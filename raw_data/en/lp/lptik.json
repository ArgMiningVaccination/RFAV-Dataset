This report highlights IRS's accomplishments in establishing and maintaining a model EEO program based on the six essential elements outlined by EEOC. The six essential elements are: Demonstrated Commitment from Agency Leadership Integration of EEO into the Agency's Strategic Plan Management and Program Accountability Proactive Prevention of Unlawful Discrimination Efficiency Responsiveness and Legal Compliance The IRS has a long-standing commitment to provide an environment free of discrimination and harassment. IRS strives to be a leader in EEO and to provide every individual with equal opportunity in employment programs and occupational activities across the Service. IRS celebrates its diverse workforce and the community it serves and is committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. Equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility are critical to the agency's success. Part E.1 - Executive Summary: Mission/Vision Overview of the Internal Revenue Service The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for administering tax laws to include tax return processing, taxpayer service, and enforcement. The IRS's mission is to deliver high quality taxpayer service and fair enforcement of the tax laws. IRS's long -term vision is to expand its effort to provide services in multiple languages and to help people from diverse and underserved communities meet their tax obligations; to integrate equity, diversity and inclusion into its' policies, procedures and practices; and to ensure the IRS is an equitable and inclusive environment for all employees. The IRS strategic plan aligns the four IRS Strategic goals to the IRS mission and identifies objectives and strategies to meet the goals: Service - Provide quality and accessible services to enhance the taxpayer experience, Enforcement - Enforce the tax law fairly and efficiently to increase voluntary compliance and narrow the tax gap, People - Foster an inclusive, diverse and well-equipped workforce and strengthen relationships with our external partners and, Transformation - Transform IRS operations to become more resilient, agile and responsive to improve the taxpayer experience and narrow the tax gap. 8 The IRS is divided into two primary organizations: the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement (DCSE) and the Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support (DCOS), both of whom report to the IRS Commissioner. The DCSE provides Executive Leadership for tax law administration and enforcement and oversees the four taxpayer-focused IRS operating divisions, including Wage & Investment, Large Business & International, Small Business/Self-Employed and Tax Exempt and Government Entities. DCSE also oversees the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, Enterprise Digitalization and Case Management Office, Office of Professional Responsibility, Online Services, the Return Preparer Office and IRS Whistleblower Office. The DCOS provides Executive Leadership for the major operational and administrative functions of the IRS in support of its business units that provide taxpayer service and enforcement. The functions under the DCOS include Information Technology; The Chief Financial Office; Facilities Management and Security Services; Human Capital Office; Privacy, Government Liaison Disclosure; Office of the Chief Risk Office; Procurement; and Research Applied Analytics and Statistics. Administering the tax law and collecting more than $4.1 trillion in tax revenue each year, t he IRS employs approximately 82,000 employees across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam and interacts with millions of taxpayers (more than nearly any other public or private organization). Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) The IRS Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is responsible for implementing and overseeing affirmative action and EEO programs. Oversight includes ensuring compliance with statutory requirements of federal legislation, and executive orders, ensuring the civil rights of taxpayers and employees are respected and enforced, all employees have access to opportunities in the workplace, and adherence to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) principles. The Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) who reports directly to the IRS Commissioner has oversight responsibilities for the agency's EEO and Diversity and Inclusion programs. The CDO with an assigned Deputy Chief Diversity Officer (DCDO) provides leadership, guidance and administration of the Agency's Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Program and serves as advisor to the Commissioner and the IRS Senior Executive Team (SET) on the IRS EEO program and other diversity and inclusion matters. The EDI Headquarters organizational structure consists of four divisions, and a Chief of Staff's office: Diversity and Inclusion - Diversity & Inclusion Education & Advisory Services, Diversity Strategy, Special Emphasis Programs, and Data Analytics EEO Operations - Affirmative Employment Program, I nformal Complaints Processing, and Alternative Dispute Resolution Disability Services Division - Reasonable Accommodation Services and Sign Language Interpreting Civil Rights and Anti-Harassment - External Civil Rights, Anti-Harassment, EEO Formal Complaint Support and Compliance 9 Chief of Staff - Policy, Oversight, Budget, and Strategic Planning EDI works collectively to support IRS Strategic Goals, enterprise-wide initiatives, and to deliver program priorities. The EDI community consists of Business Based EDI Offices (Criminal Investigation (CI), Large Business & International (LB&I), Taxpayer Advocate Services (TAS), Tax-Exempt and Government Entities (TE/GE), and Wage and Investment (W/I)), and Headquarters EDI employees. 10 Part E.2 - Executive Summary: Essential Element A - F No longer required per Department of Treasury Guidance. Part E.3 - Executive Summary: Workforce Analyses Each year, the IRS completes a multi-year trend analysis of its permanent and temporary employee workforce including all IRS organizations, with the exception of the IRS Chief Counsel's office. The data is sourced from the Department of Treasury's Data Insight database and MD-715 Tables. In FY22, the IRS total workforce increased, making it the largest workforce in five years. As of September 30, 2022, IRS's total workforce (permanent and tempo rary) consist ed of 82,907 employees. When comparing the number of employees in FY18 to FY22, the data depicted a net gain of 8.0%, resulting in a total gain of 6,147 employees over a five-year period. The analyses and findings in the Workforce Analyses section focused on workforce trends in the following areas: IRS total workforce, race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, and major occupations. Data analyses was conducted utilizing the National Civilian Labor Force (NCLF), the Occupational Civilian Labor Force (OCLF), and Relevant Civilian Labor Force (RCLF) statistics, which mostly aligns with the types of positions in the IRS workforce. T here's detailed information in an \"at -a-glance\" view for the mission critical occupations in the major occupations section of the Appendix. Employees classified with racial and ethnic backgrounds other than White comprised 54.34%of the workforce in FY22, proving that the IRS is a culturally diverse workforce. The average IRS General Schedule (GS) grade was GS-9.1. Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI), and Two or More Races (TMR) employees had an average GS grade (ranging from GS-8.1 to GS\u00ad 8.9), less than the IRS average grade. The average grade for males was GS-10.0, which was above the average grade for all IRS employees. However, the average grade for females was GS-8.7, which was less than the average grade for all IRS employees. In the Senior Executive Service (SES), Black, Hispanic, Asian, NHPI, and TMR employees had low participation rates compared to their workforce participation rates. In addition, Black, Hispanic, AIAN, and TMR employees had low participation rates in GS-13 to GS-15 occupations compared to their workforce participation rates. Males had low participation rates in grades GS-1 to GS-8, while females had low participation rates in grades GS-9 to SES levels. The overall age of IRS e mployees spanned from 17 to 99 years with an average age of 48.1 years, and 72.9% of the workforce was 40 years and older. A steep decline in participation rates within the age groups is evident as employees moved closer to common retirement ages. Employees who identified as Black, Hispanic, NHPI, TMR, and female were younger than the IRS a verage age. At the same time, the average years of Federal service were 14.0 years, and the average years of IRS service were 13.5 years. In FY22, there were 15,427 hires which is a 48.2% increase from FY21 (10,408 hires), and 11 there were 11,505 separations which is a 17.1% increase over FY21 (9,828) separations. Resignations have been higher than retirements in the last two years. Compared to FY20, resignations increased 17.84 percentage points. The participation rate of persons with disabilities (PWDs) steadily increased, from 12.1% in FY18 to 13.6% in FY22. In comparison, the participation rate for persons with targeted disabilities (PWTDs) has decreased slightly from 3.7% in FY18 to 3.3% in FY22. Despite meeting the overall targets, PWDs and PWTDs are not distributed equally across the grade structure as they are more likely to be lower-graded employees. In FY22, nearly 14% of GS 15% as compared to 12.3% of GS 13- 15 employees. This pattern of low participation of PWDs as one looks up the grade structure has been evident (and similar in magnitude) over the past six fiscal years. While not as steep, the pattern of decreased participation is also evident for PWTDs. In FY22, 3.7% of GS 1-8 9-12 employees and 2.6% of GS 13-15 employees. Details of this analysis can be found in the Appendix of the report. In FY 2022, Treasury migrated from Monster Analytics to USA Staffing for managing Treasury- wide and bure au-level Applicant Flow data. A review of the applicant flow data identified some concerns regarding the accuracy of the data and a decision was made based on the following observations to not include this data in this year's report: Identified significant difference between Monster Analytics and USA S taffing impacting Treasury's ability to collect and track Applicant Flow data. Monster Analytics provided applicant flow data regardless of whether or not a certificate was audited; on the contrary, USA S taffing will only show applicant flow data if the hiring process is closed and the certificates are marked as \"audited.\" While auditing certificates is a required step in the hiring process, IRS di scovered that audits may not have been completed for all hires in FY 2022. In addition, in previous years, using MD-715 tables built into the Monster Analytics portal, Treasury was able to efficiently and effectively pull accurate Applicant Flow data in a format that mirrored EEOC's Applicant Flow data tables. Based on conversations with Treasury, the USA Staffing team at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Treasury's Enterprise Business Solutions (EBS), USA S taffing does not have the capability to produce data in an efficient and effective format, as required for data review and analysis. Therefore, IRS MD-715 Preparers are required to manually filter and reformat hundreds of thousands of raw application data, which increases the risk for error in data reporting. Treasury's Office of Civil Right an d Equal Employment Opportunit y (OCRE) i s working with Treasury's Enterprise Data Management (EDM) team to develop a process for more efficient and accurate data transfer between USA Staffing and Treasury systems. Treasury is hopeful that the process will be in place prior to the end of FY 2023. Based on the challenges identified, and given IRS' s commitment to provide accurate and reliable data, IRS made the decision to exclude Applicant Flow data from the FY 2022 submission. IRS i s hopeful that the efforts that are being made by Treasur y will result in resolution of the data concer ns that were identified as a result of the migration an d the ability 12 to provide accurate Applicant flow data for the FY 2023 report. Part E.4 - Executive Summary: Accomplishments Element A - Demonstrated commitment from agency leadership - This element requires agency heads to translate equal employment opportunity into everyday practice and make those principles a fundamental part of the agency's culture. In FY22, the IRS Commissioner presented the IRS Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022- 2026. For the first-time ever, the agency's Strategic Plan is now available in Spanish. As demonstrated in the plan, the IRS Commissioner is fully committed to developing and supporting employees by providing resources, tools and training to help meet the needs of today and tomorrow. In FY22, the IRS also issued its updated EEO Policy statement, and re-issued its EEO Performance Elements Guidance Memo for Leaders to reiterate how managers can be evaluated on their efforts to create a work environment that ensures equal employment opportunity and values diversity and inclusion. Additional EEO policies and procedures were disseminated via email, the agency's websites, IRS bulletin boards, and in offices across the Service. Included as part of that distribution, is the April 2022 updated \"Where to Go for EDI Services,\" employee handout which provides contact information for EEO services. In addition, revisions were made to the Informal Pre-Complaint/ADR Customer Satisfaction Survey to improve the Pre-Complaint (PC) process and the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program. The IRS is committed to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the workplace and is becoming a leading organization in this space by embedding EDIA throughout every aspect of the organization to truly make it Everyone's Busines s. The Office of EDI adheres to the following definitions provided in the Government-Wide Strategic Plan to Advance DEIA in the Federal Workforce: Diversity The practice of including the many communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures and beliefs of the American people, including underserved communities. Equity The consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities thathave been denied such treatment. Inclusion The recognition, appreciation and use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds. Accessibility The design, construction, development, and maintenance of facilities, information and communication technology, programs, and services so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and independently usethem. Accessibility includes: the provision of accommodations and modifications to ensure equal access to employment and participation in activities for people with disabilities, the reduction or elimination of physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, a commitment to ensuringthat people with disabilities can independently access every outward-facing and internal activity or electronic space, and the pursuit of best practices,such as universal design. 13 Internally, IRS uses the acronym EDIA for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility to align with the office's current name of EDI. Embracing EDIA enables the Service to achieve its mission and to positively shape its cultural foundation as a great place to work. Commitment to EEO principles and practices aids in the Service's ability to achieve its mission to help America's taxpayers meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all. All IRS employees and applicants will be afforded equal protection under the law. We are committed to compliance with all applicable Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws, rules, regulations, executive orders and directives. The IRS Agency Leadership serves as key partners in advancing the principles of EDIA across the Service. Some examples are: EDI designed and developed a 3-year centralized role-based EDI learning strategy, aligned to the Agencywide EDI Strategy and Roadmap and IRS University that focuses on increasing the skillsets of leaders and employees to become more inclusive and to support diverse and underserved taxpayers. Developed an Agencywide EDIA Governance Model. The governance model includes two main groups: Executive Level and Working Group Level. The Executive Level provides strategy and oversight, while the Working Group Level serves as the operational and tactical arms. Both have varying roles and responsibilities within the model to implement, enhance and drive equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility across the Agency. Collaborated with the Human Capital Office (HCO) to advance the IRS Hiring Strategy and Strategic Recruitment Plan for FY22 by examining best practices, and coordinating bureau-wide virtual job fairs promoting agency job openings to Historically Black Colleges (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) students, alumni, and the public. Element B - Integration of EEO into the agency's strategic mission - In support of the mission, this element requires the agency maintain a reporting structure that provides the agency's EEO Director with regular access to the agency head and other senior management officials for reporting on the effectiveness, efficiency and legal compliance of the agency's Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs. In FY22, the Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) was realigned from the Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support to become a direct report to the Agency head, the IRS Commissioner. The realignment is in compliance with the Elijah E Cummings Federal Employee Anti- Discrimination Act. The move reflects the importance of equity, diversity and inclusion to the IRS and solidifies the agency's commitment and dedication to creating a workplace where Agency policies, procedures, and practices are fair and equitable, and diversity is embraced. The CDO advises senior management officials, including during Senior Executive (SET) and Human Capital Advisory Council (HCAC) meetings on EEO and diversity and inclusion principles. In FY22, the CDO presented the State of the Agency briefing to the IRS Commissioner and Agency Senior Leadership to highlight IRS accomplishments, and to demonstrate the agency's commitment to identifying and continuing to eliminate EEO program deficiencies. The realignment further enhances the agency's ability to accomplish its mission, provides greater opportunities to strengthen collaboration across the Service, and demonstrates the IRS commitment to being a model employer and Best Place to Work. The Agency-wide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap with EDI is Everyone's Business as the 14 guiding theme has been communicated across the Service and was implemented in FY22 to ensure IRS leaders and employees understand the critical roles they all play in equity, diversity, and inclusion at the Agency. As part of the Phase I EDIA Strategy and Roadmap, EDI engaged with multiple stakeholders to identify persona groups for developing IRS EDIA Learning Journeys to create three pilot EDIA Learning Journeys in FY'22 for taxpayer-facing employees, non- taxpayer facing employees and Senior Executive Leaders. Outcomes/recommendations from the Pilots included (but are not limited to) the following: o Continual need for EDIA training and development agencywide. o To formulate EDIA training, it's essential to develop specific role -based (or persona) experiences throughout the Service. o Essential to work collaboratively across the agency with stakeholders who can provide expertise and assistance with the expansion of role-based training/development curriculum, technology, dynamic and blended training approaches to delivery, and more to ensure EDIA learning is meeting the organization's needs efficiently and effectively. Benefits of EDIA Le arning Journeys to the Service o All IRS E mployees will have equal opportunity and exposure to EDIA learning and development, which ultimately contributes to improving the culture and operations of the agency by defining EDIA an d level-setting DIA as the services' foundational principles/concepts. o Integrates EDIA expectations into the performance standards across the organization o Exposure and training of senior leaders to the principles and concepts of EDIA to assist with eliminating/minimizing bias and enhancing EDIA competencies that improve leadership behaviors and decisions. o Contributes to educating, making aware, and improving the understanding/value/benefit of psychological safety at all levels of the organization. The CDO continued hosting \"CDO Connections\" and \"Let's Break to Educate\" forums in collaboration with BBDs to share information with the entire EDI Community on topics essential to equity, diversity & inclusion. Employee organizations and employee resource groups (EO/ERGs) work as partners with EDI to provide strong advocacy, guidance , and feedback on IRS' achievement of EEO, diversity and inclusion goals. EO/ERG leaders meet bi-monthly with EDI staff to help formulate and guide the IRS's strategic commitment to a culture of equal opportunity, inclusion, and diversity. Other Training Provided by EDI: Created and delivered an inclusive leadership session for managers to help leaders support and manage the COVID19 return to office (RTO) transition for employees. Conducted over 630 diversity & inclusion engagements (including EEO, AH, and RA education) to over 38,500 employees. Some of the topics included: psychological 15 safety, negotiating, managing conflict, civility in the workplace, generations, and the EEO/RA process. Conducted 17 sessions to 542 managers as part of the Fundamental Managers Skills course, a six-hour lesson on EDI fundamentals such as diversity, EEO, reasonable accommodations, and anti-harassment. Also conducted diversity & inclusion training as part of the curriculum for the Career Development Candidate (CDP) program. Developed three Self-Help Online Tutorials (SHOTs); the Benefits of ADR Mediation, an Overview of the EEO Complaint Process, and the EEO Counselor's Role , all to increase the education and outreach efforts of EEO Operations program, products, and services. Partnered with General Legal Services (GLS) offices to develop and deliver Reasonable Accommodation (RA) training for managers, including providing information on proper management responses to commonly encountered challenges highlighted in decisions where the Service failed to accommodate individual employees. Trained IRS Reasonable Accommodations Coordinators (RAC) in Sign Language Interpreting (SLI) and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) Services; briefed and provided analysis of Reasonable Accommodation Case Finding Decisions. IRS Reasonable Accommodation Training Cadre presented 46 training sessions (totaling over 61 hours) on varying topics to a total of 3,221 participants, including 2,338 managers. Element C - Management and program accountability - This element requires the agency to evaluate managers and supervisors on efforts to ensure equality of opportunity for all employees and to maintain clearly defined, well-communicated, consistently applied and fairly implemented personnel policies, selection and promotion procedures, evaluation procedures, rules of conduct and training systems. Program accomplishments in this area include the following: Published a Leader's Alert article to remind IRS leaders of their obligation to take immediate action to address any allegations of harassment (sexual and non-sexual) and bullying to protect employees and the IRS. The IRS 's Anti -Harassment & Anti- Bullying Policy details the requirements imposed by Executive Order 14035 by mandating that management immediately conduct a thorough inquiry of all allegations of harassment or bullying within 30 calendar days of notification of the allegation. Presented IRS's FY21 EDI Business Based Program Evaluation findings and recommendations to IRS Leadership. Business Based Divisions (BBD) are developing plans of action to address any noted deficiencies.

If an essential element was not fully compliant with the standards of EEO MD-715, a further evaluation was conducted and, as appropriate, EEO Plans for A ttaining the Essential Elements of a Model EEO Program, are included with this Federal Agency Annual EEO ProgramStatus Report. The agency has also analyzed its work force profiles and conducted barrier analyses aimed at detecting whether any management or personnel policy, procedure or practice is operating to disadvantage any group basedon race, national origin, gender or disability. EEO Plans to Eliminate Identified Barriers, as appropriate, are included with this Federal Agency Annual EEO Program Status Report. I certify that proper documentation of this assessment is in place and is being maintained for EEOC review upon request. Sign ature of Princi pa l EEO Directo r/ Official Certifies that this Federal Agency Annual EEO Program Status Report is in compliance with EEO MD-715. Date Signature of Agency Head or Agency Head Designee Date 22 MD-715 - PART G Agency Self-Assessment Checklist The Part G Self-Assessment Checklist is a series of questions designed to provide federal agencies with an effective means for conducting the annual self-assessment required in Part F of MD-715. This self- assessment permits EEO Directors to recognize, and to highlight for their senior staff, deficiencies in their EEO program that the agency must address to comply with MD-715's requirements. Nothing in Part G prevents agencies from establishing additional practices that exceed the requirements set forth in this checklist. All agencies will be required to submit Part G to EEOC. Although agencies need not submit documentation to support their Part G responses, they must maintain such documentation on file and make it available to EEOC upon request. The Part G checklist is organized to track the MD-715 essential elements. As a result, a single substantive matter may appear in several different sections, but in different contexts. For example, questions about establishing an anti-harassment policy fall within Element C (Management and Program Accountability), while questions about providing training under the anti-harassment policy are found in Element A (Demonstrated Commitment from Agency Leadership). For each MD-715 essential element, the Part G checklist provides a series of \"compliance indicators.\" Each compliance indicator, i n turn, contains a series of \"yes/no\" questions, called \"measures.\" To the right of the measures, there are two columns, one for the agency to answer the measure with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"NA;\" and the second column for the agency to provide \"comments\", if necessary. Agencies should briefly explain any \"N/A\" answer in the comments. For example, many of the sub-component agencies are not responsible for issuing final agency decisions (FADs) in the EEO complaint process, so it may answer questions about FAD timeliness with \"NA\" and explain in the comments column that the parent agency drafts all FADs. A \"No\" response to any measure in Part G is a program deficiency. For each such \"No\" response, an agency will be required in Part H to identify a plan for correcting the identified deficiency. If one or more sub-components answer \"No\" to a particular question, the agency -wide/parent agency's report should also include that \"No\" response. 23 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT MD-715 - PART G - Agency Self-Assessment Checklist Compliance Indicator Measures A.1 - The agency issues an effective, up-to-date EEO policy statement.

(DID) B.4.a.3 - to timely thoroughly, and fairly process EEO complaints, including EEO counseling, investigations, final agency decisions, and legal sufficiency reviews? (EEO and CRAH) B.4.a.8 - to effectively administer its special emphasis programs (such as, Federal Women's Program, Hispanic Employment Program, and People IRS' Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion's (EDI) mission is to drive innovative outcomes and better business results by leveraging the diversity of our employees and cultivating an inclusive and fair workplace. To accomplish its mission, the Office of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion serves as the principal advisor to the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and other senior leadership of the Internal Revenue Service on matters relating to equal employment opportunity, taxpayer non-discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. The Headquarters office is led by the Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) who reports to the IRS Commissioner. The Headquarters EDI Division consists of five divisions led by senior managers who provide oversight of the following EDI programs: Civil Rights and Anti-harassment (CRAH) Diversity and Inclusion (DID) Disability Services Division (DSD) Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Chief of Staff (COS) Over the last two years, the headquarters Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) has experienced an increase in program caseload while facing increasing attrition, directly impacting the ability for EDI to successfully implement the full scope of EDIA program responsibilities. EDI will require additional staffing above levels to continue to meet the demands of a growing IRS and customer base. Following are examples of some program responsibilities that have been directly impacted: - Conducting complete barrier analys es - Special Emphasis Programs 53 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT Type of Program Deficiency with Disabilities Program Manager? (DID) B.4.a.9 - to effectively manage its anti- harassment program? (CRAH) B.4.a.10 - to effectively manage its reasonable accommodation program? (DSD) Brief Description of Program Deficiency - Processing informal EEO complaints - External civil rights program - Compliance reviews - Affirmative Employment Program The staffing shortages have resulted in lengthy processing of reasonable accommodation requests, inability to conduct and complete barrier analysis, and challenges in managing increased workloads. Chief of Staff (COS) - COS is responsible for administrative functions of the Office of EDI, such as operational reviews, lapse and contingency planning; communications strategy, and business system planning support. The division is also responsible for internal employee programs such as training, performance an d awards; EDI's budget; managing human capital services including hiring, staffing, and onboarding. COS currently has three vacancies which directly impact hiring, training, and business system planning programs. Increases in overall agency staffing levels requires additional COS personnel to meet IRS demands. Disability Services Division (DSD) has had 5 Reasonable Accommodation Coordinators ( RAC ) vacancies have contributed to the untimely processing of RA cases. Open case age has gone from 45 days in January to 114 days in October. In addition, DSD is carrying 2 Sign Language Interpreter (SLI), 3 Authorized Government Representative (AGR), and 1 EEO Assistant vacancies. This staff shortage has increased the Agency's reliance on contractors. The RAC shortage has resulted in delayed case processing at every stage of the process: intake, case assignment, contacting customer for initial interview, interactive discussion, management decision on RA, and RA fulfillment. The processing delays resulted in the current NTEU national grievance. It is also likely that processing delays have resulted in EEO complaint filings but the EEO division would have those numbers. The SLI shortage has resulted in approximately 5 unfilled jobs each month in FY22 even after the Agency reached into contractors and other known IRS SLI that exist outside of EDI SLI cadre. The SLI staff shortage decreases the Agency's agility to respond to last minute requests for service from Deaf employees. The Agency's inability to provide SLI services does not comply with the Executive Order on DEIA, the Rehabilitation Act, and ADAAA and puts the agency at risk for OIG or Treasury audits, EEO complaints, and NTEU grievances. EEO Operations Division (EEO) mission critical occupations are EEO Specialists who serve as EEO Counselors. The Division's approved authorized staffing for EEO Counselors is 20 where counselors on rolls have steadily decreased over the last two and one half years while 54 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT Type of Program Deficiency Brief Description of Program Deficiency workload has increased. Within the next 3-5 years, more than 50% of the counselors will be eligible to retire resulting in a significant risk to the timely processing of the agency's informal EEO complaints. Diversity & Inclusion Division (DID) has two of the three Special Emphasis Program Manager positions vacant. This has impacted completing the full scope of SEPM's duties for all required programs. In addition, it has impacted ability to conduct barrier analysis ' of the workforce. Other staff members and management have stepped in to assist as necessary, however, that hinders their other work assignments. In addition, there are two vacancies in the Analytics section which also impacts barrier analysis projects since the employees assist with data gathering and identification of triggers. Civil Rights & Anti-Harassment Division (CRAH) - CRAH has several critical vacancies that need to be filled including: three Program Leads, one Senior EO Civil Rights Specialist, staff assistant, Front-line manager position and several Anti-harassment specialists positions. The significant staffing shortages directly impacts the Service's ability to successfully and timely implement several critical aspects of the Civil Rights, An ti-Harassment and Formal Complaint programs.

Yes 06/30/2023 70 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT F Report of Accomplishments Fiscal Year Accomplishments 2022 On June 11, 2021, the Service published updated reasonable accommodation procedures which in part, changed the processing timeframe from 15 to 20 workdays. This change brought the IRS's timeframe in line with that of the Department of the Treasury and is less likely to create unrealistic expectations in light of the complex nature of many reasonable accommodation requests. In 2021, the IRS concluded a Lean Six Sigma (LSS) assessment of its reasonable accommodation process that began in February of 2020. Following data gathering, including eliciting input from all Business Units, the LSS team identified several process modifications which were socialized with all Business Units and implemented. The process modifications pertained to expediting accommodation request assessment and approval/denial, as well as fulfillment of accommodation needs involving adaptive technology or furniture and workspace modifications. Preliminary data suggests the modifications are yielding beneficial results as the average processing time in Fiscal Year 2020 was 89 workdays, 58 workdays in FY21 and 45 workdays FY22, Year to Date. It is, however, also important to note that the reasonable accommodation process is neither a static nor closed system. While previously the Service could be expected to address less than 1,000 requests for accommodation annually, beginning in the autumn of 2021 following the issuance of Executive Order 14043, the IRS received more than 6,700 requests for accommodation based either on medical needs or reported religious beliefs. The IRS has also made a variety of policy and program changes that have prompted a substantial number of accommodation requests, including, completing a phased return to the office for all employees. The unprecedented RA inventory levels, coupled with addressing novel issues such as those pertaining to balancing individual medical concerns with the risk of the spread of disease and balancing respect for religious beliefs with the need to carry out the Service's mission have strained resources. While the data suggest the IRS has made progress towards the goal, the Service remains committed to further exploring opportunities to expedite RA request processing. Some of those opportunities include, exploring adding staff or contract support personnel to facilitate the interactive dialogue between employees or applicants for employment with disabilities and IRS management, as well as navigating the various support functions involved with assessing and fulfilling many accommodation needs. 71 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 2021 The IRS continued a Lean Six Sigma evaluation of its RA processes. The LSS team identified and implemented quick hits with all Business Units. Preliminary data during the first quarter suggests that the quick-hits are yielding beneficial results, including a 47% decrease in cycle time. On June 11, 2021, the Service published updated reasonable accommodation procedures. Editorial changes were made for clarity and accuracy, including updating titles, website addresses, and legal and other references. The updates clarified: If an accommodation can be provided in less than the maximum amount of time permitted, then it must be provided as soon as possible. Failure to do so might result in a finding that the agency violated applicable law. The agency will not be expected to adhere to its usual timelines if an individual's health professional fails to provide needed documentation in a timely manner; moreover, the status of a pending request may be ascertained by contacting the servicing Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator. Changed the processing timeframe from 15 to 20 workdays and clarified that the processing timeframe is not tolled while a determination is made as to whether medical documentation is needed. Eliminated a provision authorizing a Deciding Official up to five days to provide written notice of a denial decision. 72 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 2020 2019 The IRS updated its reasonable accommodation procedures, making editorial changes such as adding program control information, fixing/eliminating broken hyperlinks, changing office names and contact information, etc. These changes did not alter thetimeframe for processing accommodation requests. The IRS's contract with the union representing Bargaining Unit employees prescribes a 15-day period for implementing reasonable accommodations. The IRS also generally has an obligation to bargain with the union concerning implementation of changes to processes that affect Bargaining Unit employees. The Service mustremain cognizant of its Labor obligations when modifying the timeframe(s) or making other changes to reasonable accommodation processes. The IRS is undertaking a review and analysis of its reasonable accommodation decision-making and fulfilment processes to identify opportunities for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. In February2020, the IRS began a Lean Six Sigma evaluation of its RA processes. In July 2020, the LSS team concluded the data gathering phase of the study. In order to better position the LSS team to analyze the data and formulate recommended changes to processes best calculated to increase efficiency in the fulfillment of reasonable accommodation needs, the IRS moved to include seniorsubject matter experts from the Facilities Management & Security Services as well as Information Technology functions in the LSS effort. The LSS team expects to present its findings and recommendations for changes to processes in early Fiscal Year 2021. Those recommendations will need to be vetted with partner support functions and might necessitate either contract or impact bargaining with the union before implementation. The Reasonable Accommodation Coordinators are making more effective and consistent use of applicable suspense codes in the reasonable accommodations request tracking system (ALERTS). Asa result of more accurate tracking and case handling enhancements, the IRS has experienced slight increases this fiscal year in the number of requests for accommodation resolved within 30 days of the original request. 73 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT X MD-715 - Part H Agency EEO Plan to Attain the Essential Elements of a Model EEO Program Please describe the status of each plan that the agency has implemented to correct deficiencies in the EEO program.

Beginning in 2017, the agency implemented the use of an Acknowledgement form (F15013) as part of the XR application process. The Acknowledgement form was used by the applicant's business unit (BU) or organization's executive to provide an assessment of the applicant and certify their 77 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT Description of Policy, Procedure or Practice Leadership Succession Review (LSR) rating. Since 2018, F15013 is no longer mandatory; it is up to executives to decide if they want to use the F15013 or not. The IRS used survey tools to determine the impact of this practice. As a result of inconsistency in the use of F15013, HCO recommended not using this form. In the interim, HCO modified the form to have zero bearing on an applicant's rating . As time has passed, the IRS identified where Black and Asian males are not being selected at the rate of the participation in the workforce. This Part I remains open and will focus on Black and Asian males. Objective(s) and Dates for EEO Plan Objective Date Initiated (mm/dd/yyyy) Target Date (mm/dd/yyyy) Sufficient Funding & Staffing?

An applicant flow analysis of the 2022 XR Program was completed. There were 194 applicants, 168 qualified applicants and 57 selections. This announcement was compared to the 2021 announcement which resulted in the following: A cross-functional team was created to identify potential barriers and make recommendations to increase the participation rates of Black and Asian males in the XR leadership development program. o Improvements were made in the selection rates of Black females from FY21. Black females were on par with their qualified and selection rates at 21% and were above their participation rate in the GS 14/15 feeder pool at 15%. o A trigger continued for the selection of Black males. The qualified rate of Black males (21%) exceeded their applicant rate of 19%. However, Black males selected were 11%, reflecting a decrease. Their selection rate is higher than their 14/15 pool of 9%. o Hispanic females improved in the percentage of applicants qualified, and select ed in FY22. Hispanic female applicant and qualified rates were on par at 2% and their selection rate was at 5%. Hispanic females' participation rate in the GS 14/15 feeder pool was 3%. o Hispanic males improved in the percentage of applicants, qualified, and selections made in FY22. Hispanic males were on par with their qualified and selection rates of 2%. However, these rates were just below their participation in the GS 14/15 feeder pool of 3%. o Asian females were on par with their applicant, qualified, and selection rates at 4%. However, these rates were just below their participation in the GS 14/15 feeder pool of 5%. o Asian males continued to have a trigger in selections. Asian males were on par with their applicant and qualified rates at 12%. However, Asian males selected were 9%, which is less than the qualified rate, but is an all-time high from previous years. Overall, they improved and are better represented than their 14/15 pool of 7%. 81 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 2021 2020 This Part I was reopened in FY 2021 as a result of feedback received from Treasury. Concerns were raised with closing out this Part I until the barrier is addressed (determining the factors) and the participation rates have increased. In FY21, IRS conducted an applicant flow analysis of the 2021 XR Program. There were 209 applicants, 165 qualified applicants and 52 selections. This announcement was compared to the 2018 and 2019 XR announcements which resulted in the following: o Overall, Asians have made improvements in applying, qualifying, and being selected. In FY21, the application rate for Asians was 16% compared to their participation rate of 12% in the GS 14/15 feeder pool. However, while Asian females made up 5% of the GS 14/15 feeder pool only Asian females made up 4% of applicants. In FY21, Asian males were selected at a rate of 4% which is far below their qualified rate of 11%. o Overall, the rates for Hispanics have remained somewhat consistent in applying and qualifying. The Hispanic application rate has been on par with their participation in the GS 14/15 feeder pool at 6%. In FY21, their selection rate dramatically decreased from the prior years (FY18 and FY19). However, in FY21, there were no Hispanic females selected. Hispanic males increased from none in FY18 to 2% in both FY19 and FY21. o Overall, Blacks have improved in applying, qualifying, and being selected since FY18. However, they were selected far below their qualified rate. Blacks continue to apply above their participation rates in the GS 14/15 feeder pool. In the three years reviewed, Black females and males were selected below their qualified rate; rates of selection were at their highest in FY19. However, the difference between the selected rate and the qualified rate has been reduced for Black females. Redesigned the forecasting process to better align allocated slots to meet BU succession planning needs. Redesigned application process to better align with program goals, including eliminating the Acknowledgement Form (F15013) as part of the XR application process. Changed Ranking/Rating and Selection processes to be led by the respective business unit with HCO oversight. Developed a XR Application feedback form that will provide applicants with general feedback from their application review and general feedback from the interview panel for those who do not qualify or are not selected. This feedback is intended to assist non\u00adselectees with identifying additional developmental actions that can be taken to improve for the next program announcement. Received Agency leadership approval on the following recommendations to help ensure a fair and objective XR program: 82 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT The objective of this Part I has been completed. The IRS addressed the barrier of the Acknowledgement form (F15013) for XR candidates. In addition, IRS developed and implemented actions as identified in this plan to increase participation rates of minorities. The Agency will continue to monitor the participation rates of the XR program. o Conduct a review to determine if any disciplinary actions were taken against any of the XR ranking or interview panel members o BU can invite an EDI Director or EDI representative to serve on interview panel as an observer or panel member o Chief Diversity Officer will issue memo to executives encouraging use of diverse ranking and interview panels o XR Interview panel should review \"IRS Selecting Official's Interview Guide,\" Document 13264 (Rev. 10- 2018) o XR Interview panel/Selecting Officials will be provided a training resource on Unconscious Bias o EDI will develop a Checklist for Raters and Interviewers as a reminder to complete above recommendations 2019 Analyzed data from interviews to identify pr el iminary barriers, actions that could improve the XR program, and best practices. Concerns identified included but not limited to: A survey was developed in conjunction with Research, Appli ed Analytics & Statistics (RAAS) that was to be issued to all GS 14/15 an d IR equivalent (IR 01, 03 & 04) employees in FY2019. However, this survey was not issued due to the formation of the HCO XR Assessment Project. During the first quarter of FY19, IRS imple mented a cross-functional XR Assessment project team, consisting of members from HCO, LB&I, W&I, SB/SE, CI, and EDI, to conduct a 360-degree review of the XR program. The team conducted one- on-one interviews with executives, focus group discussions with recent XR graduates, and a survey of senior and front-line managers to understand their perceptions of the XR program and of senior manager development needs, respectively. The team completed a process mapping of the XR process, defined the current problem and outlined the desired end state of the XR Program. The team also completed a process redesign and developed two options that would address senior leadership concerns: having cross-functional ranking panels or Business Operating Division (BOD) specific ranking panels. A decision was made to go with BOD-specific panels, meaning each BOD would rank their own applicants. o XR program Acknowledgement form o Many appl i cants close to retirement o Lack of mobility o Change in the tax law regarding moving expenses 83 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT The team completed a preliminary review of the data gathered from the survey and focus group participants. Trends identified with the following recommendations: The team looked at additional policies, procedures and practices related to the XR Program, and results were reported in FY2020 and a final report from the XR Assessment team was finalized by 9/30/2020. In FY 2019, IRS continued to review and analyze the applicant, qualified, and selection data from the 2019 XR announcement which revealed there were no triggers in the applicant pool, qualified pool, or selections for any groups except White Female applicants and Black Female selections. o Improve leadership succession planning and forecasting leadership needs o Improve application, ranking, and rating processes o Identify potential candidates early in their careers This is a vast improvement from the last announcement and selections in 2017 which saw triggers in Hispanic Males, Black Males, Black Females, Asian Males, and White Females. IRS will continue to monitor the impact on these groups because of any changes to the XR Process implemented as a result of the XR Assessment Project. 2018 Multi-year XR vacancy announcements reviewed to determine potential impact on XR selection process. EDI presented a two (2) year overview of XR analysis completed to the Employee Organizations/Employee Resource Groups (EO/ERG). EDI participated in the FY18 IRS Women's History Month program. Presentation focused on IRS leadership development and mentoring programs. Nearly 150 employees participated. FY18 XR program announcement was publicized on the IRS internal website. Lunch and Learn XR application preparation calls sent to EO/ERG Presidents in April for distribution. Interviews were conducted with HCO XR national program managers, embedded XR program HCO personnel and the embedded EDI Directors to share XR program best practices. Concerns raised included but not limited t o: An initial survey was conducted of all GS 14/15 and IR equivalent (IR 01, 03 & 04) applicants. o XR program Acknowledgement form o Many applicants close to retirement o Lack of mobility o Change in the tax law regarding moving expenses 84 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT In July, Research, Applied Analytics & Statistics (RAAS) reviewed the survey and incorporated their suggestions.

BAWG reviewed workforce demographic trends for the four major occupations and did not identify triggers in the Revenue Officer (RO) occupation. Collaborated with Treasury and other bureaus for a Treasury-wide Hispanic Heritage Month event. Conducted a diversity workshop at the Hispanic Internal Revenue Employees (HIRE) National Training Conference in August 2022. Conducted barrier analysis training for BAWG, 30 Jun 2022. BAWG updated section chief who is covering vacant SEPM position (as of July 2022) that leads BAWG. BAWG agreed to develop questions to ask EO/ERG members to elicit information on employees' p erceptions as to why there is low participation of Hispanic males in positions CI, IT, RA, GS- 12-15 and to receive recommendations to mitigate. FY 22 data on Hispanic males, through Q3: CI, (OCLF 5.0%) Senior executive service (SES) level participation rate of permanent Hispanic employees increased from 5.26 percent in FY21 to 5.6 in FY22 91 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT FY2021 BAWG component teams were established and assigned to review trends within the four major occupations. BAWG provided an updated briefing on the scope of the review to EDI senior leadership and received approval and support to conduct the process. During this fiscal year, the SEPM who led the BAWG resigned. Therefore, all planned activities were not completed. A new SEPM was selected at the end of the fiscal year, and will address planned activities for which dates have been modified. Completed an analysis of Hispanic participation in leadership programs for trend assessment. Additional data determined that there could be triggers associated with Hispanic female participation which will be investigated in future analyses. FY2020 An updated analysis of FY17- FY19 data was completed for the four major occupations that have a career ladder that feeds into the SES level: RA, RO, CI and IT Specialist. The participation rate of Hispanic males in RA, CI, and IT were below the occupational civilian labor force, in the grades 12-14; Hispanic males are not being selected for internal promotions in the RO occupation; and Hispanic males are not being hired in the CI and IT Specialist occupations. A charter was developed to begin the process of establishing the BAWG. The BAWG includes stakeholders from the EDI office, H CO, employee resource groups, and business operating divisions. The Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) was briefed on the triggers and analysis of RA, RO, CI, and IT Specialist for Hispanic males. The team received support to move forward to conduct the barrier analyses. FY2019 In November 2018, the CDO signed a memorandum of understanding with the president of National IMAGE, Inc. an external employee organization, to engage in a partnership to identify issues of mutual interest and promote equal access to employment and career advancement opportunities. An analysis of the 2018 data provided for the four major occupations that have a career ladder which may feed to the SES level: RA, RO, CI and IT. Triggers were identified in the participation of Hispanic males. SEPM attended monthly meetings with the National Council for Hispanic Employment Program Managers to identify hiring and retention best practices shared by other federal agencies. SEPM was on detail during a majority of this period; as such, there were minimal actions taken during this reporting period. FY2018 EDI conducted a panel discussion on 11/15/2017 for all IRS managers to address retention, career development and upward mobility for th e H ispanic workforce. SEPM identified HCO points of contact to partner on recruitment efforts. SEPM met with the Hispanic Internal Revenue E mployees (HIRE) president and vice- president on 03/07/2018 to share the results from the BAWG. 92 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT SEPM hosted a focus group meeting during the HIRE business meeting in August 2018 to gather information on possible barriers for upward mobility (GS-12 and above). As a result, the SEPM will partner with the HIRE mentoring program that will roll out in FY19. The SEPM will share job announcements with HIRE for dissemination. In April 2018, the EDI executive director participated in the interview panel for CDP. EDI issued a memorandum to the Information Technology Operating Division to encourage diversity in their hiring surge of IT professionals. To assist with recruitment efforts, the acting associate director (AAD) of the diversity and inclusion division (DID) and the SEPM: o Participated in the National IMAGE, Inc. conference o Conducted five workshops o Met with the executive board of National IMAGE, Inc. to discuss a possible MOU between the IRS and National IMAGE , Inc. o The AAD of DID participated in the SES roundtable and speed mentoring event at the Department of Labor where she provided career advice and shared why IRS is an employer of choice. FY2017 EDI reviewed workforce participation data on Hispanic males by major occupation: RA (Series GS-512); RO (Series GS-1169); CI (Series GS-1811); and IT Specialist (Series GS-2210). Conducted an applicant flow analysis on these four major occupations for FY14 - FY16 to determine if Hispanic males were promoted at a higher or lower rate than their participation rate for external applicants as well as internal/competitive promotions. 93 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT MD-715 - Part J Special Program Plan for the Recruitment, Hiring, Advancement, and Retention of Persons with Disabilities To capture agencies' affirmative action plan for persons with disabilities (PWD) and persons with targeted disabilities (PWTD), EEOC regulations (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.203(e)) and MD-715 require agencies to describe how their plan will improve the recruitment, hiring, advancement, and retention of applicants and employees with disabilities.

During FY 2022, the IRS continued to share hiring summaries on a biweekly basis with the Veteran Employment and Schedule A coordinators within each business unit for dissemination throughout the IRS. Additionally, the numerical goals were briefed to senior leadership and front- line managers during annual commitment meetings. Some of the following activities demonstrate our efforts to further improve the recruitment, hiring, advancement, and retention of applicants and employees with disabilities: Managers received mandatory Veteran Employment and Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) training to raise awareness of the special hiring authorities used to attract disabled veterans, including 30% or more disabled; Managers are also required to take annual training delivered by the internal Integrated Talent Management (ITM) training modules, which include a large range of topics that cover a broad scope of disability protocol, non\u00adcompetitive hiring authority regulations and the processing of reasonable accommodation requests; Internal training on the Schedule A hiring authority was provided by the IRS Policy and Execution office in July of 2022; A staff of 15 employees were added to a new Special Emphasis Program Branch in the Strategic Talent Analytics and Recruitment Solutions (STARS) Department to focus on Persons with Disabilities (PWD) and Persons with Targeted Disabilities (PWTD) recruitment and staffing; The IRS' Veterans Outreach Program held planned activities to educate and serve the veteran workforce (including disabled veterans) on recruitment, hiring and retention. Lastly, the IRS conducted an employee resurvey campaign encouraging employees to voluntarily update their disability status information. The campaign ran from July 2022 through September 2022. At the beginning of the campaign (as of pay period 13 - FY 2022), the IRS had 80,328 permanent employees on the rolls of which 13.65% were PWD and 3.4% were PWTD. At the conclusion of the campaign (as of pay period 18 - FY 2022), the IRS had 81,982 permanent employees with 11.22% PWD and 3.35% PWTD. The overall total number of permanent employees increased by 1,654 but lowered the PWD percentage by 2.43%. The PWTD percentage also was reduced by .05% at the conclusion of the campaign. The Department is fully committed to supporting programs for the hiring, placement and advancement of people with disabilities and will continue to resurvey the workforce on a bi-annual basis to gather the critical information needed to assist in these efforts. Section II: Model Disability Program Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a71614.203(d)(1), agencies must ensure sufficient staff, training and resources to recruit and hire persons with disabilities and persons with targeted disabilities, administer the reasonable accommodation program and special emphasis program, and oversee any other disability hiring and advancement program the agency has in place.

If \"no\", describe the agency's plan to ensure all aspects of the disability program have sufficient funding and other resources . Yes No X See MD-715, Part H. B.4 Section I II: Plan to Recruit and Hire Individuals with Disabilities Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), agencies must establish a plan to increase the recruitment and hiring of individuals with disabilities. The questions below are designed to identify outcomes of the agency's recruitment program plan for PWD and PWTD . 97 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT A. Plan to Identify Job Applicants with Disabilities 1. Describe the programs and resources the agency uses to identify job applicants with disabilities, including individuals with targeted disabilities. The IRS continues to promote the improvement of recruitment, hiring, retention and advancement of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce. For example, the IRS Strategic Talent Analytics & Recruitment Solutions (STARS) utilizes the Schedule A noncompetitive hiring authority announcement specifically targeting PWD and PTWD as well as the disability special hiring path when advertising positions on USAJOBS. Other resources include membership in nation-wide employee organizations such as Deaf in Government (DIG), the IRS Employee Resource Group - Deaf Empowerment Advocacy Forum (DEAF), and workshop presentations at career fairs. 2. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.203(a)(3), describe the agency's use of hiring authorities that take disability into account (e.g., Schedule A) to recruit PWD and PWTD for positions in the permanent workforce. The Service uses multiple non-competitive hiring authorities to appoint persons with disabilities to career conditional positions. The broadest authority, Schedule A, is open to all potential candidates who meet eligibility requirements. Eligible veterans are also identified using authorities addressing military service-connected disabilities such as the 30% or More Disabled Veteran and the Veteran Recruitment Appointment authorities. 3. When individuals apply for a position under a hiring authority that takes disability into account (e.g., Schedule A), explain how the agency (1) determines if the individual is eligible for appointment under such authority and (2) forwards the individual's application to the relevant hiring officials with an explanation of how and when the individual may be appointed. The IRS routes the individuals' applications to the Employment Operations office where a specially trained HR specialist processes the applications (resumes). The HR specialists pre-qualifies applicants and refers them directly to the hiring officials. Applicants must provide a signed Schedule A letter and hiring managers are provided a certificate including qualified applicants eligible for selection. Based upon the results of the interviews, hiring managers select the most qualified candidate from the certificate. If/when management elects to fill a vacancy using non-competitive procedures, they are provided with qualified applicants from the repository. Proof of the disability is required for appointments of persons with disabilities, including intellectual, psychiatric and severe physical disabilities. Schedule A Certification must contain: an official organizational letterhead, a reference to 5 CFR 213 3129(u), and a physical signature of the signee (Computer generated signature signatures are not accept ed). Managers may request resumes from persons with disabilities from the IRS Schedule A resume repository, or from a focused recruitment effort. HR qualifies promising resumes submitted for review via a hiring request through USA Staffing and forwards qualified applicants resumes to the hiring manager for review and potential selection. 4. Has the agency provided training to all hiring managers on the use of hiring authorities that take disability into account (e.g., Schedule A)? If \"yes\", describe the type(s) of training and frequency. If \"no\", describe the agency's plan to provid e this training. Yes X No 0 N/A 0 98 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT The IRS published an internal article in March of FY22 entitled \"Shar ed Services, EDI help with recruiting and hiring\" in an effort to remind employees while recruiting for the most qualified applicants for vacant positions within their respective functions to consider diversity in all aspects of the process. Training is held on an ad hoc basis at the request of hiring managers and is included in the Strategic Talent Analytics & Recruitment Solutions (STARS) noncompetitive hiring options briefing. Hiring managers and analysts complete annual training in hiring veterans which includes specific information on the non-competitive authorities available, and the processes to hire disabled veterans. Hiring managers also receive additional information about hiring persons with disabilities in the manager curriculum. Information on Schedule A and Veteran Hiring Authorities are presented to new and existing members of the campus Submission Processing Recruitment Teams and IRS executives. Presentations emphasize the benefits of hiring persons with disabilities and veterans, while encouraging them to use Schedule A and Veteran hiring paths when announcing positions on USAJobs for competitive announcements or USA Staffing for non-competitive recruiting. Schedule A employment coordinators are provided training and encouraged to collaborate with hiring managers on leveraging the Schedule A hiring authority for agency wide usage. This training covers legal use of the hiring authority, required documentation, how candidates are referred, and onboarding of these candidates. B. Plan to Establish Contacts with Disability Employment Organizations Describe the agency's efforts to establish and maintain contacts with organizations that assist PWD, including PWTD, in securing and maintaining employment. IRS collaborates with the Department of Veteran Affairs in targeting disabled veterans and with Department of Defense in providing internships for wounded service members transitioning from active duty. The IRS also works closely with the leadership of the Council of State Administrators for Vocational Rehabilitation, and by extension, with the counselors who support local partners in states where IRS offices are located. Additional contacts include the National Industries for the Blind and SourceAmerica for the purpose of promoting employment opportunities. The IRS points of contact encompass all 50 states including Washington, DC, the territories and over 696 rehabilitation services and agencies. In FY 2022, the USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal was used to recruit individuals with disabilities for jobs, resulting in 51 known applicants. Internally, the Local Accessibility Coordinator (LAC) program continues to serve as a vital resource to assist employees with disabilities in maintaining employment. Supporting IRS offices, such as the Information Resources Accessibility Program, Alternative Media Center, Information Technology, Learning & Education and W&I Integrated Talent Management work in partnership to provide field support to the LACs to ensure employees with disabilities receive or have the same access to services, programs, technology, electronic information, facilities, and are included in activities and developmental opportunities as provided to those without disabilities. In March of FY 2022, the IRS was involved with \"A Seat at the Table Fair: DisABILITY, Multicultural and Military\" at Georgia State University Career Fair. This discussion focused on efforts to support students with Disabilities, multicultural background, and military students. The IRS partners with Circa, DisabilityJobs.com, to post all vacancy announcements and engages organizations using the Circa platform (more than 27,00 diversity organizations). Additionally, the IRS hosts virtual information sessions with organizations to assist potential candidates on barriers they may encounter with entering the federal workforce. 99 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT The IRS recruitment strategy involves identifying best practices and looking for partnering opportunities within the IRS divisions during the recruitment process for both internal and external hires.

Section IV: Plan to Ensure Advancement Opportunities for Employees with Disabilities Pursuant to 29 C.F.R \u00a71614.203(d)(1)(iii), agencies are required to provide sufficient advancement opportunities for employees with disabilities. Such activities might include specialized training and mentoring programs, career development opportunities, awards programs, promotions, and similar programs that address advancement. In this section, agencies should identify, and provide data on programs designed to ensure advancement opportunities for employees with disabilities. A. Advancement Program Plan Describe the agency's plan to ensure PWD, including PWTD, have sufficient opportunities for advancement. The IRS considers PWD/PWTD for advancement opportunities in various career developmental opportunities such as non-competitive details, promotions and internal merit promotions available to all employees agency wide. By proactively identifying barriers that could prohibit advancement of persons with disabilities, the IRS ensures sufficient opportunities for advancement exist. The Service adheres to established policies for advertising advancement opportunities as widely as possible and provides assistance to all employees in identifying and using tools and resources that will assist them in preparing for advancement opportunities in a fair and consistent manner. B. Career Development Opportunities 1. Please describe the career development opportunities that the agency provides to its employees.

Section V: Plan to Improve Retention of Persons with Disabilities To be a model employer for persons with disabilities, agencies must have policies and programs in place to retain employees with disabilities. In this section, agencies should: (1) analyze workforce separation data to identify barriers retaining employees with disabilities; (2) describe efforts to ensure accessibility of technology and facilities; and (3) provide information on the reasonable accommodation program and workplace personal assistance services. A. Voluntary and Involuntary Separations 1. In this reporting period, did the agency convert all eligible Schedule A employees with a disability into the competitive service after two years of satisfactory service (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.3102(u)(6)(i))? If \"no\", please explain why the agency did not convert al l eligible Schedule A employees. Yes 0 No X N/A 0 Of the 36 Schedule A employees with a disability eligible for conversion in FY 22, 14 employees were converted untimely due to the conversion PARs being submitted late; however, as of the 4th quarter, all 36 conversions had been processed. IRS Human Capital Office (HCO) is collaborating with the Business Based Divisions (BBDs) to ensure all future PARs are submitted timely for conversion. All FY23 Q1 PARs are on schedule for timely processing. 2. Using the inclusion rate as the benchmark, did the percentage of PWD among voluntary and involuntary separations exceed that of persons without disabilities? If \"yes\", describe the trigger below. a. Voluntary Separations (PWD) Yes X No 0 b. Involuntary Separations (PWD) Yes X No 0 Source: (B14) \u00a8 The inclusion rate for PWD (13.36%) exceeded the inclusion rate for persons with no disability (12.43%) for voluntary separations so there is a trigger. \u00a8 The inclusion rate for PWD (0.93%) exceeded the inclusion rate of persons with no disability (0.88%) for involuntary separations so there is a trigger. 3. Using the inclusion rate as the benchmark, did the percentage of PWTD among voluntary and involuntary separati ons exceed that of persons without targeted disabilities? If \"yes\", describe the trigger below. a. Voluntary Separations (PWTD) Yes X No 0 b. Involuntary Separations (PWTD) Yes X No 0 111 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT Source: (B14) \u00a8 The inclusion rate for PWTD (12.73%) exceeded the inclusion rate for persons with no disability (12.43%) for voluntary separations so there is a trigger. \u00a8 The inclusion rate for PWTD (0.95%) exceeded the inclusion rate of persons with no disability (0.88%) for involuntary separations so there is a trigger. 4. If a trigger exists involving the separation rate of PWD and/or PWTD, please explain why they left the agency using exit interview results and other data sources . In FY22, of the PWD that separated from the agency, 31.4% retired and 49.7% resigned. The Exit Survey results (as of Q3) showed that PWD resigned due to personal circumstances (10.0%) or transferred to another agency (6.7%). Job related stress had the highest impact on this group (49.2%). Nearly two-thirds (65.2%) of PWD respondents indicated they would return to work after separating due to Job-Related Stress, and the same percentage (65.2%) indicated that something could have been done to prevent them from separating. B. Accessibility of Technology and Facilities Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(4), federal agencies are required to inform applicants and employees of their rights under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(b), concerning the accessibility of agency technology, and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4151-4157), concerning the accessibility of agency facilities. In addition, agencies are required to inform individuals where to file complaints if other agencies are responsible for a violation. 1. Please provide the internet address on the agency's public website for its notice explaining employees' and applicants' rights under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, including a description of how to file a complaint. https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/accessibility-notice- of-rights 2. Please provide the internet address on the agency's public website for its notice explaining employees' and applicants' rights under the Architectural Barriers Act, including a description of how to file a complaint. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/taxpayer-accessibility-guide.pdf 112 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 3. Describe any programs, policies, or practices that the agency has undertaken, or plans on undertaking over the next fiscal year, designed to improve accessibility of agency facilities and/or technology. In response to the pandemic, the Service first moved to have most employees work from home but subsequently called certain mission-critical employees back to the office. A phased approach to bringing the entire workforce back to work in the office was later initiated with varying frequency depending on the nature of the jobs performed and other circumstances. This large movement concerning where work is performed highlighted various issues concerning accommodation. The Service is exploring how to best balance the obligation to accommodate employees with disabilities while either working in the office or at home while avoiding the spending of appropriated funds for personal use items in an effort to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. The IRS successfully transitioned from General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Relay Services (FRS) to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) and contractual services. FRS provides telecommunications services for federal employees who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing or have speech disabilities. To ensure employees experienced improved access, enhanced service and no loss of coverage, the IRS worked closely with GSA to transition 6 of the 8 telecommunication services from FRS to TRS which comes at no cost to government agencies. In addition, for the two remaining services not covered by TRS, IRS used GSA's Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) and awarded contracts for Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and Relay Conference Captioning (RCC). GSA decommissioned FRS on February 13, 2022 and the IRS successfully transition ed timely. The Internal Revenue Service is committed to ensuring accessibility of agency facilities and technology for employees, the taxpaying communities they serve and the partner organizations that are provided federal financial assistance. Highlights of improvement actions the agency has undertaken in FY22 are as follows: Due to the pandemic, the Service conducted annual compliance visits with recipients of federal financial assistance \"virtually\" in FY21; however, with staff vacancies and the recognized advantage of \"onsite\" compliance reviews to better assess and improve accessibility of facilities and programs, a decision was made to halt compliance reviews until FY23. The Service still continues to conduct training with IRS employees through events such as SABA open enrollment sessions, participation in the Fundamental Management Skills course for new IRS managers, and direct requests from business unit managers to speak directly to their employees about the topic of taxpayer civil rights, including the importance of reasonable accommodations for taxpayers with disabilities. The IRS is partnering with Microsoft (MS) representatives to have IRS employees with disabilities provide MS with feedback concerning accessibility of MS Teams from the perspectives of Deaf/Hard of Hearing, blind/low vision and other users with disabilities. The effort will involve focus groups conducted beginning in May 2022. Expected outcomes include identifying settings options that best meet the needs of the diverse user groups and possible adjustments to IT security controls and perhaps enhancements to future iterations of MS Teams. The IRS has published numerous articles in support of accessibility. Some of the articles published include, but are not limited to the following: \"NDEAM: America's Recovery: Powered by Inclusion\" ; \"Where to go for Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Questions? (EDI Mailbox)\" ; \"National Braille Literacy Month\" ; \"What Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Access (DEIA) mean ?\"; \"Where to go for EDI Services\" ; \"American Heart Month\" and \"IRS Employee Organizations/Employee Resource Groups.\" C. Reasonable Accommodation Program Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(3), agencies must adopt, post on their public website, and make available to all job applicants and employees, reasonable accommodation procedures. 113 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 1. Please provide the average time frame for processing initial requests for reasonable accommodations during the reporting period. (Please do not include previously approved requests with repetitive accommodations, such as interpreting services.) The reasonable accommodation process is neither a static nor closed system. Previously the Service could be expected to address less than 1,000 requests for accommodations annually; however, following the issuance of Executive Order 14043 (in the fall of 2021), which required employees be vaccinated against Covid-19, the IRS received more than 6,700 requests for accommodation based on medical needs or religious beliefs and more than 3600 requests for accommodation not related to the vaccine mandate. The IRS also made a variety of policy and program changes in light of the evolving nature of the pandemic environment including a phased return to office for all employees which also prompted substantial numbers of accommodation requests. The unprecedented RA inventory levels coupled with addressing novel issues such as balancing individual medical concerns with the risk of the spread of disease or balancing respect for religious beliefs with the need to carry out the Service's mission have strained resources. As a result, cycle times increased from 70 days in Sept 2021 to 83 days in Sept. 2022. The Service remains committed to further exploring opportunities to expedite RA request processing such as adding staffing or contract support personnel to facilitate the interactive dialogue between employees/applicants with disabilities and IRS management as well as navigating the various support functions involved with assessing and fulfilling varying accommodation needs. 2. Describe the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, or practices to implement the agency's reasonable accommodation program. Some examples of an effective program include timely processing requests, timely providing approved accommodations, conducting training for managers and supervisors, and monitoring accommodation requests for trends. Implementation of Treasury's Reasonable Accommodations Tracker (RA Tracker), an application information system that is used to report department wide reasonable accommodations requests and provide aggregate data through generated reports annually to the Office of Personal Management (OPM) and EEOC, has been delayed. The original plan was to finalize all enhancements by April 2022 and implement in May; however, due to the unprecedented RA inventory of over 3600 cases, three times the usual annual inventory, implementation is now delayed to Q2 of FY23 to allow for a feature to auto-populate fields through HR connect. This feature would reduce intake from ten minutes to two to three minutes. The IRS continues to effectively provide training service-wide. For example, the Disability Services Section (DSS) conducted two training sessions for 150 Front Line Managers on Sign Language Interpreting (SLI) and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) Services in June and July of 2022. These sessions were intended for both new managers and as a refresher for managers that supervise employees who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing. Discussions included the SLI virtual, face- to-face, remote and onsite CART services. It also showcased the Telecommunication Relay Services (TRS) which included Video Relay Services (VRS) and Conference Captioning (CC). Additionally, the IRS' Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) and General Legal Services (GLS) offices partnered to develop and deliver Reasonable Accommodation (RA) training for managers, including information on proper management responses to commonly encountered challenges highlighted in decisions where the Service failed to accommodate individual employees. The training was rolled out to over 500 managers in the Wage & Investment organization during three sessions in August 2022. The IRS Reasonable Accommodation Training Cadre also presented approximately 46 training sessions (totaling over 61 hours) on varying topics, to a total of 3,221 participants of which at least 2,338 were managers. Particularly noteworthy highlights of these trainings being: RA Open Enrollment Sessions in SABA, July - September 114 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT EDI, Reasonable Accommodations Return to Office training for managers, May - July The first Face to Face training presentation requested since returning to office from pandemic closures (Austin, TX) was held on July 26, 2022 in Austin, TX. Reasonable Accommodations training session for newly hired EEO Counselors Training was also provided via Lunch and Learn sessions, including topics such as \"Inclusion in Action - An Overview of Executive Order 14035: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce,\" and \"Reasonable Accommodation (RA) Services, RA Requests and Return to Office (RTO), and the HCO Hardship Program.\" The IRS's Reasonable Accommodation (RA) program focused its efforts on addressing large numbers of pandemic-related RA requests including medical and religious based requests for exemption from the vaccination requirements, requests for exemption from testing and mask wearing requirements and requests for telework etc. Notable impacts include the total number of sign language and CART services requested increasing from 1,095 requests received (Q1) to 1,355 requests (Q3) - resulting in an increase of services filled by the contract vendor (from 397 requests to 1005 requests respectively). Despite the increase in the number of requests for face- to-face services with the return to office, the program fill rate increased to 99% in the 3rd quarter. Lastly, in response to an expected hiring surge in FY 2022, which would likely include a number of new employees with disabilities, the IRS purchased an inventory of the most commonly needed hardware components of adaptive technology accommodation solutions so the accommodations could be quickly furnished without the need to procure the necessary items. D. Personal Assistance Services Allowing Employees to Participate in the Workplace Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(5), federal agencies, as an aspect of affirmative action, are required to provide personal assistance services (PAS) to employees who need them because of a targeted disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the agency. Describe the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, or practices to implement the PAS requirement. Some examples of an effective program include timely processing requests for PAS, timely providing approved services, conducting training for managers and supervisors, and monitoring PAS requests for trends. The IRS is converting the previously published Interim Guidance for Personal Assistance Services (PAS) into a section of the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) on June 10, 2022, to enable managers and employees to readily locate the policy and procedures. Information on PAS is available on the IRS's internal and external websites. Training on PAS was incorporated into a broader Reasonable Accommodation training session presented to managers in the Wage & Investment Division of the IRS. To date, the IRS has not received a request for PAS but is poised to respond if/when a request is made.

At the end of Q3 in FY22, the agency had 21.78% employees who were blind or visually impaired with 12.5% being revenue agents and 20% being revenue officers. The work of VIEW guides and assists these employees with the resources they need, and develops effective strategies and tools to enable them to bring their whole selves to work. This allows employees to fully focus on their jobs, advance their careers, and better serve the agency. VIEW uses their collective strength 127 EEOC FORM U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT to confront workplace issues for the blind and visually impaired which could impede career development, advancement, and retention.

In FY22, MOS focused on establishing regular outreach with its members via bi-monthly newsletter emails and monthly virtual national meetings that shared articles, training opportunities and job announcements for all members, including revenue agents/officers. IRS MOS hosted multiple virtual training workshops to support professional development of veterans. Topics included Resume Writing, Veterans Administration Benefits and Services, the Military Buy-Back Program, and the IRS Mock Interview Program.

We will do this by building upon our longstanding and successful partnerships and seeking new partners to innovatively engage with these communities.

GOAL 1 SERVICE IRS STRATEGIC PLAN FY2022-2026 IRS STRATEGIC PLAN FY2022-202610Provide Proactive Outreach & Education Objective 1.3: Provide proactive outreach and education to improve taxpayer understanding of their rights, responsibilities and obligations. The IRS must proactively communicate to meet taxpayers where they are. We must provide plain language and tailored messaging throughout the year at each stage of the tax lifecycle \u2014prior to filing through receiving returns and preparing for the next year. This also includes engaging more with taxpayers on both traditional and digital channels they regularly use, from phone and paper-based communications to social media and IRS.gov online accounts. From FY2020-2021, the IRS saw a 35% growth in social media followers across all of its platforms. We also promote engagement with two-way communication, like offering telephone call back service and online chat. Strategy 1.3.1: Increase digital communications, while maintaining traditional channels, to help ensure taxpayers have the information necessary to comply with their obligations and understand their rights. Strategy 1.3.2: Develop easy-to-understand tax products and correspondence for effective taxpayer messaging. Strategy 1.3.3: Enhance our social media strategy to effectively communicate with taxpayers. Protect Taxpayer Data Objective 1.4: Safeguard taxpayer data and privacy and protect the IRS against internal and external threats. We will continue to prioritize the protection of taxpayer data when creating personalized services and digital tools, such as through the Secure Access Digital Identity Initiative, especially in a world where cybercrime is so prevalent. We will also continue to bolster efforts to mitigate the risks of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information. Strategy 1.4.1: Prioritize taxpayer rights and security as foundational to every program, process and system. Strategy 1.4.2: Proactively identify, mitigate and manage internal and external risks. Strategy 1.4.3: Design services that optimize the ease of access to digital taxpayer applications while preserving the security and integrity of taxpayer data. The Social Media Strategy includes the expansion of IRS's presence across social media platforms and increases the number of languages in which we share IRS news and tailored educational updates based on demographics. These images show examples of communica-tions in Haitian Creole, Spanish and Traditional Chinese. Progress and success of our Service Goal will be supported by measures, including but not limited to: Enterprise Self-Assistance Participation Rate: Measures the percentage of taxpayer assistance requests resolved using self-assisted automated services. Enterprise Level of Service:Measures the success rate of taxpayers that call an IRS toll-free phone line seeking assistance.

We are willing to accept higher risk levels when pursuing transformative innovation or during certain critical periods, such as times of crises or when faced with the need to expeditiously implement critical legislation. In these instances, the IRS documents the rationale used in accepting the additional risk exposure. GOAL 1 | Service: Provide quality and accessible services to enhance the taxpayer experience. The IRS is committed to providing high-quality taxpayer service; however, the IRS maintains a low appetite for activities that endanger taxpayer privacy or put taxpayer data at risk, and continues to implement safeguards to protect data and privacy.

Department of Treasury Strategic Plan Alignment The IRS Strategic Plan FY2022-2026 supports key governmentwide strategic priorities from the President's Management Agenda including strengthening the federal workforce, delivering an excellent customer experience, combating climate change, increasing equity and supporting underserved communities. As the Department of the Treasury's largest bureau, the IRS plays a critical role in advancing Treasury's Strategic Plan 2022-2026 by co-leading the \"Tax Policy and Administration\" Z[YH[LNPJ\u0003VIQLJ[P]L\u0003HUK\u0003Z\\WWVY[PUN\u0003LPNO[\u0003V[OLY\u0003VIQLJ[P]LZ\u0003HJYVZZ\u0003HSS\u0003\u00c4]L\u0003NVHSZ\u0003\u000fHSPNUTLU[\u0003PSS\\Z[YH[LK\u0003PU\u0003[OL\u0003 chart below).

The IRS supports Treasury on other governmentwide legislative priorities, including the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 and the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act of 2016.

Rettig Commissioner of Internal Revenue SUBJECT: Anti-Harassment & Anti-Bullying Policy Purpose The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is committed to fostering a model workplace free of conduct that negatively affects employee engagement and prod uctivity. Every effort must be made to prevent harassment and bullying in general and in particular harassment based on protected characteristics (i.e., race, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status), national origin, religion, age (40 and over), disability (mental or phys ical), parental status, protected genetic information, and participation in protected e qual employment opportunity (EEO) activity). The purpose of this policy is to p revent or mitigate harm to any employee subjected to harassment or bullying. As such, this policy seeks to address harassing and bullying conduct before it reaches the level of unlawful harassment. This policy supplements, but does not replace, existing EEO complaint procedures under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 or collective bargaining grievance procedures. This policy applies whether the employee has sought relief through another course of action, including an EEO administrative complaint, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal, or negotiated grievance. Policy The IRS has zero tolerance for discriminatory harassing conduct against an employee or applicant for employment based on a protected chara cteristic. Moreover, the IRS will not tolerate harassment or bullying of any kind. Employees are protected from harassment by non-employees, and t he IRS may be held accountable for harassment by non-employees in work-related sit uations. Furthermore, the IRS may address harassment by an employee toward another em ployee under this policy, even if the harassment took place outside of the workpl ace and during off-duty hours. 2 The conduct covered by this policy is broader than the legal de finition of unlawful harassment. The goal of this policy is to stop unwelcome conduct before it rises to the level of unlawful harassment and to prevent harassment, sexual harassment, and bullying from occurring. Through enforcement of this policy, and by educating all employees, the IRS seeks to prevent, address, and correct behav ior that violates this policy. The IRS' goal is to address and eradicate any potentially haras sing conduct. To achieve this goal, it is imperative that any conduct that is pe rceived to be unwelcome, hostile, and/or abusive be reported to a management official as soon as possible. Should any unwelcome, hostile, and/or abusive cond uct occur, this policy sets forth procedures for immediate and appropriate inve stigation and corrective action. Importantly, if warranted, corrective action may include disciplinary or adverse action. Distribution This policy shall be distributed to all employees upon issuance and annually thereafter. It shall also be made available to employees on the IRS intrane t and distributed during the first week of work to all n ew employees as part of theiror ientation. Additionally, the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Anti-Harassment Section w ill provide periodic trainings on this policy to Management and employees. Separation of Anti-Harassment/Anti-Bullying and EEO Processes The process to address allegati ons of harassment, sexual harass ment, and bullying detailed in this policy are separate from the EEO complaint process. As such, under this policy the Chief Diversity Officer, and specifically the EEO Di vision, cannot conduct a Management Inquiry into allegations of harassment or bullying o r act as the Deciding Official regarding the inquiry findings. Information related to allegations of harassment, sexual harassment, and bullyin g will be shared between the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Office and the IRS EEO Division only as detailed in thi s policy. Conduct Covered Harassment : Harassment is hostile or abusive conduct based on a protected characteristic (i.e., race, color, sex (including pregnancy, se xual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status), national origin, religion, age (40 and over), disability (mental or physical), parental status, protected gen etic information, and participation in protected equal employment opportunity (EEO) a ctivity). Unlawful Harassment : Unlawful harassment is a form of prohibited employment discrimination. Unlawful harassment includes hostile or abusive conduct based on a protected characteristic where: 3 (a) such conduct by a supervisor culminates in a tangible emplo yment action (i.e., a significant change in employment status or benefit); or (b) the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the terms, conditions, or privileges of the employee's employment, unreasonably interferes with work performance, or otherwise creates a working environment which a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, orabusive. Examples of harassing conduct may include, but are not limited to: o Making derogatory comments or displaying offensive behavior ab out a person's religious beliefs or any other protected characteristic; o Making offensive or insulting comments about skin color, ethni c traits, or age; o Making offensive gestures or negative comments about a mental or physical disability; o Sharing inappropriate images, videos, letters or notes; o Making offensive or negative comments about a co-worker or employee because of a protected characteristic; o Wearing offensive clothing that displays inappropriate images in the workplace; o Using racist slurs or slang phrases; and o Displaying drawings, posters, cartoons, or images in the workp lace that are offensive to other people based on any protected characteristic . While the single use of an epithet that offends another employe e will typically not rise to the level of unlawful harassmen t, it is the IRS' policy that su ch conduct is inappropriate in the workplace and will not be tolerated. The following conduct typically would not constitute harassing conduct and is not covered by this policy: o Petty slights and trivial annoyances, a lack of good manners or personality conflicts. For example, saying or doing something in a playful manner to annoy or cause a reaction; lack of good manners (e.g., not saying good m orning, please, thank you, humming or singing loudly to music, even though head phones are being used, etc.); miscommunications (e.g., having a misunderst anding, disagreement, or lack of guidance/direction); or personality co nflicts (e.g., individuals having differing communication styles). o Reasonable management actions in support of the work or direct ions to employees to perform work. For example, reasonable management a ctions in support of the work (i.e., providing performance feedback, directing employees to meet with a manager, advising of conduct or time and attendance concerns, monitoring or tracking these and/or the work area/work environm ent for reasonable business reasons) and/or assigning work and directio ns to employees to perform work. 4 Sexual Harassment : Sexual harassment is one form of harassment prohibited by thi s policy and refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. The harasser may be the same sex or a different sex from the targeted person. Such conduct constitute s sexual harassment when: (a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implici tly a term or condition of an individual's employment; (b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or (c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfer ing with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, host ile, oroffensive working environment. Examples of sexual harassing conduct may include, but are not l imited to: o Remarks about a person's appearance, clothing, body parts, or activities; o Physically blocking a person's movement or standing in their w ay; o Descriptions of sexual acts; o Staring or looking a person's body up and down; o Following an individual around or paying excessive attention to them; o Telling lewd jokes or sharing stories about sexual experiences; o Sending unwanted suggestive or lewd emails, letters or other c ommunications (including those shared via social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Tik Tok, etc.) or blogs (e.g., B logger, Wordpress, Tumblr, etc. )); o Sharing images of a sexual nature around the workplace, or dis playing posters, pictures, items, or screensavers of a sexual nature; o Inappropriate and suggestive touching, kissing, rubbing or car essing of a person's body and/or clothing; o Pressure for dates, despite repeated declinations; o Repeated requests for sexual favors; and o Making sexually offensive gestures, remarks or facial expressions. Retaliatory Harassment : Retaliatory harassment is harassing conduct based on a person's prior protected EEO activity. For instance, an employe e is protected under Federal anti-discrimination laws from retaliation for having filed an EEO complaint, or testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an EEO investigation, proceeding, or hearing. In addition, an employee is protected from retaliat ion for engaging in reasonable opposition to any practice made unlawful under Feder al anti-discrimination laws. Moreover, an employee is protected from retaliation for h aving requested a reasonable accommodation for a disability or religious belief. Even if the retaliatory harassment is not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostil e work environment, retaliatory harassment may be unlawful if it could deter a reas onable person from asserting their EEO rights. 5 Bullying: Bullying occurs when an individual engages in repeated, unrea sonable actions intended to intimidate, degrade, offend, humiliate, or marginalize the target person or group. Although bullying is currently not recognized as a legal cause of action under Federal anti-discrimination laws, bullying based on a pro tected characteristic that constitutes unlawful harassment is prohibited. Regardless of th e reason such activity occurs, bullying, for any reason , is against the IRS Rules of C onduct and is prohibited by this policy. Examples of workplace bullying include, but are not limited to: o Unwarranted or invalid criticism; o Blame without factual justification; o Being treated differently from the rest of your work group; o Being sworn at; o Exclusion or social isolation; o Being shouted at or being intentionally humiliated; and o Being the target of practical jokes. Cyber-Harassment o r Cyber-Bullying: Cyber-harassment or cyber-bullying involves using electronic devices, including cellular phones and compute rs, to transmit harassing or bullying text or images via text message, email, social medi a sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Tik Tok, etc.) or blogs (e.g., Blogger, Word press, Tumblr, etc.). Although cyber-bullying is currently not recognized as a legal cause of action under Federal anti-discrimination laws, cyber-bullying based on a pro tected characteristic that constitutes unlawful harassment is prohibited. Regardless of the reason such activity occurs, cyber-bullying, for any reason, is against the IRS Rule s of Conduct and is prohibited by this policy. Examples of cyber-harassment or cyber-bullying include, but are not limited to: o Posting comments or rumors about someone online that are mean, hurtful, or embarrassing; o Threatening to hurt someone or telling them to kill themselves ; o Posting a mean or hurtful picture or video; o Pretending to be someone else online to solicit or post personal or false information about someone else; o Posting mean or hateful names, comments or content about any r ace, religion, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics online; o Creating a mean or hurtful webpage about someone; o Doxing, which is a form of online harassment used to exact rev enge and to threaten to destroy the privacy of individuals by making their personal information public, including addresses, Social Security Number, credit car d and phone numbers, links to social media accounts, and other private data . 6 Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment The employer is automatically liable for unlawful harassment by a supervisor that results in a tangible employment action such as termination, fa ilure to promote or hire, and loss of wages. If the supervisor's harassment results in a hostile work environment, the employ er can avoid liability only if it can pr ove that: (1) it reasonably tried to prevent and immediately correct the harassing behavior ; and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corr ective opportunities provided by the employer. The employer will be liable for unlawful harassment by non-supe rvisory employees or non-employees over whom it has control (e.g., independent contr actors or customers on the premises), if it knew, or should have known, about the h arassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. Employee Responsibilities Reporting Harassment or Bullying Employees are responsible for reporting harassing conduct or bu llying. While isolated incidents of harassment or bullying generally do not violate Fe deral anti-discrimination laws, a pattern of incidents may. Employees should take advantage of the preventative or corrective opportunities provided by this policy. Employees who report harassment or bullying may do so anonymous ly, or otherwise ask that their names not be disclosed to others. Any employee who believes they have been subjected to harassmen t or bullying should report the matter to any of the following individuals: o Their supervisor; o The supervisor of the employee engaging in the harassing or in appropriate conduct; o Another supervisor or other management official inside or outs ide of the employee's chain-of-command; or o The EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator via the *EDI AHP M ailbox (EDI.AHP.MAILBOX@irs .gov). 1 Employees who know of or witness what they believe to be harass ment or bullying must report the matter in a manner described above. 1 Use the email address in the parenthesis when contacting the An ti-Harassment Program Coordinator from an external email address. 7 Reporting Sexual Harassment Any employees who believe they hav e been subjected to sexual ha rassment are encouraged to inform the alleged offender verbally or in writin g that such conduct is unwelcome, that it is offensiv e, and that it must stop. If an employee does not wish to communicate directly with the a lleged offender, if such communication has been ineffective, or if the alleged offender is a manager who controls or otherwise affects the employee's terms and conditio ns of employment, the employee can report an allegation of sexual harassment to any o f the following: o Their supervisor; o The supervisor of the employee engaging in the harassing or in appropriate conduct; o Another supervisor or other management official inside or outs ide of the employee's chain-of-command; o The EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator via the *EDI AHP M ailbox (EDI.AHP.MAILBOX@irs.gov); o The IRS Sexual Harassment Hotline at 469-801-1599 or 866-298-7 672; or o The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) Special Investigations Unit (SIU) Mail box via SIU@tigta.treas.gov. Employees who know of sexual harassment or witness what they be lieve to be sexual harassment must report the matter in a manner described above. Reporting harassment or bullying to any of the individuals prov ided above does not constitute initiation of the EEO process or grievance procedure s and does not delay the time limits for init iating such actions. Even if an employee reports the conduct to Management, to the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator, through the IRS Sexual Harassment Hotline, or to TIGTA, the employee has forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of the alleged harassing conduct to initiate the informal EEO process by contacting an E EO Counselor. If an employee seeks EEO counseling over an allegation of harassment or bullying, the EEO Counselor will report allegations of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying to the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator for a Management Inquir y. For more information on the EEO process, refer to the section \"Filing EEO Complaints, Administrative Appeals, or Negotiated Grievances\" in this polic y. Employer Responsibilities Reporting Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Bullying to the ED I Anti- Harassment Program Coordinator 8 (1) Management : If Management receives a report of harassment, sexual harassm ent, or bullying, Management must immediately address all allegation s in the manner outlined in this policy. Allegations of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying involving another manager's employee should be reported to the appropriate manage r in that employee's chain of command wit hin one (1) business day. If Man agement is unsure to whom to report such allegati ons, the EDI Anti-Harassment Pro gram Coordinator can assist in determining the appropriate manager. Management must report all harassment, sexual harassment, and b ullying allegations to the Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator, via the EDI Anti- Harassment Mailbox (*EDI AHP Mailbox) within one (1) business d ay of becoming aware of the allegation. Reporting the allegation to the EDI An ti-Harassment Program Coordinator or to TIGTA, however, does not remove the r equirement for management to immediately address the allegation. The EDI Anti- Harassment Program Coordinator, or their delegate, will, as appropriate, p rovide guidance to management on conducting a Management Inquiry. Ignoring a report of alleged harassment is not an option and do ing so may subject the Agency to liability and the manager who failed to report th e allegation to corrective action, including disciplinary action where appropri ate. (2) EEO Counselor : If an employee initi ates contact with an EEO Counselor allegi ng harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying, the EDI Informal Co mplaints Section will, within five (5) c alendar days, notify the EDI Anti-Harass ment Program Coordinator that such an allegation was raised. Even if the emp loyee has exercised the right to anonymity during t he informal counseling process, the EEO Counselor still must report the allegations to the EDI Anti-Harassment Pr ogram Coordinator. Employee who report harassment or bullying may do so anonymousl y, or otherwise ask that their names not to be d isclosed to others. The assigne d EEO Counselor will notify the employee of the referral to the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator. This notification to the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinato r will not stop or postpone the EEO process. (3) EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator : When an allegation of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying is made directly to the EDI Anti -Harassment Program Coordinator, the coordinator, or delegate, will immediately ack nowledge receipt of the allegation and notify the appropriate Management officials of t he allegation. Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations to TIGTA The EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator, or delegate, will report sexual 9 harassment allegations to TIGTA within ten (10) calendar days o f receiving notice of such allegations. The report provided by the EDI Anti-Harassmen t Program Coordinator, or delegate, to TIGTA should include the specific nature of the incident, the date and place of the incident, the names of the parties involv ed, as well as all pertinent facts. Notification to TIGTA does not remove the requirement th at Management perform an inquiry and immediately address sexual harassment allegation s. Based on the information provided by the EDI Anti-Harassment Pr ogram Coordinator, TIGTA will determine whether it will conduct a separate investi gation of the sexual harassment allegation. Regardless of whether TIGTA pursues a se parate investigation of the sexual harassment allegation, the IRS' inquiry will cont inue. Also, if the sexual harassment allegations arose through the EEO process, the EEO p rocess will continue regardless of whether TIGTA takes jurisdiction of the allegatio n. Roles and Responsibilities of those Conducting the Management I nquiry The Deciding Official is responsible for making a decision based on the gathered information about the allegations raised by the alleging employ ee and for recommending any necessary actions to correct the work environm ent. The Deciding Official is also responsible fo r assigning the Inquiry Official to conduct the factfinding, and with meeting with the alleging employee and the alleged har asser to conduct close- out discussions about the inquiry. The Inquiry Official is appointed by the Deciding Official and is responsible for gathering all relevant and necessary information so that the De ciding Official can make a fact-based assessment of the employee's allegations, and the Inquiry Official may recommend any necessary follow up to be taken to correct the wo rk environment. The EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator is responsible for ensuring the Management officials conduct a full and timely inquiry in compl iance with this Policy. Conducting the Management Inquiry The EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator, or delegate, will assist Management in conducting an inquiry into allegations of harassment, sexual harassment, and/or bullying as appropriate. Guidance, direction, and assistance ar e provided by the Anti- Harassment Program to Management to ensure relevant information is obtained, and the process is completed, within the stipulated timeframes as d escribed below. There may be an occasion in which an employee confides in Manag ement that the employee is being harassed but does not want any action taken. The employee's request notwithstanding, Manage ment is still obligated to repor t this allegation to the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator, or delegate. By making a manager aware of an allegation of harassment, by extension the IRS has been made aware. As such, the 10 EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator, or their delegate, wil l initiate a Management Inquiry to determine whether harassment occurred and, if warran ted, to ensure that immediate, effective, corrective action is taken to stop the in appropriate and potentially unlawful behavior. After receiving notification of such allegations, the EDI Anti- Harassment Program Coordinator, or delegate, will: (a) Immediately acknowledge receipt of the allegation; (b) Identify and notify the appropriate Management official at leas t two levels above the supervisory level of the employee raising the allegation to act as the Deciding Official (the Deciding Official must have authority to impose disciplinary action, if warranted, to address the allegation); (c) Ensure the Deciding Official appoints an Inquiry Official (fact finder) whowill conduct the inquiry to gather all facts pertaining to the alleg ation; and (d) Provide guidance to the Inquiry Official to ensure a thorough i nquiry is conducted. Management must conduct an immediate inquiry to determine the f requency and severity of the alleged harassing, sexually harassing, or bully ing conduct and, where appropriate, take steps to ensure no further harassment or bull ying occurs. Absent extenuating circumstances, within ten (10) calendar days after notice of the allegation, the Agency will initiate the inquiry process to determine: (a) What conduct is at issue; (b) The parties involved; (c) Any pertinent facts available (e.g., the nature, date, and plac e of the incident); (d) Whether any immediate corrective action is required to insulate the alleged victim from further harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying; and (e) What action is necessary and appropriate to otherwise address the allegation. Management should record its activities and findings of the inq uiry in writing. The scope and formality of the inquiry is determined on a case-by-case ba sis, depending on the nature and complexity of the allegations. Inquiries should cons ist of interviews with all persons with relevant information, including the individual acc used of the harassing conduct, and a review of any written or electronic information related to the alleged conduct. Management should take appropriate steps to ensure no further harassment or bullying occurs. Absent extenuating circumstances, Management should complete its full inquiry within thirty (30) calendar days from notification of the harassing or bullying conduct. In addition, Management must inform employees who make reports of discriminatory harassment or sexual harassment of the employee's right to seek EEO counseling and the requirement to initiate such EEO contact within the 45 cale ndar days. The 11 applicable timeframes are provided in this policy under \"Filing EEO Complaints, Administrative Appeals, or Negotiated Grievances.\" Taking Corrective Action If it is determined that harassm ent, sexual harassment, or bull ying occurred, Management will act imm ediately to ensure that the improper con duct does not recur. In addition, Management must take appropriate corrective action, i ncluding disciplinary action where appropriate. Management must take appropriate corr ective action, which may include disciplinary action, even if the alleged victim req uests that no action be taken. The Deciding Official will determine the appropriate corrective action by reviewing the report submitted by the Inquiry Official, and as appropriate, c onsulting with the Anti- Harassment Program Coordinator or delegate, and the Labor Relat ions office. Deciding Officials should always consult with the Labor Relations office prior to taking any disciplinary or adverse actions against employees and may conta ct Chief Counsel, when desired. The Deciding Official should not implement any co rrective actions until these consultations have taken place. Close-Out Briefing The Deciding Official will provide an alleged victim a close-ou t briefing. The briefing may be conducted verbally or in writing as dictated by circumstance s and at the discretion of the Deciding Official. The Deciding Official will document, for the record, that the Close- Out Briefing occurred. The close-out briefing will notify the alleged victim that the Management Inquiry was conducted and that the work environment will continue to be mon itored to ensure no inappropriate conduct occurs. However, in accordance with the P rivacy Act, if the Agency took corrective action, including disciplinary or advers e action, against the offending employee, this info rmation will not be provided in th e close-out briefing or otherwise shared with the alleged victim. Because there may be additional requirements to provide a close -out briefing to a Bargaining Unit employee alleged to have engaged in harassing o r bullying behavior, Management is advised to consult with the Labor Relations offic e about such matters. The Deciding Official will provide the alleged harasser with a close-out briefing during which that individual will be notified of what, if any, correct ive actions will be taken. If it is determined that an adverse action is warranted, the information from the inquiry that is the basis for the adverse action will be shared with an individ ual against whom disciplinary or adverse action is proposed. Information gathere d during the inquiry will be made available to the EEO Investigator if an EEO complaint i s filed and acceptedby 12 Treasury on the same or a related matter. Monitoring the Work Environment Each Business Operating Division is responsible for ensuring it s offices are in full compliance with this policy. Supervisors and managers are respo nsible for monitoring the work environment, especially after a reported allegation of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying. When necessary, supervisors should con duct a subsequent Management Inquiry to ensure no further harassment, sexual hara ssment, bullying, or retaliation have occurred. Protection Against Retaliation Retaliation against persons who make claims of harassment, sexu al harassment, or bullying, or who otherwise participate in the fact-finding proc ess regarding such claims, will not be tolerated and should be immediately addressed pursu ant to the procedures in this policy. Such retaliation is prohibited and may result i n disciplinary action. Confidentiality Reports of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying will be k ept confidential to the extent reasonably possible. Disclosures about allegations of ha rassment or bullying will be made only on a \"need to know\" basis, in order to determine t he facts surrounding the allegation and to take appropriate action. Release of Inquiry Report Employees raising allegations in accordance with this policy will not receive a copy of the Inquiry Report. Any report or other documentation is consid ered an internal, management document pertaining to another person and is protect ed by the Privacy Act. If Management's corrective action includes disciplinary or adverse action, the information from the inquiry which was used as the basis for th e disciplinary or adverse action, including the relevant portions of the Inquiry Report, will be shared with those against whom disciplinary or adverse action has been proposed. If a formal EEO complaint is filed and accepted by the Department of Treasury on the same or a related matter, any information gathered during the internal inquiry, including the Inquiry Report, will be made available to the Department of Treasury. Appeal Rights There are no appeal rights, reconsideration, or other redress a ssociated with the 13 processing of allegations under this policy. Administrative Time Employees are entitled to a reasonable amount of administrative time to present their allegations or respond to agency requests for information while pursuing allegations or serving as a witness under this policy. Prior to meeting with a n Anti-Harassment Specialist, employees must request and obtain approval for admi nistrative time from their immediate manager. The empl oyee must submit their request in writing, with as much advanced notice as possible, preferably no later than five (5) business days in advance, and provide the following in their request: o The amount of administrative time being requested; o The stage of the process (e.g., initial meeting, follow-up meeting, etc.); and o An explanation of how the employee determined the amount of ti me requested. Representation Any Bargaining Unit employee involved in the investigation of a llegations under this policy (where the EEO, MSPB, and negotiated grievance processes have not been initiated) are entitled to NTEU representation only. These indi viduals will be issued Form 8111, Employee Notification Regarding Union Representation , in accordance with provisions of the NTEU-IRS National Agreement which permits a person designated by the union to represent the employee during the interview, if th e employee desires such representation. No other representation (e.g., attorney, family member, friend, advocate, etc.) is permitted. Filing EEO Complaints, Administrative Appeals, or Negotiated Gr ievances The purpose of this policy and the procedures identified in thi s policy is to ensure that the IRS takes appropriate actions to end harassment, sexual har assment, and bullying. In contrast, the EEO process is designed to make an employee wh o was subject to discriminatory harassment or sexual harassment whole or to prov ide remedial relief. Corrective action under this policy will not provide certain re medies that may be available to the employee (e.g., c ompensatory damages) through the EEO administrative complaint, MSPB appeal, or negotiated grievance processes. Filing an allegation of unlawful harassment under this policy will not satisfy the requirements for filing an EEO complaint, MSPB appeal, or negotiated grievance and may not result in providing remedies available through those pr ocesses. Additionally, filing an allegation of unlawful harassment under this policy will not delay the time limits for initiating the aforementioned processes. 14 An employee who chooses to pursue statutory, administrative, or collective bargaining remedies for unlawful harassment must elect one of the availabl e forums as follows: (1) For an EEO complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, contact a n EEO counselor in the Office of Equity, Div ersity & Inclusion within forty-five (45) calendar days from the most recent incident of alleged harassment (or from th e effective date of a personnel action if one is involved), as required in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). EEO counselor contact information is provided in the \"Where Do I Go For EEO?\" document located on the Employee Resource Center website on the IRS intranet. An employee may also initiate contact with an EEO Counselor by sending an email message via *EEO (*EEO@irs.gov (2) For an appeal to the MSPB pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.22, file a written appeal with the MSPB within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of an appealable adverse action as defined in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3, or w ithin thirty (30) calendar days of the date of receipt of the agency's adverse action decision, whichever is later. (3) For a negotiated grievance, file a written grievance in accorda nce with the provisions of the NTEU-IRS National Agreement, within forty-five (45) calendar days of the incident or the employee's learning of the incident. The IRS's liability for a findin g of unlawful harassment in an EEO complaint, MSPB appeal, or negotiated grievance may depend upon whether the age ncy was aware of and immediately corrected the hostile or abusive conduct. There fore: The EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator must be informed of all allegations of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying. Thus, the EEO Couns elor responsible for EEO complaint processing, or the responsible Labor Relation s Specialist processing an MSPB appeal or negotiated grievance who receives notice of such claim, shall immediately notify the EDI Anti-Harassment Program Coordinator of the allegation via the *EDI AHP Mailbox ( *EDI.AHP.Mailbox@irs.gov).

There are three categories of reason\u00ad able accommodations: (22) Reassignment -Reasonable accommodation of last resort, that absent undue hardship, is provided to employees (not applicants) who, because of a disabil\u00ad ity, can no longer perform the essential functions of their job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Reassignments are made only to funded vacant positions and for employees who are qualied to ll the vacant position. Informing an employee that they may apply for or otherwise compete for a position does not satisfy the obligation of appropriate officials to review vacancies for positions which the employee is qualied. Appropriate officials should determine if there is another position at the same or lower grade which the employee can perform. If the employee is qualied for the position, they will be reassigned to the job and will not have to compete. (23) Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator (RAC) - EDI staff member with specialized knowledge of disability-related laws, regulations, directives, practices and procedures, who support and help administer the process for requesting, assessing and affording reasonable accommodations. (24) Receiving Official -IRS personnel designated to officially receive a request for reasonable accommodation from an employee or applicant (or an individual acting on their behalf), who will forward the request to the servicing Reason\u00ad able Accommodation Services office to process and monitor the request until it is closed. (25) Regarded as -An individual is \"regarded as\" having a disability if the agency takes a prohibited action based on an actual or perceived impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last for six months or less) and minor. (26) Request for Reasonable Accommodation -A statement that an individual needs an adjustment or change at work, in the application process, or in a benet or privilege of employment for a reason related to a medical condition. A reasonable accommodation request may be submitted orally or in writing, by the employee or applicant, or by someone associated with the employee or applicant. (27) Requester -A qualied employee or applicant for employment with a disability, or an individual acting on their behalf, who requests reasonable accommoda\u00ad tion. (28) Temporary Measures -Accommodations that may be taken in extenuating circumstances. a. Modications or adjustments to a job application process to permit an individual with a disability to be considered for a job (such as, providing application forms in alternative formats like large print or Braille); b. Modications or adjustments to enable a qualied individual with a dis\u00ad ability to perform the essential functions of the job (such as, providing sign language interpreters); and c. Modications or adjustments that enable employees with disabilities to enjoy equal benets and privileges of employment (such as, removing physical barriers in an organization's cafeteria) Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.2.1.6 page 6 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity (29) Transitory -An impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less. (30) Undue Hardship -An action requiring signicant difficulty or expense. A deter\u00ad mination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including: x the nature and cost of the accommodation needed x the overall nancial resources of the facility making the reasonable ac\u00ad commodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the effect on expenses and resources of the facility x the overall nancial resources, size, number of employees, and type and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity) x the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the ad\u00ad ministrative or scal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation to the employer x the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility (31) Vacant Position -The position is available when the employee asks for reas\u00ad signment as a reasonable accommodation, or the employer knows that the position will become available within a reasonable amount of time. 1.20.2.2 (06-11-2021) Requesting a Reasonable Accommodation (1) The reasonable accommodation (RA) process begins as soon as the request for accommodation is made either orally or in writing. The request does not have to include any special words, such as \"reasonable accommodation,\"\" dis\u00ad ability,\" \"Rehabilitation Act.\" or identify the accommodation sought. T o enable the IRS to keep accurate records regarding requests for accommodation, employees should follow up an oral request for accommodation by completing the Reasonable Accommodation Request, Form 13661. If an employee chooses not to complete the written form, the Receiving Official, the Reason\u00ad able Accommodation Coordinator (RAC) or other responsible individual must complete Part I of the Form 13661 to document the request. Although the writ\u00ad ten RA Request Form should be completed as soon as possible following the request, it is not a requirement for the request itself. Processing of the request will begin as soon as it is made, whether or not the RA Request Form has been provided. This form can be completed online. An individual with a disabil\u00ad ity may request a reasonable accommodation whenever they choose, even if they have not previously disclosed the existence of a disability. The request does not necessarily mean that the IRS is required to provide the change or adjustment. Note: A RA Request Form is not required when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation on a recurring basis (e.g., the assistance of sign language interpreters or readers). The written form is required only for the rst request although appropriate notice must be given each time the accommodation is needed. Note: When the accommodation involves an individual who accesses Classied National Security Information (NSI), the Chief, Facilities Management and Security Services must be consulted prior to the accommodation being granted if the accommodation relates to NSI systems, storage of NSI and/or handling/processing of NSI. 1.20.2.2 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities 1.20.2 page 7 (2) The individual's request must be considered when an employee makes a request to (a) their immediate supervisor; (b) a supervisor or manager in their immediate chain of command; and/or (c) the IRS Disability Division Reason\u00ad able Accommodation Services (RAS). When an applicant makes a request, it will be considered if made to any agency employee with whom the applicant has contact in connection with the application process or any other individual designated by the Agency. The human resources specialist/management official handling the personnel action must give the RA Request Form to the applicant to ll out. If the applicant requires assistance with this requirement, the human resource official receiving the request will provide that assistance. If an applicant for employment chooses not to complete the form, the human resource official who has received the request must complete the form to document the request. A copy of the form will be provided to the servicing RAS office. (3) The Human Capital Office in conjunction with RAS, is responsible for training staff involved in the application process to recognize requests for reasonable accommodation and to handle them appropriately. (4) A family member, friend, health professional, or other representative (such as a union steward or coworker) may request a reasonable accommodation on behalf of an employee or applicant with a disability. The request shall be made to one of the same persons to whom the employee or applicant would make the request. T o the extent possible, an individual with a disability should be contacted to conrm that they in fact want a reasonable accommodation. The individual may refuse to accept an accommodation. Note: Requests for accommodation or inquiries concerning the status of RA requests may be made at ra.form.13661@irs.gov . 1.20.2.2.1 (06-24-2013) The Interactive Process (1) Communication is a priority throughout the entire process. IRS officials involved in the reasonable accommodation process should take a proactive approach in searching out and considering possible accommodations, including consulting appropriate resources for assistance. The employee requesting the accommodation (and any chosen representative) should also participate, to the extent possible, in helping to identify an effective accommodation. (2) On-going communication is particularly important where the specic limitation, problem, or barrier is unclear; where an effective accommodation is not obvious; or where the parties are considering different possible reasonable ac\u00ad commodations. In those cases where the disability, the need for accommodation, and the type of accommodation that should be provided are clear, extensive discussions are not necessary. Even so, the Deciding Official and requesting individual should discuss the matter to make sure that there is a full exchange of relevant information. (3) If after engaging in the interactive process the parties cannot agree on the ac\u00ad commodation to be granted, the Deciding Official should offer the individual the accommodation that the Deciding Official has determined to be reasonable and effective. Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.2.2.1 page 8 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity (4) If through the interactive process the parties agree on an (alternative) accom\u00ad modation that is different than what was originally requested, that should be noted on the RA form. (5) Resources are available to help both the Deciding Official and the individual requesting the accommodation in identifying possible accommodations for sign language interpreters, requests for materials in accessible formats, adaptive technology, and ergonomic or special equipment. See Exhibit 1.20.2-1 and Exhibit 1.20.2-2. 1.20.2.2.2 (06-11-2021) Determining Who Will Handle the Request (1) The Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator (RAC) is responsible for pro\u00ad cessing all requests for reasonable accommodation. Once a request is received by the RAC, they will work closely with the employee or their repre\u00ad sentative, supervisor/manager or in the case of an applicant, HR Specialist to facilitate the reasonable accommodation requests. (2) Deciding Official is responsible for (1) acknowledging the request; (2) explain\u00ad ing to the employee that they will be making the decision on the request for reasonable accommodation; (3) describing what will happen in processing of the request. (i.e. delays and/or extenuating circumstances). See IRM 1.20.2.2.4.2 - Request Involving Extenuating Circumstances. 1.20.2.2.3 (06-1 1-2021) Reassignment as an Accommodation (1) Reassignment to a vacant position for which an employee is qualied, and not just permission to compete for such position, is a reasonable accommodation, and the IRS must consider providing reassignment to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation when it determines that no other reasonable ac\u00ad commodation will permit an employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of their current position. Reassignment will only be considered if: a. There are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of their current position; b. The accommodation does not conflict with a controlling collective bar\u00ad gaining agreement (e.g., the IRS-NTEU National Agreement, mid-term agreements, Letters of Understanding, or local agreements), absent special circumstances; or c. All other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship (2) In considering whether there are positions available for reassignment, the Deciding Official shall work closely with the servicing RAC, Human Resources staff, as well as the individual requesting the accommodation to identify: a. All vacant funded positions at the same or lower grade which the employee can perform with or without an accommodation; and b. All positions which the RAC and the delegated Business Unit Official has reason to believe will become vacant within 60 workdays from the date the search is initiated and for which the employee may be qualied. (3) If there are no suitable vacant positions found within the IRS, the IRS, may consult with Main Treasury on conducting a 30 workdays search for suitable positions throughout the department. Examples of when the IRS would not consult Treasury for suitable positions at other bureaus are: a. Employee has stated that they are not interested in a position outside of the IRS 1.20.2.2.2 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities 1.20.2 page 9 b. Employee is only interested in positions within their POD and the other Treasury Bureaus do not have offices in that location. Note: Informing an employee that they may apply for or otherwise compete for a position does not satisfy the obligation of appropriate officials to review vacancies for positions which the employee is qualied. Appropriate officials should determine if there is another position at the same or lower grade which the employee can perform . Note: Since it may take a minimum of 30 business days to determine whether an appropriate vacant position exists, the Deciding Official and employee should discuss the employee's options during that period, i.e., use of accrued leave, use of unpaid leave, or a temporary assignment. (4) The HR staff/RAC, will focus on positions that are equivalent to the employee's current job in terms of pay and other relevant factors, as well as vacant lower level positions for which the individual is qualied. If an IRS position at a lower grade is identied the Service will consider not lling that position until the Treasury-wide reassignment search is completed. (5) Reassignment may be made to a vacant position outside of the employee's commuting area if the employee is willing to relocate. As with other reassign\u00ad ments not required by management, the IRS shall not pay for the employee's relocation costs unless IRS policy provides for such payments for non-disabled employees. (6) For reassignment to a position across Business Units, the manager in the losing office must coordinate these types of requests with the manager who has authority to effect the employment decision in the gaining office. (7) Reassignment is available only to employees, not to applicants for employ\u00ad ment. 1.20.2.2.4 (06-11-2021) Time Frames for Processing Requests for Reasonable Accommodations (1) .The time necessary to process a request will depend on the nature of the ac\u00ad commodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting documentation. At a minimum, however, requests shall be processed as outlined in IRM 1.20.2.2.4.1 sRequests Not Involving Extenuating Circum\u00ad stances s and IRM 1.20.2.2.4.2 sRequests Involving Extenuating Circumstances.s (2) When a particular reasonable accommodation can be provided in less than the maximum amount of time permitted, failure to provide the accommodation in a prompt manner may result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 C.F .R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(3)(i)(O). (3) The agency will not be expected to adhere to its usual timeliness if an individu\u00ad al's health professional fails to provide needed documentation in a timely manner. See 29 C.F .R. \u00a71614.203(d)(3)(i)(N). (4) The status of pending accommodation requests may be tracked by contacting the assigned Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator. If processing is delayed, the Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator will provide status updates including any extenuating circumstances that justify the delay. Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.2.2.4 page 10 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity 1.20.2.2.4.1 (06-11-2021) Requests Not Involving Extenuating Circumstances (1) If the manager receiving the request is the Deciding Official, they should imme\u00ad diately engage in the interactive discussion with the employee and/or servicing RAS office. (2) If the manager or management official receiving the request is not the Deciding Official, they shall forward the request to the Deciding Official as soon as possible but in no more than ve workdays. (3) If the request does not require obtaining supporting medical information, the request shall be processed and the accommodation, if granted, provided as soon as possible but no more than 20 workdays from the date the request was initially made. Since the Deciding Official may need the full 20 workdays to engage in the interactive process and collect all relevant information about possible accommodations, the Deciding Official should not delay beginning this process. Failure to meet this time frame because a Deciding Official delayed processing the request is not an extenuating circumstance. (4) If the request requires that supporting medical information be obtained to determine whether the individual has a disability and/or to identify the func\u00ad tional limitations, the following will apply: a. The servicing RAC will request the documentation as soon as possible after their receipt of the request for accommodation, but before the expi\u00ad ration of the 20 workday period referred to above. b. The 20 workday period is tolled until necessary medical documentation is received. 1.20.2.2.4.2 (06-11-2021) Requests Involving Extenuating Circumstances (1) When extenuating circumstances are present, the time for processing a request for reasonable accommodation will be extended as deemed necessary, however, such extensions should be rare. All IRS officials are expected to act as quickly as reasonably possible in processing requests and providing accom- modations. Note: Extenuating circumstances might exist when for example an employee with a disability needs to work with equipment on a trial basis to ensure it is effective before the agency buys the equipment, new staff would need to be hired/contracted to fulll the requested accommodation, or a requested ac\u00ad commodation would involve removal of architectural barriers. 1.20.2.2.5 (06-11-2021) Expedited Processing and Interim Accommodations (1) In certain circumstances, a request for reasonable accommodation requires an expedited review and decision in a time frame that is shorter than the 20 workdays discussed above. This includes where a reasonable accommodation is needed: a. T o enable an applicant to apply for a job. Depending on the timetable for receiving applications, conducting interviews, taking tests, and making hiring decisions, there may be a need to expedite a request for reason\u00ad able accommodation in order to ensure that an applicant for employment with a disability has an equal opportunity to apply for a job. Therefore, the IRS needs to move as quickly as possible to make a decision and, if appropriate, provide a reasonable accommodation. b. T o enable an employee to attend a meeting scheduled to occur shortly. For example, an employee may need a sign language interpreter for a meeting scheduled to take place in 5 days. 1.20.2.2.4.1 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities 1.20.2 page 11 (2) When a decision concerning a reasonable accommodation request cannot be made promptly (e.g. when waiting for necessary medical documentation) man\u00ad agement should consider providing an interim accommodation on a temporary basis. (3) Deciding Officials who approve such temporary measures are responsible for assuring that they do not take the place of a permanent accommodation and that all necessary steps to assess the need for or secure the permanent ac\u00ad commodation are being taken. 1.20.2.3 (06-11-2021) Requests for Medical Information (1) In some cases, the disability and need for accommodation will be obvious or otherwise already known to the Deciding Official. In these cases, further medical information will not be sought. However, when a disability and/or need for reasonable accommodation is not obvious or otherwise already known to the Deciding Official, the IRS may require an individual who requests a reason\u00ad able accommodation to provide medical information that is sufficient to explain the nature of the individual's disability, their need for reasonable accommoda\u00ad tion, and how the requested accommodation would assist the individual with applying for a job, performing the essential functions of a job or enjoying the benets and privileges of the workplace. IRS has the right to have medical in\u00ad formation reviewed by a medical expert of the agency's choosing at the agency's expense. Note: Any request for medical information must comply with the Genetic Informa\u00ad tion Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008, as well as the laws, regulations, and guidance referenced in the \"Authority\" section above, and other appli\u00ad cable condentiality statutes. (2) If the Deciding Official believes medical information is necessary to evaluate a request for a reasonable accommodation, they should contact the servicing RAC to obtain the necessary medical documentation to make an accommoda\u00ad tion decision. (3) If a determination is made to seek medical information, the requested informa\u00ad tion should be sufficient to establish that the individual has a disability. Documentation unrelated to the claimed disability should not be requested. Agency requests for medical information will follow the requirements set forth in EEOC's Enforcement Guidance: \"Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act\", available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html. (4) ) If the Human Resources Specialist believes that medical information is necessary in order to evaluate a request for reasonable accommodation from an applicant, they will consult with the servicing RAC for guidance. (5) If a determination is made to seek medical information, an employee will be asked to provide Part III-A/B of the Reasonable Accommodation Request, Form 13661 to their health care practitioner, social worker, or rehabilitation counselor to substantiate their functional limitations and that the individual has a disability. (6) Once the medical documentation is received, the RAC will evaluate the docu\u00ad mentation, and if the RAC deems necessary will consult with Federal Occupational Health (FOH). If the information provided by the health care pro- Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.2.3 page 12 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity fessional (or the information volunteered by the individual requesting the accommodation) is insufficient to enable the Deciding Official to determine whether an accommodation is appropriate, the RAC will request reasonable supplemental documentation. a. First, however, the RAC should explain to the individual seeking the ac\u00ad commodation, in specic terms, why the medical information provided is insufficient, what additional information is needed, and why the informa\u00ad tion is necessary for a determination of the reasonable accommodation request. b. The individual may then ask the health care practitioner or other appro\u00ad priate medical professional to provide the missing information. (7) The individual requesting the accommodation may agree to sign a limited release, giving the RAS Office permission to submit a list of specic questions to the individual's health care professional or contact the individual's doctor. Agency officials outside of RAS Office should not contact a health care profes\u00ad sional directly. (8) In some cases, the individual requesting the accommodation will supply medical information directly to the Deciding Official without being asked. In these cases, the Deciding Official will forward the documentation in a sealed envelope or zip le to the RAC immediately to determine if documentation is sufficient. See the section on Condentiality and Disclosure for instructions on storage of medical information. Note: All medical documentation should be submitted to the Servicing RAC . (9) If the individual requesting accommodation does not provide appropriate docu\u00ad mentation or does not cooperate in the Agency's efforts to obtain such documentation the Agency may deny the requested accommodation. (10) IRS officials who gain access to an employee's or an applicant for employ\u00ad ment's personal medical information will be reminded that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and ADAAA requires that they keep this information strictly con\u00ad dential and share it only with others who have a need to know. This information may be disclosed only to those individuals listed in the sCondenti\u00ad ality and Disclosures section. Note: Whenever medical documentation is transmitted among authorized IRS personnel it must be done in a secure manner such as conveyed in a sealed envelope or via a zipped electronic le. 1.20.2.4 (06-24-2013) Condentiality and Disclosure (1) All medical information, including information about functional limitations and reasonable accommodation needs, obtained in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation must be kept condential. The information shall be kept in les separate from the individual's personnel le. In addition, employees who obtain or receive such information are strictly bound by these condentiality requirements. The servicing RAC will maintain custody of all records obtained or created during the processing of a request for reasonable accommodation, including medical records, and will respond to all requests for disclosure of the records. The information may be disclosed to the following individuals: 1.20.2.4 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities 1.20.2 page 13 a. Deciding Officials, supervisors and managers who need to know may be told about necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and the necessary accommodation(s), but medical information should only be disclosed if absolutely necessary. b. First aid and safety personnel, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment or special arrangements in emergency situ\u00ad ations such as building evacuations. c. Government officials when the information is necessary to investigate compliance with the Rehabilitation Act. d. In certain circumstances, to workers' compensation offices or insurance carriers e. Treasury and IRS legal counsel in connection with providing legal advice to agency officials f. Those Agency Officials with the need to know the information to carry out official duties of their position (2) Whenever medical information is disclosed, the individual disclosing the infor\u00ad mation must inform the recipients of the information about the condentiality requirements that apply. Note: The Rehabilitation Act condentiality obligation is not limited to the medical diagnosis. The fact that someone has requested an accommodation, or that something is being provided as an accommodation, also constitutes con\u00ad dential medical information. Case Illustration: Tyson v. United States Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01992086 (Aug. 23, 2002). Agency violated Rehabilitation Act by disclosing com\u00ad plainant's medical condition and symptoms in a letter mailed to other installations seeking a vacancy to which he could be reassigned. Although the other managers needed to be alerted to complainant's work restrictions and his need for accommo\u00ad dation, they had no need to know his condition or symptoms. (3) Nondisclosure of GINA Protected Information: The Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic infor\u00ad mation of employees or their family members, except as specically allowed by this law. T o comply with GINA, the request for medical information must state that the agency is asking that genetic information not be provided when re\u00ad sponding to the request for medical information, unless the information is allowable as explained below: a. Genetic information: as dened by GINA, includes information concerning the manifestation of disease/disorder in family members \"family medical history\", information about an individual's or family member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual's family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services. b. Rehabilitation Act: The general prohibition against requesting or requiring genetic information does not apply where an employer requests docu\u00ad mentation to support a request for reasonable accommodation as long as the request for documentation is lawful. Such a request is lawful only Cat. No. 49442G (06-11-2021) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.2.4 page 14 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity where the disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious; the documentation required contains no more information than what is sufficient to establish that an individual has a disability and needs rea\u00ad sonable accommodation; and the documentation relates only to the impairment that the individual claims to be a disability that requires rea\u00ad sonable accommodation. (See 29 CFR.1635.8(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), and 29 CFR 1,635.8(b)(1)(i)(B)). 1.20.2.5 (06-11-2021) Granting or Denying a Request for Accommodation (1) As soon as the Deciding Official determines that a request for reasonable ac\u00ad commodation is granted, including alternative accommodations agreed upon during the interactive dialogue, the Deciding Official shall complete Part II of IRS RA Form 13661, and provide a copy (i.e. including in an accessible format if requested) to the requester of the accommodation with a copy to the servic\u00ad ing RAC. The decision shall describe in plain language the accommodation(s) granted. (2) As soon as the Deciding Official determines that a request for reasonable ac\u00ad commodation is denied, the Deciding Official shall complete Part IV of IRS RA Form 13661 and provide a copy (i.e. including in an accessible format if requested) to the requester of the accommodation with a copy to the servicing RAC. The explanation for the denial should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specic reasons for the denial. (3) Where the Deciding Official has denied a specic requested accommodation, but offered an alternative accommodation in its place which was not agreed to during the interactive process, Part IV of the Reasonable Accommodation Request, Form 13661 should explain both the reasons for the denial of the specic requested accommodation and the reasons that the Deciding Official believes the chosen accommodation will be effective. (4) The written decision must include specic reasons for the denial of a reason\u00ad able accommodation. Explanation(s) may include the following: a. Requestor does not meet the denition of an individual with a disability) or the medical documentation is inadequate to establish the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation. b. The requested accommodation would not be effective. c. Providing the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship. Before reaching this determination, the Deciding Of ficial must have explored whether other effective accommodations exist which would not impose undue hardship and therefore can be provided. Note: A determination of undue hardship means that the IRS nds that a specic accommodation would result in signicant difficulty or expense, or would fundamentally alter the nature of the IRS opera\u00ad tions. When evaluating budgetary or administrative concerns to determine if undue hardship exists, the IRS will follow the standards outlined in the \"Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\" Undue hardship because of budgetary concerns must be assessed in relationship to the entire IRS budget and workforce, rather than in relationship to the parameters of the budget or workforce of an operating division or functional unit. d. The requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential function. 1.20.2.5 Internal Revenue Manual Cat.

The requested accommodation would require the lowering of a perfor\u00ad mance or production standard. (5) The written decision denying a request for reasonable accommodation must also inform the individual that they have the right to le an EEO complaint and may have rights to pursue Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or union grievance procedures. The notice must also explain the Agency's procedures available for dispute resolution. (1) An employee seeking reconsideration should appeal to the Deciding Official within fteen (15) workdays of receiving the written denial. The employee may present additional information in support of their request. Any request for reconsideration received after fteen (15) workdays of the denial will be treated as a new request for a reasonable accommodation. This new request will not require the employee to resubmit any documentation previously submitted in a prior request. Rather, this \"new request\" only affects the time- frames for processing in compliance with the negotiated procedures. The Deciding Official will respond to the appeal within ve (5) workdays of the receipt of the appeal. a. The fteen (15) workdays deadline will commence when the employee requesting reasonable accommodation has received the denial of their request for reasonable accommodation. b. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"received\" means when the employee is handed the denial decision in-person or when the individual signs for mail with return receipt requested. (2) If the Deciding Official does not reverse the initial denial, the employee may initiate a second and nal appeal within 15 workdays of receiving the Deciding Official's denial of the request for reconsideration. The appeal shall be decided by the Business Unit Commissioner/Chief or their executive-level designee. The BU Commissioner/Chief or their executive-level designee may consult with the Chief Diversity Officer or their designee prior to rendering a nal decision. A response to the nal appeal will be issued to the employee within 15 workdays of receipt of the nal appeal request. (3) Employees should follow up any oral reconsideration requests in writing. If the employee chooses not to submit a written reconsideration request, the request must be documented in writing and dated by the receiving official, the RAC, or other responsible individual. (4) Pursuing this appeal process, including seeking reconsideration from the Deciding Official or ling a second and nal appeal under this process will toll the time limits for initiating claims under the Parties' collective bargaining agreement. However, seeking reconsideration will not toll statutory time frames for ling an EEO complaint or Merit Systems Protection Board appeal. (5) For an employee to invoke their right to appeal within the fteen (15) workday timeframe, they must simply notify, orally or in writing, the point of contact of their decision to appeal. Within the fteen (15) workday timeframe, the employee must only invoke their right to reconsideration; the employee does not have to prepare the content of the appeal within that time. The point of contact will be identied at the time of the denial decision. Cat.

The policies and requirements described in these procedures are in addition to statutory and collective bargaining protections for persons with disabilities and the remedies they provide for the denial of requests for reason\u00ad able accommodation. Requirements governing the initiation of statutory and collective bargaining claims, including time frames for ling such claims, remain unchanged. (2) An individual who chooses to pursue statutory or collective bargaining remedies for denial of reasonable accommodation must comply with the following: a. EEO Complaint -Contact an EEO counselor within 45 days from the date of receipt of the written notice of denial. b. Collective Bargaining Claim -File a grievance in accordance with the provisions of the controlling Collective Bargaining Agreement (under the IRS-NTEU National Agreement, Article 41, a grievance must be led within 15 workdays of the denial); or c. Merit System Protection Board Appeal -Initiate an appeal within 30 days of an appealable adverse action as dened in 5 CFR \u00a71201.154. 1.20.2.8 (06-24-2013) Collective Bargaining Obligations (1) As called for in the EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommoda\u00ad tion and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (which has also been applied to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973), prior to granting any reasonable accommodation that would violate any collective bar\u00ad gaining agreement between the IRS and NTEU (e.g., the IRS-NTEU National Agreement, mid-term agreements or LOUs, local agreements, etc.) the Service will notify NTEU at the appropriate level and seek to negotiate, in good faith, a variance to the agreement to allow the accommodation. The parties are en\u00ad couraged to work cooperatively to reach such agreements, but only if they do not unduly burden the expectations or rights of other workers. (2) The Service acknowledges that under the ADA 2008 Amendments Act (ADAAA) and Rehabilitation Act case law, accommodations that conflict with collectively bargained seniority systems are unreasonable, absent special cir\u00ad cumstances. (3) The Service will notify and bargain, to the extent required by law, with NTEU prior to implementing any reasonable accommodation that would require more than de minimis change in other bargaining unit employees' conditions of em\u00ad ployment. (4) If granting a reasonable accommodation would conflict with a collectively bargained agreement, or would necessitate a change in other employees' con\u00ad ditions of employment, and thus require negotiations, consistent with paragraph 3 above, the Service will consider such situations as presenting ex\u00ad tenuating circumstances (as dened in the RA procedures) requiring a delay in implementation of the accommodation, and perhaps requiring the Service to take temporary measures. (5) The Service will consider reasonable accommodations that do not conflict with collective bargaining agreements or require changes to other employees' con\u00ad ditions of employment before proposing or approving reasonable accommodations that would cause such conflicts or changes. 1.20.2.7 Internal Revenue Manual Cat.

The Service shall make rea\u00ad sonable accommodations for all qualied applicants or employees with physical or mental disabilities in accordance with law . The Service shall comply with all appropriate rules, regulations, and directives. Executives, managers, and su\u00ad pervisors shall create a positive work environment that will encourage employees with disabilities to maximize and reach their full potential. (2) The Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion's (EDI) Reasonable Accommoda\u00ad tion Services (RAS) Section is responsible for processing all requests from IRS employees for Personal Assistance Services (assistance with feeding or dressing oneself, using the restroom - See the Denitions section below for further explanation).

For example, someone providing PAS might assist someone with getting into or out of a vehicle at the worksite. Note: PAS does not include medical services such as administering injections or monitoring blood sugar.

Determination of undue hardship is always made on a case-by- case basis, considering factors such as the nature and cost to provide PAS needed and the impact of the PAS on the operations of the Department. An undue hardship based on cost should rarely be an issue. The inability to nd a PAS provider with the security clearance level of the employee may, under some circum\u00ad stances, be sufficiently difficult as to constitute an undue hardship. 1.20.5.2 (06-10-2022) Requesting Personal Assistance Services (1) An employee (not an applicant) with a targeted disability may, orally or in writing, request assistance with daily life activities that the individual cannot perform because of the targeted disability. The request does not have to use any special words, such as PAS, Section 501, disability, EEOC's regula\u00ad tions or Rehabilitation Act. Requests for PAS may be made to any Receiving Official, including an employee's immediate supervisor; a supervisor or manager in his/her immediate chain of command, or the EDI Office. Note: To expedite processing of the request it is recommended that the request include: the employee's name; his/her position and employing organization; his/her contact information; his/her targeted disability; what type of PAS is required, as well as where and when PAS would be needed. (2) A family member, friend, health care professional, or other representative may request PAS on behalf of an employee with a targeted disability. If possible, the employee with the targeted disability should be contacted to conrm that they in fact want PAS. The employee with the targeted disability may decline to make a request or refuse to accept services. (3) An official to whom a request for PAS is made should immediately refer the request to EDI. (Referrals may be emailed to *RA Form 13661). (4) EDI is responsible for (1) acknowledging the request; (2) explaining to the employee that management will be making the decision on the request for Personal Assistance Services; (3) describing what will happen in processing of 1.20.5.2 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 92758H (06-10-2022) Policies and Procedures for Personal Assistance Services 1.20.5 page 5 the request. (i.e. delays and/or extenuating circumstances), and (4) within two business days of EDI's receiving it ensuring the Deciding Official is aware of the request.. 1.20.5.3 (06-10-2022) The Interactive Process (1) Communication is a priority throughout the entire process. (2) The Deciding Official (determined by the employing Business Unit) involved in the Personal Assistance Services process should consult with EDI. The official involved in the interactive process should record their activities. (3) The employee requesting the Personal Assistance Services (and any chosen representative) should also participate, to the extent possible, in helping to identify the skill set required from the Personal Assistance Service provider. (4) On-going communication is particularly important where the specic need or skill set, or extenuating circumstance is unclear. In those cases where the Personal Assistance Services that should be provided are clear, extensive dis\u00ad cussions are not necessary. Even so, the Deciding Official and requesting individual should discuss the matter to make sure that there is a full exchange of relevant information. (5) If after engaging in the interactive process the parties cannot agree on the Personal Assistance Services that should be provided, the Deciding Official should offer the individual the Personal Assistance Services that the Deciding Official has determined to be effective. If through the interactive process the parties agree on a Personal Assistance Services (alternative) that is different than what was originally requested, that should be documented. During the interactive process or pending procurement of PAS an interim arrangement might be necessary to meet the employee's needs. 1.20.5.4 (06-10-2022) Granting Personal Assistance Services and Time Frames for Processing Requests (1) When the Deciding Official determines Personal Assistance Services will be provided, the decision should be communicated in writing within ve business days to the individual by the Deciding Official. EDI shall take a proactive approach to ensure PAS providers have the necessary skill sets for the services required. If the Personal Assistance Services cannot be provided im\u00ad mediately EDI shall inform the individual of the projected time frame for providing the Personal Assistance Services. (2) PAS providers may be procured via a Blanket Purchase Agreement estab\u00ad lished by the Department of the Treasury and funded by the IRS. A request for a specic PAS provider (e.g., a family member or a PAS provider with whom the employee has previously worked) will be considered and, where the PAS provider is dedicated to a single employee, given primary consideration to the extent permitted by law. (3) All PAS providers must satisfy applicable security clearance and background investigation requirements. These requirements apply to any PAS provider de\u00ad livering services on a temporary or indenite basis if the provider, due to their presence in the workplace (IRS facility, telework location etc.), might see or hear tax, sensitive but unclassied, or personally identiable information the following are required: : a moderate risk background investigation; a non\u00ad disclosure agreement; UNAX training etc. (Refer to Publication 4812 for contractor requirements).

(1) The time necessary to process a request will depend on the nature of the request and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting documentation. At a minimum, however, requests shall be processed as outlined in Requests Not Involving Extenuating Circumstances and Requests Involving Extenuating Circumstances. 1.20.5.4.1.1 (06-10-2022) Personal Assistance Services Requests Not Involving Extenuating Circumstances (1) If the manager receiving the request is the Deciding Official they should promptly, but in no more than two business days, engage in the interactive process with the employee and the EDI POC. If the manager or management official receiving the request, is not the Deciding Official, they shall forward the request to the Deciding Official as soon as possible but in no more than two business days. (2) If the request does not require that supporting medical information be obtained, the request shall be processed and if approved, should be provided as soon as possible but no more than 30 business days from the date of the request. Since the Deciding Official may need the full 30 business days to engage in the interactive process and collect all relevant information about possible provided PAS, they should not delay beginning this process. Failure to meet this time frame solely because a Deciding Official delayed processing the request is not an extenuating circumstance. (3) If the request requires that supporting medical information be obtained to determine whether the individual has a T argeted Disability requiring PAS EDI will request the medical documentation and the above-referenced 30 business day timeframe will be tolled until the needed documentation is received. The IRS recognizes that the need for documentation may not become apparent until after the interactive process has begun. 1.20.5.4.1.2 (06-10-2022) Personal Assistance Services Requests Involving Extenuating Circumstances (1) When extenuating circumstances (e.g. the PAS provider will have access to classied or sensitive information and will require a specic type of background investigation or security clearance; the request requires supporting medical documentation) are present, the time for processing a PAS request will be extended as deemed necessary. All IRS officials are expected to act as quickly as reasonably possible in processing requests and providing PAS. (2) Where extenuating circumstances are present, EDI shall notify the employee requesting PAS, in writing, of the reason for the delay, and the approximate date on which a decision, or provision of the PAS, is expected. Any further de\u00ad velopments or changes should also be communicated promptly to the employee. (3) If there is a delay in providing an approved PAS, the Deciding Official must decide whether temporary measures can be taken to assist the employee. This could include providing the requested services on a temporary basis with limited access to facilities/information by PAS providers. 1.20.5.4.2 (06-10-2022) Expedited Process (1) In certain circumstances, a request for PAS requires an expedited review and decision in a time frame that is shorter than the 30 business days discussed above (e.g. to enable an employee to attend a meeting scheduled to occur shortly). Therefore, the Agency will need to take appropriate steps as quickly as possible to determine, if appropriate, to provide PAS. 1.20.5.4.1 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 92758H (06-10-2022) Policies and Procedures for Personal Assistance Services 1.20.5 page 7 1.20.5.5 (06-10-2022) Denial of Personal Assistance Services Requests 1.20.5.6 (06-10-2022) Appeal Process (1) When the Deciding Official denies a request for PAS, they must notify the employee/representative in writing (with a copy to EDI) of the decision. The explanation for the denial should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specic reasons for the denial. (2) The explanation may include the following: Individual requiring PAS is not an employee Employee does not have a targeted disability, as dened in OPM SF\u00ad 256, or the targeted disability does not create a need for PAS The medical documentation is inadequate to establish the individual has a targeted disability and/or needs Personal Assistance Services The requested Personal Assistance Services would not be effective Providing the requested Personal Assistance Services would result in undue hardship (before reaching this determination, the Deciding Official must have explored whether other effective measures exist which would not impose undue hardship and therefore can be provided) Employee is not able to perform the essential functions of the job, even with PAS and any reasonable accommodations Employee would create a direct threat to safety on the job, even with PAS and any reasonable accommodation (3) The written decision denying a request for Personal Assistance Services must also inform the individual of EEO complaint, Merit Systems Protection Board and/or union grievance procedures. (4) The notice must also explain the Agency's procedures available for dispute resolution. (1) An employee who based on new medical documentation or other pertinent in\u00ad formation seeks reconsideration by the Deciding Official of a denial should make such a request to the Deciding Official within ten (10) business days of receiving the written denial. The employee must present additional documentation/information in support of their request. Any request for reconsid\u00ad eration received after ten (10) business days of the denial will be treated as a new request for Personal Assistance Services. This new request will not require the applicant to resubmit any documentation previously submitted in a prior request. Rather, this \"new request\" only affects the timeframes for pro\u00ad cessing in compliance with the procedures. The Deciding Official will respond to the request within ve (5) business days of the receipt of the request for re\u00ad consideration. (2) If due to the absence of new medical documentation or other pertinent infor\u00ad mation reconsideration was not requested the employee may initiate a nal appeal within ten business days of receiving the denial of the request for PAS, or if upon request for reconsideration the Deciding Official does not reverse the initial denial the employee may initiate a nal appeal within ten business days of receiving the decision not to reverse the denial. (3) The appeal shall be decided by the Business Unit Commissioner/Chief or his/ her executive-level designee. The Business Unit Commissioner Chief or his/her executive-level designee may consult with the Chief Diversity Officer or their designee prior to rendering a nal decision. The Business Unit Commissioner/ Cat. No. 92758H (06-10-2022) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.5.6 1.20.5.7 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 92758H (06-10-2022) page 8 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Chief or his/her executive-level designee will issue a response to the nal appeal within ten business days of receipt of the appeal. (4) Individuals should follow up any oral reconsideration/appeal requests in writing. If the individual chooses not to submit a written reconsideration/appeal request, the request must be documented in writing and dated by the receiving official, the RAS POC or other responsible individual. (5) Pursuing this appeal process, including seeking reconsideration from the Deciding Official or ling an appeal under this process, will toll the time limits for initiating claims under the Parties' collective bargaining agreement. However, pursuing this appeal/reconsideration process will not toll statutory time frames for ling an EEO complaint or Merit Systems Protection Board appeal. 1.20.5.7 (06-10-2022) Relationship of Procedures to Statutory and Collective Bargaining Claims (1) Executive Order 13164 does not create new rights for employees or applicants for employment; nor does it limit an individual's rights under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The policies and requirements described in these procedures are in addition to statutory and collective bargaining protections for persons with disabilities. Requirements governing the initiation of statutory and collective bargaining claims, including time frames for ling such claims, remain unchanged. (2) An individual who chooses to pursue statutory or collective bargaining remedies for denial of Personal Assistance Services Request must comply with the following: a. EEO Complaint - Contact an EEO counselor within 45 calendar days from the date of receipt of the written notice of denial; b. Collective Bargaining Claim - File a grievance in accordance with the pro\u00ad visions of the controlling Collective Bargaining Agreement (under the IRS\u00ad NTEU National Agreement, Article 41, a grievance must be led within 15 workdays of the denial); OR c. Merit System Protection Board Appeal - Initiate an appeal within 30 days of an appealable adverse action as dened in 5 CFR \u00a71201.154. 1.20.5.8 (06-10-2022) Condentiality and Disclosure (1) All medical information, including information about PAS needs, obtained in connection with a request for PAS must be kept condential. The information shall be kept in les separate from the individual's personnel le. In addition, employees who obtain or receive such information are bound by these con\u00ad dentiality requirements. EDI will maintain custody of all records obtained or created during the processing of a PAS request, including medical records, and will respond to all requests for disclosure of the records. The information may be disclosed to the following individuals: a. Deciding Officials, supervisors and managers who need to know may be told about necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee, but medical information should only be disclosed if absolutely necessary. b. First aid and safety personnel, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment or special arrangements in emergency situ\u00ad ations such as building evacuations. c. Government officials when the information is necessary to investigate compliance with the Rehabilitation Act. d. In certain circumstances, to workers' compensation offices or insurance carriers Policies and Procedures for Personal Assistance Services 1.20.5 page 9 e. Treasury and IRS legal counsel in connection with providing legal advice to agency officials. f. Those Agency Officials with the need to know the information to carry out official duties of their position. (2) For disclosure to other individuals, obtain written consent from the employee. Use Form 15293, IRS Privacy Act Disclosure Consent. (3) Whenever medical information is disclosed, the individual disclosing the infor\u00ad mation must inform the recipients of the information about the condentiality requirements that apply. Note: The Rehabilitation Act condentiality obligation is not limited to the medical diagnosis. The fact that someone has requested a PAS, or that something is being provided as PAS, also constitutes condential medical information. 1.20.5.9 (06-10-2022) Nondisclosure of GINA Protected Information (1) The Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information of employees or their family members, except as specically allowed by this law. T o comply with GINA, the request for medical information must state that the agency is asking that genetic information not be provided when responding to the request for medical information, unless the information is allowable as explained below: Genetic information: as dened by GINA, includes information concerning the manifestation of disease/disorder in family members \"family medical history\", information about an individual's or family member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an indi\u00ad vidual's family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services. (2) The general prohibition against requesting or requiring genetic information does not apply where an employer requests documentation to support a request for PAS as long as the request for documentation is lawful. Such a request is lawful only where the targeted disability and/or the need for PAS is not obvious; the documentation required contains no more information than what is sufficient to establish that an individual has a targeted disability and needs PAS; and the documentation relates only to the impairment that the indi\u00ad vidual claims to be a targeted disability that requires PAS. 1.20.5.10 (06-10-2022) Collective Bargaining Obligations (1) As called for in the EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommoda\u00ad tion and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (which has also been applied to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973), prior to providing Personal Assistance Services Request that would violate any collec\u00ad tive bargaining agreement between the IRS and NTEU (e.g., the IRS-NTEU National Agreement, mid-term agreements or LOUs, local agreements, etc.) the Service will notify NTEU at the appropriate level and seek to negotiate, in good faith, a variance to the agreement to allow the Personal Assistance Services Request . The parties are encouraged to work cooperatively to reach such agreements, but only if they do not unduly burden the expectations or rights of other workers. Cat. No. 92758H (06-10-2022) Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.5.10 page 10 1.20 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity (2) The Service acknowledges that under the ADA 2008 Amendments Act (ADAAA) and Rehabilitation Act case law, providing Personal Assistance Services Request that conflict with collectively bargained seniority systems are unreasonable, absent special circumstances. (3) The Service will notify and bargain, to the extent required by law, with NTEU prior to implementing any Personal Assistance Services Request that would require more than de minimis change in other bargaining unit employees' con\u00ad ditions of employment. (4) If granting a Personal Assistance Services Request would conflict with a col\u00ad lectively bargained agreement, or would necessitate a change in other employees' conditions of employment, and thus require negotiations, consistent with paragraph 3 above, the Service will consider such situations as presenting extenuating circumstances (as dened in the PAS procedures) requiring a delay in implementation of the Personal Assistance Services Request , and perhaps requiring the Service to take temporary measures. (5) The Service will consider Personal Assistance Services Requests that do not conflict with collective bargaining agreements or require changes to other employees' conditions of employment before proposing or approving Personal Assistance Services Requests that would cause such conflicts or changes. 1.20.5.10 Internal Revenue Manual Cat. No. 92758H (06-10-2022) 1.2.1.2.7 (02-22-2021) Policy Statement 1-37 (Rev. 1), A lternative Dispute Resolution for Equal Employment Opportunity Claims (1) Alternative Dispute Resolution for Equal Employment Op portunity Claims (2) The Inte rnal Revenue Service (IRS) is committed to early and voluntary resolution of claims of employment discrimination in o rder to foster a harmonious and productive working environment. The IRS recogniz es that mediation and other forms of Alt ernative Dispute Resolution (AD R) are valuable mechanisms for resolving Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) claims and related concerns. Acc ordingly, it is the policy of t he IRS to offer ADR for all EEO claims except in cases involving criminal activ ity and managerial actions taken as a result of a 1203 violation. (3) All IRS managers a nd supervisors have a duty to cooperate in ADR as a part of the EEO process. During the E EO process, the IRS will offer to engage in ADR with the employee. Once ADR i s offered and the employee ele cts to participate, the accused manage r has a duty to cooperate, like any witness, in the EEO ADR process, but may not b e the agency official that ha s settlement authority. Management officials r epresenting the Service in ADR must do so in good faith and must either have authority, or have immediate ac cess to an official with authority, to ent er into a binding settlement agreement. The management official representing the Service in ADR and/or with settlement authority cannot be an individual whom the employee has alleged is responsible for the discriminato ry action(s). As ADR is intende d to facilitate voluntary resolution, no participant in ADR during the EEO process shall be compelled against his/her will to compromise claims or make bin ding commitments. (4) In order to derive the maximum benefit from and ensure conf idence in the ADR process, all ADR sessions shall be conducted using a certif ied mediator or otherwise appropriately trained third party neutral person. The IRS regards the Department of the Treasury Sha red Neutrals Program as a via ble source for trained, neutral third parties. (5) The IRS shall collect data c oncerning the ADR process inclu ding but not limited to: the number of ADR se ssions offered; the number of A DR offers accepted; and the source of the neutral thir d parties used in e ach ADR session. The IRS shall also survey or otherwise offer ADR sessi on participants the opportunity to provide feedback on the effecti veness of the ADR session, including the effect iveness of the neutral third party utilized. (6) This policy supersedes all previous Alternative Dispute Res olution policies. (7) Signed: Jeffrey J.

Vision A diverse and inclusive IRS that understands and adapts our services to the unique and ever- changing needs of taxpayers. Purpose This SOP outlines procedures for providing pre-complaint counseling and for processing EEO complaints. See exhibit 1 for A flowchart of the complaint process. In addition, specific terms related to the process can be found in exhibit 2. Scope The procedures discussed in this guide are in tended to comply with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations found in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a71614. Filing Periods and Computation of Time All periods in this guide are stated in calendar days (except where noted). Legal Authority \u00beTitle VII of the Civil Righ ts Act of 1964, as amended The Age Discrimination in Employmen t Act (ADEA) of 1967, as amended The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended The Equal Pay Act (EPA) of 1963, as amended The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Executive Order 13145 of February 8, 2000 (Genetic Information in Hiring and Promoting) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Sexu al Orientation and Gender Identity) Executive Order 13152 of May 2, 2000 (Parental Status) Executive Order 13839 of May 22, 2018 (Merit System Principles) Page 4 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS These statutes prohibit discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and physical or mental disability; and they prohibit retaliation for prior participation in activities protected by the statutes. EEOC Regulations The EEOC is responsible for developing, issuing, an d enforcing the complaint processing regulations of these acts for all executive departments and age ncies, including the U.S. Postal Service. These regulations are found at 29 CFR \u00a71614.101 et seq. Page 5 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS ROLE OF THE EEO COUNSELOR Highlighted below are important aspects of the counselor's role to keep in mind in order to create the best chance or opportunity for reso lution at the informal stage. \u00beJob Knowledge EEO Counselors are expected to be knowledgeable and to stay current regarding changes and trends in the areas of EEO and diversity. However, when educating counselees, it is important that technical job knowledge does not appear as an attempt to influence the counselee to accept or reject specific resolution- or withdrawal-related ac tions. This also speaks to Counselor's role and responsibility to be perceived as neutral in the counseling process. As a result of this challenging balance, EEO Co unselors should be skilled at sharing their job knowledge while leaving the decision -making process up to the counsel ee. This is true even when a counselor may not agree with counselee's decision(s). \u00beEmotional Intelligence Emotional Intelligence (EI) is described as the ability to monitor a person's own and other people's emotions, to distinguish between different emot ions, label emotions appropriately and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior. In EEO counseling, this means separating the counsel or's feelings and emotions from the conflict that may be occurring between the parties. This can on ly happen if the counselor first acknowledges his/her own feelings, emotions or personal thoughts . Once this happens, the counselor is in a better position to assist the parties in resolving their issues. \u00beCommunication There are two aspects of communication in the EEO pre-complaint process. The first aspect involves the ability of the EEO Counselor to effectively communicate with both parties. The other aspect involves the EEO Counselor's ability to open the lines of communication between the parties. Both are equally important. Ultimately, the EEO Counselor cannot force the parties to communicate. However, the counselor has much more control over the communication between himself/herself and the parties. This is a critical first step to opening the lines of communicati on between the parties. Unless the EEO Counselor communicates effectively with the parties about th e issues, it is unlikely that the parties will communicate effectively with each other. Page 6 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS \u00beNeutrality In the context of EEO counseling, neutrality means not having a vested interest in the outcome of a dispute and not supporting one side in a dispute in favor of the other. Counselors should not attempt to dissuade individuals from engaging in the counseling process and, once in the process, nor should they attempt to persuade individuals to settle, withdraw or to move forward to the formal process. It is important to note that neutrality is largely a matter of perception. Perceptions of neutrality, or lack thereof, can be based on such things as language choice, how discussion topics are approached, tone of voice, etc. The best way to give the correct impression about neutrality is to be truly neutral. \u00beProfessionalism Individuals who seek EEO counseling are ofte n upset and emotional. Therefore, they may not communicate with the counselor in a polite and courteous manner. Regardless of how a counselee speaks to a counselor, the counselor should always respond professionally. In order to avoid dealing with counselees in an unprofessional manner, counselors should consider the following: 1) do not take the counselee's beha vior personally, 2) model the behavior that is desired, and 3) upset counselees normally calm do wn at some point, which means there will likely be other opportunities for a more calm and ration al discussion. If necessary, consider rescheduling the call to allow the Counselee an opportunity to calm down. \u00beFollow-Up and Follow Through When a counselee seeks assistance from an EEO professional, there is an expectation that the professional will provide frequent and informative updates. Custome rs also expect that time frames will be adhered to and commitments will be kept. When this does not happen, the credibility of the EEO complaint process is at risk and the likelih ood of a successful resolution is diminished. Page 7 Day Initial contact with Customer via email from *EEO@IRS.Gov 1-2 After contact has been converted to an informal complaint, TM receives and assigns to Counselor for processing. 1-2 EEO Counselor conducts initial interview 1-2 After Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is offered, Counselee is given 2 business days to decide. If ADR is elected, ADR mediation is sche duled within 10 days and case is extended by no more than 60 days. If ADR is not elected, complaint will be counseled traditionally. 3-10 IRS ADR Policy requires management to participate in mediation when the employee makes the ADR Election. All attempted declinations by management must be elevated to the TM for follow up. This includes untimely responses by managers. EEO Counselor interviews and limited inquir y with appropriate Parties in dispute. 5-20 \u00be Facts collected from interviews with parties and shared with TM. \u00beDiscuss with TM to identify concerns/liability, potential resolution terms and next steps. 5-20 TM and Counselor discussion completed 5-20 TM and/or EEO Counselor elevates to appropriate highest-level Resolution official necessary for resolution consideration. (Draft potent ial resolution agreement, if necessary.) 20- 60 EEO Counselor prepares extension, withdrawal and Notice of Right to File (NORTF.) 25- 60 TM reviews draft resolution agr eement to ensure terms are measurable. TM reviews Report of Counseling (ROC.) 26- 60 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS SECTION 1| TIME FRAMES, TCTS AND EEO FORMS o Processing Time Frames In traditional counseling, the final interview should occur within 30 days of the initiation of EEO counseling, unless the counselee consents to an extension, which should not exceed 60 days. The unavailability of the EEO Counselor to meet with the counselee after the initial contact does not toll the 30-day counseling period. Note: Notify the Territory Manager (TM) immediately if there are delays in the process. Sample Traditional Counseling Activities - Day 1 to Day 30 Page 8 If resolution agreement has Arti cle 8 implications, see Section 4.2.7. Counselor will prepare Article 8 email for TM with completed Articl e 8 form and copy of resolution agreement. (If resolution has monetary implications re fer to Business Unit settlement authority) Secure signatures for Resolution Agreement 26- 60 27- 60 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS o Processing Cases in Treasury Complaint Tracking System (TCTS) TCTS is the Treasury Department's official reposi tory for all EEO administrative complaints. For the informal EEO complaint stage, IRS EDI territory offi ces must use TCTS to track EEO contacts and the EEO counseling process, as well as the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process. All relevant EEO counseling documents must be uploade d into TCTS once Notice of Right to File has been issued so there is no delay in the Office of Civil Rights and Diversity's (OCRD) ability to start the formal complaint process if the counselee files a formal complaint. This documentation should be uploaded regardless of whether counselee pursues a formal complaint. o EEO Forms Another critical aspect of EEO co unseling is the use of the correct forms. Below is a listing of EEO forms. The most current versions of these forms are available on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site . \u0083EEO Contact Intake Form (Rev:11/2019) \u0083Notice of Rights and Responsibilities \u0083Representation/Anonymity Form \u0083EEO Counselor Neutrality Card \u0083Report of Counseling \u0083Traditional Extension All relevant events and dates associated with EEO counseling and the informal ADR processes should be entered in TCTS by EEO Counselor s within 1-2 business days of the occurrence of those events or actions.

It is important to note the date of contact as OCRD will use this information to determine whether timely contact was made with an EEO counselor, and may impact whether the claim(s) are accepted or dismissed for formal processing (counseling must be initiated within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory event or 45 days from when the counselee became aware of the alleged discriminatory event.) o Case Assignment and TCTS Update ACTION Territory Manager (TM) EEO Counselor Within 1-2 Days of converting to informal 1. TM assigns pre-complaint. Within 1-2 Days 1. Once assignment received, counselor schedules and conducts initial interview and updates TCTS. o Initial Contact Procedures These procedures pertain to the responsibilities of employees to clarify the internal process for handling contacts and converting th em to pre-complaint cases. All contacts made with EEO Counselors should be updated in TCTS. These procedures are based on CFR 1614 an d MD 110 regulations. \u0083Definition of a Contact A contact is communication via walk in, email, telephone or correspondence in which an Employee, Applicant for Employment, or Former Employee, referred to hereafter as the counselee, wants information from an EEO professional about an employment matter they feel may be discriminatory. In EDI, an EEO professional is an EEO Counselor, Manager, or any GS-260 series employee. When a counselee is placed with an EEO professional, they should receive a thorough explanation of the key components of the EEO process. If th e counselee raises an allegation of harassment, the EEO Counselor should include an explanation that allegations of harassment must also be referred to the Anti-Harassment Program (AHP) for processing at *EDI AHP Mailbox If Counselee is a TIGTA notify ReportHarassment@TIGTA.Treas.gov. The purpose of this initial discu ssion is educational in nature. EEO professionals must take the appropriate amount of time and share all relevant information with the counselee so that he/she may make an informed decision as to how they wish to proceed. At the Page 11 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS end of this initial conversation the person must de termine if they would like to file an informal complaint or if they are satisfied and do not want to enter the informal pr ocess at this time the contact should be closed. In summary, there are two potential outcomes to this first contact with the counselee: x The counselee does not want to file an EEO pre-complaint. x The counselee wants to file an EEO pre-complaint. \u0083 What is a closed Contact? A closed contact occurs when the counselee has an initial discussion with an EEO Intake Specialist from the Territory Office who listens to their employment matter to understand why they feel discrimination has occurred. The EEO Intake Sp ecialist explains the EEO complaint process and obligations under Anti-harassment to the extent th e counselee can make a decision on whether they want to file a pre-complaint, and/or pursue through Anti-harassment; and/or decide they do not want to pursue either forum at this time. All in formation discussed should be captured on the Contact Intake form and uploaded in TCTS, and th e contact should be immediately closed once decision has been made. EEO Intake Specialist/Counselors should secure several contact methods from customer, e.g., e-mail, telephone, mailing address, from the counselee during the initial contact. In addition, counselors should secure information about upcoming leave, furloughs or other extended absences from the office. \u0083 What is an EEO Informal Complaint? An informal EEO complaint occurs when the counselee has an initial discussion with an EEO Intake Specialist who listens to their employment matter to understand why they feel discrimination has occurred. The EEO Intake Specialist explains the EEO complaint process to the extent the counselee ultimately decides they do want to file. The day that the counselee communicated an intent to file is day one of the 30-day counseling period. a. How does the initial interview and obtaining Counselor Forms affect the start of the counseling period? Paperwork does not dictate the filing or non-filing of an EEO complaint. The 30-day counseling period begins when the counselee elects to file a pre-complaint. However, there are a number of forms that are an important part of the EEO Counseling process. The EEO Counselor w ill contact the counselee to conduct the initial interview and obtain the si gned Rights and Responsibilities, Page 12 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS Representation/Anonymity Form and Agreement to Extend Counseling/Participation in Mediation. Note: The Date Counseling First Sought is the date in TCTS. After attempting to reach the counselee, if he/she is non-responsive after 3 attempts the EEO Counselor will send a No Response Letter notifying the Counselee that the case will be processed anonymously. The Counselor will obtain managements articulation to the a llegations then issuing the NORTF. \u0083 What if the Customer needs additional time to decide? If, after meeting with the EEO Counselor, the couns elee is unable to decide whether they want to enter the process, the counselor should secure the reason they cannot decide. Based on the reason, the counselor needs to determine how much addi tional time is needed by the counselee. A reasonable amount of time should be allowed (no more than 2 business days.) Documentation must include the reason the couns elee needs more time, the date they will make a decision and how the follow-up will be made to the counselee. The EEO Counselor retains this contact and continues processing it until a decision is reached. The \"no contact/unresponsive process\" must be used from the date the counselee promis ed a response and when the EEO Counselor has difficulty contacting them. If the EEO Counselor does not hear from the counselee, they will continue to process the contact using the \"no contact/unr esponsive procedures\" and process the complaint anonymously and issue the NORTF. \u0083 Processing Courtesy Cases If a Counselor is assigned a courtesy case from the other territory, the Counselors Territory Manager will remain case manager. There are occasions in which individuals make contact regarding the EEO process and make that contac t to someone in a territory outside of their geographic region. The Counselors should comp lete the intake form and forward it to *EEO@IRS.Gov . SECTION 3|INITIAL INTERVIEW o General Overview Before the initial interview, the counselor should advise the counselee of his/her right to be accompanied, advised, and/or represented by a representative at any stage in the complaint process, including the counseling stage. In additi on, the counselor should perform the following: \u0083Begin the initial interview with the counselee by explaining the role of the counselor and then by giving the counselee an opportunity to explain his/her concerns. \u0083Advise the counselee that she/he has the righ t to remain anonymous during counseling. Page 13 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS \u0083 Find out if the counselee tried to resolve the issue or brought the problem to the agency's attention before seeking counseling and if so , with whom, when, what was discussed and how. \u0083 Ask the counselee whether she/he is willing to meet with agency officials through either a facilitated interview or Altern ative Dispute Resolution (ADR). \u0083 Provide the counselee with an overview of informal counseling and the discrimination complaint process under Part 1614, includin g the required Notice of Rights and Responsibilities, time frames, and answer any questions she/he may have about counseling and the complaint process. \u0083 Collect as much specific information as possible concerning the counselee's reasons for believing discrimination has occurred, the nexus, dates and comparator employees, if applicable. Ask the counselee what they are seeking to resolve the issue. \u0083 If the Counselee stated Reasonable Accommodat ions (RA) as an issue, the Counselor should refer this information to Disability Services Division. \u0083 If Counselee files with the issue of RA and it is denied, the Counselor should refer this information to TM. \u0083 Determine whether special procedures apply, i.e., Significant EEO Case Tracking Report (SECTR), class complaint, executive order, etc. .. In the absence of facts or circumstances that relate to discriminatory practices or to Title VII bases, offer other alternatives for redress. \u0083 There are occasions when a counselee does not appear to have timely initiated EEO counseling. On such occasions, the counselor should ask the counselee to explain why they waited more than 45 days to make contact. This information should be documented in the ROC. \u0083 If the complaint involves a Non-Selection regarding a vacancy announcement, Counselor sends email to *HCO.ETS.PATM@IRS.Gov to request promotion package. Preparation of the Report of Co unseling (ROC) is an interactive process. The EEO Counselor should be preparing ROC as the case progresses through the counseling period. MEMORY JOGGER o Neutrality Card ( Document 13309 / Catalog Number 59110P) Page 14 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS The EEO Counselor Neutrality Card is an internal tool designed to inform the counselee of the counselor's role as a neutral party. It outlines the duties and responsibilities of the counselor. A copy of the Neutrality Card can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site . However, this document should not be made part of the Counselor report. o Representation/Anonymity Form The Representation/Anonymity Form includes the Pr ivacy Act that counselees that the information they provide will be used to help resolve the allegations raised during counseling. A copy of the Representation/Anonymity Form can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site. T his document should be made part of the Report of Counseling. o Rights and Responsibilities The Notice of Rights and Responsibilities provides the counselee an extensive list of his/her rights and responsibilities throughout the EEO Counseling process. The counselee signs this document to indicate receipt. A copy of this document can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site. T his document should be made part of the Report of Counseling. o ADR Information Pamphlet (Revised April 2020) The ADR Brochure is designed to provide the counselee with information about ADR and the mediation process. A copy of the brochure can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site , however should not be part of the Report of Counseling. SECTION 4|TRADITIONAL CASE PROCESSING Limited Inquiry vs. Investigation EEO Counselors should conduct a \"lim ited inquiry\" rather than an in-depth EEO investigation. The definitions listed below outline the differences between the two: Limited Inquiry is defined as the process used to gat her (case related) information in an effort to establish an open channel thro ugh which employees and management may raise and discuss problems, obtain an swers, and on an informal bas is, resolve issues concerning equal employment opportunity. Investigation is defined as the process used to gather the facts to support or disprove a complaint or report of an alleged incident. The investigation seeks to determine or report the truth and all the facts, both favorable an d unfavorable, in order that management and EDI practitioners will have all the facts ava ilable t o them, to render a fair decision concerning equal employment opportunity. The limited inquiry serves two purposes as related to the EEO complaint process: Limited inquiries provide information needed fo r resolution purposes if the counselee chooses EEO counseling over ADR. Page 15 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS Information obtained during the limited inquiry he lps to determine a jurisdictional question if a formal complaint is filed. Special Case Processing The majority of contacts/pre-complaints are hand led according to standard procedures. However, there are certain situations that may need to be handled somewhat differently. Below is a listing of these situations and the proper case handling. o Sensitive Contacts/Pre-Complaints The following situations will result in a sensitive contact/pre-complaint: An Executive is the counselee. An Executive directly took the action on the employment matter the counselee feels is discriminatory. An EEO Professional in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) National Headquarter (NHQ) is the counselee. An EEO Professional in Business Unit specific EDI Office is the counselee. All contacts received from EEO Professionals an d/or EDI employee's must be directed through a Territory Manager (TM). The TM will then cont act the Associate Director for EEO Operations for case assignment outside of the IRS Agency. The Sensitive Case Counselor will follow the regu lar procedures for handling a contact or pre- complaint once case has been assigned. o Class Complaints A class is defined as a group of employees , former employees, or applicants who are alleged to have been adversely affected by an agency personnel policy or practice which discriminates against the group on the basis of their common race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. The regulato ry requirements for class complaints provide a structure different from that for individual complaints. For class complaints, there is a four-stage process. The first stage is the establishment of a class complaint. At this stage, the class agent is required to seek counseling from an agency EEO Counselor. The second stage is a dete rmination from a Commission Administrative Judge, subject to agency final action, as to whether to certify the complaint as a class action. The third stage, assuming that the comp laint has been certified as a class action, involves a recommended decision from an Administrative Judge on the merits of the class complaint, subject to final agency action in the form of a final decision. The fourth stage, where there has been a finding of class-based discrimination, is the determination of the claims for relief of the individual class members. If a contact with a counselee involves a class complaint, it will be assigned to a Class Complaint Counselor. Page 16 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS o Reported Allegations of Harassment and Sexual Harassment All allegations of Harassment and Sexual Harassment should be referred to Anti- Harassment Team mailbox *EDI AHP Mailbox edi.ahp.mailbox@irs.gov and Prevention of Sexual Harassment Coordinator. o Significant EEO Case Tracking (SECTR) The SECTR process is designed to ensure th at significant EEO cases are reported to executive leadership in a timely manner, to prov ide control over the resolution process of significant EEO cases by conducting early monito ring, and to create a centralized repository of information about significant EEO ca ses, e.g., trends, bases and issues. The various categories that falls under SECTR are: Class Actions Cases which rely on recent court precedents of significant importance Cases which generate a high le vel of interest or publicity Cases that challenge existing affirmative employment policies Cases involving allegations of sexual harassment against a manager at the GS-15 level or above Cases involving a Senior Executive Service (SES) employee as a party involved in the allegation, including as a counselee, comp lainant or the responsible management official Cases where there are ongoing negotiations involving a proposed settlement agreement of $75,000 or more If a contact with a counselee involves a SECTR-related issue/individual, the EEO Counselors should: Ensure that the case does not fall into anot her special handling procedure, such as a sensitive pre-complaint. If it does, please follow those procedures. If the case does not fall under another procedure, it should be worked as normal with the TM being kept abreast of actions. Enter the term \"SECTR\" into the Subject Field in TCTS. o Executive Orders Page 17 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS 4.2.5.1 Processing Cases with Alle gations Protected by Executive Order If a pre-complaint involves a basis or bases covered by Executive Order rather than Title VII, i.e. parental status, follo w the procedures below: Advise the counselee of the relevant distin ctions between compla ints based on bases covered by Executive Order and those proce ssed under 29 CFR Part 1614, including that under these procedures, in contrast to part 1614, an individual is not entitled to a hearing or appeal and remedies are limited. Inform the counselee about other possi ble avenues of redress, such as: o filing a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure in an applicable collective bargaining agreement, if any; o filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel; o Appealing to the Merit Systems Prot ection board (MSPB) if the action complained of is otherwise appealable to the MSPB; o Filing an administrative grievance; or o Filing a complaint under the Department's modified EEO process. In order to promote efficiency and avoid multip le investigations of the same claims, if the counselee elects to use one or more of the alternative avenues outlined above, the modified process will not be available. o Parental Status Although discrimination based on an individual's status as a parent is not a protected basis under Title VII, there are other protections agains t discrimination based on an individual's status as a parent, including Executive Orde r 13152, which is an amendment to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in Federal Government. Executive Order 13152 prohibits discrimination based on an individual's status as a parent. Executive Order 13152 states that \"status as a par ent\" refers to the status of an individual who, with respect to an individual who is under the age of 18 or who is 18 or older but is incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability, is a biological parent, an adoptive parent, a foster parent, a stepparen t, a custodian of a legal ward, in loco parentis over such individual, or actively se eking legal custody or adoption of such an individual. o Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) June 15, 2020, The Supreme Court ruled Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay, lesbian, sexual orientation and transgender employees from discrimination based on sex. o Genetic Information Page 18 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS o Pregnancy Discrimination o Nursing Mothers Program o IRS Gender Identity Guidance The Genetic Information and Nondiscriminatio n Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from re questing, requiring, or purchasing genetic information of employees or their family membe rs, except as specifically allowed by this law. GINA has specific exceptions for reques ts under the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Rehabilitation Act. \"Genetic information\", as defined by GI NA, includes information concerning the manifestation of disease/disorder in family members (\"family medical history\"), information about an individual's or family member's geneti c tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member soug ht or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual's family memb er or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member re ceiving assistive reproductive services. In 1978 Congress amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to enact the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA). This act was passed to reverse the Supreme Court's decision in General Electric Company v. Gilbert (1976), in which the Supreme Court held that Title VII's prohibition against \"sex\" discrimination di d not include a ban on pregnancy-based discrimination. Title VII generally banned sex discrimination in employment. By amending Title VII, Congress extended that prohibition to include pregnancy-based discrimination. If a contact with a counselee invo lves pregnancy discrimination: Process the pre-complaint in the same manner as a pre-complaint involving gender discrimination. Nursing mothers have the right to express milk in the workplace under a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. The Memorandum of Understanding between NTEU and IRS regarding the Nursing Mothers Program can be found on IRS Source. The Service's policy reaffirms its commitment to fair treatment of, and equal opportunity for, all people. A policy prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity helps create the reasonable expectation of a safe environmen t in which all employees and applicants for employment are evaluated by their merits, rather than others' perceptions of, or level of comfort with, their gender identity or gender expression. Courts have held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act precludes discrimination based on gender identity as a type of sex discrimi nation. Executive Orders also provide similar protections. Repeatedly and intentionally referri ng to an individual using the wrong name, pronoun or gender can be cons idered sex discrimination. Co urts have also held that denying access to a restroom consistent with one's gender identity can be considered sex Page 19 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS discrimination. The IRS Gender Identity Guidan ce discusses these matte rs in further detail, as well as other workplace-related topics. The guidan ce also includes resources to assist when an employee undergoes a gender transition in the workplace. Studies have shown that transgender peop le face disproportionate amounts of discrimination in all areas of life, especially in employment. A study of 6,450 transgender people, published in 2011, indicated that 90% reported experiencing mistreatment, harassment, or discrimination on the job, incl uding invasion of privacy, verbal abuse, and physical or sexual assault. These statistics und erscore the importance of the Service creating a safe environment for all employees. Gender identity and gender conformity are i nherently personal matters. The IRS recognizes that each individual is different and ha s unique needs, which all fellow employees and supervisors should respect.

Addition ally, this link may also be shared with management officials when counseling cases alleging issues based on gender identity. The Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion has additional resources to learn about gender identity-related workplace topics on their website, http://edi.web.irs.gov . You can also contact them for assistance or with questions via e-mail at edi@irs.gov . o Executive Order 13839 Merit System Principles Executive Order Promoting Accountability and St reamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles is a presidential executive order issued in May 25, 2018 that aims to streamline the discipline and dismi ssal processes for poor performing federal employees. The executive actions s eek to advance \"the ability of supervisors in agencies to promote civil servant accountability consistent with merit system principles while simultaneously recognizing employees' procedural rights an d protections according to the order. o Article 8 If a resolution is reached, and the TM and Counselor determine the terms impact the working conditions of a bargaining unit employee, the Counselor must complete and submit the Article 8 record and copy of the resolution agreement to TM and EDI Compliance Manager within 2 days of resolution agr eement. Article 8 only applies to working conditions that impact bargaining unit employees. Terms that impact bargaining unit working cond itions are those that may conflict with negotiated agreements between the IRS and NTEU or other non-discretionary requirements (including established past practice) such as: Grants or promises of relief regarding priority consideration Promotions Realignment / Reassignment Page 20 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS Details greater than 90 days in length Transfers Training and/or Changes in working hours or pe rmanent Post of Duty locations The following conditions do not impact bargaining unit employees: Grants or promises that provide a form of relief that is purely personal to one or more individual complainants - and wh ich have no meaningful impact on the bargaining unit (such as payments of cash) Performance awards of $500 or less Performance awards in excess of $500 that are not funded from the NPAA program Special Act awards Quality Step Increases Changes made to performance appraisals Restoration of leave Correction of a personnel record and reversing disciplinary action do not impact bargaining unit working conditions SECTION 5|ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) ADR Elections Any applicant or current or former employee who contacts an EEO Counselor for purposes of initiating a pre-complaint may elect to participate in the mediation process (except for allegations involving criminal activity and ma nagerial actions taken as a result of a 1203 violation. TCTS event code 2.1.2 ADR -Did Not Meet Criteria.) When ADR is elected, EEO Counselors must perform se veral important tasks in all cases, to include: Advising the counselee about the EEO complain t process under 29 CFR Part 1614, including ADR. Determining the claim(s) and basis(es). Conducting an initial interview with the counsel ee for the purpose of determining the timeliness of the counselee's contact and obtaining information relating to this issue. Preparing the parties (counselee, repres entative, management, and mediator) for mediation. Advising the counselee of his/her right to file a formal discrimination complaint if attempts to resolve the dispute through EEO counseling or ADR fails. Page 21 x ADR Rejected Event EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS Preparing a Report of Counseling which sufficiently documents the Counselee's allegations and basis(es) and Managements response for each allegation. Refer to iComplaints Events Guide for specific coding actions taken during the complaintprocess. Below are additional considerations a counselor should keep in mind when a counselee elects ADR. Requesting a Mediator After the parties have completed the ADR Election process, the EEO Counselor has ten (10) business days from the completion of the ADR Election to request a mediator. This is accomplished by completing the ADR Mediator Request form. After the form is completed, the EEO Counsel or should forward form to the Team Lead. Mediation-Related TCTS Events and Tools Counselors must enter the standardi zed reasons for ADR rejection in TCTS, event 2.5 \"Rejected by Complainant\" comment box. For a listing of the standardized reasons, see the TCTS Events Guide. x Mediation Conducted Event Mediation participants are surveyed after case closur e to determine their level of satisfaction with the process and the service that was provided. In order to determine the correct counselees to survey, counselors must enter the names, roles and e-mail addresses of mediation participants in TCTS event 2.12.2 \"Mediation Conducted\" event comment box. x Mediation Cost Calculator The cost of mediation must be entered into TCTS befo re an ADR case can be closed. In order to assist counselors in computing this cost, an Excel-based tool has been developed and uploaded to SharePoint. This tool allows counselors to estimate the cost of mediation by entering the grades and localities of the mediation participants. See the screenshot below. The calculator can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site .

This is not a general prohibition on those officials from being present at appropriate settlemen t discussion and partici pating only that they are not the officials with settlement authority. SECTION 6| TERRITORY CL OSE-OUTS AND REVIEWS Both EEO Counselors and TMs should ensure quality case processing. Early case discussions between counselors and TMs are held to ensure quality case processing. Options for earl y resolution should be discussed and offered to parties. If resolution is no t reached, TM's will conduct open case reviews of all counselor's reports and related case files ensu ring quality and thorough written product. TMs will use the EEO Counselor Contact/ROC Review Feedback to ensure high-quality and effective cases reviews. The check sheet provides space for comments related to the most crucial factors involved in EEO complaint counseling. Each fa ctor is associated with a Critical Job Element (CJE). There are numerous stakeholders who have a vested intere st in the timely and accurate input of information into the TCTS system. As a result, EEO pre-compla ints in TCTS are subject to feedback from numerous sources. Below is a listing of some of the TCTS stakeholders who may pe riodically conduct reviews of TCTS data, including uploaded documents. Treasury Office of Civil Rights Division (OCRD) OCRD reviews cases to determine acceptance or dismissal of some or all allegations raised. OCRD also processes formal investigations, whic h means that OCRD's role in reviewing pre- complaints in TCTS has increased. Completeness and accuracy of information included in the report of counseling are critical to ensure that OCRD has all the information needed to process cases if the counselee files a formal complaint. Furthermore, the EEO Counselor must ensure that s/he has timely completed and up loaded the report of counseling into TCTS so Page 23 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS that it can be accessed by OCRD, as they are required to comply with EEOC guidelines for processing EEO complaints. (See section 1.3 regarding required forms for OCRD.) Note: Contact with OCRD should be coordinated with the TM. Compliance Group Processing Resolution Agreements Counselors will ensure fully executed and signed resolution agreements and Compliance memos are provided to appropriate management officials within 2 business days of final signature, copying their TM's, EDI Compliance Manager and *EDI EEO Settlements Agreements edi.eeo.settle.agre@IRS.Gov . A copy of the memo can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site . Compliance Group supports the informal comp laint processing function through the management of a variety of comp liance monitoring and review activities. This office conducts reviews and analyses of complaints of discrimi nation that resulted in either a settlement agreement or adverse decision. Key program activities include: Reviewing and analyzing all referred EEO settlement agreements and findings of discrimination; x Conducting fact findings as necessary and ma king preliminary determinations concerning evidence of intentional discriminatory treatment of an employee, which might warrant removal or other disciplinary action in accordance with the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 \u00a71203(b)(3)(B); x Making referrals to the Employee Conduct and Compliance Office, Executive Misconduct Unit, or Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration where warra nted; and coordinating the collection and reporting of information concerning corrective actions ta ken by the Service to oversight organizations. EDI Analytics Section This is a centralized function responsible for developing all roll-up reports and supporting the strategic priorities of IRS and EDI by providing research, analytical and statistical services including customer satisfaction survey results. SECTION 7| CASE CLOSURES o Final Interview If the counselee's issues are not resolved informally within the 30-day period, the counselor conducts the final interview and issues the counselee a Notice of Right to File a Formal Complaint (NORTF) no later than the end of the 30-day period (or up to the 90-day period, if extended or ADR elected). Page 24 EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EEO OPERATIONS The new electronic NORTF letter is a fillable, 508 compliant PDF document that the counselor will complete, sign electronically, and upload into TC TS. The counselor should e-mail the NORTF, with Delivery Notification and Read Receipt Requested activated, to the Counselee's official work or personal e-mail address with a subject line of \"URGENT: NOTICE OF RIGHT TO FILE ATTACHED.\" The e-mail must contain a statement asking the Counselee and/or Representative to reply to the e-mail to acknowledge receipt. A reply by the Counselee/Rep resentative will assist OCRD Specialists to determine timeliness when a read receipt is not received. For those instances where emailing the NORTF is not an option, the counselor should complete and sign the form electronically, then print and mail it by certified mail. The Counselor should ensure that the green card tracking number is noted in TCTS and that a copy of the green card, when received, is uploaded into TCTS. Alternatively, if the counselor conducts an in-person interview, the counselor should obtain the counselee's signature on the NORTF, scan it and upload it into TCTS. If the matter is resolved informally, the counselor mu st submit the draft resolu tion agreement to the TM for review and TM's e-signature befo re it is signed by the parties. o Customer Satisfaction Surveys Generally, counselees who participate in the EEO co unseling process, i.e., traditional counseling and ADR, will receive an electronic survey that reques ts feedback regarding the process and the service provided. During the final interview, counselors sh ould explain the survey process and request that counselees respond to the surveys when they are issued and ensure contact tab in TCTS has been updated. (Currently being revised.) o Close-Out Memo to Responsible Management Official (RMO) Counselors will provide RMOs with a close-out letter that provides basic information about the pre- complaint and the next steps in the process. A copy of the letter can be found on the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site . All final documentation and the Report of Counsel ing should be complete d and submitted to the Territory Manager for review within two business days from the date of closure. MEMORY JOGGER SECTION 8| CASE FILE, DOCUMENT RETENTION AND POST CLOSURE o Case File - The Counselor's Report ROC Font should be Arial and pitch size 11. \u0083 Time Limits Page 25 The counselor must have uploaded all ROC's into TCTS within two business days after the Notice of Right to File has been issued. All supporting documents must be uploaded into TCTS prior to submitting ROC for review to TM. \u0083Contents In an effort to utilize TCTS in a more effectiv e and efficient manner, enhanced procedures have been put in place for uploading the ROC. This sh ould benefit OCRD personnel and others requiring access to these records. Documents collected at the informal stage will be u ploaded into TCTS. The Intake Form, the ROC and the Green Card or read receipt, if NORTF is sued electronically. All are separate uploads and named accordingly (as shown below). The follow ing documents should be uploaded for every complaint. x Contact/Intake Form x Counselors Forms o The Representation/Anonymity Form o The Notice of Rights and Responsibilities o Agreement to Extend Counseling/Participate in Mediation x Counselee's Misc.

Utilizing addi tional data sources allowed the team to identify themes to help center and define t he employee experience. x Workforce Demographics provided labor force composition statistics and insights into how reflective the IRS is of the American taxpaye r, as well as potential barriers to employee progression. x EEO Data collected through the FY20 IRS Report of EDI Services provided insights into the scale and basis of pre-complaints, alternativ e dispute resolution, EEO complaints, harassment issues and reasonable accommodations. x Employee Sentiment Data was collected through the 2019 and 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), 2021 Employee Insights Survey on EDIA at the IRS, EDI Focus Groups and interviews with the Senior Exe cutive Team. The data provided a view into the perception of the IRS' commitment to EDIA-not only what employees see, but what they feel to be true. Overall, the workforce acknowled ges that diversity and inclusio n positively impact the Service's ability to serve taxpayers and achieve the mission. W e know that equity needs to be present at all levels of the organization. The IRS can become more proactive with the use of education and support services to eliminate barriers to equal employment opportunity. The FEVS shows that the IRS is on par with governm ent benchmarks for Inclusion Quotient Scores, and indicators reveal that the IRS is well positioned to accelerate its inclusion journey with the implementation of the initiatives outlined in this Strategy. The EDIA Maturity Model provides a structured, comprehensive ap proach to evaluate where an organization is on its journey towards becoming a more inclusive culture and helps identify where an organization can improve to better serv e its workforce and customers. The IRS used an established maturity model framework to guide i n the creation of a robust, equitable, diverse, inclusive, accessible Strategy and Roadmap. The maturity model's six components\u2014Strategic Intent, Communica tions and Change, Metrics and Analytics, Leadership Behaviors, Talent Act ions, and Inclusive Culture\u2014provide a comprehensive and meaningful view into how ED IA affects the IRS workforce. 9 Figure 4. The EDIA Maturity Model The model suggests the IRS is foundationally strong at promotin g EDIA throughout its ranks. The Strategy and Roadmap will help to push the Service f urther along on the maturity model scale as it progresses towards becoming a leader of EDIA. Figure 5. The EDIA Levels of Maturity 10 Introduction and Explanation of Strategy The Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap is anchored on four pr iority areas critical to advancing EDIA across the IRS: People, Culture, Community and Leadership . These priority areas emerged through an understanding of the current environment; input collected through multiple organization-wide employee feedback opportunities; data aligned to the maturity model; and robust c ollaboration with the Office of EDI, the Senior Executive Team and strategic partners . Each priority area has a set of strategic goals that the organi zation will advance through in the next one to three years\u2014and each goal has aligne d objectives and initiatives that further dis till how we will successfully imple ment the Strategy. The priorities are underpinned by the strategic approach, communica tions and change strategy as well as metrics and analytics. Figure 6. Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap Priority Areas Graphic 11 EDIA Strategy and Roadmap Goals Figure 7. Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap Goals Graphic 12 Strategic Priority Area 1 PEOPLE Grounded in valuing,respecting, and developing employees to reach their greatest potential\u2014at work and in life. GOAL P1: Everyone has an equal opportunity to learn, grow and thrive at the IRS. Employees will be encouraged to reach their full potential through career planning, performance management and learning opportunities. Employee growth and experiences are critical to fulfilling the mission and vision of the IRS. The IRS will promote an environment that ensures equal o pportunity while facilitating career mobility an d clear paths for the workforce. The programs and services to support employees will be designed and developed so that all people, including individuals with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. GOAL P2: Support and advance diverse recruitment and onboarding. Workforce planning that emphasizes equitable processes will support a diverse candidate pool. The federal and IRS workforces are evolving, and hiring is on t he rise. Strategic workforce planning, with an emphasis on equitab le and inclusive hiring practices, is critical to growing and sust aining a diverse workforce at the Service. By providing a recruitment, hiring and onboarding experience th at is comprehensive, equitable, diverse, inclusive and accessible, th e IRS will ensure that prospective and newly hired employees will fee l supported from day one, resulting in an overall diverse and inc lusive workforce. 13 GOAL P1: Everyone has an equal opportunity to learn, grow and thrive at the IRS. Achievement of People Goal 1 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective P1.1: Enhance development and delivery ofcomprehensive learning opport that EDIA P1.1.1 Agencywide EDIA Learning Strategy: 1) Establish EDIA learning competencies 2) Align learning opportunities using both in-person and technology 3) Assess all learnings to infuse EDIA 4) Develop learning key performance indicators (KPIs), and 5) Develop required training curriculum and schedule P1.1.2 Perform an equity assessment of learning and growth programs and benefits (e.g., applicant flow for employee traini ng opportunities) Objective P1.2: Improve equity in career development and progression across the workforce P1.2.1 Conduct workforce demographic equity assessments and eliminate barriers to equal opportunity P1.2.2 Conduct a barrier analysis of supervisor and Senior Executive Service-level roles for underrepresented groups P1.2.3 Partner with HCO and Employee Organizations/ Employee Resource Groups to develop and support community specific professional development as a pipeline for leaders P1.2.4 Develop programming to address career mobility challenges P1.2.5 Define partnership support model between the Office of EDI and HCO Objective P1.3: Elevate EDIA performance standards across the Service SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of People Goal 1 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of specific initiatives, the number of employees who attend EDIA training, barrier analyses, and equity of representation in the workforce. P1.3.1 Include EDIA goals in the performance review process 14 GOAL P2: Support and advance diverse recruitment and onboarding. Achievement of People Goal 2 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective P2.1: Design an inclusive and welcoming onboarding experience for all new employees Objective P2.2: Reduce barriers and bias in hiring of candidates Objective P2.3: Recruit and attract a diverse and inclusive workforce P2.1.1 Partner with HCO on embedding EDIA throughout the onboarding experience (e.g., refreshing the New Employee Orientation (NEO) video) P2.1.2 Evaluate the need and implementation options for a formal mentorship or buddy program for IRS new hires in partnership with HCO P2.2.1 Conduct applicant pipeline assessment (stages of the hiring process a candidate moves through) and barrier analysis for underrepresented groups P2.2.2 Provide unconscious bias training for interviewers and recruiters P2.3.1 Partner with HCO to advance the IRS Hiring Strategy and Strategic Recruitment Plan (inclusive of the hiring surge) P2.3.2 Evaluate inclusive and non-gendered language across the recruitment process SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of People Goal 2 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of specific initiatives, barrier analyses, recruitment, and mentorship program participation. 15 Strategic Priority Area 2 CULTURE Centered on building an authentically inclusive workplace respectful of physical accessibility and focused on the well-being of every employee by ensuring they have a sense of belonging, safety, and authenticity . GOAL C1 : Enable workplace engagement and inclusion. The workplace environment is grounded in respectful, equitable conversations and actions, with opportunities to build relationships across the Service. This goal acknowledges that culture is the paramount driving fo rce that creates a sense of belonging and well-being for the workfo rce. Job applicants make acceptance decisions based on the culture o f an organization. In addition, the degree to which taxpayers com ply with the law depends on how they are engaged and treated. It is mission-critical for our employees to feel welcomed, incl uded and engaged when they come to work or provide services to customers. Valuing diverse voices and perspectives in conversations and through actions will be key in furthering equ ity. An engaged workforce will more efficiently and effectively meet the needs of the customer. Research on private and public organizations has found that increased levels of engagement lea d to improved individual and organizational performance. GOAL C2: Employees feel safe and supported. Workplace policies, systems and structures are fair and allow all employees to feel safe to operate authentically in their roles. This goal focuses on putting equity at the forefront of this St rategy, requiring a close and continual evaluation of workplace policie s, including anti-harassment, safet y and accessibility policies. Establishing and maintaining a model EEO program is essential for employees to be treated fairly and to have avenues to raise concerns when the IRS is not fulfilling its responsibility of functioning as a just workplace. Improvement in these areas will create better processes for evaluating fairness in policies that impact employees. 16 GOAL C1 : Enable workplace engagement and inclusion. Achievement of Culture Goal 1 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective C1.1: Enhance cultural awareness and recognition of diversity across the Service Objective C1.2: Communicate and demonstrate a commitment to EDIA Objective C1.3: Enhance oppor tunities for engagement, relationship-building and understanding C1.1.1 Employee Organization/Employee Resource Group (EO/ERG) alignment and engagement strategy to increase programming and employee participation C1.1.2 Enhance cultural awareness programming on diverse holidays, events and cultures C1.2.1 Define a partnership s upport model between the Office of EDI and Communications & Liaison (C&L) C1.2.2 Develop and execute EDIA Servicewide communications plan (inclusive of revamping the EDI Website) C1.2.3 Develop an annual report geared towards employees and prospective employees that highlights the Service's EDIA programs and accomplishments C1.2.4 Launch employee \"Self-Identification Campaign\" to gather information about diverse employee groups, including persons with disabilities C1.2.5 Launch agencywide EDIA commitment campaigns to reinforce commitment to EDIA C1.3.1 Establish ongoing employee listening and sharing forums on EDIA C1.3.2 Partner with HCO to define and develop allyship programming SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of Culture Goal 1 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of specific initiatives, participation in EO/ERG events and programming, and frequency and reach of communications. 17 GOAL C2: Employees feel safe and supported. Achievement of Culture Goal 2 will be realized through these st rategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective C2.1: Identify and reduce biases in workplace policies Objective C2.2: Enhance access and education to support systems (informal) Objective C2.3: Assess and improve EDI operations and program delivery C2.1.1 Partner with HCO and NTEU to assess existing workplace policies to remediate bias C2.1.2 Enhance communications on EDI services (tied to Initiative C1.2.2) C2.2.1 Enhance communications on EDI services - proactive resolution (tied to Initiatives C1.2.2 and C2.1.2) C2.2.2 Create a system of d irect employee access to EDI support staff C2.3.1 Advance reasonable accommodations process improvements (e.g., partner with IT to promote access to 508 compliant tools and equipment) C2.3.2 Assess Office of EDI employee training needs and develop a learning strategy C2.3.3 Conduct an EDIA data management and analytics needs assessment and develop an Agencywide EDI Dashboard C2.3.4 Develop an Office o f EDI Communications and Engagement Plan (to include the broader EDI Community) C2.3.5 Implement the EDI Business Based Offices Program Evaluation recommendations, as appropriate SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of Culture Goal 2 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of developing and launching specific initiatives, number of proactive resolution services requested and provided, and report on other EDI services and EDI customer satisfaction survey results. 18 Strategic Priority Area 3 COMMUNITY Focused on making a positive social impact by fostering internal and external partnerships and creatinginitiatives that support the communities in which we live and serve. GOAL CM1: Enhance and cultivate community- based relationships. Intensify efforts to build relationships in taxpayer communities through a greater understanding of their needs and how we can best serve them. This goal is based on the fact that leading organizations lever age intentional community-based relationships as a vehicle to interweave EDIA into community influence, engage current and potential employees and drive meaningful change. More than ever, community relationships can serve to enhance employer brand reputation, attract and retain talent and positively impa ct customers. GOAL CM2: Enable opportunity through equitable practices. Provide equitable access to IRS services and opportunities for taxpayers and vendors. Equity of access is a fundamental component of service delivery . As a result, this goal focuses on the human-centered design tha t can help illuminate opportunities for improving equitable pract ices and understanding the needs of stakeholders. This is an opportunity to explore systems and processes that engage taxpayers and vendors, and to make adjustments where needed for more equitable access. 19 GOAL CM1: Enhance and cultivate community-based relationships. Achievement of Community Goal 1 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective CM1.1: Partner with Taxpayer First Act Office and W&I to provide E DIA expertise and support to initiatives for underserved communities Objective CM1.2: Partner with ERGs to support local communities CM1.1.1 Establish a partnership support model between EDI and Wage and Investment (W&I) on the multilingual initiative (u nderserved communities) CM1.1.2 Establish a partnership support model between EDI and Stakeholder Partnerships, Education & Communication (SPEC) on community-based initiatives CM1.2.1 Develop community service opportunities aligned with business objectives (MLK Jr. National Day of Service, for example) SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of Community Goal 1 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of developing and launching specific initiatives and participation in events. 20 GOAL CM2: Enable opportunity t hrough equitable practices. Achievement of Community Goal 2 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective CM2.1: Evaluate vendor diversity strategies Objective CM2.2: Promote accessibility to systems, services and education on IRS services CM2.1.1 Partner with the Office of Procurement to evaluate current vendor diversity strategies CM2.2.1 Incorporate the Office of EDI as an advisor in the creation of taxpayer-facing policies and service delivery decisions CM2.2.2 Develop an EDIA learning strategy for taxpayer-facing employees CM2.2.3 Partner with W&I and C&L to develop an external facing communications campaign to educate taxpayers on EDIA services SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of Community Goal 2 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of developing and launching specific initiatives, vendor diversity, completion of training programs. 21 LEADERSHIPStrategic Priority Area 4 Committed to providing strategic direction, demonstratingcommitment, and reinforcing accountabilityfor EDIA. GOAL 1: Elevate leadership responsibility and accountability. Leaders will model inclusion by amplifying and taking lead on EDIA initiatives. Agency leaders will model behaviors and actions that support EDIA. Leaders at all levels must hold themselves and others accountable for ensuring that EDIA is woven into the delivery o f services for internal and external customers. Leveraging the maturity model, we see that leadership behaviors at the IRS are currently at the Foundational stage. We seek to move toward Leading. In doing so, leaders will communicate to employees not just the importance of EDIA, but also execute actions that generate greater E DIA within the spaces they lead. Moreover, leaders will be asked to set goals and measures that ensure EDIA outcomes are reached. With active and engaged leadership, employees feel included and supported by their leaders\u2014and by the IRS. GOAL 2: Establish a governing structure. EDIA will be delivered through an ecosystem of partners across our organization. This goal supports the establishment of a governing structure that will streamline and support EDIA across the Service. A governing structure will connect the work at all levels and provide aligned collaboration, allowing for coordinated communications and greater equitable access of EDIA programs to support employees and their well-being. Employees will also have increased opportunities to provide feedback and become involved with employee organizations and employee resource groups. 22 GOAL L1: Elevate lea dership responsibilit y and accountability. Achievement of Leadership Goal 1 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective L1.1: Enhance data driven methods and analytics to monitor EDIA progress Objective L1.2: Increase leaders' visibility, engagementand commitment to EDIA Objective L1.3: Build EDIA l eadership competencies and learning opportunities to model inclusion L1.1.1 Develop EDIA scorecards that include goals and measures L1.2.1 Develop Agencywide EDIA-related leadership communications (e.g., video messages, podcasts and hosting of Zoom events) L1.2.2 Develop Change Network Mode l to support message dissemination throughout the IRS L1.2.3 Increase access to senior leaders through a series of open networking engagements L1.3.1 Assess inclusive leadership competencies and launch EDI leadership development serie s (e.g., cohort cross-training on EDIA) L1.3.2 Pilot leadership mentorship programs for diverse employee groups L1.3.3 Pilot executive sponsorship programming to support diverse employee groups SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of Leadership Goal 1 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of developing and launching specific initiatives, attendance at EDIA training,and frequency and reach of leadership communications. 23 GOAL L2: Establish a governing structure to drive and prioritiz e EDIA. The Agencywide EDI Council will promote partnership engagement by adopting a collaborative whole-of-agency approach. The purpose of the Council is to drive the implementation of the Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap, whi le fostering opportunities to integrate EDIA into business initiatives and t he IRS culture more broadly. In addition, the Agen cywide EDI Council will support t he enhancement of the employee experience by optimizing EDIA as an IRS priority and i ncorporating these principles into all Agency functions. Membership of the Agencywide ED I Council will be representative of the Agency and include members from all business units and key strategic partn ers: Human Capital Office, Information Technology, IRS NEXT, Procurement, and Comm unications & Liaison; with extended impact to Employee Organizations/Employee Resource Groups, the Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity Advisory Committee, and the National Treasury Employees Union. Achievement of Leadership Goal 2 will be realized through these strategic objectives and aligned initiatives: Objective L2.1: Strengthen the executive leadership structure to promo te accountability Objective L2.2: Assess and improve the sponsorshipand strategic alignment of EO/ERGs and DiversityCouncils L2.1.1 Establish the Agencywide EDI Council (determine goal setting, accountability, r eviewing equity data, score cards, meeting cadence) L2.1.2 Evaluate data management structure needed for analytics L2.1.3 Incorporate the Office of EDI as an advisor in the creation of new workplace policies L2.2.1 Assess structure of existing EO/ERG and diversity councils, provide recommendations for operating model improvements and confirm funding guidance SUGGESTED MEASURES The success of Leadership Goal 2 will be measured through both qualitative and quantitative performance measures to include, but not be limited to, the completion of developing and launching specific initiatives and BOD-specific EO/ERG and diversity council engagement. 24 Implementation Roadmap The Implementation Roadmap prov ides a phased approach for accom plishing the Strategy over the next three years. Phase one focuses on strengthening the foundation across all the priority areas, phase two focuses on enhancing the core elements of each priority area and phase three will expand effo rts across each priority area to attain the goals laid out in this Strategy. Figure 8. High-Level Phased Approach to Strategy Implementation 25 Phase 1 (FY22), as described in Figure 9, focuses on strengthen ing the foundation of EDIA across the Service. Foundational elements to be considered incl ude structure, talent management, communications, EDI culture and operations, learnin g and equity data. Figure 9 shows how the initiatives for Phase 1 are grouped according to the foundational elements, with cross-referencing of the priority areas as indicated by the ico n keys. The graphic below details the interplay of the four priority areas and how they mutually rein force the elements needed to provide a strong EDIA foundation across the Service. Figure 9. Strengthen the Foundation of EDIA Graphic 26 Road to Progress The implementation of this Strategy will require deep partnersh ip and collaboration across the Service and involve elements of governance to set th e IRS on the path to success. It will lay the groundwork for the relationship betwee n progress, risk, budget, and decision-making through an agile implementation process. Th is section raises considerations for accountability , risk mitigation and metrics for measuring progress to set the stage for implementation. Governance The Strategy supports establishing a governing structure that w ill facilitate implementation and accountability across the Service. The Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) and the Deputy Chief Div ersity Officer (DCDO) will overse e progress of overall implementation. The S&R project director will manage and coordi nate the setting of accountability expectations, act as main point of contact for q uestions regarding the Strategy and work closely with points of contact for a smooth implementation process. Risk Implementation Risk - Successful implementation of the Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap requires a strong governance structure, socializati on process and collaboration between various business units. If one of these p illars fails, implementation of the Strategy could be at risk. In addition, t here is the risk that large- scale, agencywide initiatives may deprioritize the Strategy wit hin the organization. Resourcing Risk - The Office of EDI is currently e xperiencing resourcing constraints; therefore, addi tional funding, resources and expertise will be required to implement recommended initiatives. Employee Acceptance Caused by Political Polarization - In today's cultural climate, foundational conversations regarding the principles of EDIA hav e the potential to become hyper-politicized. Employees and leaders may fail to emb race initiatives related to workplace equity because of political or social beli efs. Cultural Readiness and Change Management - Based on initial change management analysis, the Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap c onstitutes a large-scale change. Leaders and many longtime employees may not be ready for a large cultural shift and new ways of working. 27 Suggested Measures of Success Approach A framework for developing KPIs was created to measure the succ ess of the Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap. By gat hering and analyzin g data associated with these measures, the IRS will be able to evaluate the progr ess of this Strategy across the People, Culture, Community and Leadership priority a reas in creating an equitable, diverse, inclusive and accessible workplace. At its highest level, this framework will help assess how the Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap impacts the workforce representation, employee awareness, employee sent iment and business outcomes. To measure progress accurately and consistently, deci sions must be made about reporting timelines, baselines and targets for each initi ative outlined in the previous section. Figure 10. Agencywide EDIA Strategy and Roadmap Performance Measure Framework Graphic Change Management With a focus on change management, the Prosci\u00ae Methodology was applied to the Strategy development to understand the degree of change require d and to better prepare the IRS for implementation. The Prosci\u00ae Methodology focuses on the people who will be impacted by change, the degree to which they are re ady, and what they need to successfully move through change. During the Strategy creation process, we conducted the following assessments to help guide our work: Spo nsorship Assessment, Triangle Assessment (PCT), Risk Assessment (change characteristics assessment and change readine ss) and Group Impact Assessment. 28 Communications Plan At the onset of this initiative, EDI launched a series of commu nications to socialize the development of the Strategy with the IRS workforce to share inf ormation early and often. Similarly, a communic ations plan for leaders, managers a nd the broader workforce will be developed and LPSOHPHQWed with the primary goal of keeping the workforce engaged and contributing to the success of the Strate gy. We have outlined several key communication priorities in the Culture priority area in order to provide consistent and timely messaging on strategic objectives, goals and initiatives across the organization. The success of this Strategy relies on each and every one of us at the IRS. Key levers to achieving this success are transparency, proactive communication and engagement. 29 Appendix Appendix A: Policy and Legislation Recent executive orders provide guidance that directly impact E DIA expectations and requirements. The executive orders include: x Executive Order 13988 on preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation (January 2021) x Executive Order 13985 on advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government (January 2021) x Executive Order 14035 on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility in the Federal workforce (J une 2021) Appendix B: Defining Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessib ility (EDIA) The Office of EDI adheres to the following definitions provided in the Government-Wide Strategic Plan to Advance Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Acce ssibility in the Federal Workforce (November 2021): Diversity The practice of including the many communities, identities, rac es, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures and beliefs of th e American people, including underserved communities. Equity The consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved co mmunities that have been denied such treatment. Inclusion The recognition, appreciation and use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds. Accessibility The design, construction, development, and maintenance of facil ities, information and communication technology, programs, and service s so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and i ndependently use them. Accessibility includes: the provision of accommodations a nd modifications to ensure equal access to employment and particip ation in activities for people with disabilities, the reduction or elimi nation of physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, a commitme nt to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently access every ou tward-facing and internal activity or electronic space, and the pursuit of best practices, such as universal design. 30 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE October 28, 2022 Internal Revenue Service Treasury One Report FEORP FY 2022 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TABLE OF CONTENTS FEORP Plan Accomplishments .......... ........................................................................... .........3 Promising Practices ............................................................................................................................................ 4 Hispanic Employment ........................................................................................................................................ 4 Strategic Activities for People with Disabilities ............. ................................................................................... 6 Progress Tracker and Demogra phic Information on Mentoring and D evelopment Programs ......................... 10 2 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 3 FY 2022 Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Plan (FEORP) PLAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS Throughout Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, the Agency worked diligently to meet and implement requirements set forth in Executive Orders 14035, 13985 and 13988, and continues to collaborate wit h the Department of Treasury to develop a government-w ide Diversity, Equity, Inclus ion, Accessibility (DEIA ) plan. The IRS has many accomplishments from the FY22 FEORP Plan. The annual Manageme nt Directive (MD) 715 S tate of the Agency br iefing was provided to the IRS Commissioner, allowing for the timely submission of MD 715 to T reasury in February. In compliance with the Elijah E. Cummings Federal E mployee Anti-Discrimination Act , the IRS Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) and the Office of Equity, Divers ity & Inclusion (EDI) were real igned effective July 3, 2022, to the bureau head, the IRS Commissioner. The Agency's Diversity & Inclu sion dashboard was developed with input from Equity & Diversity practitioners and will he lp engage IRS leaders in strategic discussions about the workforce's demographics. The dashboard will become activ e after all year end data has be en uploaded. The Agency advanced cultura l awareness by conducting over 575 d iversity & inclusi on engagements, and delivered EEO, reasonable accomm odation and anti-harassment pre sentations to over 34,500 employees; this was a 43 percent and 56 percent increase respectively from FY21 . One session in particular, Inclusive Leadership , was developed and presented to man agers to assist with employ ees returning to offices. The IRS' Civil Rights Unit (CRU) pr ovided presentations to employee s who interact with external facing customers or taxpayers, including IRS Tax Forums in English and Spanish; there were nine CRU events delivered to more tha n 9,500 participants. The IRS conducted special emphasis observance programs for: His panic Heritage Month (360 virtual attendees), National Disability Employment Awareness Month (530 virtual attendees), Veterans Day (500 attendees), Black History Mont h (500 virtual attendees), Women' s History Month (210 virtual attendees), and Pride Month (450 virt ual attendees). The IRS also collabora ted with Treasury and other bureaus for Asian American/Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian Heritage Month (1,015 virtual attendees) and Juneteenth (950 virtual attendees) events. Gue st speakers included IRS emp loyee resource group representatives, senior managers, and executives, as we ll as executives from Treasury. In January 2022, the IRS issued the Gender Neutral Language Gui de that outlines best practices for using gender inclusive language in I RS written work products including guidance and policy documents. The guide served as a reference for Treasur y's Gender Inclusive Language Policy and Guidance document. The IRS implemented t he Agencywide EDIA S trategy and Roadmap (S &R), a critical ste p in realizing the Service's vision of creating an e quitable, diverse, and inclusi ve IRS, fully equippe d to understand, adapt, and support the ever-changing needs of taxpayers and tax administration. The S&R provides a roadmap for increasing diversity in the workpl ace and for strengthening an inclusive culture across the enterprise. The S&R's four priority areas - Pe ople, Culture, Community and Lead ership provides goals and objectives for implementing approx imately 60 initiatives during FY 22-24. In F Y22, 20 key actions/initiatives were accomplished across six S&R Phase I workstreams - Equity Data, EDI Culture and Operations, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 4 Communications, Learning, Governan ce, and Talent Management. Th ese S&R initiatives will advance the principles of EDIA, while build ing the foundation for a workpla ce culture where employees feel they can safely learn, grow, and thrive. PROMISING PRACTICES The Agency's commitment to EDIA principles is helping to suppor t and empower employees. The IRS piloted Diversity & Inclusion ( D&I) persona based learning journeys for external cust omer-facing employees and non-customer facing employees. E ach D&I learning curriculum included related topics that will help individuals succeed in the wor kplace. By building upon a focus of customer-centricity, t he trainings will help to foster an inclusive IRS culture. Learning journey sessions w ere delivered via instru ctors and through self- paced learning. The two cohort pilot groups were supervisory re venue agents and EDI employees. The IRS is reviewing the feedback to make final recommendations on how bes t to roll out the training to all employees. In addition, a similar EDIA leader ship learning journey was ini tiated and offered to Tier 3 Executive Leaders and their direct reports across the Service. The six-week learn ing journey fostered a spa ce for senior leaders to engage in candid discussions on EDIA topics and created oppo rtunities for learni ng, and an expansion of competencies. The feedback from this pilot is also being review ed to make final recomme ndations to roll out to all executives. Another promising practice is our use of multiple social media platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagra m for reaching underserved communities and to engage prospective applicants for jobs. On 7/21/22, the IRS celebrated having 100k followers on Instagram\u2014this reflects the Bureau's commitment to connecti ng with all communities. The IRS was also present at virtual job fairs specifically geared towards fir st generation professionals, the Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and the LGBTQIA community. STRATEGIC ACTIVITIES RELATED TO HISPANIC EMPLOYMENT IN THE FEDE RAL GOVERNMENT This report contains informa tion on the participation, career d evelopment, and recruitment of Hispanics in the IRS. In FY22, through third qua rter, Hispanic employees acc ounted for 15.21 percent of the permanent IRS workforce, compared to 14.32 percent in FY21. This is above the relevant civilia n labor force of 9.96 percent. Below outlines the participation rate of t he Hispanic populatio n in IRS: Ethnicity/Gender REVENUE SERVICE 5 In FY22, a new special emphasis program manager was assigned to lead the Hispanic barr ier analysis (HBA) project team. The HBA p roject team is compri sed of employees fr om varying grades and business divisions, including members of Hispanic Inte rnal Revenue Employees (HIRE) employee organization. The team focused on activities t o address the lower than expected partic ipation, career developm ent, and retention of Hispanics in three major o ccupations and grade levels: x Criminal Investigators, grades 12-15 x Information Technology, grades 12-15 x Revenue Agents, grades 12-15 Barrier analysis overview trai ning was conducted for all team m embers. Data on the H ispanic population was also shared and reviewed by t he team members. The team is d eveloping questions for proposed focus groups and other activitie s to determine if there are any polic ies, practices, or procedures that limit career opportunities of Hispanics in the IRS. The results of the workf orce data, focus groups, and other activities will assist the team to create a plan of action toward increasing the participation of Hispanic employees in higher graded positions. Hispanic Recruitment In FY22, the Strategic Talent An alytics and Recruiting Solution s (STARS) recruitment office attended 15 virtual career fairs at Hispan ic serving institutions. The STARS office collaborated with the EDI office and employee resource groups/employ ee organizations to present information regarding the IRS during these recruitment events. Leadership Development Program The IRS Leadership Development Program (LDP) is a critical link to the IRS Succession Planning Strategy for future leaders. The Leadersh ip Development Programs includ e: Frontline Leader Readiness Program (FLRP), designed to ide ntify and develop employees for front line manager positions; Leading Leaders Readiness Course (LLRC) which pr ovides experienced managers who have high potential and interest in applying for future department and senior manager positions; Ex ecutive Readiness Program (XR) designed for IRS senior managers and GS-14 and above employees who aspir e to apply to the IRS Candidate Development Program, the princi pal means to identify and select employees for the senior executive service.

STRATEGIC ACTIVITIES OR ACTIONS RELATED TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF PE OPLE WITH DISABILITIES Outreach and Recruitment The Strategic Talent Analytics & Recruitment Solutions (STARS) Office hosted over 35 virtual information sessions and career fairs. In par ticular, participated in the ' Ability Virtual Job Fair' and held a virtual recruitment event on Schedule A. STARS collaborated with the Depar tment of Veterans Affairs Vete rans Readiness and Employment (VRE) to conduct a virtual job fair fo r Veterans and disabled Veteran s to provide an overview of available hiring options and breakout sessions wer e also held with various busin ess units. The business units were able to connect with approximately 450 job seekers to provide informati on on current vacancy announcements. The EDI Office in Tax Exempt/Government Entities participated i n a panel, 'A Seat at the Table Fair: Disability, Multicultural and Milita ry' at Georgia State Univer sity Career Fair a nd had 28 participants in attendance. This discussion focused on efforts to support stude nts with disabilities, multicultural backgrounds, and military students. The EDI Office in Wage & Investment established new contacts an d potential partnerships with AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans and Paralyzed Veterans of America to broaden outreac h to communities representing veterans with disabilities. STARS staff conducted an outreac h session with the Military Spouse Employment Program via video to provide information to attendees and promote the benefits of working at the IRS. Additionally, STARS provided an overview of the F ederal hiring process, job announcements, writing effective resumes to Veterans and Military spouses at a local (VRE) chapter (Winston /Salem North Carolina Region). STARS launched a non-comp etitive vacancy announcement that targ ets and collects resumes from Disabled Veteran and Schedule A applican ts to increase utilization of sp ecial hiring authoritie s. This announcement replaced the SharePoint-base d resume repository and provides a larger pool of candidates for non- competitive consideration. These announcements were relaunched in Q2 with enhanced features to facilitate data mining of potential candidates. STARS initiated the migration of the Veterans Program Office (V PO) website from its current platform to the IRS Source page to increas e visibility and traffic to the V PO page. Migration was c ompleted in Q2, and the new platform provides improve d access to important veteran resources. This new pl atform links to other available IRS resources and tra ining opportunities for veterans . Migration of the Schedule A page to the IRS Source page will be c ompleted in FY23. 6 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE During Q2, STARS added a military s pouse hiring tab to the STAR S hiring dashboard t o facilitate 'at-a- glance' data on military spouse targ eted hiring efforts. This tab tracks military spouse sp ecial hiring authority efforts within IRS. There is no current benchmark set by Treasu ry at this time. This initiative will include all military spouses including those with disabilities and will be reported to the Militar y Spouse Employment Program. Hiring and Retention In response to an expected hiri ng surge in FY22, which would likely include a numbe r of new employees with disabilities, the IRS received approval to hire eight additional recruiting a gents and three human resource specialists to form a new branch, Outreach & Talent An alytics, to meet the increase in recruitment and hiring activities. The recruitme nt efforts targeted all emp loyees, direct hires, noncompetitive hires, and those who qualified under other special hiring authorities. STARS held a direct hi ring event at Fort Buc hanan Army Base (Sa n Juan, Puerto Rico). During this event, over 200 tentative job offers were issued on the spot to Vetera ns and disabled Veteran s who qualified for the Veterans Recruitme nt hiring authority. The tables below show IRS' Persons with Disabilities in the wor kforce, hires and separations, FY21 compared to FY22 (Q3); the IRS slightly increased in PWD workforce and hires, and decreased in separations. The IRS exceeds th e 12% goal in the grade grouping s GS 1-10 and GS 11 and above. Persons with Disabilities IRS's Reasonable Ac commodation (RA) program focuse d its efforts on addressing over 6,700 medical and religious ba sed requests for exemption from the vac cination requirements, a s well as more than 3,500 requests for exemption fro m testing and mask wearing requ irements, requests for adaptive technology and telework (including request s to work remotely 100% of the t ime following the Service's 'Return to Office'). Processing RA requests took longe r than usual due to the unprec edented number of reque sts and novel issues arising during the COVID-19 pandemic . While requests for accommodation are pending, managers and employees have been encouraged t o consider possible interim mea sures to meet both the reported needs for accommodation and the business ne eds of the organization. 7 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE The IRS converted the previously published Interim Guidance for Personal Assistance Services (PAS) into Internal Revenue Manual 1.20.5, where managers and employees ca n readily locate the policy/procedures. Information on PAS is also availa ble on the IRS's internal and external websites. Training on PAS was incorporated into broader RA t raining sessions presented to man agers in the Wage & Investment and Small Business/Self-Employed Divisions of the IRS. To date the IRS ha s not received a request for PAS but is poised to respond if/when a request is made. General Services Administration ( GSA) Federal Relay Services (F RS) were successfully transitioned to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Telecommunications Rela y Services (TRS) and contractual services. FRS provides telecomm unications services for federal employees who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing or have speech disabilities. G SA decommissioned FRS on 2/13/22. As a result, all federal agencies were required to standup interna l agency programs. The IRS worked closely with GSA to transition six of the eight telecommunication services from FRS to TRS which is available at no cos t to government agencies. In doing so, the Agency e nsured no loss of coverage for employees, improve d access, and enhanced services. In addition, for the tw o remaining services not covered by TRS, the IRS was able to use GSA's Multiple Awar d Schedule to award c ontracts for Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and R elay Conference Captioning. The IRS met the 2/13/22 deadline for transitioning and standing up all FRS. The total number of sign langua ge and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) services increased each quarter in FY 22 from 1,095 requests received (Q 1) to 1,355 requests (Q3); resulting in an increase of services filled by t he contract vendor (from 397 re quests to 1,005 requests filled, respectively). The number of request s filled by the EDI Si gn Language Interpre ter cadre decreased with employees returning to their office and the n eed for face-to-face service s. The program fill rate increased to 99% in Q3. Education STARS hosted quarterly meetings wit h Veteran Employment Coordinators and hiring managers to provide information and training on non-co mpetitive hiring options for Schedule A candidates. STARS VPO hosted an IRS Veteran's Town Hall featuring a present ation on Veteran Disability claims with approximately 300 Veter ans in attendance. The EDI and General Legal Services offices partnered to develop and deliver reasonable accommodation training for managers, incl uding information on pr oper manageme nt responses to common challenges in decisions where the Service fa iled to accommodate individual em ployees. The training was rolled out to over 500 managers in the Wage & Inve stment organization during three sessions in August 2022. The IRS RA Coordinators received training in Sign Language Inte rpreting, CART Services, as well as EEO (Complaint) Decisions related to reasonable accommodation denia ls. The IRS reasonable accommodati on training cadre presented at le ast 46 training sessions (totaling over 61 hours) on various topics to 3,221 participants (approximately 2 ,338 were managers). Par ticularly noteworthy highlights of these trainings include Reasonable Accommodations Return to Office training for SBSE managers and reasonable accomm odation training sessions to newl y hired EEO counselors. 8 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE The IRS Disability Services divi sion conducted two trainings se ssions for 150 front line mangers on SLI and CART Services. The sessions were intended for new managers and as a refresher for managers that supervise employees who are Deaf and/or Har d of Hearing. Discussions included the SLI virtual, fac e-to-face, remote, and onsite CART services and showcas ed the Telecommunication Re lay Services which included Video Relay Services and Conf erence Captioning. EEO Counselors attended annual c ontinuing professional educatio n (CPE) in August. Three new EEO Counselors also received 32 hours of new Counselor training. Bi -annual CPE was also provided for mediators. 9 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 10 11 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 12 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE Appendix 3 Annual FEORP Plan Certification for the Fiscal Year 2022 A.Name and Address of Bureau: B.Name and Title of Designated FEORP Official (Include e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers.

Print Name __________________________Signatur e ________________________Date ______ __ Title: __________________________________ Capital Huma n Resources) Email Ad dress: Appendix 2 FAQs 1. What stand for and what exactly is it? FEORP stands for the Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP). This report provides data on employment in the Federal workforce and highlights some Human Capital practices Federal agencies are using to recruit, develop, and retain talent. Each year, agencies are asked to certify that they have a FEORP Plan. 2. What is the purpose of the FEORP? The purpose of the FEORP is to promote efforts among Executive agencies to generate diverse applicant pools for Federal Government positions, and to obtain information concerning th ese efforts to make comparisons with the civilian labor force. Each Federal agency prepares FEORP Plans to recruit and retain from diverse applicant pools and address underrepresentation, as applicable. The FEORP is prepared in accordance with the requirements of Title 5, United States Code, section 7201. 3. Who reviews the FEORP? In addition to Congress, OPM monitors and evaluates agency programs to determine their effectiveness in addressing any underrepresentation. OPM works with agencies to develop effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job opportunities targeted to reach candidates from underrepresented groups, as part of their overall recruiting programs, and conducts a continuing program of guidance and instruction to supplement these regulations. In addition, under the Executive Order 13583, Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce , and Executive Order 14035, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce , OPM may review the agency reports to provide consultation and support to agencies to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. 4. Why is this information required when some of the information is already reported in the EEOC Management Directive 715 ( MD-715) report and/or has been provided in response to Executive Order 14035 requirements? The reporting requirements are distinct and interrelated. The FEORP report is prepared in accordance with the requirements of Title 5, United States Code, Section 7201. Information under MD-715 is collected under Section 717 of Title VII and section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act and it is utilized for the EEOC reports to which OPM's Office of Employee Services does not have access. EO 14035 requires OPM to, \"pursue opportunities to consolidate implementation efforts and reporting requirements related to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility established through related or overlapping statutory mandates, Presidential directives, and regulatory requirements.\" Accordingly, agencies may leverage data and information generated during preparation of their promising practices reports and the 100 -day assessments to prepare the Fiscal Year 2021 FEORP, HE, and Individuals with Disabilities Report. Please do not incorporate EO 14035 submissions by reference in response to this reporting call. Rather, please tailor agency responses in alignment with the FEORP Checklist (Appendix 1) and identify relevant policies, successful/promising practices or procedures within the page limit s of each section. 5.

Describe how the agency has communicated the numerical goals to the hiring managers and/or recruiters. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) continues to communicate to IRS leaders and employees the benefits of utilizing special hiring authorities. The agency remains successful in achieving the numeric goals across the Service. The following narrative highlights some of the actions that occurred this year to achieve this overall success: Educate and engage the workforce - The Service continues to raise visibility of the Disability Page 3 DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 2021Program through presentations, meetings, working group sessions, and briefings to IRS leadership. Enhanced visibility has boosted leadership support and involvement in an effort to strengthen the program, including recruitment, hiring, and reasonable accommodations. The IRS provides business units with biweekly hiring summaries. Those summaries show that our hiring of veterans and persons with disabilities is in alignment with Department of the Treasury's goals. The IRS presents the advantages of non-competitive hiring and promotes the use of special hiring authorities through presentations to Business Operating Divisions (BODs) and hosts quarterly forums for recruiters on hiring strategies to aid in reaching targeted goals. Numerical goals and progress toward them are communicated in Business Based operational reviews and are shared during executive briefings. The IRS actively monitors and conducts on-going analysis of the workforce who self-identify as having a disability or targeted disability. The information is used to make informed hiring decisions. Enhance communication, collaboration and consistency - IRS conducts an analysis of the workforce to address the maintenance of numerical goals of PWD/PWTD. Additional outreach activities include, but are not limited to, working with the National Industries for the Blind and Source America to promote employment opportunities, conducting mock interviews for Deaf and Hard of Hearing students at Gallaudet University, and presenting at the Deaf in Government Conference (DIG). Collaboration with our external partners is far reaching and encompasses all 50 states, including Washington, DC., and the territories, and includes over 678 rehabilitation services and agencies. EDI has observed an increase in taxpayer-facing employees who are deaf and require innovative technology to interact with taxpayers. Remote video interpreting through laptops, Federal Relay Service, Ubi-Duo devices and I-phones and I-Pads are being used to facilitate communication in the field and in Taxpayer Assistance Centers. As a result, BODs and EDI partnered to increase employee awareness of taxpayer civil rights and conducted virtual Lunch and Learns. Sessions were marketed Servicewide, including through Employee Organizations and Employee Resource Groups (EO/ERGs). EDI professionals across the Service participate in quarterly Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Federal Exchange on Employment and Disability (FEED) meetings. Leverage Technology - To simplify the application process for disabled applicants and disabled veterans, the IRS developed an assessment tool in USA Staffing (USAS). The generic announcement helps to solicit and recruit for \"Individuals with Disabilities and Disabled Veterans\" (10 point preference). To address the Service's inability to obtain Schedule A workforce data in a simplified manner, the Human Capital Office (HCO) began developing an automated prototype system to address \"special hiring authorities\" . This will allow the IRS to obtain non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII ) Schedule A workforce data to provide monthly reports and perform trend analysis. Section II: Model Disability Program Pursuant to 29 C.F .R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(1), agencies must ensure sufficient staff, training and resources to recruit and hire persons with disabilities and persons with targeted disabilities, administer the reasonable accommodation program and special emphasis program, and oversee any other disability hiring and advancement program the agency has in place.

[see MD-715, II(C)] If \"no\" , please provide the percentage of timely-processed requests, excluding ongoing interpretative services, in the comments column. Objective The Agency will take steps to reexamine the current Reasonable Accommodation procedures and establish appropriate metrics to ensure accurate timeframes are in place in an effort to improve the Agency's timely processing of reasonable accommodation cases. Target Date Sep 30, 2019 Completion Date Target Planned Activity Completion Date Planned ActivitiesJul 30, 2015 Aug 1, 2015 Oct 1, 2015 Feb 15, 2018 Apr 30, 2018Jun 30, 2017 May 30, 2015 May 30, 2015 June 30, 2019 June 11, 2021The Agency will expand the assessment of case cycle-time to include FY12 - FY 15 cases: a) identify where barriers to service delivery; b) evaluate the use of extenuating circumstance codes; and c) accurately define RA case processing timeframes. FY 16 will serve as a baseline year for testing the proposed measures, with continuous improvements being implemented in future years. The Agency will fully assess the Fiscal Y ear (FY) 14 RA closed case inventory by type to define RA timeliness measures to support the development of measures. The Agency will fully study the FY 14 closed RA inventory to identify cases meeting the current extenuating circumstances definition to specifically understand where barriers are to delivery. EDI will collaborate with the Human Capital Office (HCO) Automated Labor & Employee Relations Tracking System (ALERTS) database administrative team to initiate the identification and adding of new coding in the system to help address when various phases of the RA process cases should be suspended and to identify other inefficiencies. The Agency will implement the approved cycle time(s) and procedures recommended following: a) approval of recommended cycle -time change(s)internally and through Treasury and EEOC; b) training of personnel on the new procedures and cycle-time(s); c) notice to Labor Relations Strategy & Negotiations (LRSN) of the changes for notification to NTEU; d) revision of IRM1 .20.2 and the National Agreement as necessary.DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 2021Page 6Dec 10, 2018 Nov 15, 2019 Dec 21, 2021Dec 7 , 2018 June. 11, 2021The Agency will re-examine current RA procedures through a mapping and modeling process. Develop and implement a communications strategy to notify both managers, employees and strategic partners (FMSS), IT and IRAP) of the change in cycle timeframes. The agency will conduct an assessment of the reasonable accommodation process to identify opportunities to expedite decision making and fulfillment of RA needs, and implement any approved recommendation for enhancing the process. Accomplishments Fiscal Y ear Accomplishment 2019 2020The Reasonable Accommodation Coordinators are making more effective and consistent use of applicable suspense codes in the reasonable accommodations request tracking systems (ALERTS). As a result of more accurate tracking and case handling enhancements, the IRS has experienced slight increases this fiscal year in the number of requests for accommodation resolved within 30 days of the original request. The IRS updated its reasonable accommodation procedures, making editorial changes such as adding program control information, fixing/eliminating broken hyperlinks, changing office names and contact information etc. These changes did not alter the timeframe for processing accommodation requests. The IRS's contract with the union representing Bargaining Unit employees prescribes a 15-day period for implementing reasonable accommodations. The IRS also generally has an obligation to bargain with the union concerning implementation of changes to processes that impact Bargaining Unit employees. The Service must remain cognizant of its Labor obligations when modifying the timeframe(s) or making other changes to reasonable accommodation processes. The IRS is undertaking a review and analysis of its reasonable accommodation decision making and fulfilment processes to identify opportunities for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. In February 2020 the IRS began a Lean Six Sigma evaluation of its RA processes. In July 2020 the LSS team concluded the data gathering phase of the study. In order to better position the LSS team to analyze the data and formulate recommended changes to processes best calculated toincrease efficiency in the fulfillment of reasonable accommodation needs the IRS moved to include senior subject matter experts from the Facilities Management & Security Services as well as Information Technology functions in the LSS effort. The LSS team expects to present its findings and recommendations for changes to processes in early Fiscal Y ear 2021 . Those recommendations will need to be vetted with partner support functions and might necessitate either contract or impact bargaining with the union before implementation.Page 7 DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 20212021 The IRS continued a Lean Six Sigma evaluation of its RA processes. The LSS team identified and implemented quick hits with all Business Units. Preliminary data suggests that the quick-hits are yielding beneficial results, including a 47% decrease in cycle time. On June 11, 2021, the Service published updated reasonable accommodation procedures. Editorial changes were made for clarity and accuracy, including updating titles, website addresses, and legal and other references. The updates clarified: If an accommodation can be provided in less than the maximum amount of time permitted, then it must be provided as soon as possible. Failure to do so might result in a finding that the agency violated applicable law. The agency will not be expected to adhere to its usual timelines if an individual's health professional fails to provide needed documentation in a timely manner; moreover, the status of a pending request may be ascertained by contacting the servicing Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator. Changed theprocessing timeframe from 15 to 20 workdays and clarified that the processing timeframe is not tolled while a determination is made as to whether medical documentation is needed. Eliminated a provision authorizing a Deciding Official up to five days to provide written notice of a denial decision. Section IV: Plan to Recruit and Hire Individuals with Disabilities Pursuant to 29 C.F .R. \u00a71614.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), agencies must establish a plan to increase the recruitment and hiring of individuals with disabilities. The questions below are designed to identify outcomes of the agency's recruitment program plan for PWD and PWTD A. PLAN TO IDENTIFY JOB APPLICATIONS WITH DISABILITIES 1. Describe the programs and resources the agency uses to identify job applicants with disabilities, including individuals with targeted disabilities. The IRS continues to have a presence at recruitment/outreach events for PWD/PWTD candidates. The Service has conducted mock interviews for Deaf and Hard of Hearing students at Gallaudet University, provided a presentation at the Deaf in Government Conference (DIG), and interviewed student candidates with disabilities from the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP). Informational interviews were conducted via telephone with students to provide career advice, information about applying for IRS jobs, and resume tips. IRS maintains a Schedule A repository to facilitate Non-Competitive placements. Applicants who provide a copy of their resume and Schedule A letter are added to the repository for consideration for noncompetitive placement. When management elects to fill a vacancy using non-competitive procedures, the Schedule A Program Manager provides them with qualified applicants from the repository. At their discretion, managers may contact candidates they wish to consider for an interview.DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 2021Page 82. Pursuant to 29 C.F .R. \u00a71614.203(a)(3), describe the agency's use of hiring authorities that take disability into account (e.g., Schedule A) to recruit PWD and PWTD for positions in the permanent workforce. The agency has incorporated the use of non-competitive hiring authorities into management discussions and training, and strongly encourages the use of non-competitive hiring authorities under both Schedule A for Individuals with Disabilities and the 30% or More Disabled Veterans authority for recruiting PWD and PWTD into the permanent workforce. The Schedule A Program Manager forwards qualified applicant resumes to hiring officials for review and consideration. The IRS has also established a Personal Assistance Services (PAS) program. PAS is a component of the IRS's affirmative action effort to expand employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. To date, a request for PAS has not been received. However, the IRS continues to publicize the program via presentations and through web content. 3. When individuals apply for a position under a hiring authority that takes disability into account (e.g., Schedule A), explain how the agency (1) determines if the individual is eligible for appointment under such authority; and, (2) forwards the individual's application to the relevant hiring officials with an explanation of how and when the individual may be appointed. The IRS adheres to Schedule A guidelines as outlined in the code of federal regulations. Applicants who wish to have their disability considered in the hiring process are required to provide proof of permanent disability. When management elects to fill a vacancy using non-competitive procedures, the IRS HR coordinators who manage the Schedule A and 30% Disabled Veterans programs provides resumes of qualified candidates from the repository. At management's discretion, they may contact the candidates they wish to consider for an interview. 4. Has the agency provided training to all hiring managers on the use of hiring authorities that take disability into account (e.g., Schedule A)? If \"yes\" , describe the type(s) of training and frequency. If \"no \", descr ibe the agency's plan to provide this training. Answer Y es The IRS provides training to managers that includes the Schedule \" A \" Hiring Process. The trainings emphasize the benefits of hiring persons with disabilities, and veterans, while encouraging hiring managers to use Schedule A and Veteran hiring paths when announcing positions on USAJobs for competitive announcements or USAStaffing for non-competitive recruiting. The Human Capital Office (HCO) provides training to Business Based Divisions (BBDs) upon request, and each BBD provides a variety of training on disability employment. B. PLAN TO ESTABLISH CONTACTS WITH DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZATIONS Describe the agency's efforts to establish and maintain contacts with organizations that assist PWD, including PWTD, in securing and maintaining employment. IRS Business Operating Divisions (BODs) continue to explore different avenues for reaching potential candidates with disabilities/ targeted disabilities. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the IRS has continued to leverage established relationships/partnerships with organizations that assist with PWD/PWTD to include, but not limited to: Bender Consulting Department of Veterans Affairs Gallaudet University National Federation for the Blind the Independent Living Resources Utilization SourceAmerica Department of Vocational Rehabilitation Centers The Service also participates in outreach vehicles, including socialPage 9 DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 2021networks and virtual communities that are used by disabled veterans to make the disabled veterans aware of IRS employment opportunities. The IRS Local Accessibility Coordinators (LAC) remains an essential resource for helping to retain employees with disabilities. The LACs and EDI work in partnership with supporting offices, such as Information Resources Accessibility Program, Alternative Media Center, Learning & Education, and W&I Integrated Talent Management to provide field support to the LACs to ensure employees with disabilities receive the same access to services, programs, technology, electronic information, and facilities, and to ensure they are included in activities and developmental opportunities are provided to those without disabilities. All applicants are required to provide proof of permanent disability. Qualified resumes are forwarded to hiring officials for review and consideration. C.

Do triggers exist for PWD among the applicants and/or selectees for any of the career development programs? (The appropriate benchmarks are the relevant applicant pool for the applicants and the applicant pool for selectees.) If \"yes\" , describe the trigger(s) in the text box. Select \"n/a\" if the applicant data is not available for your agency, and describe your plan to provide the data in the text box. a. Applicants (PWD) Answer No b. Selections (PWD) Answer No Internship Programs: There were 7 participants in the IRS Presidential Management Fellows; 28.57% were PWD. There were 27 participants in the IRS Internship program; five (18.52%) were PWD. Applicant data was not available to determine the benchmark to identify triggers. Detail Programs: A review of the Detail Opportunities Program revealed that of the 13,311* applicants for details at the GS-11 and above level, 1636 (12.29%) were PWD. Of the 851 selected, 90* (10.58%) were selected, therefore, a trigger exists. * Missing disability data on 242 applicants and nine selectees. Leadership Development Programs: Relevant Pool, Applicants, Selections Grade Program (CDP) applicants with PWD are below the Relevant Pool of grade equivalent 14 through 15. Data from the last CDP announcement where selections were made in FY 2021 showed 7 .53% of applicants were PWD. However, only 5.88% of selections were PWD. IRS has a trigger in the CDP when comparing selection rates to the applicant pool rates for PWD. The FY 2021 XR announcement showed 13.40% of applicants were PWD, which is above the relevant pool. However, only 5.77% of selections were PWD. A trigger exists in PWD selections in the XR Program. 4. Do triggers exist for PWTD among the applicants and/or selectees for any of the career development programs? (The appropriate benchmarks are the relevant applicant pool for the applicants and the applicant pool for selectees.) If \"yes\" , describe the trigger(s) in the text box.

In this section, agencies should: (1) analyze workforce separation data to identify barriers retaining employees with disabilities; (2) describe efforts to ensure accessibility of technology and facilities; and (3) provide information on the reasonable accommodation program and workplace assistance services. A. VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY SEPARATIONS 1. In this reporting period, did the agency convert all eligible Schedule A employees with a disability into the competitive service after two years of satisfactory service (5 C.F .R. \u00a7 213.3102(u)(6)(i))? If \"no\" , please explain why the agency did not convert all eligible Schedule A employees. Answer No Of the 38 Schedule A conversions (from October 1, 2020 thru July 31, 2021), 36 conversions were processed with 2 employees not yet converted. Of these 2 employees, one (eligible for conversion in September of 2021) was off for an extended period. When the employee returned to work, there was a decline in performance; therefore, the performance period was extended 90 days for observation to ensure the position is still a good fit. The other employee had extensive LWOP and the Employment Office is currently awaiting guidance from the Policy office to determine how the LWOP affects the conversion date. 2. Using the inclusion rate as the benchmark, did the percentage of PWD among voluntary and involuntary separations exceed that of persons without disabilities? If \"yes\" , describe the trigger below. a. Voluntary Separations (PWD) Answer Y es b.

If a trigger exists involving the separation rate of PWD and/or PWTD, please explain why they left the agency using exit interview results and other data sources. Of the PWD and PWTD that separated from the agency, 42.4% retired and 37 .8% resigned. The Exit Survey results showed that PWD/PWTD resigned due to personal circumstances (34.3%) or transferred to another agency (17 .9%). Job related stress had the highest impact on this group, 43.8%. Over half (52.2%) of PWD respondents indicated they would return to work after separating due to Job-Related Stress, and more (63.0%) indicated that something could have been done to prevent them from separating. B. ACCESSIBILITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES Pursuant to 29 CFR \u00a71614.203(d)(4), federal agencies are required to inform applicants and employees of their rights under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(b), concerning the accessibility of agency technology, and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4151-4157), concerning the accessibility of agency facilities. In addition, agencies are required to inform individuals where to file complaints if other agencies are responsible for a violation. 1. Please provide the internet address on the agency's public website for its notice explaining employees' and applicants' rights under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, including a description of how to file a complaint. https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/accessibility-notice-of-rightsDTR Internal Revenue Service FY 2021Page 222. Please provide the internet address on the agency's public website for its notice explaining employees' and applicants' rights under the Architectural Barriers Act, including a description of how to file a complaint https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/taxpayer-accessibility-guide.pdf 3. Describe any programs, policies, or practices that the agency has undertaken, or plans on undertaking over the next fiscal year, designed to improve accessibility of agency facilities and/or technology. The Internal Revenue Service is committed to ensuring accessibility of agency facilities and technology for employees, the taxpaying communities we serve and the partner organizations that are provided federal financial assistance. Highlights of improvement actions the agency has undertaken in FY21 are as follows: The Service conducts annual compliance visits with recipients of federal financial assistance. The compliance visits provide proactive opportunities to assess the accessibility of program recipients' facilities and programs. Recommendations about how to improve accessibility are made during the compliance visits. 100% of compliance visits were conducted virtually at 67 sites. As a result of the pandemic, during FY21, many recipients continued to operate following modified guidelines to incorporate safety protocols. Thus, sites operated in a drop-off, virtual, or closed capacity. In July 2019, the IRS received a letter from the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) regarding availability of IRS notices in alternative formats such as Braille and large print for taxpayers with a visual impairment. The letter was followed by a complaint filing in federal court against the IRS which alleged that the agency violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. However, a settlement agreement was reached the following year. As a result, the IRS has agreed to develop and implement a process to allow blind taxpayers to request post-filing tax notices, such as notices about additional taxes or penalties owed in Braille, large print, or electronic formats. The alternative media process (AMP) is on target to be fully implemented by January 31, 2022. The Integrated Talent Management (ITM) Insider Threat Awareness mandatory briefing was found to not be accessible for IRS employees that are JAWS users; therefore, a Section 508 compliant text version of the briefing was created to allow access for timely completion. IRS funds approximately $10,000 for the cost of television production of annual mandatory briefings in American Sign Language (ASL) for deaf and hard of hearing employees. EDI worked with IT to download videophone software to laptops of deaf IRS employees and IRS Sign Language Interpreters to receive remote video interpreting services while working from home during the pandemic. These users were previously accommodated with in-person sign language interpreting services. Because of COVID-19 protocols, assistive technology users do not have the option for one-on-one training currently. In the interim, the Service has provided training videos until one-on-one sessions can be resumed. Experienced users were solicited to assist new users needing additional help after viewing the videos. C. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROGRAM Pursuant to 29 C.F .R. \u00a7 1614.203(d)(3), agencies must adopt, post on their public website, and make available to all job applicants and employees, reasonable accommodation procedures. 1. Please provide the average time frame for processing initial requests for reasonable accommodations during the reporting period. (Please do not include previously approved requests with repetitive accommodations, such as interpreting services.) Average processing time in FY21 for Reasonable Accommodations was 58 business days.Page 23 DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 20212. Describe the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, or practices to implement the agency's reasonable accommodation program. Some examples of an effective program include timely processing requests, timely providing approved accommodations, conducting training for managers and supervisors, and monitoring accommodation requests for trends. In 2020, the IRS began a Lean Six Sigma (LSS) evaluation of its Reasonable Accommodation (RA) processes. Following data gathering, including eliciting input from all Business Operating Division (BODs), the LSS team identified several 'quick-hits' which were socialized with all business units and implemented. The quick hits pertained to expediting accommodation request assessments and approval/denial, as well as fulfillment of accommodation needs involving adaptive technology or furniture and workspace modifications. Preliminary data suggests the quick-hits are yielding beneficial results as average RA case processing time decreased 13 days during the first quarter the quick-hits were in effect. In 2021, the Service published updated reasonable accommodation procedures. The updates clarified that if an accommodation can be provided in less than the maximum amount of time permitted, it must be provided, and that failure to do so might result in a finding that the agency violated applicable law. The agency will not be expected to adhere to its usual timelines if an individual's health professional fails to provide needed documentation in a timely manner. The updated procedures changed the processing timeframe from 15 to 20 workdays and clarified that the processing timeframe is not tolled while a determination is made as to whether medical documentation is needed. The updated procedures eliminated a provision authorizing a Deciding Official up to five days to provide written notice of a denial decision. Editorial changes were made throughout the procedures for clarity and accuracy, including updating titles, website addresses, and legal and other references. In FY21, Reasonable Accommodation Services conducted a total of 23 training sessions for IRS personnel covering topics such as Reasonable Accommodation, Service Animals, Disability Etiquette and Personal Assistance Services to a total of 2,998 participants of whom approximately 629 were managers. EDI has observed an increase in taxpayer-facing employees who are deaf and require innovative technology to interact with taxpayers. Remote video interpreting through laptops, Federal Relay Service, Ubi-Duo devices and I-phones and I-Pads are being used to facilitate communication in the field and in Taxpayer Assistance Centers. D. PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORKPLACE Pursuant to 29 CFR \u00a71614.203(d)(5), federal agencies, as an aspect of affirmative action, are required to provide personal assistance services (PAS) to employees who need them because of a targeted disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the agency. Describe the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, or practices to implement the PAS requirement. Some examples of an effective program include timely processing requests for PAS, timely providing approved services, conducting training for managers and supervisors, and monitoring PAS requests for trends. The IRS has established a Personal Assistance Services (PAS) program. PAS is a component of the IRS's affirmative action effort to expand employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. The IRS will contract for services to support employees who due to their targeted disabilities are unable to attend to personal needs (e.g. feeding themselves, using the restroom, dressing). In March 2020, the IRS published Interim Guidance regarding PAS, obtained approved funding for the effort and created aTask Order to utilize the Blanket Purchase Agreement established by Department of the Treasury. In June 2020, a Service-wide communication was sent to all managers and employees announcing the program. Interested persons were invited to contact Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI). To date, we have not received any requests for PAS. The IRS continues to publicize the program via web content presentations and lunch and learn sessions.DTR Internal Revenue Service FY 2021Page 24Section VII: EEO Complaint and Findings Data A.

This commi tment not only extends throughout the IRS workforce, but to the taxpayers, tax practitioners, and communi ties with whom the IRS engages. The IR S is committed to fostering an inclusive workforce that reflects America's diversit y through effective outreach, r ecruitment, hiring and employee development. While div ersity and inclusion can mea n different things to different people acro ss the different cultures, the i mportance of belonging is universal. (3) Definitions: Diversity At the IRS, diversity is a broad concept that encompasses all t he differences that employees bring to work. Diversity, therefore, includes the traditional focus around race and gender, ethnicity, individual s with disabilities, veterans, sexual orientation and religion, but also includes di versity of thought, ideas, backgrounds, and experiences. (4) Inclusion Inclusion, one of IRS's core values, occurs when we leverage and engage every employee's unique strength s and talents so that eve ryone can contribute to his or her full potential. Diversity coupled with inclusion is a long- term business strategy that wi ll help fuel the innovative outco mes and continual improvement necessary for our future success. (5) Belonging Belonging is when employees feel their insights and contributio ns are valued. A sense of belonging means that each employee can bring their f ull identit y to work, and not feel like they are a different person in the work place than they are at home. Enabling everyone a t the IRS to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to our continued success. It is imper ative that barriers are cleared, each voice is heard and understood, and e ach of us appreciate others for their unique perspectives and backgrounds . (6) Equity Equity ensures fairness and respect. Employees feel supported, valued, trusted and able to achieve their personal best, and it means t axpayers and other stakeholders a re treated equally. Equity encompasses lega l obligations and requirements for non-discrimination, civil rights, reasonab le accommodations and equal employment opportunity. (7) Accountability Leveraging diversity and inclusion is critical to our mission, workforce and taxpayers. Each IRS employee and manager is responsible for promoting diversity and inclusion an d demonstrating inclusive behaviors. This creates an organizational culture that fosters workforce diversity and inclusion resulting in a more engaged workforce. Greater engagement of employees from all backgrounds yields greater perso nal satisfaction and higher lev els of productivity. Our atti tudes, words, actions and inactions all impact the workplace environment. Diversity a nd inclusion are an investmen t and is essential to improve our ability to drive innovation, solve complex problems, serve taxpayers and achieve our mission. Each of us must strive to treat one another with dignity and respect , be open to learning about our differences and seek to leverage individual a ttributes that will make the I RS stronger. To reach employees full potential, everyone must hold each other a ccountable and lead by example. (8) Signed: Charles P.

It is mission-focused an d outlines human capital goals, strategies and measures aimed at strengthening IRS's capacity t o deliver on its mission. Our human capital (HC) strategies align with and support the IRS and United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) Stra tegic Plans, critical management initiatives and other human capital drivers (i.e., United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Workforce Priorities, President Management Agenda Items and/or Executive Orders) and the IRS mission to enforce the nation's tax laws. Part of this effort includes ensuring the developed HC strategi es identify and close current and a nticipated skill (staffing and competency) gaps. This plan includes measures that will enable evaluation of the identified HC strategies through regular reviews within the Huma n Capital Office (HCO), IRS and Treasury reviews to ensure progress toward the achievement of HC goals. The HCOP serves as the map to ensuring that we are moving in a result-focused, forward-thinking direction towa rd our desired outcome(s). The HCOP is accompanied by an annual human capital action plan (App endix A), which provides the tactical details to support the HCOP.

Through HRStat, IRS HCO will hold itself accountable for result-driven, strategically focused hum an capital programs and activities. There are several drivers for HRStat including: legal requireme nts and external mandates (i.e., Government Performance Reporting Modernization Act, OMB require ments, etc.). Human capital strategies and action items will be selected from the annual human capital action plan (Appendix A), no less than quarterly, to track measures an d metrics. Selected items will be evaluated by the Human Capital Office leadership, in partnershi p with the human capital action item owners, to determine if revisions to the strategies, actio n items, measures or metrics require modifications to achieve goals. The results of those evaluation s will roll into Business Process Reporting and Quarterly Performance Reporting. During quarterly HRStat reviews, IRS HCO leadership may add add itional strategies, action items, measures and metrics to m onitor the effectiveness of achieving the IRS strategic human capital goals. FY Evaluation Timeline Page 16 of 33 Utilization of the Human Capital Operating Plan Success of the outlined IRS Huma n Capital Strategic Goals requi res the commitment of IRS leadership throughout the organization.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE 715 APPENDIX C FY22 TREND ANALYSES IRS MD 715 Tr end Analyses IRS Workforce Demographics Annually, the IRS completes a multi-year trend analysis of the overall workforce (permanent and temporary) employees. This year, the IRS conducted a five-year trend analysis from FY18 to FY22. The data source for this section is the Department of the Treasury' s data Insight database in the form of a report builder query and Management Directive (MD) 715 Tables. The workforce data includes all IRS organizations except the IRS Chief Counsel office. The demographics section focused on workforce trends in the following areas: IRS total workforce, race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, and major occupations. Th e IRS conducted data analyses utilizing the National Civilian Labor Force (NCLF), the Occupational Civilian Labor Force (OCLF), and the Relevant Civilian Labor Force (RCLF) statistics. Utilizing the RCLF prov ides the IRS with an opportunity to ensure that civilian labor force statistics are aligned with the types of positions that make-up the IRS workforce. In the major occupations section of this appendix, there is detailed information in an \"at-a-glance\" view for the mission critical occupations. Section 1: Total Workforce The IRS workforce increased making FY22 the largest workforce in five years. When comparing the number of employees in FY18 to FY22, the data depicted a net gain of 8.0 percent in the workforce, resulting in a total gain of 6,147 employees over a five-year p eriod. The chart below provides a comparison of total workforce populations. Figure One: IRS Total Population by Fiscal Year IRS MD 715 Tr end Analyses Section 2: Demographic Group Distributions IRS is a racially diverse workforce. At the end of FY22, employ ees classified with racial and ethnic backgrounds other than White comprised 54.34 percent of the wor kforce. A comparison of the participation rates for each racial and eth nic group to the corresponding Relevant Civilian Labor Force (RCLF) benchmarks, show the participation rates for White and American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) employees were each less than their respective RCLF. Male participation rates were less than the RCLF and female participation rates were greater than the RCLF. During the five-year period, the workforce participation rates for White and AIAN employees decreased while Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, and employees who are two or more races increased in participation. Gender workforce participation rates remained about the same. Figure Two: IRS Total Workforce Distribution by Racial & Ethnic Origin & Gender NCLF 715 Tr end Analyses Section 3: Demographic Group by Grades The average General Schedule (GS) grade for IRS employees in FY 22 was GS-9.1. Black, Hispanic, AIAN, NHPI, and TMR employees, had an average GS grade (ranging GS-8.1 to GS-8.9) less than the IRS average grade. The average grade for males was GS-10.0, whi ch was above the average grade for all IRS employees. However, the average grade for females was GS-8.7, which was less than the average grade for all IRS employees. In the Senior Executive Service (SES), Black, Hispanic, Asian, NHPI, and TMR employees had low participation rates compared to their workforce participation r ates. In addition, Black, Hispanic, AIAN, and TMR employees had low participation rates in GS-13 to GS-15 com pared to their workforce participation rates. Males had low participation rates in grades GS-1 to GS-8 , while females had low participation rates in grades GS-9 to SES. Figure Three: IRS Total Workforce Grade Distribution by Racial & Ethnic Origin GS (and equivalents) IRS AverageFY 2022 1-8 MD 715 Tr end Analyses Section 4: Total Workforce by Age Group & Years of Service The overall range for the age of IRS employees spanned from 17 to 99 years with an average age of 48.1 years; 72.9 percent of the workforce was 40 year s and older. A steep decline in participation rates within the age groups is evident as employees moved close r to common retirement ages. Employees who identified as Black, Hispanic, NHPI, TMR, and female were younger than the IRS average age. Figure Four: IRS Total Workfo rce Distributi on by Age Group At the end of FY22, the average years of Federal service were 1 4.0 years, and the average years of IRS service were 13.5 years. For additional details on the IRS work force, see the At-A-Glance (AAG) on pages 11 to 17. IRS MD 715 Tr end Analyses Section 5: Disability Group Distributions In FY17, Treasury implemented the new \"501 Goal\" and expanded t he disability categories. In addition, a new goal was established for PWD, 12 percent and the PWTD goal remained at 2 percent. In FY22, the IRS exceeded the goal with a participation rate of 13 .59 percent for PWD and 3.33 percent for PWTD. Figure Five: IRS Total Workforce Distribution by Disability Gro up Goal FY2018 FY2019 FY2020 3.33% *Beginning FY2017. There is no requirement to maintain specific participation rate s at each grade level. However, PWD and PWTD participation is much higher in the lower grades (GS-10 an d below) than at the higher grades (GS-11 and above). Ignoring SES, the average grade level of PWD and PWTD is 9.1 and 8.6 respectively. In comparison, the average grade of IRS employees is a GS-9.1. Figure Six: IRS Total Workforce Grade Distribution by Disabilit y Group Goal GS-1-10 GS-11+ Average Grade Persons with a Disability 12.00% 13.80% 13.41% 9.1 Persons with a Targeted Disability 2.00% 3.68% 2.85% 8.6 Since the grade distribution is not symmetric but skewed, the m edian grade level provides more actionable information. The median grade level of employees wit h a disability (regardless of the type of disability) is a GS-8. This means that half of the employees wi th a disability are above the GS-8 level while the other half is less than the GS-8 level. IRS MD 715 Tr end Analyses Section 6: IRS Total Workforce Distribution by the Major Occupa tion IRS's major occupations are series 512, 592, 962, 1169, 1811, a nd 2210. Below is the OPM classification for each of thes e occupations. Pages 11-17 show a three-year (FY20 to FY22) at-a-glance trend for each of these major occupations that include total wo rkforce, eligibility to retire, age, grade, disability, gender, ethnicity, and veteran status compared to a gency goals. 4A.

(Source: OPM Classification) Section 7: IRS Total Workforce Hires During FY22, there were 15,427 hires which is a 48.2% increase from FY21 which had 10,408 hires. Figure Seven: IRS Total Workforce Hires by Racial & Ethnic Orig in & Gender end Analyses The hire rates for White, AIAN, and Males were below the RCLF.

IRS MD 715 Tr end Analyses Types of Separations There are two types of separations: x Non-adverse is when an employee voluntarily leaves. x Adverse is when the agency initiates an employee's departure. When segmenting the attrition data by non-adverse and adverse actions, the data suggests that in FY22, 93.5 percent of IRS separations resulted from a non-adverse personnel action. The remaining 6.5 percent of total separations were initiated by the agency and s tem from an adverse personnel action. Figure Ten: IRS Total Workforce Separations by Type FY2020 Resignations have been higher than retirements in the last two years. Compared to FY20, resignations increased 17.84 percentage points. 9 IRS MD 715 Grade Trends Grade Trends This iteration of the Grade Trends covers shifts in the total workforce, primarily FY18-FY22 and includes the following pay plans: General Schedule (GS), Internal Revenu e Pay Band (IR), Administratively Determined (AD), Senior Executive Service (SES), Executive Pay (EX), and Senior Level Positions (SLP). To simplify reporting, grade-level data is reported in f our grade clusters: Grades 1-8 equivalent (cluster 1), Grades 9-12 equival ent (cluster 2), Grades 13-15 e quivalent (cluster 3), and Senior Level Positions (SL) and executive (EX, AD, SES) (cluster 4) position s. The objective of this section is to provide information regardi ng the representation of employees in common grade groups based on gender, ethnicity, race, and disab ility status. Additional quantitative information about the senior-level feeder groups (Grades GS-14 and GS-15) is also captured in this section. The data source for this section is Treasury's Data In sight database in the form of a report builder query and Management Directive (MD)-715 Tables (found in the Appendix) unless otherwise noted. The IRS Chief Counsel i s not included in this analysis. Section 1: Grade Distribution 1.A. Gender Females continue to have the highest participation rate in the IRS's lower grades (Figure 1). Females outnumber males nearly 3 to 1 in the GS 1-8 cluster and 2 to 1 in the mid-grades (GS 9-12). However, the percentage of females and males in the GS 13-15 range is ne arly equal. Females comprise nearly two-thirds of IRS employees; however, t hey are not distributed equally across all grade levels. In FY19, the overall IRS female participation rate was 65%, workforce. This patt ern continued in FY20, with females comprising 65% of total workforce FY21, the pattern persisted, with females comprising 65% of the total workforce with employees. The pattern of decrease d female participation throughout the grade structure continued through FY22 as well; despite making up 65% of the total workforce, were FY14, workforce data has shown that females have had a hi gher than expected participation rate in the higher grades. In FY14, the percentage of IRS employees tha t were GS 1-8 females (35.5%) was over twice the percentage of IRS employees that were GS 1-8 mal es (12.5%). In contrast, 13.5% and 13.2% of the IRS workforce were GS 13-15 females and males resp ectively in FY14. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends Since FY14, the participation rate of females has increased by two percentage points a t the lower grade level, and by half a percentage point at the upper grade levels . Their participation rate has decr eased by 2.6 percentage points in t he mid-grades. The opposite pattern persists for males who tend to have lower participation rates in the lower grades, represented as expected in the middle grades, and a high partic ipation rate in the higher grades. In FY22, males made up nearly 35% of the total IRS workforce with 27% GS GS 9-12, and nearly 50% of GS 13-15 employees. Both the male and female workforce distribution patterns have b een relatively consistent over the past five fiscal years (Figure 1). However, the workforce participat ion rate of females at the GS 13-15 level has slowly but steadily increased between FY18-21 but decreased slightly in FY22. Furthermore, the female participation at the mid-grades has steadily decreased. Figure 1: Workforce by Grade and Gender Executive level positions have historically been dominated by m ales (Figure 2) even though males make up one-third of the IRS workforce overall. There is much volati lity in the executive level gender gap. In FY16, the gender gap was 2.4 points (not shown). In FY18, the gender gap decreased to 1.8 percentage points but in FY19, it blossomed to 7.1 percentage p oints. In FY20, the gap increased again to 8.8 percentage points but was reduced to 8.2 percentage poin ts in FY21. In FY22, the gap increased again to 12.8 percentage points. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends Despite making up 65% of the total IRS workforce, only 44% of t he Service's executives are female. In FY21, females made up 46% of the Service's executive cadre. Und erstanding this variability is the first step in ensuring females are adequately represented at the SES level. Figure 2: SES Stratified by Gender 2.B. Disability Status The participation rate of persons with disabilities (PWDs) stea dily increased, from 12.1% in FY18 to 13.6% in FY22 (Figure 3). In comparison, the participation rate for persons with targeted disabilities (PWTDs) has decreased slightly from 3.7% in FY18 to 3.3% in FY2 2. The Service continues to meet its overall benchmarks of 12% for PWDs and 2% for PWTDs. Despite meeting the overall targets, these employees are not distribute d equally across the grade structure as they are more likely to be lower-graded employees. In FY22, nea rly 14% of 15% compared to 12.3% of GS 13-15 employees. This pattern of low participation of PWDs as one looks up the grade structure has been evident (a nd similar in magnitude) over the past six fiscal years. While not as steep, the pattern of decreased participation is also evident for PWTDs. In FY22, 3.7% of GS 1-8 employees GS 9-12 employees and 2.6% of GS 13-15 employees. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends Figure 3: Workforce Stratified by Disability and Grade The IRS SES PWD participation rate has consistently been below the 12% PWD threshold; however, it has steadily increased from 8.8% in FY18 to 11.7% in FY21, but then decreased to 9.7% in FY22. The SES PWD participation rate is also less than expected based on the percentage of PWD in four of the five years since FY18, the Service h as met its 2% PWTD target for executives (Figure 4). FY20 was the only year in which the SES PWTD target was not met (1.92%). Specifically, the rate ranged from 2.78% in FY18 to 2.22% in FY19. In FY22, the PWTD rate decreased to 2.33%. Additional insights are needed to get a better understanding of this volatility; however, this participation rate analysis suggests that the FY16/17 administrative change i n the definition of a PWD may have had a small demonstrative effect on the percentage of executives who identify as PWD or PWTD. SES by Disab ility 2.C. Ethnicity and Race American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (NHPI), and those claiming two or more races (TMR) are excluded from the analysis in this section because when combined, they make up less than 2% of the total IRS workforce. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends The IRS has a considerable amount of ethnic diversity with over half of the total workforce being people of color; however, this diversity is not distributed eve nly across the grade levels. For example, the IRS's overall Black workforce participation rate i s 30.7%. However, the Black participation rate is higher in the lower grades (34.5% for GS 1-8 equivalent s) and considerably lower in the higher grades (23.3% for GS 13-15 equivalents). Over the past five yea rs, the participation rate for White employees has decreased while the participation rate of people of color has increased. In this section, the rate at which the participation rate changes (by ethnicity and grade level) is analyzed and reported. The IRS workforce demographics analysis shows the workforce par ticipation rate dependence on grade is evident across all the ethnicity/races at the Service. As illus trated in Table 1, there are specific five-year trends in the ethnic makeup of the IRS by grade level. x Since FY18, of the 12 race-grade groupings investigated, the five-year trend for the nine \"people of color\" groups increased while the trend for the three White groups decreased. This suggests that the participation of people of color increased across t he grade structure. x The average five-year participation rate percent increase is 14.2%. If trends continue, the IRS could expect an annual percent increase of 2.32%, 1.98%, and 4.22% for the GS 1-8, 9-12, and 13-15 groups respectively. x Over the past five years, the group with the largest increased participation rate is Asian GS 13- 15 employees. The group with the largest decreased participatio n rate is White GS 1-8 employees. Table 1: Race and Ethnicity by Grade Groups White Black GS 1-8 Hispanic Asian FY since FY18, the GS 1-8 participa tion rate of White employees decreased while the participation rates of Black, Hispanic, and Asian employees increased. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends The participation rate of GS 1-8 Hispanic employees increased t he fastest from 16.5% in FY18 to 19.1% in FY22. This is a 15.9% increase in their participation rate o ver these five years. At a slightly slower pace (11.2% change), the Black GS 1-8 participation rate increa sed from 31.1% in FY18 to 34.5% in FY22. In addition, the participation rate for Asian GS 1-8 empl oyees increased slightly over this five-year period. People of color make up a larger percentage of the lowe r grades than they did five years ago. The participation rates of three of the four races/ethnicity gr oups investigated remained relatively constant (defined as less than a 10% change in either direction ) in the mid-grade level. However, the participation rates for GS 9-12 Hispanic employees increased ne arly 20% from a 12.4% participation rate in FY18 to 14.9% in FY22. The Black and Asian participation rates increased slightly in the mid-range while the White participation rate decreased. White employees continue to make up most of the GS 13-15 equivalent employees. In FY22, there were 2.4 times more White employees than Black employees in this grade range and nearly seven time s more White employees than Hispanic employees. Over the years, howeve r, the participation rate of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians have increased in this grade range. In FY18, 5.81% of the IRS were Black GS 13- 15 employees. In FY22, Black GS 13-15 employees made up 6.33% of the IRS, an 8.95% increase. Similarly, in FY18, 1.86% of the IRS were Hispanic GS 13-15 emp loyees in comparison to 2.23% in FY22 - a 19.89% increase. Likewise, the IRS had a 14.75% increase in the Asian GS 13-15 participation rate from 2.78% in FY18 to 3.19% in FY22. While historically, the total IRS workforce was predominantly W hite (55.1% in FY15 not shown), in FY20, White employees made up less than half of the total I RS workfor ce (49.4%). This pattern has continued in FY22; with White employees making up 45.9% of the IRS. Black and Hispanic employees have a low participation rate at t he higher grade levels. In FY22, 30.7% of the total IRS workforce were Black FY22 Hispanic employees made up 15.2% of the tota employees. The analysis shows that the IRS has indeed become considerably more diverse over the last several fiscal years. However, the Service should continue to seek ways to ensure that each racial group is appropriately represented at each grade level. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends Figure 5: Senior Level Stratified by Race and Ethnicity Figure 5 shows the diversity of the IRS executive cadre with a low participation rate for \"people of color\" executives. From FY18-20, the participation rate of White executives decreased. In FY22, it rebounded to nearly FY19 levels (69.9%). Additional research is required to determine if the factors responsible for the uptick are due to: (1) a lower-than-expected selection rate getting people of color into the executive cadre, (2) a higher than expected separation rate of \"people of color\" executives, (3) a higher than expected selection rate of White executives, (4) a lower than e xpected separations rate of White executives, (5) or some combination of these potential factors. Section 2 - Feeder Group Analysis for IRS Senior Level Position s 2.A. SES Feeder Groups The following section provides additional insights into the fee der groups for IRS' senior executive positions for FY22. To become an IRS executive, interested empl oyees must at a minimum be a GS-14 or GS-15 equivalent at the time that they apply to the Candidat e Development Program (CDP) or to an executive vacancy announcement. Managerial experience, managing supervisors and/or other managers is no longer a requirement, but candidates should have some supervisory experience since applicants are ranked based on both their basic qualifications (where managerial experience falls) and their responses to Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). This section addresses the grade level requirement. Table 2 bel ow provides the demographic makeup of the SES feeder pool for FY22. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends Table 2: Feeder Groups into SES for FY 2022 Workforce Male or Races Male 715 13-15 equivalents make up the feeder pool f or senior level positions. However, at the IRS, GS-13 equivalents are not included in the feeder pool for IRS executives since they do not have the appropriate grade level experience necessary to apply to th e CDP. There are senior, departmental, and frontline managers at the IRS, all of which have supervisor y experience. The departmental managers pay band scale covers the GS 11/12/13 levels, which ma kes them ineligible to become members of the feeder pool for IRS executives. This does not in clude IR-03s and IR-04s which are GS-15 and GS-14 equivalents respectively. Senior managers (IR-0 1s) are GS-14 and GS-15 equivalents. They have obtained the necessary grade level experience needed for executive level appointments. It is possible for applicants to qualify for executive positions externally if they can demonstrate the appropriate managerial experience outside of the Service and was compensate d equivalent to the GS 14/15 level. There are GS-14s and GS-15s that do not have any interest in ad vancing their careers to the SES level; yet they are included in our workforce tables as being part of the feeder pool. However, as stated previously, there are IRS employees at lower grades with superv isory experience (e.g., IRS departmental managers, former directors of companies in the private sector, and some veterans) that do not have the required time-in-grade to apply for executive positions interna lly but may apply through external announcements. This section focuses only on the diversity at the GS-14 and GS- 15 levels. The information reported here is for FY22 and can be used to identify key workforce trends as well as possible barriers that could impact specific segments of the IRS workforce. While White employees continue to have a high participation rat e at the higher grade levels, their participation rates vary by gender. When compared to the overal l IRS participation rate, White females have a low participation rate at the GS-14 level while White ma les have a high participation rate at the GS-14 and GS-15 levels. This provides some insight as to why White males continue to have a high participation rate at the executive ranks. Black males have a high participation rate in the higher grades . Despite just 6.6% of the workforce being Black males, in FY22, 8.9% of GS-14s and 7.9% of GS-15s were Bl ack males. The percentage of IRS executives that were Black males was on par with the overall wo rkforce IRS participation rates. In FY22, Black employees made up 6.6% of the IRS workforce and 7.0% of I RS executives. In FY22, 24% of the total IRS workforce were Black females. How ever, they were primarily lower-graded and mid-graded employees. Despite being 24% of the workforce po pulation, only 15.5% of GS-14s and 16.0% of GS-15s were Black females. Their participation rate at the executive level (14.4%) was nine percentage points less than their overall participation and one percentage point less than their GS 14-15 feeder pool participation rate (15.5%) as one in seven executiv es were Black females. In FY22, Hispanics had a low participation rate in the higher grades. Despite making up 5.1% of the total IRS workforce, Hispanic males made up 3.8% of GS-14s, 2.5% of G S-15s, and 3.9% of FY22 executives. The Hispanic male SES participation rate is on par with their GS 14-15 participation rates (3.78%). The Hispanic male SES participation rate has more than doubled since FY18 when Hispanic males made up just 1.9% of the Service's executives. IRS MD 715 Grade Trends In FY22, Hispanic females made up 10.0% of the total IRS workfo rce wit h 3.8% of GS-14s, 3.1% of GS- 15s, and 2.0% of the IRS executive cadre. The overall Hispanic female participation rate was 5.1 times larger than their SES participation rate and 2.7 times larger t han their feeder pool (GS 14-15) participation rate. Asian employees continue to have a high participation rate in t he higher ranks. The participation rates of Asian males GS-14s, GS-15s, and executives are larger than thei r overall workforce participation rate. The participation rate for Asian males GS-14s (6.8%) and GS-15s (6.9%) are both more than twice their overall participation rate (3.0%). Asian males have a high part icipation rate in the executive cadre based on their overall participation rate but not based on their GS 1 4-15 participation rate (6.8%). The participation rate for Asian females GS-14s (3.8%) is on pa r with their overall participation rate (3.7%). However, based on their participation at the GS 14-15 l evel (6.1%) and their overall participation rates (3.7%), Asian females have a low participation rate in th e executive cadre with less than 0.5% of IRS executives being Asian females. In FY23, the IRS will continue to focus on understanding the po licies, practices, and procedures that govern the entry into, promotion within, and exit from the seni or leadership feeder pools. __________________________________________________________________________________ At-A-Glance Internal Revenue Agent (Series 0512) Total Workforce = 8,464 Source: Workforce Analytics Total 8,359 8,646 CY2023 CY2024 Eligible 34.07% 36.52% 39.13% Retirement is year Workforce Demographics: Age Trend FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 Average Age 51.2 50.4 50.3 Average Years of Service 18.7 17.0 16.4 40 and Older percent and 2 percent for PWD and PWTD.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE 715 APPENDIX D 90 DAY ENTRANCE SURVEY 90-Day Survey MD-715 Report The 90-day survey is designed to obtain the perspectives of newly hired employees regarding the federal recruitment process which includes receiving feedback about vac ancy announcements as well as the application, hiring and on-boardi ng processes. In this section, we focus on the experience of 1,589 FY21 respondents and 2,032 FY22 respon ses to several equity, diversi ty, and inclusion themed questions. Nearly 20% of the IRS new hires hired in the first three quarters of each fiscal year responded to the survey. This fiscal year, the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusio n (EDI) analyzed FY22 responses to determine the robustness of the FY21 findings. FY21 responses identified different distributions for the statement regarding ethics and key personnel policies (Q23B) by grade, ag e, and disability status. The statement regarding new hires receiving clear and concise explanation of duties and job expectations (Q25C), had different distributions by grade, gender, and race while the sp eed of integration statement (Q26A) distribution differed by grade, gender, race, and disability st atus. Furthermore, we found that the response distribution of the supervisor check statement (Q27C) differed significantly by grade, gender, and veteran status. EDI found that the IRS's onboarding process has generally been well received by new hires and the Service's process has improved. In FY21, 82.5% of respondents reported that the ethics and key personnel policies were clear and helpful. This positive percentage incr eased 2.2 points to 84.7% in FY22. Similarly, the percent of respondents that believed that their supervisor provided them with a clear and concise explanation of their duties and job expectations increased from 71.9% in FY21 to 73.2% in FY22. Opportunities for improvement do exist. Most respondents (74.4 %) believed that their supervisor quickly integrated them into their team' this is a slight decrease from the FY21 74.6% positive rating. The rating is influenced by the relatively low ratings of GS 1-8 employees (69.74%), Black employees (71.43%), and employees with disabilities (68.82%). In addition, 71.9% belie ved that their supervisor checked on them regularly to answer any questions; this is a slight decrease fr om the FY21 percentage of 73.1%. In FY21, survey responses with statistically significant differ ent distributions for at least one employee group were identified. In this year's report, the results were extended using the results based on average ratings. Ratings ranged from 1 to 5 with higher numbers indica ting more agreement with the survey statement. Analysis of variance tests using FY21 and FY22 data were conducted to determine which groups differed in their average response and t-tests were perf ormed to determine significant differences between fiscal years. Of the 72 independent samples t-test con ducted (18 demographics, 4 questions), only two had a statistically significant difference between the ir FY21 average rating and their FY22 average rating. The results for the ethics and ke y personnel policies statement (Q23B) were not robust, they varied by fiscal year. The analysis showed that GS 1-8 employees rated this statement lower than GS 13-SES employees in FY21 but less than GS 9-12 employees in FY22. Sim ilarly, employees aged 18-39 years had a more negative opinion about this statement than 40-49 and 50+ year old employees in FY21 but no such differences exist in FY22. Finally, people with disabilities ( PWDs) had a lower opinion than people without disabilities (PWODs) in FY21 but not in FY22. As it pertains to the explanation of duties and job expectation s (Q25C), GS 1-8 employees had a lower opinion than both GS 9-12 and GS 13-SES employees in both years . Also, female agreement was lower than male agreement to this statement in both years. There were no racial differences in FY21; however, in FY22, the percentage of White and \"Other\" employees who agre ed with the statement was larger than the percentage of Black employees that agreed with the statemen t. Both differences were statistically significant. The responses to the speed of integration statement (Q26A) were robust. Across both years, GS 9-12 and GS 13-SES employees agreed with the statement more than GS 1-8 employees. Similarly, males agreed with the statement more than females and employees without disa bilities had a higher rating than employees with disabilities. While there were no racial differ ences in FY21, White employees did rate this question higher than Black employees in FY22. The results for the supervisor check statement (Q27C) were robu st. In both years, GS 1-8 employees had a lower level of agreement than GS 9-12 and GS 13-SES employees , males had a higher level of agreement than females, and non-veterans had a higher level of agreement than veterans. FY21 results were based on differences between a five-year end of year dataset (FY16-20) and FYTD21 Q3 responses. This may have biased our results since different po pulations of employees are more likely to onboard at various times of year (i.e., hiring employees for fi ling season work or enforcement hiring). If this is true, then the Q4 employees who onboarded between April and June may differ in grade, occupation, and business unit, from Q3 respondents who onboarde d January through March. In this year's study, EDI corrected this \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison by comparing FY21 Q3 data to FY22 Q3 data. Our results show that year-to-year distributional variations ex ist, even when comparing data at the same reporting cycle (comparing FYTD Q3 data to FYTD Q3 data). For example, White employees had a significantly larger average Q26A score than Black employees in FY22 but not FY21. As a result, a larger dataset with more years of data must be analyzed to determine t he robustness of these findings. Ideally, policy changes should be made in response to robust findings only. Based on the past seven years of survey responses, we conclude that the onboarding process is generally well received by new hires but is perceived differently by various employee groups. The full version of this year's report which contains tables fo r both the descriptive and inferential statistics provided here can be found in the appendix of this MD-715 repor t. To summarize our key take-away: the IRS is successful in ensuring that all new hires have a positive experience with their onboarding process; however, improvements can be made to address the concerns of sp ecific populations of employees. Page 1 of 21 Page 2 of 21 ' FY 2021 data suggested that the distribution of responses to the four DEI-related questions varied by employee demographic characteristics. In this year s report, EDI used FY 2022 average response scores to extend these FY 2021 results. Our results show that year-to-year distributional variations exist, even when comparing data at the same reporting cycle (comparing FYTD Q3 data to FYTD Q3 data). (For example, White employees had a signifi cantly larger average Q26A score than Black employees in FY 2022 but not FY 2021.) As a result, a larger dataset with more years of data must be analyzed to determine the robustness of these findings. Ideally, policy changes should be made in response to robust findings only. Based on the past seven years of survey responses, we conclude that the onboarding process is generally well received by new hires but is perceived differently by various employee groups. \u0007\u0083\u009b\u0003 \u0016\u0097\u0094\u0098\u0087\u009b\u0003 \u0004\u0090\u0083\u008e\u009b\u0095\u008b\u0095\u0003 \u0003\u0003\u0015\u0087\u0083\u0090\u0083\u008e\u009b\u0095\u008b\u0095\u0003 Dr. Ray Mooring, EDI 4 SURVEY RESPONSES .............................................. ............................................................... ..................... 6 Q23B - Ethics and Key Personnel policies (e.g. equal opportunit y, sexual harassment, etc.) were Q25C - My supervisor provided me with a clear and concise expla nation of my duties and job clear and he lpful. ........................................................................................................... ....................... 6 expectations.................................................. ............................................................... ......................... 7 Q26A - My supervisor quickly integrated me into the team. ..... .......................................................... 8 Q27C - My supervisor checks with me regularly to answer any questions I may have. ...................... 8 REANALYSIS RESULTS ............................................ ............................................................... ..................... 9 Q23B - Ethics and Key Personnel policies (e.g. equal opportunit y, sexual harassment, etc.) were Q25C - My supervisor provided me with a clear and concise expla nation of my duties and job Q27C - My supervisor checks with me regularly to answer any questions I may have..................... 13 clear and he lpful. ........................................................................................................... ..................... 10 expectations.................................................. ...................................................................................... 11 Q26A - My supervisor quickly integrated me into the team. ..... ........................................................ 12 CONCLUSION.................................................... ............................................................... ........................ 14 APPENDIX...................................................... ............................................................... ........................... 15 Page 3 of 21 BACKGROUND The 90-day survey is designed to obtain the perspectives of new ly hired employees regarding the federal recruitment process which includes receiving feedback about vac ancy announcements as well as the application, hiring and on-boardi ng processes. In the FY20 rep ort, the perspectives of employees who were onboarded between FY16 and FY20 were analyzed. In last ye ar's report, the analysis was extended by including and focusing on input from employees onboarding du ring the first three quarters of FY21. In this report, EDI examines a) the FY21 Q3 statements that had on average less than positive responses for at least one demographic group and b) the statements that h ad a practically significant decrease in their average score from FY16 to FYTD21 Q3 to see if any quantifiable improvements have been made through FYTD22 Q3. EDI continues to focus on the fo ur statements that are associat ed with equity, diversity, and inclusion (DEI) themes. The four statements are listed in Table 1 below: Table 1: DEI-Related Statements Captured on the 90 Day Survey Q23B Ethics and key personnel policies (e.g., equal opportunity , sexual harassment, etc.) were clear and helpful. Q25C My supervisor provided me with a clear and concise explanation of my duties and job expectations. Q26A My supervisor quickly integrated me into the team. Q27C My supervisor checks with me regularly to answer any questions I may have. Last year's report showed that statistically significant differences exist in the distribution of these four survey statements between IRS populations. In this report, the se statements are again analyzed to determine the robustness of our findings. The terms \"mean\" and \"average\" are used interchangeably in the report. The terms \"prompt\" and \"survey statement\" are also used interchangeably. New employees are asked to take the survey within 90 days of their hire date. During the first three quarters of FY21, the IRS hired 8,375 new permanent, seasonal, and temporary employees. Of these, 1,589 (19%) responded to the survey. The IRS added another 10, 180 employees during the first three quarters of FY22. The IRS received responses from 2,032 (20.0% ) of these FY22 new hires. The demographics of the FY21 and FY2 2 survey responde nts are provid ed in Table 2. Page 4 of 21 Table 2: Demographics of the Respondents to the New Employee 90 Day Entrance Survey (FYTD21 Q3 -FYTD22 Q3) Respondents were asked to rate their agreement and/or support f or each survey statement using a 5- point Likert scale. A respondent who scored a statement a 4 or 5 is said have provided a positive response and agrees and/or supports the statement. A 1 or 2 score indicates a negative response and disagreement with the statement. Response 3 is considered neutral (neither positive or negative). Page 5 of 21 Page 6 of 21 Survey respondents were grouped by grade level, supervisory sta tus, age, gender, ethnicity, veteran, and disability status. For eac h group and each survey statemen t, an average rating based on the respondents' level of agreement was calculated and analyzed. A verage scores range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher levels of agreement with the su rvey statement. SURVEY RESPONSES Q23B - Ethics and Key Personnel policies (e.g ., equal opportunity, sexual harassment, etc.) were clear and helpful. In FY21, 82.5% of respondents reported that the ethics and key personnel policies were clear and helpful. In FY22, the proportio n of respondents who believed that the policies were clear and helpful increased to 84.7%. Table 3 pro vides the distribution of FY22 responses partitioned by their demographic characteristics. GS 9-12 employees (89.4% positive ) and male employees (86.3% positive) agreed with the survey prompt the most. Table 3: Mean Score and Distribution of Q23B Responses By Demog raphic Characteristics Q23B FY Q3) 4.27 Q25C - My supervisor provided me with a clea r and concise explanation of my duties and job expectations. In FY21, 71.9% of respondents reported that their supervisor pr ovided them with a clear and concise explanation of their duties and job expectations. In FY22, the proportion of respondents who believed that the supervisor provided them with a clear and concise expl anation of their duties and job expectations increased to 73.2%. Table 4 provides the distribu tion of FY22 responses partitioned by the employees (85.4% positive) and GS 13-SES employees (84.1% positive) agreed with the survey prompt the most. Table 4: Average Mean Score and Distribution of Q25C Responses By Demographic Characteristics Q25C FY 2022 (Through Q3) Page 7 of 21 Q26A - My supervisor quickly integrated me into the team. In FY21, 73.7% of respondents reported that their supervisor qu ickly integrated them into their team. In FY22, the proportion of respondents who believed that their sup ervisor quickly integrated them into their team increased to 74.4%. Table 5 provides the distributi on of FY22 responses partitioned by employee demographics. The table suggests that GS 9-12 employe es (84.2% positive) and GS 13-SES employees (85.4% positive) agreed with the survey prompt the mo st. Table 5: Mean Score and Distribution of Q26A Responses By Demog raphic Characteristics FY Responses (Through Q27C - My supervisor checks with me regu larly to answer any questions I may have. In FY21, 71.3% of respondents reported that their supervisor ch ecks on them regularly to answer their questions. In FY22, the proportion of respondents who believed that their supervisor checks on them regularly increased to 71.9%. Table 6 provides the distributio n of FY22 responses partitioned by employee demographics. Higher graded employees, specifically G S 9-12 employees (81.2% positive) and GS 13-SES employees (85.4% positive), agreed with the survey pr ompt the most. Page 8 of 21 Table 6: Mean Score and Distribution of Q27C Responses By Demog raphic Characteristics Q27C (Through Q3) REANALYSIS RESULTS Initially, EDI had grouped FY21 survey responses into three cat egories: positive (responses 4 and 5), negative (responses 1 and 2), and neutral (response 3). Severa l demographic characteristics were also grouped to facilitate analysis of variance testing. Specifical ly, American Indians, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders, and Two or More Races were grouped into an \"Other Ra ce\" category. Similarly, GS 1-4 and 5- 8 equivalents were combined into a GS 1-8 equivalent group and executives and GS13-15 equivalents were joined together into a GS 13-SES group. EDI then conducted several chi-squared tests to determine if an y differences existed in the distribution of responses across the various demographic categories. Our results identified different distributions for Q23B by grade, age, and disa bility status. Q25C had differ ent distributions by grade, gender, and race while Q26A's distribution differed by grade, gender, race, and disability status. Furthermore, we found that Q27C response distribution differed significantly by grade, gender, and veteran status. In this year's report, EDI used a series of analysis of varianc e tests with Tukey correction to identify groups that had statistically significant different average (me an) scores in FY21 (significance level a = Page 9 of 21 0.05). Using this information, we leveraged FY22 data to condu ct a repeat analysis for groups with statistically significant distributions in FY21 to determine th e robustness of our results. As a final check, one way t-tests (a = 0.05) were performed on all groups to determine if the average scores significantly increased from FY21 to FY22. Our t-test results suggested that the Q23B average score signif icantly decreased from 4.56 to 4.36 for GS 13-SES employees. The average score for GS 13-SES employees on Q25C also decreased significantly from 4.64 to 4.27. No other demographic group had a significant change in average score from FY21 to FY22 on any of the four DEI-related questions. Said another wa y, of the 72 independent samples t-test conducted (18 demographics, 4 questions), only two had a statis tically significant difference between their FY21 average score and their FY22 average score. Q23B - Ethics and Key Personnel policies (e.g., equal opportunity, sexual harassment, etc.) were clear and helpful. The reanalysis of the FY21 survey results (Table 6) found that GS 13-SES (mean = 4.56) employees were more likely to have found ethics and key personnel policies to be clear and helpful than GS 1-8 employees (mean = 4.24). The mean GS 9-12 value (4.40) is not significantly different from the mean values of the other two groups. This finding is not robust. In FY22, the mean GS 9-12 score (m ean = 4.47) was significantly larger than the GS 1-8 score (mean = 4.26). There were no significant diff erences between the average GS 13-SES score (mean = 4.36) and the GS 1-8 nor between the GS -SES and GS 9-12 average score. showed that on average, 18-39-year-old empl oyees (mean = 4.39) received clearer and more helpful ethics and key personnel policies than their 4 0-49 year old (mean = 4.21) and 50 and older counterparts (mean = 4.20). However, in the FY22 respons es, no statistically si gnificant age group differences exist. FY21 responses suggest that people without disabilities (PWODs) (mean = 4.31) had a more positive opinion of the ethics and key personnel policies than people wi th disabilities (PWDs) (mean = 4.14). The FY22 responses provide similar findings; however, the approval gap decreased from 0.17 points to 0.05 points and is no longer statisti cally significant. The gap dec rease is a direct effect of the increased positive opinion of PWDs. Their score increased from 4.14 to 4 .27 while the score of PWODs remained relatively constant (mean = 4.32). Page 10 of 21 Table 7: Significant Differences Between Demographic Groups Tha t Have Been Identified as Having Statistically Significant Differen ces in Distributions of Q23B 18-39 vs. 40-49 YES NO 18-39 vs. 50+ YES NO 40-49 vs. 50+ NO NO PWD vs. No Disability YES NO Source: 90 Day Survey Responses (FY21 Q3 - FY22 Q3) Q25C - My supervisor provided me with a clea r and concise explanation of my duties and job expectations. A larger percentage of GS 9-12 (FY21 mean = 4.42) and GS 13-SES employees (FY21 mean = 4.64) responded that their supervisor provided them with clear and concise explanations of their job duties and expectations than GS 1-8 empl oyees (FY21 mean = 3.87). To elaborate, 68.4% of GS 1-8 employees had a positive response to this prompt, compared to 86.3% of GS 9-12 employees and 93.1% of GS 13- SES employees, respectively. This finding is quite robust and is duplicated in FY 2022 data (Table 8). The average GS 1-8 response (mean = 3.88) is again significantly le ss than the average GS 9-12 (mean = 4.41) and average GS 13-SES (mean 4. 27) response. The GS 9-12 and GS 13-SES responses are not significantly different from one another. Males tend to feel that their supervisor provide them with clearer and more concise explanations of their job duties and expectation s as compared to females. Ther e is a 0.26-point gender gap in FY21 and a 0.30 gender gap in FY22. The average score for males is 4.18 in FY21 and 4.23 in FY22. These averages suggest that this finding is ro bust and enduring as the gender gap is increasing over time. Even though the distribution of responses to this question was significantly different by race, none of the racial groups in FY21 had any significantly different average scores. However, the FY22 data suggests that White (mean = 4.09) and Other (mean = 4.17) emplo yees tend to feel that their supervisor provide them with clear and concise explanations of their job d uties and expectations more than Black employees (mean = 3.92). This difference is statistically sign ificant. Page 11 of 21 Table 8: Significant Differences Between Demographic Groups Tha t Have Been Identified as Having Statistically Significant Differen ces in Distributions of Q25C 9-12 vs. GS 13-SES NO NO Male vs. Female YES YES White vs. Black NO YES White vs. Hispanic NO NO White vs. Other NO NO Black vs. Hispanic NO NO Black vs. Other NO YES Hispanic vs. Other NO NO Source: 90 Day Survey Responses (FY21 Q3 - FY22 Q3) Q26A - My supervisor quickly integrated me into the team. The FY21 reanalysis (Table 9) showed that GS 9-12 (mean = 4.39) and GS 13-SES (mean = 4.44) employees' supervisors integrated them to their team quicker th an GS 1-8 (mean = 3.93) employees were integrated. This finding i s robust. FY22 survey results suggest that 69.7% of GS 1-8 employees (mean = 3.93) rated this survey statement positively compared t o 84.2% of GS 9-12 (mean = 4.39) and 85.4% of GS 13-SES employees (mean = 4.44). Data from FY21 and FY22 suggest that male employees (FY21 mean = 4.26; FY22 mean = 4.24) integrated into their teams quicker than female employees (FY21 mean = 4.00; FY22 mean = 3.99). The average score across all racia l groups were statistically s imilar in FY21. However, FY22 data provides preliminary evidence to suggest t hat White (mean = 4.16) employ ees integrated into their teams quicker than Black employees (mean = 3. 96). This difference is statistically significant. On the other hand, PWODs (FY21 mean = 4.11) integrated into the ir teams faster than PWDs (FY21 mean = 3.92). This 0.19 point disability gap increased to 0.20 points in FY22. The average scores of PWODs and PWDs was 4.10 and 3.90 respectively.

The FY21 reanalysis (Table 9) identified statistically signific ant differences in grade, gender, and veteran status. GS 9-12 (mean = 4.45) employees and GS 13-SES (mean = 4.53) employees report that their supervisors check on them more regularly than GS 1-8 employees (mean = 3.90). Males (mean = 4.19) are checked on more regularly than female employees (mean = 3.9 4) and veterans (mean = 4.20) are checked on more regularly than non-veterans (mean = 4.00). Each of these findings are robust as they have been duplicated in FY22 data (GS 1-8 mean = 3.83, GS = 13-SES mean = 4.36; males mean = 4.17, es mean = 3.89; veterans mean = 4.24; non-veterans mean = 3.94).

This report, like the one from last year, confirmed most of the findings from the previous yea r's report with some slight differences. Last year, we hypothesized that comparing end of year FY16-20 data with FY21 Q3 data was not an appropriate comparison since different populations of responden ts would be used. To make an appropriate comparison, we compared FYTD21 Q3 data to FYTD22 Q3 data. We found that even using the same time frames, significant differences depended on the s urvey statement of interest. For example, in FY21, all the average scores (by race) for Q25C and Q26A were similar to each other. No significant differences existed. However, in FY22, White emplo yees were found to have a significantly higher average score than Black employees to both statements. This, and other differences exist despite accounting for reporting cycle time. We conclude that the repo rting cycle may play a part in identifying significant differences, but it alone cannot account for differ ences that we observed in the responses. We also hypothesized that natural temporal variation in our data may influence our conclusions from year to year; however, a longer longitudinal dataset is needed to test this theory. Several more years of data are needed to uncover and un derstand annual variation and statement to statement variation. Once a sufficiently sized dataset is obtained, a spectral analy sis could be conducted to identify any significant longitudinal cycles (or equivalently spectral signa ls). While this year's report focused on testing the robustness of o ur findings from the previous years, the overarching conclusion remains the same: the onboarding process is perceived differently by employees of different grade levels, age, gender, veteran status, and dis ability status.

By contrast, the Q3 FY2021 retirements were 45.3% of the IRS voluntary separ ations. Resignations dominated the remainder of voluntary separations followed by transfers. E xit surveys were issued to employees who voluntarily separated, and there were 1,482 respo nses (18.1%). Exit survey results are useful to the agency in developing strategies to retain a more engaged workforce. Analyzing the root causes of voluntary separations can help the agency to achieve higher levels of employee satisfaction. This separations analysis includes non-retirement related infor mation on Females, Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, Persons with Disabilities (PWD) and Veterans fo r FY2022 (through Q3) with five (5) year comparisons going back to FY 2018. Females At third quarter FY2022, the pe rcentage of voluntary female sep arations (68.7%) exceeded the percentage of female employees in the Service (64.9%) by 3.8 points. There were 898 female Exit Survey respondents. Responses from surveys are as follows: Females, not involving retirements, GS 5-15, generally Resigned (13.9%), Left for Personal Reasons (9.3%), or moved to the Private Sector (5.8%). The bulk of the female separations in this group (44.1%) came from grades 5-8. Within the major occupations (0512, 0592, 0962, 1811 and 2210), female separations primari ly involved Resignations (16.4 %), Personal Circumstances (14.1%), moves to the Private Sector (7.7%). Exit survey result s indicated that the top concerns strongly impacting female decisions to separate from the servic e were Job-Related Stress (39.4%), Reasonableness of Workload (22.6%), Office Morale (21.0%), and Resource Availability (19.6%). Job-Related Stress and Office Morale have been identified as th e top concerns prompting female decisions to voluntarily leave the Service since FY2018. The concerns that highly impacted female decisions to leave the service remained relatively consistent since FY2018; however, the current year percentages decreased by 4.9 points from a four (4) year average of 25.9% to 21.0% regarding Office Morale concerns. In contrast, Job- Related Stress concerns increased 4.5 points from a four (4) ye ar average of 34.9% to 39.4% and Pay Concerns also increased by 4.1 points from a 4-year average of 16.3% to 20.4% in the current year. Over half of female respo ndents (57.9%) who indicated that Job-Related Stress strongly impacted their decisions to separate stated that they would return to work for Treasury, and 61.0% of these respondents indicated t hat their separations could have been prevented. The profile of a typical separating female who said that Job-Re lated Stress strongly impacted her decision to leave the service was Permanent Status (90.18%), Wh ite (47.5%), GS 5-8 (46.3%) with More Than 25 Years of Service (37.9%), and Age 60 & Over (35.9% ). 3 Hispanics As of FY2022 (Q3), Hispanics comprised 15.2% of the IRS workfor ce, and the percentage of Hispanic voluntary separations (14.7%) was 0.5 percentage point less than that. There were 163 Hispanic Exit Survey respondents. Responses from surveys are as follows: The top Hispanic non-retirement voluntary separations in GS 5-1 5 mostly involved Resignations (26.0%), Personal Circumstances (15.0%), and Transfers to Other Federal agencies (9.0%). Most of the Hispanic separations (59.0%) came from grades 5-8. Hispan ics within the mission occupations (0512, 0592, 1811 and 2210), voluntarily sepa rated for Resignation (26.0%), Personal Circumstances (21.0%), and Transfers to Other Federal agencies (8.0%). Top concerns strongly impacting Hispanic separation decisions w ere Job-Related Stress (40.9%), Resources Available to Do the Jo b (27.4%), and Access to Develo pmental Opportunities (23.8%). Job-Related Stress has been identified as a top concern impacti ng Hispanics' decisions to voluntarily leave the Service since FY2018. The concerns that h ighly impacted Hispanics' decisions to leave the service remained relatively consistent from FY2018; however, there was a 5.1 point increase in Concerns over Job Related Stress from a four (4) year average of 35.8% to 40.9% in the current year and a 5.1 point decrease in managerial concerns from a four (4) year average of 19.1% to 14.0% in the current year. Nearly 3/5 (59.7%) of Hispanic respondents indicated that they would return to work for Treasury even though their separation decisions were strongly impacted b y Job-Related Stress. Even more respondents (67.2%) indicated that something could have been do ne to prevent their separations. The typical Hispanic employee who reported that Job-Related Str ess strongly impacted a decision to leave was Permanent Status (88.1%), GS 5-8 (56.7%), with Mor e Than One Year of Service (37.3%), and in Series 962 (29.9%) at Age 30-39 (29.9%). Blacks As of FY2022 (Q3), Blacks comprised 30.0% of the IRS workforce, and the percentage of Blacks voluntarily separating (32.3%) exceeded that by 2.4 points. There were 343 Black Exit Survey respondents. Responses from surveys are as follows: Resignations (18.7%) were the highest percentage of voluntary s eparations, not involving retirement, for Blacks in positions GS 5-15. Personal Circumstan ces followed at 12.0% and moves to the Private Sector were the s mallest percentage for this cat egory at 8.4%. The highest percentage of Black separations (53.06) came from grades 5-8. Within the mission critical occupations (0512, 0592, 0962, 1811 and 2210), most voluntary s eparations Blacks involved Resignation (21.9%), Personal Circumstances (16.6%), and Privat e Sector (7.7%). Job-Related Stress (40.2%) was the top concern impacting voluntary separation decisions for Blacks. Followed by Reasonableness of Workload (25.1%), and Career Goal Concerns (24.5%). 4 The leading concerns that strongly impacted Blacks' decisions to leave the service increased significantly in four categories with the largest increase in Job-Related Stress. This concern increased 8.3 percentage points fr om a Four (4) year average of 31.9% to 40.2 % in the current year. Pay Level concerns increas ed 7.7 points from a 17.1% average to 24.8% in FY2022, and Reasonableness of Workload had a 7 .5 point increase from an average of 17.6% to 25.1% in FY2022. Overall, 61.6% of separating Blacks, strongly impacted by Job-Related Stress, indicated they would return to work for the agency, and an additional 63.8 % indicated that something could have been done to prevent them from leaving. The typical Black employee who reported that Job-Related Stress strongly impacted a decision to leave was Permanent Status (89.1%), GS 5-8 (57.2%), Series 962 (27.5%), aged 50-59 (26.8%), with More than 25 Years ' Service (24.6%). Asians As of FY2022 (Q3), IRS voluntary separations for Asians (4.9%) were 1.8 percentage points lower than their workforce participation of 6.8%. There were 67 Asian Exit Survey respondents. Responses from surveys are as follows: The analysis of Asian separations other than retirement indicat ed that 30.6% of the Asian employees in GS 5-15 voluntarily separated mainly through Resig nation. Also 14.3% separated by moving into Private Sector and 12.2% through Personal Circumsta nces. The remaining categories were evenly divided. Unlike the other groups under review, the highest percentage of Asian separations (49.0%) came from grades 9 -12. Within the mi ssion critical occupations (0512 , 0592, 0962, 1811 and 2210), the majority or moved to the Private Sector (16.1% ). Also, three categories, Self- Employment, State and Local Government, and Transfers to Other Treasury Bureaus were tied at (6.4%). Job-Related Stress had the most significant impact on Asians' separation decisions (34.3%) followed by Reasonableness of Wo rkload (22.4%) and Office Align ment (20.9%). The major concerns that highly impacted Asians' decisions to separate from FY2018 through FY2022 shifted significantly. Job-Related Stress increased 7.5 p ercentage points (from a four (4) year average of 26.8% to 34.3% in the current year). Workload Concerns increased by 6.6 points from a four (4) year average of 15.8% to 22.4% in FY2022. Supervisory Concern decreased by 5.9 points from a 13.52% four (4) year average to 19.4% in FY2022. Also, Fairness of Evaluation and Recognition of Achievements decre ased 5.1 and 4.7 points respectively. Overall, 65.2% of separating Asians indicated they would return to work for the agency even though Job-Related Stress had a prevalent impact on their separ ation decisions; however, only 56.5% of Asian survey respondents indicated that their leaving could have been prevented. The typical Asian employee reporting that Job-Related Stress st rongly impacted a decision to leave was Permanent Status (95.7%), GS 9 -12 (47.8%), Series 0512 (34 .8), aged 60 & over (30.4%). 5 Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Persons with Disabilities (PWD) comprised 13.7% of the total IR S workforce in FY2022 (Q3), and the percentage of PWD voluntarily separating (13.1%) was simila r. There were 187 PWD Exit Survey respondents. Responses from surveys are as follows: Top PWD separations, not involving retirement, in GS 5-15 were Resignations (74.5%), Personal Circumstances (10%), Other (7.3% ), and Transfers to Other Feder al Agencies (6.7%). Work Experience concerns continued to be among the top drivers in PWD decisions to separate. Job- Related stress had the highest impact on PWD at 49.2%. Office Morale was second with 35.3%, and Available Resources followed with 33.7%. There were some significant incre ases in the top concerns that strongly impacted PWD decisions to separate from FY2018 through FY2022. Concerns over Pay increased by 12 percentage points from a four (4) year average of 19.2% to 31.6%. Also concerns o ver Supervisory Career Goal attention and Evaluation Fairness increased by 9.7 percentage p oints and 9.6 percentage points respectively. Nearly two-thirds (65.2%) of PWD respondents indicated they wou ld return to work after separating due to Job-Related Stress, and same percentage (65.2%), indicat ed that something could have been done to prevent them from separating. The typical PWD respondent who reported that Job-Related Stress strongly impacted a decision to leave was Permanent Status (91.3%), GS 5-8 (50.0%), aged 50 through 60 and over (29.3%) with 13 through More Than 25 Years of Service (29.3%). Veterans Veterans comprised 9.5% of the total IRS workforce in FY2022 (Q3), but the percentage of veteran voluntary separations (7.5%) was 2 percentage points below the percentage of veterans in the workforce. There were 230 Veteran Exit Survey respondents. Respo nses from surveys are as follows: The top separations not involving retirement for veterans in GS 5-15 were Resignations (21.3%), Transfers to Other Federal Agencies (13.1%), and Personal Circu mstances (8.1%). Job-Related Stress had the highest impact on Veteran separations at 33.0%. Pay Concerns followed at 23.5%, and Available Resources were next at 20.4. The top concerns that strongly impacted Veterans' decisions to separate from FY2018 through FY2022 remained consistent except for an eight (8) percent poin t drop in the concern over Office Morale from a four (4) year average of 25.0% to 17.0% in the current year. Over half (60.5%) of Veteran respondents indicated they would r eturn to work after separating due to Job-Related Stress, and nearly the same percentage (59.2%) i ndicated that something could have been done to prevent them from separating. 6 The typical Veteran respondent who reported that Job-Related Stress strongly impacted a decision to leave was a Permanent Status (96.1%), GS 5-8 (44.7%), Age 60 and over (40.8%, with 13 to 25 Years' Service (28.9%). Conclusion The various groups were compared to identify trends which s trongly impacted respondents' decisions to leave the Service. Resignation dominated non-retir ement voluntary separations in all six groups, and Personal Circumstances followed. Workload conce rns also had a high impact within the groups. Listed below are patterns uncovered through the exit survey ana lysis: 1. Job-Related Stress had the st rongest overall impact for all six groups on employee s' decisions to voluntarily separate from the Service. 2. Workload Concerns replaced Office Morale as a significant co ncern strongly impacting employee s' decisions to leave the Service. 3. Resignations increased significantly and respondent comments indicated that they were largely due to the mandato ry vaccination directive. 7 APPENDIX Top Separations Other Than Retirement for Females FY2022 1 2 3 GS 4 Personal: 3 Trnsf to another Fed Agency: 3 Black or African American Resignation: 53 Personal: 35 Private Sector: 20 Hispanic Resignation: 21 Personal: 15 Trnsf to another Fed Agency: 8 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander Resignation: 1 N/A N/A White Resignation: 40 Personal: 31 Private Sector: 26 2 or More Races Resignation: 7 Personal: 2 Prom to Another Fed Agency: 2Trnsf to another Fed Agency: 2 Other: 1 Series Sector: 17 14 Private Sector: Trnsf Fed Agency: 5 Series 0962 44 35 Private Sector: Series 1 N/A 2210 Personal: 1 Prom to Another Fed Agency 1 Private Sector: 1 Trnsf to another N/A Source: Treasury Exit (FY2022 Q3) 8 Top Concerns That Impacted Femal es' Decisions to Leave the Service FY2022 Strong Impact Work Experience Job-related stress 39.4% Reasonableness of my workload 22.6% My job description in relation to my actual duties and Responsibilities 19.2% My office's organization and alignment with regard s to effective and efficient service 18.0% Office Morale My office's morale 21.0% Resources available to do my job 19.6% Coworkers' work ethics 13.1% Recognition of staff efforts, contributions, and achievements 13.0% Career Growth My ability to participate in decision-making 17.9% My supervisor's concern and interest in assisting me to achieve my career goals 17.7% Relationship with Supervisor The existence of arbitrary actions, personal favoritism, or coercion for political purposes 17.3% My supervisor's understanding of his/her supervisory role 16.7% My supervisor's ability to ensure c ooperativeness and teamwork amo ng employees 14.7% Source: Treasury Exit Survey (FY2022 Q3) 9 Did Top Concerns Prompting Female My pay level in relation job responsibilities and performance 18.0% 15.6% 16.5% 15.3% 20.4% My office's organization and alignment a nd efficient service 23.0% 20.8% 18.9% 16.6% 18.0% 17.2% 15.9% 13.9% 17.9% My supervisor's concern and interest in assisting me to achieve my career goals 20.0% 16.5% 16.5% 16.3% 16.5% 14.5% 17.6% The existence of arbitrary actions, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes 22.0% 19.1% 17.0% 14.6% 17.3% My supervisor's 19.0% 16.0% 15.8% 15.3% 14.7% Source: Treasury Exit Survey (Responses from FY 2018 through F Y2022) 10 Would Females Return to Work for Treasury?
