With the balancing services it has procured, National Grid forecasts a margin for this winter at 5.1% which it considers manageable. Today's report shows there is uncertainty on the outlook for margins in 2016/17, and a significant opportunity for industry to play a role in delivering security of supply, for example by returning mothballed plant to the market or improving plant availability. Margins could also be boosted by higher imports from neighbouring countries. National Grid is today starting a consultation on whether to extend the option to purchase balancing services for winter 2016/17. This allows National Grid to contract with generators and businesses to provide additional balancing services over and above those provided by the normal market. Rachel Fletcher, senior partner, markets, Ofgem, said: \"We are confident that National Grid has the tools it needs this winter to manage the risks arising from the recent power station closures. \"As there is a wider range of uncertainties in the outlook for 2016/17, National Grid's decision to consult on extending these services into next winter is a prudent one. However, given we are 18 months away from winter 2016/17 there is also plenty of opportunity for generators and other market participants to continue to make more supplies available.\" Notes to editors - For an explanation of how National Grid works with the wholesale market to balance electricity supply and demand, see our infographic guide: [Keeping Britain's lights on](/electricity/wholesale-market/electricity-security-supply). - Ofgem's [Security of Electricity Supply (2015) report](/publications/electricity-security-supply-report)provides a commentary on the next three winters of National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios.
