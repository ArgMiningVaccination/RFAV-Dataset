Your Guide To Clearing Negative Energy [commerce guidelines.](/commerce-guidelines)Our selections are never influenced by the commissions earned from our links. Humans are multidimensional beings, but in the grind of daily life, that's easy to forget. We are more than a body and more than a mind, so we also have a spirit that calls for just as much attention and care. We shower to cleanse our bodies, book a therapist to cleanse our minds\u2014but how do we [cleanse our spirits](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/tools-for-clearing-negative-energy), and what does that actually mean? Advertisement What is spiritual cleansing? According to [Yashoda an expert in and Himalayan yogic practices, spiritual cleansing encompasses, \"Rituals, practices, and actions performed to create harmony and connection between mind, body, soul, and spirit.\" She classifies a spiritual cleanse as anything that causes purification or removal of anything toxic. And in a spiritual context, toxicity is a much broader term. \"What we observe we become,\" says Yashoda Devi Ma. \"If our attention is always absorbed in stress, negativity, loss, drama, gossip, lack, comparison, competition, past, future, or ego, then our energy becomes low and weighs us down mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually.\" From her perspective, if we don't do our daily spiritual practices, energy can become stuck, stagnate, or absorb whatever our attention dwells in, affecting our entire life. Naturopathic doctor, nurse practitioner, and reiki master [Erica Matluck](https://www.experiencesevensenses.com/) sees spiritual cleansing in a similar light: \"I define 'spiritual cleansing' as an intentional cleansing of the energetic field,\" she explains, adding, \"Just as the organs of detoxification (such as the liver and the lymphatic system) work around the clock to cleanse the physical body, the spirit is always moving energy.\" And sometimes, when our energy grows old and stagnant or we take on the energy of others, it creates undesirable behaviors and patterns, according to Matluck. That's where a spiritual cleanse comes in\u2014so how do we do it? 14 spiritual cleansing methods and rituals: Meditation According to Yashoda Devi Ma, meditation is the most effective way to spiritually cleanse, as it purifies our physical body, mind, and energy (prana) and helps clear out negativity, imbalances, and toxicity. \" [Meditation](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-meditation-can-alter-the-brain) uplifts our mind/body system, enhances and relaxes our brain, regulates our nervous system, boosts our immune system, enhances our life force, and connects us to our soul, essence, and blissful nature,\" she says. Advertisement Sound healing Whether it's with crystal bowls, tuning forks, gongs, or any other sound-healing instrument\u2014this method cleanses through frequency. According to sound therapy practitioner [Nate Martinez](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/nate-martinez), \"By using rhythm and frequency, we can entrain our brainwaves.\" Entrainment is the phenomenon whereby sound provides a stable frequency for our brain waves to attach to. \"It then becomes possible to [downshift our normal beta state](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871151/) [1](#citations) (normal waking consciousness) to alpha (relaxed consciousness) and even reach theta (meditative state) and delta (sleep; where internal healing can occur),\" says Martinez. Cleansing crystals Crystal expert [Heather Askinosie](https://energymuse.com/pages/our-story) reminds us that \"crystals come from the earth, so [when we work with them](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-use-crystals-everyday), they can connect us to the planet's healing and grounding energy.\" And some crystals are better suited for cleansing than others: - Selenite: \" [Selenite](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/selenite)crystals are thought to absorb negative energy, and they are commonly used for protection,\" according to Askinosie. - Smoky quartz: This stone is known for its cleansing properties of electromagnetic and negative energy. Askinosie suggests meditating with [smoky quartz](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/smoky-quartz)to help identify and release stale stories and beliefs. - Lepidolite: For those who need extra help cleansing their mind of cyclical and negative thoughts, [lepidolite](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/lepidolite#mbg-myTvTfcXV4s)is the go-to gem. Spiritual baths A [spiritual cleansing bath](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/spiritual-bath) can help us purify on both physical and subtle levels. A healing soak soothes sore muscles by relieving lactic acid but also sets an overarching tone of deep relaxation. \"I find Epsom salt with different aromatherapies to be relaxing for our nervous system and calming for the mind,\" shares Yashoda Devi Ma. And if you want to further elevate your bath ritual, \"Ayurveda has many types of cleansing baths with different herbs to help detoxify our system depending on our [doshas](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/doshic-constitution-vs-dosha-imbalance)\u2014which can be very balancing,\" she adds. Mantras [Mantras](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/mantras) have been used for thousands of years to overcome obstacles and expand consciousness. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29921143/) [2](#citations) shows that traditional mantras (those made of sacred sounds and/or Sanskrit) have a positive impact on mental and emotional well-being, which we can harness through practices like Vedic meditation, or another form of mantra meditation known as japa. Our modern understanding of mantras is more accurately a practice of positive [affirmations](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/self-love-affirmations), which help train our thoughts in a more positive direction. Try adopting any of the following affirmations as a regular cleansing ritual: - I cleanse my spirit of all negativity. - I release all energies that do not serve the greater good. - I live in harmony of mind, body, and spirit. Advertisement Yoga postures [Yoga](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-yoga-apps) poses (asana) were created to cleanse and purify the body, mind, and energy in preparation for meditation. This practice creates internal heat through breath and postures, like a metaphorical fire burning through what no longer serves us. Plus, excess negative energy often stores as tension in the body (hello, half pigeon). [Yoga poses](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/yoga-for-when-you-feel-overwhelmed) are an opportunity to release tension and the congested energy at its root. Spiritual cleansing prayer \"Cleansing prayer can be very powerful for the soul,\" says Yashoda Devi Ma. To her, prayer is something that comes from the purity of the heart, or sacred sounds of creative intelligence that encourage evolution (read: mantra). \"[Cleansing prayer] helps develop one's mental power and strength, eases us of stress, and has the potential to take us to higher states of consciousness. It is a beautiful way to connect to the divine/sacred,\" she explains. Advertisement Essential oils Working with [essential oils](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/calming-scents) helps us shift into a more positive energetic frequency by kindling a calm and relaxed state via our olfactory system. \"The connection between scent and emotion is lightning-fast, which is why aromatherapy can be such a powerful tool,\" says natural skin care expert and founder of [Osmia](http://osmiaorganics.com/pages/about-us) [Sarah Villafranco, M.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/dr-sarah-villafranco) For cleansing purposes, you can work with lavender and Roman chamomile to create a calm state. And for spiritual purposes? Sandalwood has been used for centuries in spiritual ceremonies and meditation. Sauna and sweat Whether it's the Mayan rituals of temazcal still practiced in Mexico and Central America or the smoke sauna traditional to Finland, humans spanning cultures and timelines seem to agree on the cleansing properties of sweat. [Studies](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2012/184745/) have even found heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury in our sweat, which implicate its detoxifying nature. But stepping out of the sauna, we don't just feel physically lighter\u2014we feel mentally, emotionally, and spiritually reinvigorated too. Advertisement Spiritual cleansing with sage Sage might be the most well-known sacred smoke, but Yashoda Devi Ma shares that copal and sandalwood also have a deeply purifying effect on us and the environment. \"Most cultures that use sacred smoke are preparing and setting the tone of the environment for a meditative, deep, relaxed experience,\" she tells mindbodygreen, adding, \"These sacred smokes purify, clear, and uplift the energy within our mind/body and our space.\" Breathwork Both Yashoda Devi Ma and Matluck point to [breathwork](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-breathwork-is) as one of the most potent forms of spiritual cleansing. \"Conscious breathing strengthens the connection between our body and mind,\" Yashoda Devi Ma explains, adding, \"It stabilizes the mind, relaxes the brain, creates brain coherence, and supports multiple aspects of physical health\u2014including lung function, blood pressure, and brain function.\" Spend time in nature Spending time in nature is one of the most powerful and accessible forms of spiritual cleansing. \"Going into nature connects us to our soul and the oneness of everything around us,\" Yashoda Devi Ma notes. \" [Forest bathing](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/health-benefits-of-nature) is a simple method of allowing ourselves to be calm and quiet, to connect to the trees, listen to the birds, and observe nature while consciously breathing deeply. It's an easy way to de-stress and enhance our well-being,\" she adds. Ayurvedic rituals As Matluck says, \"Different cultures and traditions prefer different [cleansing] techniques for various reasons.\" A leading example is [Ayurveda](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ayurveda-for-beginners-how-to-balance-your-doshas), one of the oldest traditional systems of medicines, founded in India. Ayurveda (or, the science of life) offers an entire system of cleansing, with common techniques including: - Seasonal Ayurvedic cleanse: Ayurveda considers the transitions between seasons an optimal time to cleanse the physical, mental, and emotional toxicities we have taken on. [Abhyanga](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/abhyanga-benefits-of-ayurvedic-self-massage)self-massage: This massage technique entails rubbing the entire body, head to toe, with a specific oil to improve circulation, cultivate self-love, and balance energy. - Panchakarma: A longer-term, intensive treatment program designed to cleanse and purify the body, mind, and consciousness, according to Ayurvedic principles. Journaling Journaling is associated with [decreased mental distress and increased well-being](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305886/) [3](#citations), with [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17576282/) [4](#citations) finding that when we put our feelings into words, we activate the part of our brain that processes emotions. Just by putting pen to paper, we allow emotional energy to move through us more effectively. It doesn't matter whether your journal is full of confessions, poems, or scribbles\u2014it's the practice that makes it powerful. 5 signs you're in need of a spiritual cleanse.

FAQs What does spiritual cleansing mean? Spiritual cleansing means engaging in the rituals and practices that remove toxicity and impurities from your energetic field.
