[My Philosophy](/services-treatment-options/) - I focus on health and preventive care and choose safe and effective natural therapies - I believe that a healthy lifestyle and proactive medical care prevent disease. - I review your entire medical health history to discover the cause of your complaint and the root of your symptoms. - I use the best tools from both conventional and alternative medicine. - I respect that you are a whole person - body, mind, and spirit and I support you in achieving balance. - I keep \"care\" in healthcare. This means that I treat you like I would want to be treated. - I address a wide spectrum of health concerns for all ages, with a special emphasis on gastrointestinal health and nutrition, eating disorders, autism, PTSD, PCOS, diabetes, and healthy aging.
