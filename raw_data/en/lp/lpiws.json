To achievethese goals, NCCAM supports basic and clinical research, issues training andcareer development awards, and sponsors outreach activities, with the goal ofenabling integration of scientifically proven complementary and alternativepractices with conventional medicine. Selective Achievements and Initiatives: Stemming the Obesity Epidemic: NCCAM, as a partner in the obesity research agenda developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sup-ports studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of popular, but unsubstantiat-ed, dietary approaches to obesity and its many complications. In 2003, theCenter 's investment in this area yielded results, when the findings of a one- year, multi-center trial regarding the apparent beneficial short-term effects ofthe low carbohydrate (Atkins) diet on weight loss and risk factors for cardio-vascular disease were published in the New England Journal of Medicine . In addition to examining the effects of alternative diets on weight loss, theCenter is supporting studies on CAM interventions, such as meditation, astreatments for obesity and binge eating. To encourage more research onCAM approaches to weight loss, NCCAM is cosponsoring several majorNIH obesity research initiatives and conducting research in its intramurallaboratories on diseases linked to obesity \u2014 particularly, diabetes. Ensuring the Safety and Efficacy of Botanical Products: Millions of Americans use botanical products, marketed as dietary supplements, to pre-vent disease, maintain wellness, or treat illness or pain. NCCAM supports acontinuum of research on botanical products that includes developing stan-dardized, well-characterized products suitable for use in human clinical tri-als, studying the efficacy of botanicals as potential treatments or preventativeagents, and analyzing herb-drug interactions. Recent advances addressedconditions ranging from cancer to the common cold. For example, in 2003,scientists demonstrated how extracts from a Chinese herb, Scutellariabaicalensis, inhibit the growth of human head and neck cancer cells in vitroand in mice, while another study concluded that one echinacea product wasnot effective in treating upper respiratory infections in children. The Centerrecently launched a major initiative to clarify the health benefits of cranberryand its mechanisms of action, particularly for urinary tract infections and, in collaboration with its NIH partners, will award new Botanical ResearchCenter grants early in 2005 to support interdisciplinary studies of botanicalsto generate evidence regarding their safety and potential public health bene-fits. Further, the Center is cosponsoring the largest randomized Phase IIIclinical trial to date of the botanical Ginkgo biloba to determine if it can pre-vent cognitive decline in the elderly. To broaden its botanical research agen-da in 2005, the Center will seek applications for Phase I/II studies on the NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINENCCAM45 The National Institutes of Health A Resource Guide April 2005safety and tolerability of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Examining Brain-Body Interactions: NCCAM scientists are exploring practices such as meditation, acupuncture, hypnosis, and yoga tounderstand their abilities to harness the healing effects of the mind onthe body. For example, NCCAM grantees are conducting pilot studiesof yoga as a behavioral intervention for the management of chroniclung disease, insomnia, and chronic low back pain, as well as investi-gating the effect of CAM modalities on immune system functioning. In2003, NCCAM-funded researchers reported that a traditional Chinesemeditative exercise regimen, Tai Chi, could enhance physical perfor-mance and immune responses in older people. An extension of brain-body research, mind-brain research, investigates the connectionbetween the conscious mind and the brain and how this interfaceaffects the body 's response to a variety of diseases and disorders. In 2004, NCCAM funded mind-brain research to study the use of CAMtherapies for neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer 's disease, pain, and depression. Understanding CAM and Special Populations: NCCAM has launched studies to enhance understanding of the interplay of race and ethnicityin CAM use. One study, for instance, will examine four data sets tounderstand how age, gender, and locale affect various minorities ' use of CAM as part of their self-management of highly prevalent chronicconditions, such as diabetes. Researchers are examining the data forpatterns of CAM use to construct a clearer picture of how AfricanAmerican, Hispanic, and Native Americans use CAM therapies.NCCAM also proposes awarding planning grants to foster collabora-tive interactions between investigators at minority/minority-serving(M/MSI) institutions and CAM and conventional researchers toimprove the ability of M/MSI investigators to compete for CAMresearch grants and to encourage more research on health disparitiesamong minority populations. Gender, just as race, appears to play an important role in CAM use, and women 's health has been a particular focus of the Center since its inception. According to a 1999 National Health Interview Survey, pre-and-post-menopausal women are the most prevalent users of CAMtherapies. In the wake of findings on potential health risks of hormonetherapy, women are turning to CAM therapies to treat a range ofmenopausal symptoms. Numerous ongoing NCCAM-funded studiestarget menopause-related CAM therapies. Some seek to refine ourknowledge of the role of plant-based estrogens, called phytoestrogens,in breast cancer and cognitive functioning. Another study examinesthe function of black cohosh, a botanical that does not contain phytoe-strogens but may act as an antidepressant. Should black cohosh proveto work in this way, it may help menopausal women who suffer seriousmood changes and depression.
