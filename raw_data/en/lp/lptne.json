Luoma PEN 15 SEPTEMBER 2008OLD PROBLEMS OR NEW CHALLENGES?SILVER NANOTECHNOLOGIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT :1Dr. Samuel Luoma has given us an excellent description and analysis of the science of silver and nanosilver. His paper raises many questions for policy makers. Its subtitle, \"Old Problems or New Challenges,\" is appropriate, because the subject of the paper is both. Metals are among theoldest of environmental problems. Lead, silver and mercury have posed health hazards for thou- sands of years, and they are as persistent in the environmental policy world as they are in the environment. Nanotechnology is a new challenge, but the scope of the policy issues it presents is as broad and difficult as the technology itself. As the paper makes clear, there is much we do not know about the environmental pathways of nanosilver, its environmental effects and its impact on human health. However, as Luomanotes, ionic silver, a form of nanosilver, when tested in the laboratory, is one of the most toxicmetals to aquatic organisms. Ionic silver is being used now in washing machines and otherproducts. The need for research is urgent. The major experiment being conducted now is to putnanosilver products on the market, expose large numbers of people and broad areas of the envi-ronment and then wait and hope that nothing bad happens. This is a dangerous way to pro-ceed. The experiments need to come before the marketing so that damage can be avoided ratherthan regretted. Dr. Luoma employs a useful environmental framework, starting with sources of nanosilver, then dealing with its pathways in the environment and ending with receptors and impact.Policy makers use the same model, only in reverse. They start with the question of whetherthere is an impact, then analyze the environmental pathways and finally deal with whether andhow to control the sources. The impacts are the policy starting point, so the fact that less than 5 percent of the money being spent on nanotechnology by the U.S. government is being spent to study health and envi-ronmental impacts demonstrates a questionable sense of priorities. That is the major policy issue.However, there is also a need for surveillance and reporting. Workers, consumers, lakes andstreams are being exposed to nanosilver and, while the experimentation is unfortunate, societyshould at least learn fr om it. P eople working with nano need to be monitored, and key aspects ofthe environment exposed to nanosilver should be investigated. Some of this will be done by scientific institutions, public and private. However, some of it, for example, medical monitoring of workers, may require government regulation. There is another connection between regulation and impacts, one that is less well recognized. As Luoma notes, \"the formulation and form of a nanoparticle has great influence on the risksthat it poses.\" Silver in different nanoproducts can be in the form of silver ions, silver colloidsolutions or silver nanoparticles. The nanosilver can come in different shapes, have different elec-trical charges and be combined with other materials and coated in different ways. Each of thesefactors, as well as others, affects toxicity and environmental behavior. If we are to discover howthese different factors impact nanosilver's toxicity and environmental behavior, it will only be bytesting a large number of specific products that have different characteristics. This is not the kindFOREWORDof testing that will be done by universities or government laboratories. The only way that these data are likely to be collected is by requiring manufacturers to test their nanosilver products. Although it would be neater and more efficient to mandate testing of nanoproducts only after we knew how particular product characteristics influence toxicity, in reality the only way we are going to gain this knowledge is by first mandating that manufacturers test their nanoproducts for health and environmental effects. As Dr. Luoma describes, little is known about the environmental pathways of nanosilver. The policy challenge that emerges from his description is how to match the antiquated air-water-landbasis of existing laws with the inherently cross-media nature of the problem. Nanosilver can go from a manufacturing plant to a waste-treatment plant to sludge to crops to the human-food chain. It is considered primarily a water problem in the environment but primarily an air prob-lem in the workplace. Like climate change, acid rain and genetically modified crops, nanosilveris a problem that fits poorly into the old boxes of the existing regulatory system. One reason a cross-media approach is necessary is that it allows a policy maker to consider which sources of pollution or exposure are most important and which can be most efficientlyand effectively addressed. Current efforts to address nanosilver are using the few cross-mediatools the United States has\u2014specifically, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The two acts are quite differentin several ways. TSCA is broad and potentially could cover most nanomaterials. FIFRA, bycontrast, is limited to pesticides, which are defined to include antimicrobials. However, sincenanosilver is used primarily as an antimicrobial, most nanosilver products may come underFIFRA. The acts also differ in the degr eeof public pr otection and pr oduct o versight they offer. FIFRA is quite stringent and puts the bur den of pr oof for safety on the manufactur er.TSCA is riddled with loopholes and puts the bur den of pr oof on the U.S. E nvironmental Protection Agency (USEP A) to sho wthat a substance is harmful. The extent to which USEP Awill use FIFRA to r egulate nanosilv er pr oducts is uncertain. The agency has r eversed a pr evious decision and decided that the S amsung Silver Wash wash- ing machine, which emits silv er ions into ev erywash load, must be registered as a pesticide. However, that decision was drawn in the narrowest possible terms, making it clear that the agency has not decided to r equire registration for the numerous other commercial products that areusing nanosilv er as an antimicrobial. Several environmental groups have joined to petition the agency to r equir eregistration for the other pr oducts, but the agency has not y et respond- ed. M eanwhile, USEP A'sSan Francisco regional office has imposed a fine on a company sell- ing computer keyboar ds and mouses coated with nanosilv er on the gr ounds that the pr oducts should hav ebeen r egister ed under FIFRA. H owever, it is not clear that this represents a gener- al policy ,either in R egion IX or for USEP Aas a whole. I tseems more likely that this is a one- time case, perhaps intended as a signal to discourage widespr ead use of nanosilv er coatings. Ther eis no legal or technical r eason why FIFRA could not be used to r egulate most nanosilv er products. H owever, an initiative to do so would require dollars and personnel, and both ar ein shor tsupply within USEP A. M ore important, it is not clear that the agency would 23want to launch a major regulatory initiative in the waning days of a fervently antiregulatory administration. The Bush administration has significantly reduced USEPA's budget, and the current USEPA administrator seems willing to be guided by White House directives when it comes to major decisions. Dr. Luoma, while conceding that little is known about the quantities or concentrations of nanosilver releases from various sources, states that \"industrial releases associated with manu- facturing the nanosilver that goes into the consumer products or production of the products themselves is likely to be greater than consumer releases.\" If this is so, it will be necessary to look to the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Clean Air Act (CAA) to control nanoreleases. This is unfortunate, because at present there are major technical obstacles to using these acts.Practical methods for monitoring nanosilver in air and water and methods for controllingreleases to air and water are lacking. The monitoring problem is especially difficult because it is not clear what should be moni- tored. Simple measures of quantity, mass or concentration that are used for other pollutants areprobably not adequate for monitoring nanomaterials. As noted above, there are more than adozen characteristics of nanosilver that are relevant to its health and environmental impact.There is no technique for ambient monitoring all these characteristics, nor is it clear how theycan be narrowed to a manageable number for monitoring. Without the ability to monitor, it isdifficult to regulate using the CAA or CWA, although some version of \"good managementpractices\" might be used until monitoring methods are developed. Silver is an old problem, and nanosilver is a new challenge. The scope of the new challenge is not yet clear because it is unclear how much nanosilver will be used as an antimicrobial andbecause ne wuses ar elikely to be disco vered. Regardless of the scope of the nanosilver problem, it underscor es the need for ne wapproaches to oversight to deal with the new technologies and problems of the ne wcentur y. Laws and institutions shaped in the mid-20th century are not likely to succeed in addr essing 21st-centur yproblems. Developing a new approach to oversight and r egulation may be the biggest challenge of all. \u2014J.

Potentially great benefits are accompanied by a potential for environmental risks, posed bothby the physical and chemical traits of the materials. We need not assume that because nano is new, we have no scientific basis for managing risks, however. Our existing knowledge of silver in the environment provides a starting point for some assessments, and points toward some of the new questions raised by the unique properties of nanoparticles. Starting from what we know about silver itself, this report identifies 12 lessons for managing environmental risksfrom nanosilver. These lessons help set the stage for both the research strategy and the riskmanagement strategy. Silver itself is classified as an environmental hazard because it is toxic, persistent and bioac- cumulativ eunder at least some cir cumstances. Aside from releasing silver, the toxicity, bioac- cumulativ epotential and persistence of nanosilv er materials ar ejust beginning to be kno wn. But enough is kno wn to be cer risks must be inv estigated. Nearly one-thir dof nanosilv er products on the mar ket in S eptember 2007 had the potential to disperse silv er or silv er nanopar ticles into the envir onment. The silv er content of these materials appears to v arywidely .Reports on the form of the silv er in these pr oducts ar egen- erally inconsistent and do not follo wscientific definitions. G uidelines for concentrations and formulations of r educed to xicity might offer oppor tunities for r egulation. The mass of silv er dispersed to the envir onment fr om ne wproducts could be substantial if use of one pr oduct, or a combination of such pr oducts, becomes widespr ead. Traditional photography established a pr ecedent for ho wasilver-based technology that was used b ymil- lions of people could constitute an envir onmental risk. R elease of silv er to waste eams when photographs w eredeveloped was the primar ycause of silv er contamination in water bodies r eceiving wastes from human activities, and of adverse ecological effects where stud- ies were conducted. Risk assessment(s) will ultimately be necessary for at least some products employing silver nanomaterials. Risk assessments will require information about mass loadings to the envi-ronment. Such information is not currently available. Neither government reporting require-ments nor product information is sufficient to construct reliable estimates of mass dischargesfrom these new nanosilver technologies, but the potential exists for releases comparable to orgreater than those from consumer usage of traditional photography. There are no examples of adverse effects from nanosilver technologies occurring in the envi- ronment at the present. But environmental surveillance is a critical requirement for a futurerisk management strategy, because silver nanoproducts are rapidly proliferating through the consumer marketplace. Few if any methodologies exist for routine environmental surveil- lance of nanomaterials, including nanosilver. Monitoring silver itself, in water, sediment or biomonitors, could be a viable interim approach until methods specific to the nanomaterial are developed. Silver concentrations in natural waters, even those contaminated by human activities, range from 0.03 to 500 nanograms/liter (ng/L). Even substantial proliferation of silver nanotech- nologies is unlikely to produce pollutant concentrations in excess of the ng/L range. Environmental surveillance methodologies must be capable of detecting changes in concen-trations within this range. Toxicity testing should focus on realistic exposure conditions and exposures in the ng/L range, and not on short-term acute toxicity. Sensitive toxicity tests and environmental casestudies have shown that silver metal is toxic at concentrations equal to or greater than 50ng/L. One well-designed study on nanosilver has shown toxicity at even lower concentra-tions to the development of fish embryos. Even though the potential concentrations in con-taminated waters may seem low, environmental risks cannot be discounted. The envir onmental risks fr om silv er itself can be mitigated b yatendency of the silv er ion to form str ong complex es that ar eappar ently of v erylowbioavailability and toxicity. under some cir cumstances. I tis not y et clear to what extent such speciation r eactions will affect the to xicity of nanosilv er.If organic/sulfide coatings, or complexation, educe bioav ailability of nanosilv er par ticles, the risks to natural waters will be r educed. B ut it is also possible that nanopar ticles ions to the mem- branes of organisms or into cells (a \" Trojan horse \"mechanism). I nthat case, an accentua - tion of envir onmental risks would be expected bey ond that associated with a similar mass of silver itself. The T rojan horse mechanism is an important area for future research, especially for nanosilver. The environmental fate of nanosilver will depend upon the nature of the nanoparticle. Nanoparticles that aggregate and/or associate with dissolved or particulate materials innatur ewill likely end up deposited in sediments or soils. The bioavailability of these materi- als will be determined b ytheir uptake when ingested by organisms. Some types of silver nanopar ticles are engineered to remain dispersed in water, however. The persistence of these particles, on timescales of environmental relevance (days to years), is not known. Silver is highly toxic to bacteria, and that toxicity seems to be accentuated when silver is delivered by a nanoparticle. Dose response with different delivery systems and in different delivery environments has not been systematically studied. 6When the ionic form is bioavailable, silver is more toxic to aquatic organisms than any other metal except mercury. But no comparable body of information is available for nanosilver.Uptake of nanomaterials by endocytosis appears to explain toxicity in higher organisms(marine invertebrates). Other portals for uptake across the membrane (e.g., protein trans- porters or pores) also appear to exist. Risk of toxicity may be accentuated if endocytosis delivers a bundle of potential silver ions, in the form of a nanosilver particle, to the interior of cells, where it can release silver ions in the proximity of cell machinery. Signs of silver stress in such circumstances should include lysosomal destabilization and generation ofreduced oxygen species. Nanosilver may also affect development of embryos and otheraspects of reproduction at environmentally realistic concentrations. All these mechanismsdeser ve further investigation. Silver is not known as a systemic toxin to humans except at extreme doses. Silver itself is taken into the body but seems to largely deposit in innocuous forms in basement mem-branes, away from intracellular machinery, where it could cause damage. Whether nanosil-ver particles have a similar fate in human tissues is unknown. One study showed that onceinside cells, silv er nanopar ticles ar emoretoxic than par ticles composed of more innocuous materials such ir on, titanium or molybdenum. Ther eis contr oversy about whether silver treatment of wounds might slo wgrowth of healthy cells, at least in some cir cumstances. Indirect effects hav enot been adequately inv estigated. E xamples of areas needing further research include to xicity to bacteria on the skin fr om chr onic silver exposure (as in silver- laden clothing or bedding materials) and effects to or in the gut fr om chr onic or \" kno wledge pr ovides a po werful baseline from which to identify research pri- orities and to begin making scientifically defensible policy decisions about nanosilv er. Adequate r esour ces for r esearch, interdisciplinary collaboration, new ways to integrate inter- ests of div erse institutions and linkage betw een r esearch and decision making are necessary if weare to fully exploit the potential benefits, and limit the unnecessary risks, of this rap- idly pr oliferating technology . 7Silver has been known since antiquity for its many properties useful to humans. It is, how- ever, an element of many faces. It is used as a precious commodity in currencies, ornaments and jewelry. It has the highest electrical con-ductivity of any element, a property useful inelectrical contacts and conductors. Its chemicaltraits allow uses ranging from dental alloys toexplosives. The way it reacts to light (photo-chemistry) was manipulated to develop tradi-tional photography. Claims of medicinal prop-erties have followed silver since the time ofHippocrates, the father of medicine. Mostimportant, silver has long been used as a disin-fectant; for example, in treating wounds andburns, because of its br oad-spectr um to xicity to bacteria and, perhaps, to fungus and vir us- es, as w ell as its r eputation of limited to xicity to humans. Onthe other hand, silv er is designated b y the U.S. E nvironmental P rotection Agency (USEP A) as a priority pollutant in natural waters. The inclusion of silv er on the 1977 pri - ority pollutant list 1(still in effect) means it is one of 136 chemicals whose discharge to theaquatic environment must be regulated. Thisdesignation is based upon silv er's persistence in the envir onment and its high toxicity to some life forms when released to natural waters from photographic facilities, smelters, mines orurban wastes. The dichotomies in the long his-tory of human contact with silver, its use as abiocide and its designation as an environmen-tal toxin stem from the complexities of silver'sbehavior in the environment. Notably, silverhas not been studied in depth compared toother heavy metal pollutants. The environmental implications of silver are of increasing interest because new technologies are rapidly emerging that carry with them ele- ments of silver's complex nature and history. Recent advances in nanoscience have uncoverednovel properties in materials at the nanoscale(materials typically smaller than 100 nanome-ters [nm] in one critical dimension).Nanotechnologies use this knowledge to synthe-size, modify and manipulate nanomaterials. Theresulting products have unique physical, chemi-cal and biological characteristics 2(Text box 1). Commercial products that generate silver ions or contain nanosilver are one of the mostrapidly growing classes of nanoproducts. Mostof the emerging pr oducts exploit silv er'seffec- tiveness in killing a wide range of bacteria (thus the term broad-spectr um biocide ), including some of the strains that hav eproven resistant to modern antibiotics. What is ne wis that advances in nanotechnology allo wheretofor e unavailable methods of manipulating silv er so that it can be r eadily incorporated into plastics, fabrics and onto sur faces (H enig, 2007). Perhaps most impor tant, nanosilv er par ticles deliver toxic silver ions in large doses directly to sites wher ethey most effectively attack microbes. And the technology appears to be cost-effective. To date, silver is used in more manufacturer- identified consumer products than any othernanomaterial. 3Hundreds of nanosilver products are currently on the market, and their number isgrowing rapidly. Searching Google for \"nanosil-ver\" yielded 3.5 million hits in October 2007,more than half of which were for nanosilverproducts. But most of the data on products9Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment I. INTRODUCTION10 Nanoscience is defined by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, United Kingdom (2004) as the study of phenomena and manipulation of materials at atomic, molecularand macromolecular scales, where propertiesdiffer significantly from those at a larger scale. The academy defines nanotechnologies as the design, characterization, production and application of structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale. Terms such as nanoparticle and nanoma- terial are used inconsistently and/or inter- changeably in commercial, and even scientific,literatur e. The of ficial standar ds organization of the United Kingdom, the British Standards Institution (BSI), has r ecently pr ovided some for- mal definitions. The BSI defines the nanoscale as between 1-100 nm. A nanomaterial is defined by BSI as having one or more externaldimension in the nanoscale (BSI, 2007). A nanoobject is a discrete piece of material with one or mor eexternal dimensions in the nanoscale. A nanopar ticle is a nanoobject with all three external dimensions in thenanoscale. A manufactured nanoparticle is a solid entity with size from approximately 1 nm to 100 nm in at least two dimensions that hasbeen produced by a manufacturing process. Nanopr oducts arethose to which nanopar ti- cles \"are intentionally added, mixed, attached, embedded or suspended.\" Nanomaterials ar eof interest because they have novel properties and functions attributable to their small size. First, they have greater sur- face area when compared to the same mass ofmaterial in larger particles (Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, 2004). Lar ger surface area per unit mass can make materials more chemically reactive. Some materials, such as gold, are inert in their larger particles but are reactive as nanopar ticles. Second, quantum effects can begin to dominate the behavior of matter at the nanoscale, par ticularly the smaller nanomaterials. The result is development of unique optical, electrical and magnetic behav- iors. Materials can be pr oduced that ar e nanoscale in one dimension (very thin surface coatings), in two dimensions (nanowires and nanotubes) or in all three dimensions (nanopar-ticles). The feature common to the diverse activ- ities characterized as \"nanotechnology\" is the tiny dimensions on which they operate. The abil- ity to systematically control the distribution ofparticles or to manipulate matter on this scale iswhat has driven new advances in nanotechnol- ogy (see Figure 1). Inthis report, s ilverrefers to any specified form of the element silver or to the mixture of forms that occur in that particular environmental setting. The silver ion is the most fundamental entity of silver. It is an atom in which the number of electr ons is one less than the number of pro- tons, creating a positively charged cation (thus written Ag+). The ionic radius of a silver ion is ~0.1 nm (Figur e2). A silver ion is not usually considered a particle, and its surface area is irrelevant in the context we are considering here. But ions are highly reactive because theyTEXT BOX 1. Nanoparticles, nanotechnology FIGURE 1 Nanotechnology deals with nanopar ticles aligned in an or dered manner as subunits in a functional system.

Even though they are of appropriate size, they will not be functional if they lack order. In that case, the ter mnanotechnology does not apply. ( Wiredmag- azine, December 2005. Available at http://www.wired.com/ science/discoveries/news/2005/12/69772)a busing or containing nanosilver are anecdotal. There are no reporting requirements or official government registries for such products. A recent survey used the Internet in an attempt toidentify products that employed the emerging silver technologies (Fauss, 2008). The 240 products that were identified in this survey, which concluded in September 2007 were lim- ited to those that advertised their use of nanosil-ver. Nevertheless, the range of products andproposals is impressive. 4 Anumber of products use nanosilver in medicine and water purification. Because oftheir potential to address long-standing and dif-ficult problems, such uses are expected to growrapidly. For example, a number of new uses ofnanosilver coatings on medical devices seem toreduce infection rates (Gibbons and Warner,2005). Highly organized microbial communi-ties called biofilms ar ethe leading in many life-thr eatening infections and ar epartic- ularly difficult to eliminate once established within the human body .Nonliving sur faces that penetrate the body or ar eimplanted within the body ar eprone to suppor ting growth of micr obial biofilms. N anosilv er coatings on the sur faces of ar tificial joints, pacemakers, ar tificial hear tvalves and Teflon sleeves for the r epair of blood v essels and catheters, among other devices, have great potential to pr event these deadly microbial growths. A number of companies are now marketing urinary, dialysis and other catheters with such coatings. Silver-impregnated band-ages and dressings are the treatment of choicefor serious burns and are now available over-the-counter for the local treatment of woundsand elimination of pathogenic bacteria(Vermuelen et al., 2007). Ceramic filters thatincorporate a coating of nanosilver for waterpurification are proposed as a small-scale solu-tion to the drinking water purification prob-11Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment are charged.

Buthere we refer to silver nanomaterial ornano- particles as made up of many atoms of silver in theformof silver ions\u2014 clus - ters of metallic silver atoms and/or silver compounds(e.g., Balogh et al., 2001)engineered into a particleof nanoscale size. High surface area is a particu-larly important property fornanosilver, because itincreases the rate at which silver ions are released. A nanosilver par ticle, in contrast to an ion, is notnecessarily persistent. Part- icles can dissolve or disaggregate, for example,which means they fundamentally transform andwill not necessarily re-form, losing the propertiesofaparticle. Thus, silver ions and silver nanopar ticles are fundamentally different. The term colloid is often also applied to silver .Acol- loid (Figur e2) is defined as a particle any- where in the wide range between 1 nm and 1,000 nm. That is, a colloid may or may not be ananopar ticle. Aquatic colloids can also be defined by their physical behavior .Colloids ar e held in suspension in natural waters, aiding transport of any material associated with them (colloid-facilitated transport). Particles are largerand tend to settle to the bottom if undisturbed. In this r eport, nanosilver and silver nano - particle refer to a nanoparticle or a nanocoat- ing comprised of many atoms of silver engi- neered for a specified use. Silver nanopar ticles areusually engineered to release silver ions, which are the source of antibacterial activity.

The greatest growth, however, is in consumer products utilizing nanosilver to fight bacterialgrowth in circumstances where the benefits are less clear. The Wilson Center website 3shows that nanosilver can be found in tableware, chop-sticks, food preparation equip-ment and food storage contain- ers. Colloidal silv er was appar- ently spray ed on surfaces of the Hong Kong underground trans- port system as a public health measure, a move that is alsobeing considered by the city ofLondon. 5Silver ion generators are commercially available thatdisperse the ion into the watersof machines used to washclothes and dishes, and nanosil-ver is appearing in applianceslike refrigerators, vacuums, air-filtration devices and Nanosilver is beingspun thread, incorporatedinto plastics, impregnated intofilters and painted onto productsurfaces. Products that can bepurchased with nanosilver ingre- dients sports- wear; and bedding ters, sheets and mattr ess co vers. There's even a nanosil- ver bab ymug and pacifier .Nanosilv er can be found in personal-gr ooming kits, female-hygiene products, beauty soaps, cleansers and fabric sof - teners. I tis used as a pr eservative in cosmetics, whereit is combined with nanopar ticles of titani - um dio xide. N anosilv er sprays or mists can be purchased on the I nternet to disinfect and deodoriz esurfaces in kitchens, bathr ooms and babyclothes. Claims of general health benefitsfrom drinking silver solutions also are heard. One company's website recommends ingesting a tea- spoon of silver colloid per day \"to help maintainhealth,\" and one tablespoon four times per day to \"help fortify the immune system.\" Another web- number of people using col- loidal silver as a dietary supplement on a dailybasis is measured in the millions .\" Risks, efficacy or even necessity are not always obvious for many of the consumer products. Many of these products bring nanosilver directly into contact with the human body (H enig, 2007). Others have the potential to disperse(nano) silver to the environment during and aftertheir use. No known cases exist of people or the envi- ronment being harmed specifically by nanomate-rials or nanosilver. The absence of cases couldreflect limited experience with nanomaterials orlack of knowledge about what effects to expect.For this reason, unease over poor understandingof the potential health and environmental risksfrom nanomaterials is growing. Such concernswere expressed by the Royal Society and theRoyal Academy of Engineering in the UnitedKingdom (2004), the European Commission'sAction Plan for Nanotechnology (2005),USEPA's Nanotechnology White Paper (USEPA,2007) and a growing number of editorials intrade and popular publications. Recent scientificanalyses identify the grand challenges in under - standing risks fr om nanomaterials (M aynar det al., 2006). O ther ar ticles suggest strategies for developing the necessar yknowledge about risks (Owen and H andy,2007; O berd\u00f6rster et al., 2005) and addr ess managing risks within existing legal frame works (D avies, 2007).

The central question involves a trade-off between unknown risks and established benefits for society (Colvin, 2003). For nanosilver, that situation is compli-cated by limited understanding of both benefits and environmental implications. In addition, the rapid growth of emerging silver technologieshas created an atmosphere of confusion aboutthe science that unnecessarily adds to the inco-herence of the dialogue. Understanding of implications of silver metal in the environment provides an impor-tant context for understanding the implicationsof nanosilver. At least part of the risk fromnanosilver will stem from release of silver ions(Blaser et al., 2008). The existing knowledgeabout the metal provides a place to begin a sys-tematic analysis of the potential environmentalrisks fr om the nanomaterials, and can at the least be used to highlight impor tant inv estiga - tiveneeds. onmental effects of silv er metal. Implications of incr easing silv er metal releases to the envir onment ar ethe first or der of risks emerging fr om silv er nanotechnology . Implications of releasing silver in nanoparticle form could add to (or subtract fr om) the risks from silver metal contamination. Nanosilver implications could differ from silver metal implications in some ways, but the conceptsthat guide assessment of those risks should havemany areas of similarity. While there are uncer-tainties about implications, there is enough evi-dence from laboratory tests with both silvermetal and nanosilver to be certain that potentialadverse effects from silver nanotechnologiesmust be investigated (Davies, 2007). Human society has repeatedly faced chal- lenges with chemicals whose immediate bene-fits were clear and whose potential risks were unknown. In some cases, commercial applica- tions moved forward in a \"grand experiment\" with nature. Substantial and ongoing environ- mental or human-health damage were the result in examples that include asbestos, long- lived pesticides like DDT, persistent chemicalslike dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls and the climatic changes now attributable to com- bustion of fossil fuels. Such mistakes have con-tributed both to degradation of the environ-ment and to an erosion of public trust in thetraditional institutions assigned to protect theenvironment (L\u00f6fsted, 2005). The socialatmosphere is now one where uncertaintyabout risks from a new technology can \"affectthe trajectory of commercialization\" (Colvin,2003). If unanticipated adverse effects are dis-covered, or the perception of such effectsgrows, opportunities could be lost for substan-tial benefits to society from even those aspectsof the technologies that ar erelativ ely benign (Davies, 2007). I tis imperativ ethat the scien - tific community begin to aggr essively addr ess the issue of risks fr om ne wtechnologies, such as the emerging silv er technologies and the other nanotechnologies of which they ar ea part(Maynar det al., 2006), in order to \"strike the balance betw een the harm that could be done b yproceeding with an innovation and the harm that could be done b ynot proceed- ing\" (Davies quoted in Henig, 2007). Our knowledge is not adequate to conduct a full risk assessment for nanosilver. But the riskassessment paradigm (Suter, 2006) provides astructure within which to analyze potential fornanorisks. The next section of this reportaddresses what is known about silver metal. Section III addresses the unique implications of using and releasing silver in nanoparticleform. The report concludes with recommenda-tions for next steps. HISTORY OF SILVER TOXICITY One of the important uncertainties about nanosilver technologies is the contradiction between the long history of intimate human use of silver and its classification as a persistent and toxic pollutant. Silver (Ag) is a chemical element with an atomic weight of 47. It is rare (67th inabundance among the elements) and thus a pr e- cious metal that has long been handled as cur - rency and worn as je welry.Silver implements havelong been associated with eating and drink - ing. I tis used in the highest-quality cutler y(\"sil- verware\") and was used in storage vessels for water and wine in civilizations dating back to the Phoenicians (lead was also used in this way b y the R omans). M any such uses ar ethought to reflect its po wers to prevent decay of foodstuffs. The long histor yof human contact with bulk sil - ver includes no ob vious negativ eside effects on human health, an argument sometimes used to imply that the likelihood that significant envi - ronmental impacts will occur fr om the new sil- ver technologies is lo w. Silver's use in medicine also has a long histo- ry.Around 1884, the German obstetrician C. S. F.Crede introduced l% silver nitrate as an eye solution to prevent infections in babies born of mothers with gonorrhea (Eisler, 1996). Silvernitrate eye drops are still a legal requirement fornewborn infants in some jurisdictions (Chenand Schleusner, 2007). Silver compounds wereused extensively to prevent wound infection in World War I, and silver was found in caustics, germicides, antiseptics and astringents, pr esum - ably as a disinfectant. With the advent of more selectiv eantibiotics like penicillin and cephalosporin, most medicinal uses of silv erdeclined. A mixture of silver and sulfa drugs (e.g., silver sulfadiazine cream) remains the stan-dard antibacterial treatment for serious burnwounds. Acursory historical analysis seems to point toward silver as a benign disinfectant; however, complexities appear upon mor ecareful examina- tion and as uses in medicine grow. Hollinger (1996) predicted that \"as the intentional utiliza-tion of silver in pharmaceutical preparations anddevices incr eases, subtle to xic effects of silv er may be pr edictable and expected. \"Hecited delayed wound healing, absorption into systemic cir cula- tion and localiz ed to xicity to cells need- ing inv estigation. Episodes of envir onmental toxicity resulting from silv er pollution are rare (Rodgers et al., 1997); ho wever, a more careful examination shows evidence of potential ecological signifi- cance. I onic silver is one of the most toxic metals known to aquatic organisms in laboratory test- ing (e.g., Eisler, 1996). Silver persists and accu-mulates to elevated concentrations in water, sed-iments, soils and organisms where human wastesare discharged to the environment. Well-docu-mented examples also exist where silver contam-ination in water and mud corresponds stronglywith ecological damage to the environment(Hornberger et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2003). SOURCE-PATHWAY-RECEPTOR-IMPACT The complex behavior of silver contributes to the contradictory conclusions about its effectson human health and the environment: Different uses release silver in different forms and differ ent quantities. 14 II. FATE AND EFFECTS OF SILVER IN THE ENVIRONMENT15Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment Quantifying the mass of silver ultimately released to the environment (or to the body) from a given use is necessary to evaluate the risk associated with that use. Complex geo- chemical reactions determine how thosereleases translate to silver concentrations in food, water, sediments, soils or topical applications. Silver concentrations in the environment determine impacts. But concentrations inthe envir onment are low compared with those of many other elements, adding to thechallenge of obtaining r eliable data on envi - ronmental tr ends. S imilarly low concentra- tions of nanosilv er might be expected wher e waste pr oducts fr om its uses are released, although nanopar ticle-specific transpor t and accumulation mechanisms might also be expected. The environmental chemistry of silver metal influences bioav ailability and toxicity in complex ways (wher ebioavailability is defined by the physical, geochemical andbiological processes that determine metaluptake by living organisms). The influenceof environmental chemistry on nanosilverbioav ailability is a crucial question. Determining potential for to xicity is mor e complex than usually r ecogniz ed. The type of test can hav eastrong influence on con - clusions about silv er'spotential as an envi - ronmental hazar d. Organisms emost sen - sitivewhen tested using long-term chr onic toxicity tests and/or exposur evia the diet (see later discussion). B ut such data ar erare. Once inside an organism, silv er may be highly to xic, but not necessarily so .Theprocesses that influence internal toxicity (or biological detoxification) might be one of the most important considerations in deter- mining risks from nanosilver. Ecological risk is ultimately influenced by toxicity at the cellular and whole-organism level, but that risk will differ from species to species. In discussing how to evaluate risks from nan- otechnologies in general, Ow en and Handy (2007) r eferred to a \" source-pathway-recep- tor-impact \"as a unifying principle for risk assessment. P rogressively evaluating each link in the sour ce-pathway-r eceptor-impact chain is a systematic way to addr ess potential risks from an activity .The questions to follow apply that appr oach to silv er metal and nanosilv er materials. SOURCES: HOW MUCH SIL VER IS RELEASED TO THE ENVIRONMENT BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES? Silver is mined from the earth from deposits of the mineral argentite. Argentite occurs inlead-zinc and porphyry copper ores in theUnited States, and in platinum and golddeposits in S outh Africa (Eisler, 1996). Silver is also extracted during the smelting of nick - el or es in Canada. S ilver pr oduction fr om mining and smelting incr eased steadily through the last centur y.In1979, silv er was used mainly in photography onic of the silv er from such pr oducts is another major sour ce of the metal. I n1990, the estimated world pr oduction of silv er was 14.6 million kilograms (kg) (E isler,1996). I n2007, approximately 20.5 million kg of silver were mined worldwide (USGS, 2008). Emissions to the environment of metals such as silver are influenced by commercial and industrial activities as well as by environ- mental regulations. Silver emissions peaked between the late 1970s and the early 1980s in the historically developed world (e.g., Europe,North America, Japan, Australia and NewZealand). After the 1980s, emissions began todecline in these jurisdictions with the passageand implementation of environmental legisla-tion such as like the Clean Water Act in theUSA in the 1970s. Industries and cities were forced to remove or capture contaminantmaterials, including silver, preventing theirdisposal to the atmosphere and especially tolocal water bodies. Many heavy industries,which release the largest masses of such con-taminants, moved from the historically devel-oped to the rapidly developing countries dur-ing the same period. More recently, use of sil-ver in photography (one of the largest com-mercial uses) declined with the advent of dig-ital photography (USGS, 2008). In contrast to the historically developed world, developing countries whose economiesare rapidly expanding (primarily in east andcentral Asia) have not kept pace with environ-mental r egulations as their industries expand and demand for v arious products increases.Specific data on silver emissions to the environ- ment in these jurisdictions are not available, butestimates for other contaminants are probablygood indicators that silver emissions are increas- ing at a rapid rate (e.g., Jiang et al., 2006). In 1978, most silver emissions came from smelting operations, photographic manufac- turing and processing, the electronics indus-try, plating and coal combustion, along withavariety of smaller-scale domestic uses (Table 1; Eisler, 1996; Purcell and Peters, 1998).Because silver is so rare, the quantities pro-duced and released to the environment seemsmall on a product-by-product basis, espe-cially when compared with mass dischargesof other metals. In 1978, the estimated lossof silver to the environment in the UnitedStates was 2.47 million kg, or 2,470 metrictons. Of that, about 500 metric tons werecarried into waterways in runoff from soils,and 1,600-1,750 metric tons went to land-fills (Purcell and Peters, 1998). While the sil-ver in landfills is largely constrained andimmobile and the silver in runoff is mostlypart of the natural background, the mostenvironmentally damaging silver was proba-bly that going to the aquatic environmentfrom human wastes, estimated to be about250 tons per year (Eisler, 1996; Purcell andPeters, 1998). Table 1 accounts for the major sources of this silver release, including waste- 16 TABLE 1. MASSES OF SILVER DISCHARGED TO THE AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT FROM DIF- FERENT SOURCES IN 1978.

There is substantial evidence that silver discharges declined considerably in theUnited States after the 1980s (e.g., Purcelland Peters, 1998; Sanudo-Wilhelmy and Gill,1999; Hornberger et al., 2000). For example,the mass of silver discharged in 1989 and in2007 from a well-studied publicly ownedtreatment works (POTW) at Palo Alto,California, in South San Francisco Bay hasbeen compared (Hornberger et al., 2000)with the discharge from the entire urban areasurrounding South Bay (Table 2). The silver-per-person discharged from both sites in the1980s was similar to the estimated averagedischarges from waste-treatment facilities perperson nationally (350 mg per person per year[Table 1]). Major improvements in wastetreatment were implemented by all the localPOTWs around the South Bay, as they were nationally, during the 1980s and 1990s.Probably more important, silver recycling wasinitiated for local industries, and the use of silver in photography declined considerably. The mass of silver released to South Bay in the wastes declined more than tenfold as a result of these changes. In 2006, when silver releases were 6 kg per year, inputs to the Palo Alto POTW were 65kg per year. This reflects the ability ofsewage-treatment works to extract silver fromeffluents and retain it with an efficiency ofabout 90 percent (Lytle, 1984; Shafer et al.,1999). In studies of POTWs, 19-53 percentof the incoming silver associated with col-loidal particles during treatment wasremoved by advanced filtration, indicatingfiltration is crucial to effectively removing sil-ver. Despite the efficiency of silver removal,concentrations in the discharges to naturalwaters are correlated with silver in theincoming wastewater (Shafer et al., 1998).Discharges of silver both in the 1980s and2007 (Table 2) were from POTWs that treat-ed their effluents. The more silver that TABLE 2.DISCHARGES OF SILVER INTO SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO BAY FROM ONE WASTE TREA TMENT F ACILITY (POTW) AND FROM THE COMBINED POTW DISCHARGES FROM THE SURROUNDING URBAN AREA (SILICON V ALLEY) IN THE 1980S AND IN 2007.

Sewage treatmenthelps, but it is not a cure for environmentalrisk if incoming loads are large enough. PATHWAYS: WHAT ARE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF SILVER IN THE ENVIRONMENT? Dispersal of silver into the environment is not necessarily an ecological risk. The concentration,environmental fate and ecological response arealso important. The background concentrationof every metal in soil and water is determined, inpart, by erosion from Earth's crust. If the elementis more abundant, its concentration is higher inundisturbed waters. Silver is an extremely rareelement in the Earth's crust, which means thatbackground concentrations are extremely low.Thus, the addition of only a small mass of silverto a water body from human activities will resultin proportionally large deviations from the natu-ral conditions. Concentrations of most trace metals in waters are reported in parts per billion (ppb)or micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/L). Concen-trations of silver are always in the pptr (parts per trillion) range, reported as ng/L. Table 3and Figure 4 illustrate silver concentrations indifferent types of waters around the world at different times. The lowest concentrations of dissolved silver are found in the open oceans, where concentrations range from 0.03-0.1 ng/L (Ranville and Flegal, 2005). However,silver concentrations changed from 0.03 ngng/L in 1983 to 1.3 ng/L in 2002 in surfacewaters from the open ocean off Asia (Ranvilleand Flegal, 2005). The distribution of the con-tamination followed a pattern that suggestedwind-blown pollution aerosols were being car-ried to sea from the Asian mainland by theprevailing westerly winds. Ranville and Flegal(2005) concluded that the change reflectedatmospheric inputs from the rapidly develop-ing Asian continent, although the specificsources are not known. It was surprising thatpollution inputs were sufficient to raise off-shore silver concentrations by 50-fold. Thechange demonstrates the sensitivity of waterbodies to changes in human inputs of silver,and suggests that local hot spots of substantial 18 TABLE 3.

Dissolved silver concentrations have long been recognized as a characteristic marker ofsewage inputs. In the late 1980s, there was asilver concentration gradient extending fromthe ocean off S an Diego, California, into Mexican waters (Sanudo-Wilhelmy and Flegal, 1992). The source was the Point Loma wastedischarge, which consolidates most waste fromSan Diego. Urbanized bays estuariesshowed similar levels of contamination.Concentrations up to 27-36 ng/L were deter-mined to occur broadly in San Francisco Bayand San Diego Bay in the late 1980s (Flegaland Sanudo-Wilhelmy, 1993). In waters fromthe lower South San Francisco Bay, silver con-centrations w ereas high as 189 ng/L in the late 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., L uoma andPhillips, 1988), when silver inputs from indus- try and waste-treatment facilities were elevated(Table 2). After upgrades of the treatmentfacilities, closure of a large photographic facil-ity and instigation of silver recycling for thesmaller photo processors (P . Bobel, personalcommunication), silv er concentrations in the South Bay dropped to 2-8 ng/L (Squires et al., 2002). The important lesson from these stud-ies is that when human activities mobilize suf-ficient silver, the contamination is readilydetectable in large bodies of water. If inputs arecontrolled, the contamination may recede. Fewer silver studies are reported for fresh- waters than for marine or estuarine waters.Where data are available, concentrations arecomparable to those found in urbanized estu-aries, (F igure4; Wen et al., 2002), but con - centrations can v arywidely .ConcentrationsSilver Nanotechnologies and the Environment The positively charged free silver ion (Ag+)has a strong tendency to associate with negatively charged ions in natural waters in order to achieve a stable state. The negatively charged ions, or ligands, can occur in solu- tion or on particle surfaces. In natural waters, five anionic ligands compete Ligands also occur on dissolved organic matter. Equilibrium constants, also termed stability constants, define the strength of each metal-ligand complex. Theseconstants can be used in models to predict silver speci-ation in solution or distribution among ligands.Speciation is driven by the combination of: a) The strength of silver association with the ligand (if silver associates more strongly with one ligand thananother ,it is mor elikely to associate with the first); and b) The abundance of the ligands. Ligands that are more abundant ar emorelikely to associate with and bind the silver. These properties work in combination. For example, atsome point, an extremely abundant but weaker-bind- ing ligand might outcompete a stronger binding but rare ligand. The specific complexes or precipitates of silver cannot be directly measured at the low concentra-tions in natural waters, but because their chemistry isquantitatively well-known, the distribution among inor-ganic ligands can be calculated from chemical princi- ples with reasonable certainty. The outcome of the com- petition among ligands is more difficult to calculate from first principles if dissolved organic matter is present,because those ligands take many forms. Speciation is typically more variable in freshwater than in seawater, because of greater variability in lig-and concentrations. The composition of seawater is rel-atively constant; only concentrations of organic materi-als vary much. The silver chloro complex will alwaysdominate in solution in seawater ,although sulfide com - plexes may also occur (Cowan et al., 1985; Adams and Kramer, 1999).TEXT BOX 2. How silver ions combine with other chemicals in effluents are much higher than are those in natural waters. Concentrations in urban efflu- ents from three cities ranged from 64 to 327 ng/L; effluents from a photographic facility atthe time (before 2000) contained 33,400 ng/L (Wen et al., 2002). Environmental water quality standards provide guidelines for the upper limits for acceptable metal concentrations in water bod-ies. These regulatory limits are based on datafrom toxicity tests and on assumptions aboutdilution after discharge into the water body.They are enforced by comparing observationsof environmental concentrations to the guide-line. For example, North American ambientwater quality criteria suggest that aquatic lifewill not be harmed if silver concentrations do not exceed 1,920-3,200 ng/L in streams and coastal waters (USEPA, 2002). The European Union does not list silver among its 33 desig-nated \"priority hazardous pollutants.\" 7It is interesting that these regulatory guidelines, where they exist, are much higher than ever were found in even the most contaminated open waters during the period of greatest sil-ver contamination (Figure 4), which is anoth-er contradiction in the silver story.

To achieve stability, the charged ionrapidly associates with negatively charged ions called ligands (Text box 2). A very small pro- portion of the total dissolved silver will alsoremain as the free ion (Ag +), depending upon the concentrations of the different negatively charged ligands and the strength of the silver ion binding with each ligand. This distribu- tion of silver between its ionic (Ag+)and its ligand-bound forms is termed speciation especially strong complexes withfree sulfide (-SH) ligands, and with the sulfideligands that occur within organic materialsdissolv ed in natural waters (A dams and Kramer ,1999). I tis possible for dissolved sul- fide and/or organic matter to complex essen - tially all the dissolv ed silver in freshwaters based on the r elative abundance of (-SH) compar ed to silver concentrations (Adams and Kramer ,1999). Speciation has great influence on how much silver is available to affect living organisms. For example, silvercomplexed to a free sulfide is essentiallyunavailable for uptake by organisms. Silver also interacts strongly with the chlo- ride anion, but the interactions are complex.In freshwater, chlorides occur in low concen-trations. But if there are more atoms of chlo-ride present than atoms of silver, the silverquickly precipitates or falls out of solution asasolid compound, silver chloride. This com- pound is unavailable for uptake by organ-isms. The strong reactions of silver with freesulfides, dissolved organic materials andchloride can drive free silver ion concentra-tions to minuscule values in most freshwaters(Adams and Kramer, 1999). Chloride occurs in very high concentra- tions in seawater (and thus in coastal watersand estuaries) because the salt in seawater isdominated by sodium chloride. Chemical principles predict that when chloride concen- trations increase to about 10 percent of full- strength seawater, multiple chloride ions reactwith each silver ion to form complicated com- plexes that hold silver in solution (Cowan et al., 1985). The silver is more mobile and more reactive than it would be in fresh water because its most abundant form is an extreme-ly strong silver-chloro complex (Cowan et al.,1985; Reinfelder and Chang, 1999). Because silver accumulates in sediments, risk assessments must always consider thelong-term implications of accumulation,storage, form ter,occurs with the negativ ely charged lig - ands in sediments (L uoma et al., 1995). Because ligands ar eso abundant in - ments and hold silv er ongly ,geochemical reactions tend to bind mor esilver ions to particulate matter compar ed to silv er in solution. B etween 10,000 and 100,000 ions of silv er bind with par ticulate matter for everyion that r emains in solution. Thus, concentrations on par ticulate matter con - taining organic material can be 10,000 times higher in sediments than in water (L uoma et al.,1995). Wher esilver in contaminated waters range fr om 25-100 ng/L ( Table 2), silver concentrations in the sediments in the same locations range fr om 0.5-10 \u00b5g/g dr yweight. The av ailability of o xygen in sediments influences the form of silv er bound to the particles ( Text box 3). Strong complexes with organic material appear to pr edominate at the sediment sur face, wher eoxygen is usually present and sulfides ar erare(Luoma et 1995). D eeper within the sediments, wher eSilver Nanotechnologies and the Environment22 oxygen is absent, silver associates with sul- fide in an extremely stable form that is char-acterized by its lack of solubility in weak acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Berry et al., 1999). Organically complexed silver is also present in many anoxic sediments, as evidenced by the presence of HCl-solublesilver (Luoma et al., 1995). RECEPTOR: IN WHAT FORMS IS SILVER BIOAVAILABLE? Toxicity is ultimately determined by the dose or exposur ethat a living organism r eceives. That is why envir onmental risk assessmentsand risk management formally consider both exposure and toxicity. Bioavailability isdefined by the silver that is taken up by an organism from passing water over its gills or ingesting food, sediments or suspended material. Bioavailability is the sum of silver taken up from all these sources. Silver mustpenetrate the tissues of an organism before itcan be toxic, so the bioaccumulated concen-tration is an indicator of the dose of silver to which an organism has been exposed. The biological systems that transport materials acr oss the boundar ybetween an organism and its envir onment ar ecomplex. The presence or absence of oxygen has a strong influence on the form of silver in sediments. Oxygenis typically present in the water column of most nat-ural waters. The contact of this oxygenated waterwith the sediment surface creates an oxygenatedsedimentar ysurface layer .But deeper in the sedi - ment, the oxygen is consumed by microorganisms faster than it dif fuses into the sediments from the water column. All of the oxygen is used up, and thesediment becomes anoxic (without oxygen). Thedepth of the junction between the oxygenated zoneand the anoxic zone can var yfrom mm to many cm depending upon the conditions in the sediment. In the absence of oxygen, negatively charged free sulfide ions become abundant in most sedi-ments. In the oxygenated zone of the sediments, sil - ver is bound largely to organic materials. In the absence of oxygen, at least some of the silver becomes bound to sulfides (Berry et al., 1999). It isargued that if the number of available sulfide bonds (i.e., the molar concentration) exceeds the number ofsilver atoms, silver should not be bioavailable; it should be innocuous (Berry et al., 1999). Sulfidesareorders of magnitude mor eabundant than silver in anoxic sediments\u2014so low that bioavailability should usually be the case in much of the sediment column based upon this concept. And experiments convincingly show that bioavailability and toxicityof silver are greatly reduced in well-mixed, fully anoxic sediment. i.e., sediment with no oxidizedsurface layer (Berry et al., 1999). The complexity is that almost all higher order animals require oxygen. Even animals that livewithin anoxic muds have mechanisms or behaviorsthat assure that they have contact with the oxy-genated par tof the sedimentary environment. If those organisms ingest particles and/or carrywater acr oss their gills fr om the oxygenated zone, silver will be bioavailable. If their contact is with particles fr om the anoxic zone, silver will be much less bioavailable. The exact outcome is thus highly dependent upon the nature of the sediment andhow each organism experiences that sediment. Field obser vations consistently show higher sil - ver bioaccumulation in sediments contaminated with silver, whether or not the sediments are anox- icin the subsurface layers (e.g., et al., 1995). Laborator yexperi- ments that allow animals to feed in sediments that contact oxygenated water at the surface also show that silver is bioavailable (e.g., Lee et al., 2000).Thereremains some contr oversy about how silver bioavailability is af by the pr esence of anox - ic sediments. Nevertheless, it is clear that silver bioavailability fr om sediments must be included in any assessment of risks. TEXT B OX3. Effect of sediment chemistry on bioavailability of silver from sediments The surfaces of cells and the surface lining of biological tissues are surrounded by a mem- brane system that must prevent unwantedsubstances from entering the cell and regulate entry of essential substances. Ion transporters are proteins that are selectively designed to take up essential ions based upon their metal charge and size, as well as their coordination and ligand preferences (Veltman et al., 2008). Nonessential metals such as silver are takenup by the transporters to the extent theymimic the characteristics of an essential ion.Silver ions are probably transported by a car-rier system that controls the cell's concentra-tion of sodium and/or copper (Bury andWood, 1999). Silver uptake by the trans-porters (its bioavailability) is strongly influ-enced by the form of silver in the environ-ment. One form favored for uptake by thetransporters is ionic silver (Ag +), because its properties are most similar to those of sodium(Na +)and copper, which is transported as Cu+1.Precipitated silver chloride, dissolved complexes between silver and sulphide and Wood, 1998; B ianchini et al., 2002). Thus, precipitation or complexation in water almost completely inhibits silv er bioav ailability . Some authors have concluded that the bioavailability of dissolved silver in freshwa-ters, in general, will be low because reactionswith sulfide and dissolved organic materialsare so predominant (Ratte, 1999; Hogstrandand Wood, 1998). Complexation with chloride in seawater does not eliminate bioavailability, however. Even though almost no fr ee silv er ion is pr es- ent in seawater ,rapid uptake of silv er is obser ved (E ngel et al., 1981; L uoma et al., 1995). M icroscopic plants at the base ofoceanic food webs (phytoplankton) bioaccu- mulate silver from marine waters to concen- trations 10,000 to 70,000 times higher thanthose found in the water (Fisher et al., 1994). Uptake rates and the degree of silver biocon- centration by these organisms are exceeded only by mercury among the metals. This assures that high concentrations of silver will occur at the base of food webs wherever silver contamination occurs in estuaries, coastalwaters or the ocean. Bioaccumulation of silver from solution by marine invertebrates is also faster than forother trace metals, following the order: silver>zinc>cadmium>copper>cobalt> chromium> selenium (Wang, 2001). When the soluble chloro complex is dominant, silver is taken up less readily than the free silverion, for example, in fish or in invertebrates likemussels (Hogstrand and Wood, 1998). Butuptake of the chloro complex is far greater thanuptake when sulfide complexes are dominantor when silv er is pr ecipitated into its insoluble silver chloride form. I naddition, at salinities greater than ~10 per cent seawater ,it is less like - ly that complexation with organic and soluble sulfides will r educe to xic effects; the extr eme abundance of chloride ions makes the chloro complex a strong competitor for binding. Luoma et al. (1995) concluded that, unlike in freshwater, the chemical reaction that dom-inates silver speciation in estuarine and marineenvironments also maintains substantialbioavailability. The result may be that theenvironmental \"window of tolerance\" for sil- ver r tively narr owbecause of the str ong r esponses of organisms to r elativ ely small changes in exposur econcentration.23Silver Nanotechnologies and the EnvironmentSilver associated with particulate organic matter can be taken up when those particles areeaten by animals. Digestion may generate freesilver ions in digestive fluids of low pH. Silvermay also combine with proteins and aminoacids within the complex fluids of the digestivetract, or gut (Luoma, 1989). The gut membraneis capable of transporting amino acids and clus-ters of molecules of colloidal size, termed micelles .Silver will accompany these molecules as they ar etransported into the cells of the organism. S imilarly, mechanisms exist to engulf particles and either digest them within the cell (intracellular digestion) or transport them through the membrane (endocytosis). In the past decade researchers have quanti- fied the impor tance of obtaining silv er from contaminated food ( Wang et al., 1996; Wang, 2002). I ngeneral, diet is a mor eimpor tant route of uptake than is uptake fr om solution. But the exact contribution of diet to bioaccu - mulation depends upon the efficiency with which silv er is taken up b ythe gut (termedassimilation efficiency ). An organism that takes silver up efficiently from food and retains it forlong periods before excreting it is most likely toaccumulate a higher concentration in its tissuesthan was present in its prey. Biomagnification is the term used when a predator accumulates achemical to a higher concentration than occursin its prey. Contrary to conventional expecta-tions, many invertebrates have high assimilationefficiencies, slow loss rates and a high potentialto biomagnify silv er (Table 4; Reinfelder et al., 1997; Wang and Fisher, 1999). For example, when ingesting the microscopic aquatic plants (phytoplankton) that are their typical food, clams ( Macoma petalum) from San Francisco Bay will take into their tissues 39-49 percent ofthe silv er they ingest and accumulate concentra - tions fiv eto sev en times higher than in the phy - toplankton (R einfelder et al., 1998). As a r esult, exposur evia diet explains 40-95 per cent of the silver bioaccumulation b ythese animals (Griscom et al., 2002). I nvertebrate pr edators seem to be especially efficient at assimilating sil -24 TABLE 4. ASSIMILATION OF SILVER IN VARIOUS AQUATIC SPECIES.

Higher assimilation from food means more silver is taken up from food; and longer half-lives mean the silver is held longer by the organism before loss.High assimilation and longer half-lives result in a high potential to accumulate high concentrations of silver. Data from Wang et al., 1996; Wang, 2002; Reinfelder et al., 1997; Wang and Reinfelder et al., 1998; Griscom et al., 2002; and Cheung and Wang 2005). ver from food and accumulate very high con- centrations of the metal from their prey (Table 4). Cheung and Wang (2005) showed that a predatory snail, Thais clavigera ,assimilated 60 percent of the silver in the prey it eats. Models predicted accumulation of silver to very high internal concentrations in the snail predator. An accompanying study in Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, showed that, indeed, predator snails hadfive to ten times more silver in their tissues thandid their prey (Blackmore and Wang, 2004). In contrast, assimilation efficiencies are rel- atively low, or loss rates are high, for other organisms, including zooplankton and at leastsome fish. Predatory fish, for example, are inef-ficient at taking up silver from food and willnot accumulate higher concentrations than arein their prey (Hogstrand and Wood, 1998;Wang, 2002). The tendency of silver to associate with sed- iments or to become associated with the com-plex particles in the water column does notnecessarily eliminate bioavailability. Thus, sed-iments \"store\" a large reservoir of potentiallybioavailable silver. Many animals also ingestsediments for food (Griscom et al., 2002), pro-viding direct exposure to the bound silver.Invertebrates assimilate a lower percentage ofsilver from inorganic fractions of fr om the nev- ertheless, is bioavailable. from bulk sediments,including inorganic materials, percent in the clam Macoma petalum. Silver assimilation efficiencies from living plant materials by this clam are 38-49 percent.Ingestion of sediment was a more importantsource of silver than was uptake from waterwhether the source was sediments or plantmaterials (Griscom et al., 2002). The form of the silver in sediments is impor- tant to bioavailability (Text box 3). Bioaccum-ulation of silver from sediments can be predict- ed from the concentration of silver extracted from the sediment with HCl, the weak acid that does not extract the silver from sulfides (Figure5). This suggests organically bound silver is bioavailable, but sulfide-associated silver is not. Aremarkably strong relationship occurs between weak acid extractable silver and silver concentrations in clams from mudflats( Macoma spp .), considering the diversity of con- ditions under which the data were collected.The figure also demonstrates that these clams bioaccumulate silver to higher concentrations than is found in the organic fraction of theirsedimentary food. IMPACT: TOXICITY OF SILVER The inherent toxicity of silver determines its ranking as an environmental hazard, but the25Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment FIGURE 5. Silver concentrations in clams found in San Francisco Bay and the estuaries of southwest England correlated against silver concentrations in the sediments upon which the clams feed, measur ed in those sediments by extraction with a weak acid that eliminates silver sulfides (1N hydrochloric acid). Other extractions do not show a similar cor relation.500 100 10 1 0.1 0.1 1 10 Silver in sediment (ug/g dry wt) UK SFBaySilveraccumulationinMacomabalthica(ug/g)definition of toxicity depends upon the organ- isms that are considered and the way toxicityis determined. It is well-known that silver is extremely toxic to bacteria. It is also among the most toxic of the metals to plants like phy- toplankton, as well as to invertebrates and fish. Adverse ecological impacts have beenobserved in some well- studied instances ofrelatively moderate silver contamination inestuaries. However, silver is not especiallytoxic to humans or other mammals. Factors such as the following influence the ability of silver to produce toxic effects: the ability be taken inside cells; the tendency to bind to biological sites that perform important functions; the degr ee to which the metal is ex creted; and the degr ee to which the metal is sequester ed in nonto xic forms inside cells. Silver'shistor yof use in medicine is tied to its antibacterial pr operties. A long histor yof study verifies that er is a br oad-spectr um and effec- tivetoxin to bacteria. The r ecent growth in uses of silv er in the management of open wounds stems from the loss of effectiveness of manymodern antibiotics because of the spr ead of antibiotic-r esistant bacteria such as the staph bacterium ( Staphylococcus aureus) . Silver's antibacterial activity is strongly dependent upon the concentration of the silverion. Silver nitrate dissociates readily, releasingfree silver ions. Thus, silver nitrate has oftenbeen used in medical applications.Antimicrobial effects from other silver com-pounds are found only when the compoundsare oxidized to release free silver ion. For exam-ple, bulk elemental silver, as in tableware ordishware, has antimicrobial activity only if oxi- dized silver species are present on the surfaces orwithin the silver metal. A higher surface area per unit mass will yield more oxidized silver. Silver toxicity has been tested on many strains of bacteria. Silver inhibits the activity and growth of both gram-positive and gram-nega-tive bacteria, as well as fungi (although fewerstudies address the latter). There is less evidencethat silver is toxic to viruses, despite some claimsto the contrary. Silver is also toxic to strains ofbacteria that can develop tolerance to otherantibiotics (e.g., staph bacteria). For example,when bandages with and without \"hydrocol-loidal\" silver were applied to human epithelium(isolated patches of reconstituted human skin),the silver-treated bacteria (Schaller etal., 2004). A topic ecz ema (skin rash) can be related to or accompanied b ycolonization of the skin b ystaph bacteria. G auger et al. (2003) compar ed the r esponse of 15 patients to a silv er- coated textile on one arm and cotton on the other for 7 days. They found a significantly lower number of the staph bacteria on the arm treated with the silv er-coated textile during and at the end of the experiment. Despite a large number of pr oduct studies like those above, the dose-response characteris- tics of silv er toxicity to bacteria remains poorly understood. The concentration at which silver becomes toxic to the bacteria has not been stud- ied carefully and is variable among experimentaldata that are available (Chopra, 2007). Forexample, two similar studies of the doseresponse of the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus to silver showed thresholds of toxicity varying between 8 and 80 ppm(Chopra, 2007). T wo other studies with anoth-er pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa, produced a similar range of toxicity of the26silver ion, from 8 to 70 ppm. The nature of the bacterial colony also influences the effectiveness of silver. Bjarnsholt et al. (2007) found that the bactericidal concentration of silver required to eradicate the bacterial biofilm was 10 to 100 times higher than that used to eradicate free-liv- ing bacteria. They concluded that the concen- tration of silver in many currently availablewound dressings was much too low for treat- ment of chronic wounds infected by biofilms. Differences in silver delivery systems, differentformulations of silver and different dressingmaterials also influence silver toxicity (Brett,2006; Chopra, 2007). Development of bacterial r esistance to silv er is less likely than the dev elopment of r esistance to mor eselectiv eantibiotics. The multiple mechanisms b ywhich silv er affects bacteria (Text bo x4) make it mor edifficult for bacteria to manifest the multiple mutations necessar yto produce r esistant strains (Chopra, 2007). However there is no doubt that silver resistance can occur (B rett, 2006). R esistance to silver- based burn dr essings has been r eported, for example (Chopra, 2007). The genetic mecha - nisms of the r esistance ar enot yet well-known. Dressings that release silver slowly are more like- ly to stimulate onset of r esistance than are dress- ings that r elease high doses of bioavailable silver (Brett, 2006; Chopra, 2007). Silver in any form is not thought to be toxic to the cardiovascular, nervous or reproductive systems of humans. Nor is silver considered to be a cancer-causing chemical (Drake and Hazelwood, 2005). Silver can be absorbed into the body through the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, mucous membranes of the urinogenital tract and the skin (Landown, 1996). If silver isingested, the efficiency with which it absorbed is thought to be low (~10%; Drake and Hazelwood, 2005), although this may dependupon the form of silver ingested. The limited occurrence of death from silver exposur eor ob vious signs of poisoning (sys - temic signs) in humans appears to r eflect str ong capabilities to sequester the metal in innocuous forms, often in tissues outside the functioningcells of organs (for mor edetails see Text bo x5). The most commonly r eported r esponse of humans tation or discoloration of the skin, nails (argyr - ey es, mucous membranes or internal organs (argyr osis) b ysilver deposits (Text box 5). A skin color of gray ,gray-blue or ev en black is sympto- matic of these conditions. 8Neither argyria nor argyrosis can be r eversed, and both are incur- able, although no ob vious long-term health effects seem associated with either (D rake and Hazelwood, 2005). 27Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment The mechanisms behind the biocidal action of silver arerelated to the interaction with thiol (sulfhydr yl, -SH) groups in enzymes and proteins. Silver inter- feres with the functions that the protein normally performs when it attaches to such a ligand. Cellular respiration and transport of electrons across mem-branes are two examples of functions supported by enzymes with many sulfhydr yl groups. Silver also inhibits DNA replication by interfering with DNA unwinding. In bacteria, silver induces oxidativestress at the cell wall, where many cellular functions areperformed, af fecting the bacteria' sability to respire and to maintain a balance of essential ions within the cell and thereby maintain an internal environment suitable for life. Thus, bacteria exposed to silver show inhibited growth, sup-pressed respiration and metabolism; they lose potassium and other wise show suppressed trans- port of essential chemicals into and out of the cell membrane (Hwang et al., 2007). Text box 4. Mechanisms of silver toxicity to bacteriaIn patients with argyria, deposits of silver are also found in the region of peripheralnervous tissues, small blood vessels (capillar-ies) or even near the blood-brain barrier(Lansdown, 2007). The silver in these regionsis usually encased in a membranous vesicle(lysosomes) or as a nontoxic granule, prevent-ing exposure to the more sensitive cellularmachinery. Nevertheless, argyria appeared tobe one r eason for the curtailment of silver use once alternativ es (antibiotics) were developed (Chen and Schleusner, 2007). When toxicity does occur in humans, it is usually associated with exposure to a bioavail-able form of silver and at very high doses.Exposure to metallic silverware poses no risk tohuman health because such products producevery little soluble silver or silver ions, for exam-ple. Acute symptoms of overexposure to silvernitrate are decreased blood pressure, diarrhea,stomach irritation and decreased respiration,but these require massive doses. Some chronicsymptoms from prolonged intake of low doses of silver salts have been reported, includingulcers (Wadhera and Fung, 2005), fatty degen-eration of the liver and kidneys and changes inblood cells (Drake et al., 2005). Direct, systemic toxicity is not the only way that silver can affect human health. Hollinger(1996) predicted that subtle toxic effects wouldbegin to appear as silver was increasinglyemplo yed in medical applications. He suggest- ed that the implications of uptake of silv er into the circulatory system (e.g., through ingestion or through wounds in the skin) should be fur- ther investigated. He also suggested that effectson delayed wound healing and possible localsilver toxicity in specific organs be considered.Amore recent study reported toxic effects of sil- ver nitrate on the types of human cells involvedin wound healing, i.e., fibroblasts and endothe-lial cells (Hidalgo and Dominguez, 1998).Prolonged exposure to silver nitrate produceddose-dependent cell loss at silver concentrations28 Text box 5. Detoxification of silver Detoxification of metals, including silver, is a normal process that has evolved in all organisms, presum- ably the result of evolving in the presence of metal ions naturally occurring in the Earth's crust. With sil- ver, detoxification in humans appears to occur by precipitation of silver salts either as silver chloride, silver phosphate or silver sulfide within tissues. In people with argyria, the blue or gray skin discol-oration is caused by the photoreduction to metallicsilver during exposur eto ultraviolet light (Eisler, 1996). Silver sulfide and silver chloride granules aredeposited outside cells in the thin layer of connectivetissue underlying the surface cells of many organs,termed the basement membrane .Macrophages, a type of white blood cell that takes up for eign materi - al, also accumulate silver and prevent it from pene- trating into cells (Baudin et al., 1994). Before storageas a stable mineral, silver first binds to proteins thatcontain a large proportion of sulfhydryl groups. Themost common of these proteins are termed metal-spe- cific binding proteins. These proteins then aggregate into the granular stored materials or are encased by lysosomes, the vesicles often used by the body to capture, hold or degrade foreign substances in an innocuous form. Silver deposits can be observed near peripheral nerves and the blood-brain barrier, but the deposits do not appear to have adverseeffects on crucial membranes of the nervous tissue(Lansdown, 2007). If concentrations of a toxin gettoo high, lysosomes will break down and leak theirtoxins, however. The liver is an important organ forthe synthesis of detoxifying proteins like metalloth-ioneins, and that may be the reason silver tends toaccumulate str ongly in this or gan. High concentra - tions of silver can also occur in the basement mem- brane of the digestive tract, which has a strong abil-ity to accumulate, retain and eliminate the metal(Baudin et al., 1994). of 0.4-8.2 ppm. The mechanisms of cell toxic- ity were similar to those of toxicity in bacteria, namely, depletion of energy reserves typical of effects on cell metabolism and effects on DNA synthesis. In a 2007 review of the literature on delayed healing, Atiyeh et al. (2007) concludedthat \"recent findings, however, indicate that the (silver) compound delays the wound-healing process and that silver may have serious cyto- toxic activity on various host cells.\" However, they described the literature on silver as oftencontradictory with regard to both wound infec-tion control and wound healing. Brett (2006)emphasized that such effects were not consis-tent with a long history of clinical successes inusing silver bandages to treat burn victims.Atiyeh et al. (2007) suggested that the goal of a\"practical therapeutic balance between antimi-crobial activity and cellular toxicity\" was elusiveat the present state of knowledge. They con-cluded that \"the ultimate goal remains thechoice of a product with a superior profile ofinfection control over host cell cytotoxicity.\" The ecological hazard of a chemical is deter- mined by its persistence, its tendency to bioac-cumulate and its toxicity. Silver is persistent inthe environment because it is an element thatcan be neither created nor destroyed. Silver isone of the most toxic of the trace metals tomany species, although the degree of toxicity isgreatly influenced by how it is measured. It has astrong tendency to bioaccumulate to high concentrations in bacteria, humans and otherorganisms and to pass through food webs. It isbiomagnified to higher concentrations in pred-ators than in their prey. The mechanisms of silver toxicity to high- er organisms are much the same as those seenwith bacteria. When a silver ion is taken upby fish from solution, for example, it perturbsthe regulation of major ions in the gills byinhibiting sodium uptake (disruption of membrane transport processes). The inhibi- tion of the animal's ability to regulate sodium and chloride at the gills perturbs the concen- trations of major ions in the blood and affects internal fluid-volume regulation, amongother fundamental life processes (Wood et al., 1999). Less is known about the mechanisms by which the silver ion is toxic to inverte- brates, but disruption of metabolism through binding to sulfhydryl-rich enzymes andreduced growth would be expected. The concentrations at which silver is toxic are determined by either short-term acute tox-icity studies (mortality after 96 hours) orchronic toxicity studies (tests lasting manydays or even months, and monitoring suchsigns as impairment of growth or reproduc-tion). Chronic toxicity tests address responsesthat are symptomatic of stress, rather thanimmediate death. Chronic effects on an organ-ism, like disruption of reproduction, slowergrowth or toxicity to early life forms, nearlyalways occur at lower concentrations than doesacute toxicity to adults. But chronic stress isjust as likely to eliminate a species as is mortal-ity to adults. Thus, chronic tests reflect themost sensitive, but important, responses oforganisms in nature. Chronic toxicity tests, however, are much moredifficult to conduct than are acute tests. They take more time, more maintenance and more complex logistics. Measuring sublethalendpoints is more difficult than counting deadorganisms; thus, there are always less chronicdata than acute data for a chemical contami-nant. In many cases, the acute data alone areused to draw water quality regulations.Unfortunately, the studies of chronic silver tox-icity are so few that USEPA has not defined acriterion for protecting species from chronic 29Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environmentexposure. The lack of chronic toxicity data for silver is one explanation for the very high con-centrations of silver defined by regulatory agen-cies as protective in natural waters (Table 3;Figure 4). Whether designed to measure chronic or acute toxicity, traditional standardized tests haveimportant limitations that greatly influenceextrapolations to nature. Examples include: Short exposure durations. Acute tests are typi- cally conducted for 96 hours, whereas organ-isms in nature are exposed for a lifetime (andpresumably succumb at much lower concen-trations). Only a few surrogate species are used for test- ing. The surrogates are not necessarily as sen-sitive as are many of the species in nature. Dietary exposure is not considered. For silver, this greatly affects determination of concentra-tions that are toxic (see later discussion). Correction factors, or application factors, are incorporated into regulatory criteria to addresstendencies to be overprotective (if geochemical conditions negate bioavailability) or underpro-tective (if diet is the crucial route of exposure)when applying toxicity testing results. Theapplication factors are based upon professionaljudgment. The shortcomings of toxicity testsand the incorporation of professional judgmentin the form of correction factors add uncertain-ties (and sometimes controversy) to water qual-ity standards. Among the standardized tests, a large body of evidence shows that the toxicity of the silverion occurs at concentrations lower than thoseobserved for every metal except mercury. Therank or der of toxicity among metals for aquatic invertebrates, for example, typically showsgreater hazards from mercury and silver ionthan from copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel, leador chromium. Species differ widely in their vul-nerability to silver, but the rank order amongmetals is generally similar for most species. The threshold of acute toxicity has been eval- uated for more than 40 freshwater species and25 marine species using the conventional stan-dardized tests (Table 5; Wood et al., 1999).Toxicity thresholds are the concentrations at30 TABLE 5*. RANGES OF TOXICITY TO SILVER IN VARIOUS TYPES OF TESTS WITH INVERTEBRATES AND FISH. Invertebrates or 3,000 50 100 *Data from Luoma et al., 1995; Hogstrand and Wood, 1998; Wood et al., 1999, Bielmyer et al., 2006; and Hook and Fisher, 2001.which 50 percent of the organisms under investigation die. The most sensitive species include phytoplankton in freshwater and sea- water, salmonids (e.g., trout) in freshwatersand early-life stages of a broad array of marine invertebrates, including oysters, clams, snails and sea urchins (e.g., summarized in Luoma et al., 1995). Table 5 also shows how toxicity of dissolved silver as defined by chronic tests differs fromtoxicity determined in acute testing. Silver ismost toxic when tested on developing lifestages and especially toxic when delivered viafood. When animals like microscopic zoo-plankton consume food contaminated by50-100 ng/L silver, their ability to reproduce isinhibited (Hook and Fisher, 2001, 2002). Incontrast, the toxic threshold observed in thetraditional tests with dissolved silver is10,000-40,000 ng/L (see Text box 6).Bielmyer et al. (2006) repeated these resultswith another species of common zooplankton, Acartia tonsa, and determined that 20 percent of animals had inhibited reproduction whenfed diatoms (algae) exposed to 650 ng/L silverin seawater. Silver toxicity to aquatic plants and ani- mals is correlated with the concentration of''free'' ionic silver. When sulfide and thiosul- fate are present to complex the silver ion, tox- icity declines remarkably. Embryos and larvae of fathead minnow, for example, are notaffected until concentrations of silver reach 11,000,000 ng/L when sulfides are present in freshwater. In ligand free waters, silver is toxic at 370 ng/L. Hogstrand and Wood (1998) concluded that sulfide and thiosulfate offergreater than five orders of magnitude protec-tion against chronic toxicity, reflecting thereduced bioaccumulation of the silver ion.Hogstrand and Wood (1998) concluded that\"laboratory tests with silver nitrate almostinvariably overestimate acute silver toxicity inthe field because of the abundance of naturalligands which ... markedly reduce its toxici-ty.\" They concluded that \"it is doubtful if sil-ver discharges in the freshwater environmentwould ever result in high enough silver ionlevels to cause acute toxicity.\" But not all complexes completely elimi- nate silver toxicity. Bielmyer et al. (2001)studied the complexed silver freshwater usedin toxicity dubia. They inhibition of reproduction in 8-day tests at 10 ng/L when silver nitrate31Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment Text box 6. Toxicity of silver in the diet Hook and Fisher (2001, 2002) studied the effects of dietary exposure to silver on reproduction in zooplank- ton from both freshwater and marine environments. They exposed algal cells to a range of silver concen - trations in water and then fed the algae to the zoo- plankton. When the zooplankton consumed algae exposed to 100 ng silver/L in marine waters and 50ng silver/L in freshwaters, reproductive success was reduced by 50 per cent in both cases. The acute toxic - ity of dissolved Ag in the marine species was 40,000 ng/L and in the freshwater zooplankton was 10,000 ng/L. One r eason for the higher toxicity of silver infood was that the silver assimilated from food was accumulated internally in the zooplankton. Silver from food specifically accumulated in egg protein, depress- ing egg pr oduction in the zooplankton by r educing the ability of the organism to deposit protein in the yolk of the eggs and ther eby inhibiting development of eggs and young (Hook and Fisher, 2001). This mechanism is consistent with silver's strong affinity for sulfhydryl complexation in essential pr oteins. In contrast, the sil - ver from solution that was associated with the external surface of the animal had little adverse effect (Hook and Fisher ,2001). 32 (silver ion) was added to the medium. Silver in solution was just as toxic when bound to the sulfur-bearing amino acid cysteine as was the silver ion. Exposure to a more complex sulfur-bearing molecule reduced silver effects on reproduction to 600 ng/L, but did not \"eliminate\" toxicity. Similarly, toxicity is noteliminated by chloro-complexation in seawa- ter, just as bioavailability is not eliminated (Table 5). The concentrations of dissolved silver that are toxic in the most sensitive tests,including dietary exposures, are well withinthe range of silver concentrations observedin contaminated waters (Figure 4; Smith andFlegal, 1994). Bielmyer et al. (2006) (3,430 ng/L infreshwaters and 1,920 ng/L in seawater;USEPA, 2002) are well above the concentra-tions at which toxicity occurs in tests withfeeding z ooplankton, and would not pr otect such species. D ata fr omsensitiv etesting pr o- tocols, like dietar yexposur es, w erenot con - sider ed when those standar ds w eredevel- oped. The r esult seems to be a 10- to 100- fold under estimation of the to xic concentra - tion of silv er in many natural waters, espe - cially the waters of estuaries, coastal z ones and the oceans.The ultimate test of whether a chemical is a threat to the environment lies in observations of toxicity in the waters where those chemicals are discharged. Evidence from nature can be controversial (Text box 7). On the other hand, historically, it was observations of nature, not toxicity testing, that originally detected theadverse effects of pesticides on birds; lead on children; mercury, DDT and PCBs TBT onoysters and other invertebrates. these chem-icals are now recognized as powerful environ-mental toxins, and at least some uses of each ofthem have been banned. Toxicity is usually manifested in complex ways in nature, and effects from one stress canbe difficult to differentiate from another. Oneway to improve the likelihood of associatingcause and effect in a field study is to use long-term data, in which a variable such as silver con-tamination changes slowly over time while uni-directional trajectories ar eabsent in other aspects of the envir onment. As the Clean Water Act took for ce in the 1980s in the U nited S tates, it is likely that a number of such experiments in natur eoccurr ed as contamination r eceded (Sanudo- Wilhelmy and G ill, 1999). O nly a fe w, however,were documented. T wo such studies detected the disappearance of silv er toxicity in San Francisco Bay as contaminated conditions Text box 7. Challenges in separating cause and effect in a field study Agood example of the difficulty in distinguishing caus- es of an adverse ef fect fr om a pollutant comes fr om a 1984 study of mussels transplanted from a clean envi- ronment to a silver -contaminated environment in South San Francisco Bay (Martin et al., 1984). Where silver concentrations were highest in the bay, growth in mus- sels was adversely af fected. However ,other factors that could have affected feeding also changed as sil- ver contamination increased. For example, silver-con-taminated waters in the southernmost part of the bay also had higher suspended loads that could havereduced feeding by the mussels. Thus, it was not pos- sible to conclusively tie the gr owth ef fects to silver alone, and this elaborate study had little impact on conclusions about silver toxicity in nature. Later studies showed that silver was indeed having adverse ef fects on organisms living in this region (Hornberger et al., 2000). 33Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment Hornberger et al. (2000) reported on 32 years of monthly measurements on a mudflat 2kilometers (km) from a domestic-sewage outfall beginning in 1975. Copper and silver were the major pollutants discharged from the treatment works in the 1970s. Improvements in treatment of the wastes from this facility were progressively implemented during the 1980s and 1990s, as mandated by the Clean Water Act. In response, Ag con-centrations in clam tissues on a mudflat 1 kmfrom the discharge declined from 106 \u00b5g/g to 4 \u00b5g/g over the 30-year period. Copperconcentrations declined fr om 287 \u00b5g/g to 24 \u00b5g/g in clam tissues. Concentrations of both metals in sediments also declined. Asnoted earlier, concentrations of dissolved sil-ver declined from an average of 113 ng/L inthe late 1970s and 1980s (Smith and Flegal,1993) to 6 ng/L in 2004. Declining metals in the clams were strong- ly correlated to declines in waste dischargesof the metals (Figur e6). Biochemical signs of stress were observed in surviving species dur- ing the period of contamination. But mostimportant, reproduction persistently failed inthe clams in the mid-1970s thr ough much of the 1980s; the animals were not producingviable eggs and sper m. The adult clams appar ently wer epresent because successful reproduction occurred on other mudflats and afloating larval stage allowed individual clams to immigrate regularly to the contami-nated mudflat. Tolerant individuals within theimmigrants survived. The most convincing evidence that metals were the culprit in the stress response was that reproduction recov- eredand signs of str ess disappear ed as metal contamination declined into the 1990s. The community of animals living in the mud also changed with r ecover yfrom the metal contamination. Animals that fed on the mud directly (deposit feeders) and species that laid their eggs in the mud reappeared or increased in abundance once the contamina - tion subsided. Other potential explanationsof the biological and ecological changes were considered: food availability, sediment chemistry, salinity, temperature and organic chemical contamination. None of these potential confounding variables changed uni- directionally with the changes in clam repro- duction and community characteristics over the 32 years (Shouse, 2002). Alater study with a similar long-term design showed effects of silver alone (Brownet al., 2003; Figure 7). This study coveredthe period 1990 to 1999, when a secondspecies of clam was collected monthly fromfour locations in Nor th San Francisco Bay .In this case, silver was apparently released from photographic processing at a nearby naval station. Silver concentrations were ele-Text box 8. Effects of silver on invertebrates as observed in San Francisco Bay FIGURE 6.

There was a high-er frequency of reproductive failure in years when Ag contamination was greatest. An index of the annual average reproduction at all sites correlated strongly with the silver contamination in the tissues of the animals. Cross-cutting spatial and temporalsampling eliminated the likelihood that other sources of stress explained the change of reproduc- tive maturity when Ag concentrations were high.This was the same effect observed in South San Francisco Bay and an effect similar to that observed when zooplankton were exposed to elevated silver in their diet (loss of reproductive capabilities). FIGURE 7. Correlation of the gamete index (reproductive maturity) with silver concentrations in the tissues of the clam, Corbula amurensis . Nine years of monthly samples at taken at four sites. Each point represents an annual average for each site. As silver contamina- tion in tissues increased, the animals produced fewer mature eggs and sperm on an annual average basis. improved (Text box 8). These studies showed that sur viving invertebrates were unable to reproduce in the presence of silver contamina- tion, but reproductive capabilities recoveredwhen the contamination receded over a 30-yearperiod. No other aspects of the environmentshowed a unidirectional trajectory of changelike the metal contamination. Furthermore, thesilver contamination that accumulated in sedi-ments seemed to cause the r educed abundance or disappearance of species that either ingested sediments for food or laid their eggs in the mud.Those species also r ecovered when the contami- nation r eceded. The toxicity to the invertebrate animals occurr ed in the range pr edicted by the dietar yexposur estudies. The worst effects occurr ed at dissolv ed Ag concentrations esti- mated to be in the 100-200 ng/L range, which is 10-fold lo wer than the ambient water quality criteria (1,920 ng/L). Field studies and dietary toxicity studies showtoxicity and ecological effects are associat- ed with silver concentrations in the environ- ment in the ng/L range. Invertebrates are not ascharismatic as some species, but they lie at thebase of every aquatic food web. Changes ininvertebrate communities result in changes inpredator communities. Much of the silverreleased by a widespread consumer demand forphotographic dev elopment and b yindustries and businesses was r emoved by waste-treatment facilities in the 1970s and 1980s. M uch of the remaining dissolv ed silver discharged to the environment was undoubtedly complex ed (not silver ion). N evertheless, enough silver was dis- charged and bioav ailable during that period, at the loadings sho wn in Table 1, to result in adverse ecological effects. There is no reason to think that a r eturn to similar loadings to the environment would not result in similar effects. Text box 8.

The source- pathway-receptor-impact concept (Owen and Handy, 2007) can be a useful framework foranalyzing risks from these products (Text box9), just as it is for silver itself. Environmentalrisks will depend upon the nature of the parti-cle, the use of the product, the fate of the par-ticle, the fate of the silver metal and thebioavailability and toxicity of both nanosilver and the newly added silver metal. SOURCES OF NANOSILVER AND POTENTIAL DISPERSAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT The envir onmental risks from emerging silver technologies will first depend upon the mass ofnanosilv er and silv er (Text box 9) released to the envir onment. F or most chemicals, govern- ments hav emandator y, uniform reporting requir ements on mass releases of chemicals toIII. EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND NANOSILVER Text box 9. Factors that should be considered in evaluating environmental risks from nanosilver: Sources of nanosilver must be understood in order to manage risks. Regulatory programs ultimately willhave to consider the mass of the nanoparticle emit-ted to the environment from specific sources in orderto manage risks. Because silver itself is a toxin, thecumulative risks fr om the emer ging technologies could also be influenced by the total mass of silver released. Concentrations in the environment determine risks. Environmental concentrations are therefore one basisfor regulatory criteria. Concentrations are influenced by source inputs to the environment, fate in the envi- ronment and the characteristics of the water body. For example, when nanosilver is discharged to awater body via a sewage pipe, concentrations in thewater ar ediluted to a degr ee deter mined by the characteristics of that water body but are also affect- ed by interactions with particles and the fate of those particles. The concentrations that r esult deter mine any toxicity that will occur. The pathways of nanosilver in the environment also influence risk, as deter mined by chemical r eactions with dissolved ligands, particles and sediments (mud). Receptor: Bioavailability of nanosilver is a crucial consideration in determining impacts. Bioavailabilityin this case is defined by the ability of organisms toaccumulate into their tissues the form or forms ofnanosilver delivered to it from the environment. Impact: Toxicity is determined by the internally accu- mulated, bioavailable nanosilver in each or ganism, not just the total concentration in the envir onment. However, biological factors also influence toxicity. If the organism can sequester the silver in forms thatarenot toxic (detoxification), then all the internal sil- ver will not be biologically active and the contami- nant will be less toxic. The forms of nanosilver that will be most toxic are those that are taken up readi-ly from the environment, excreted slowly and/or arenot sequester ed inter nally in a nontoxic for m. Impact: Effects on ecological structure and function aredetermined by how many and what kinds of organisms are most affected by nanosilver at the bioavailable concentrations that are present in the environment. TheConsumer Product Safety Commission and Nanotechnologythe environment. For example, the USEPA keeps a record of hazardous materials discharges through legislation such as the Toxics ReleaseInventory (TRI), wherein the industry that releases a chemical must report the mass that is released. Although such programs have a num-ber of weaknesses (questionable data quality,infrequent syntheses), the loadings to the envi-ronment they define often provide a starting point for ev aluation of environmental risks. Nomandatory reporting requirements exist for engineer ed nanoparticles. Voluntary pro- grams were initiated in 2007 in the private sec-tor (DuPont/Environmental Defense) and bysome governments (USEPA and UK DEFRAnanoscale materials stewardship programs).However, some authors suggest that these donot include ingredients that typically lead tocomprehensive reporting or high-quality data(Hansen and Tickner, 2007). Participation inthese programs after their first year was veryweak. A first-order need for conclusive riskanalyses of nanosilver in the environment isconsistent data from which to identify emissionsfrom the new technologies or trends in thoseemissions. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies database 3provides anecdotal information about potential sources of nanosilver. The generalinformation in the database and some of theinformation in the commer cial w ebsites them- selves areinstructiveabout some characteristics of the gr owing numbers of pr oducts containing nanosilv er.The 240 pr oducts identified b y Fauss (F auss, 2008) in S eptember 2007 w ere classified into types that ar erelevant for estimat - ing envir onmental r eleases (for alternativ eclassi- fications, see B laser et al., 2008). 1. The most pr evalent use was in pr oducts coat- ed with a polymer containing nanosilv er.Examples of these uses include nanosilver embedded onto handrails, medical devices, food storage containers, dressings for woundsand female-hygiene products. Polymeric sil- ver is also called silver protein because the nanoparticle is complexed with a long chainmolecule like gelatin, then added to the par-ticular product. 2. The second most prevalent use was as \"col- loidal silv er,\" which refers to nanosized silver particles (0.6-25 nm in this case) in a water suspension. These include solutions recom-mended for daily ingestion. 3. Spun silver is another prevalent application of nanosilver. In this case, the silver is integratedor spun into a fabric (e.g., cotton or synthet-ic fabrics), impregnating sheets, clothing,sportswear and other fabrics with thenanoparticle. 4. Nanosilver powder is used in a handful of products. For example, one manufacturerclaims that its socks contain 100 times moresilver than they actually need to work.Nanosilver powder is added, which comesout in shoes or in the first wash. 5. Ionic silver is intentionally generated by some products, including washing machines and dishwashers. These ar enot necessarily silv er nanotechnologies, although some impor tant the ionic silv er technologies not be dismissed in terms of envir onmental risks, however,because they add to the total burden of silv er discharged to the envir onment (one of the modes of risk). 3637Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment Information on rates of increase in the num- ber of nanosilver products is also anecdotal, but a number of sources are predicting rapid growth. Blaser et al. (2008) cited the SilverInstitute as showing use of biocidal silverincreased 500 times between 2000 and 2004. Nanotechnology News reported the following in April 2006:9 Silver nanoparticles are emerging as one of the fastest growing product categories inthe nanotechnology industry, according toBourne Research,\"silver 'it' product,much like antibacterial soaps took theconsumer sector decade ago,\"said Marlene Bourne, principal analystwith Bourne Research. The medical sectorwas one of the first on board where end-uses have already migrated from burndressings to surgical instruments and handsanitizers. In addition, a recent study by aleading supplier of textiles to hospitalsshowed a dramatic reduction of infectiousmicrobes in curtains embedded with silvernanoparticles. Sportswear manufacturersare also embracing its use to prevent odorin clothing. I nthe home, consumers can already find washing machines, refrigera- tors, HVAC filters, brooms and even food containers that employ silver nanoparticlestokill bacteria and limit mold growth\u2014 and this is just the beginning. Information from manufacturers' websites gives scattered, and often contradictory, infor- mation about the nature of the silver used. Butsome give at least anecdotal hints about con-centrations of silver employed. Concentra-tions of 10 ppm silver are reported necessaryfor antibacterial effectiveness, so it is probably not unreasonable to assume this is the mini- mum concentration in products with silver sprays and mists, silver polymers and spun sil-ver. One manufacturer cited the concentra-tion of silver in its colloidal silver solution as20 ppm silver, 10although the range of concen- trations in such products in other sources is reported as 3-1,000 ppm. Arizona State University researchers soaked six pairs of nanosilver socks in wash water and recoveredfrom zero to 1.85 mg per sock. One pair ofsocks had no detectable silver. The lowestdetectable mass of silver in a sock was 0.020mg, and the highest was 31.2 mg (Benn andWesterhoff, 2008). The latter represent a max-imum concentration in socks of about 1,358ppm. This extreme variability is consistentwith the variability in nanosilver dosing sug-gested for other products. The silver polymers on products like handrails, for example, seem unlikely torelease much silver to the environmentbecause of their limited turnover. Similarly,products that end up in the terrestrial envi-ronment or as solid waste will be constrainedin landfills (e.g., silver bandages) or in soils. Itmight be argued that medical applicationslike catheter linings, or ev en bandages, ar e unlikely to be a large sour ce of environmental release because their use is limited compared to consumer products. Blaser et al. (2008)suggested that greater contact with water ismost likely to result in the greatest release ofsilver to waste streams. The greatest riskswould be expected from products that might be used by millions of people in ways that release silver directly to wastewaters. Forexample, coated products will present thegreatest risk of dispersal if they are washedregularly and lose some of their silver (or38 nanosilver) down the sewer. An example might be dishware or food storage containers. Spun silver products are likely to release some (nano) silver every time they are washed. In addition to the direct evidence of this (Benn and Westerhoff, 2008), one manufacturer advertises that the silver in its socks weatherstheir ability to fight microbes for 50 wash- ings. This suggests that all the silver in the socks will eventually end up in the environ-ment, most likely in domestic waste streamsin the form of wash water. Silver ion genera-tors release silver intentionally into washwaters, all of which will eventually end up inwaste streams. Is it possible that enough products, each releasing a small amount of silver, can eventual-ly add up to an environmental hazard? An aptanalogy is traditional photography. This was atechnology used daily, most likely, by hundredsof millions of people. Each photograph thatwas processed released a tiny amount of silver asit was developed, and not all that silver could berecaptured or recycled, even in centralized facil-ities. The result was that almost every domesticwaste stream contained high levels of silver con-tamination (Table 3; Figure 4). While no singlenanosilver product is approaching the popular-ity of photography ,the challenge lies in the diversity of products\u2014ultimately, hundreds of dispersive products are conceivable. Many of these (e.g., antibacterial soaps) have potentialinterest to millions of people. Each wouldrelease (nano) silver into domestic wastewaters. Another question is whether there is enough of this rare element available to sup-port such a growth in technology. There wassufficient silver in circulation to support arelease of 850 metric tons of silver per year towastewaters and solid-waste facilities from thephotographic industry in 1995 (Purcell andPeters, 1998). The market for antibacterial silver products is projected by some market analysts to grow to 110-230 tons of silver per year in the 25-member European Union by 2010 (Blaser et al., 2008); a similar-sized market might be expected in the USA. Sufficient silver was available in the past tosupport such uses. Finally, it is argued that most nanosilver will be removed from wastewaters anddeposited in sludges by waste treatment(Blaser et al., 2008). The silver in wastes fromthe processing of photographs, for example,was largely in the form of a strong thiosulfatecomplex. High concentrations of silver weretypical of waste streams from photo process-ing facilities and were reflected in dischargesfrom the waste-treatment plants that receivedsuch wastes (Table 1). The tendency of silverto associate with particulate material isexploited in sewage-treatment works toextract silver from effluents and retain it insludges. Lytle (1984) compared six POTWsand found removal efficiencies of Silver rangedfrom <1 to More recently,Shafer et al. (1999) investigated removal ofsilver in five POTWs. More than 94 percentof the silv er was r emoved in all fiv eplants. Between 19 percent and 53 percent of the sil- ver was associated with colloidal particles (50 nm-1,000 nm); however, that required filtra-tion of the waste for removal, which is one ofthe most advanced forms of treatment. Therest was settled out as larger particles. In allcases, silver concentrations in discharges tonatural waters correlate with silver in theincoming wastewater (Shafer et al., 1998).The more silver in incoming wastewater, themore silver that was lost to the environment.Sewage treatment helps, but it is not a cure39Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment for environmental risk if incoming loads are large enough. In addition, the degree to which nanoparticles containing silver might be captured by waste treatment is unknown. Proponents of the new technologies do not necessarily accept that there are environmental risks associated with their products (Text box10). For example, one washing machine tech- nology uses a silver anode assembly to release sil- ver ions into a stream of tap water that is carriedinto the water supply of the machine. The goalis to achieve better bacterial control than con-ventional washing machines (although there isno evidence that bacteria are a problem in con-ventional machines). In March 2005, a pressrelease from one of the machine's manufacturerclaimed that \"Samsung machine,refrigerator, air-conditioner, air-purifier and vac-uum cleaner are all equipped with comprehen-sive features that kill bacteria, molds and evenharmful influenza viruses during the filteringprocess.\" The Samsung website, downloaded inOctober 2007, had the following to say aboutthe silver released: \"Silver is present in natureand, as silver ions only attack bacteria (due totheir cell structure) and not healthy organisms,it would be environmentally friendly\"(http://ww2.samsung.co .za/silv ernano/silv ernano/washingmachine.html#). In late 2007, a new technology was introduced that can fit a silver ion generator to any automatic clothes washing machine. MASS DISCHARGES TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM NANOTECHNOLOGY Very crude estimates of mass emissions of sil- ver to the environment are, arguably, possible,if only to give a general sense of the nature ofthe potential environmental risks (see alsoBlaser et al., 2008). Factors to considerinclude: the nature of the potential sources the number of such sources and the potential for growth in that number the potential for dispersal to the environment the concentration of silver associated with each source There is great uncertainty in such estimates, of course. First, as noted above, the quanti-ties of nanosilv er associated with individual Text box 10. Controversies about the fate of silver nanoparticles Quotes from NewsTarget.com, December 2006: Silver is spread throughout the environment already. Taking silver from the environment, using it and having some of it return to the environment is no different than the use of any other metal from the environment,whether iron, copper ,orwhatever . ...free silver ions are needed to have an antimicrobial effect, but the ions will automatically bond with chlorineif they find their way into common drinking water, thereby rendering the ions inert. ... Our patentedSilver100 is a perfect case in point, where it took manyyears of development and achieved patent protectionbecause it has a specific molecular structure to controlthe release of silver ions in microbial forms, Once that occurs, the silver ions do not hang around. That's just the way the chemistry works. 40 products are not well-known. What is known suggests silver concentrations, even in similar products, are highly variable, as cited above for silver socks or colloidal silver solutions. Estimates should include scenarios that cap- ture this variability. Maximum scenarios test the question of whether it is feasible for silverinputs from such products to be environ- mentally significant, for example. Second, it is not clear whether silver lost from any prod-uct will be in the form silver itself or ofnanosilver. Estimates presented below con-sider only total silver releases, using theassumption that the baseline risk is from theloss of silver metal itself. Additional risks willoccur if nanosilver is more toxic than the sil-ver metal. Finally, it not possible even to esti-mate wastes from manufacturing plants inany reasonable way (Blaser et al., 2008). Theonly precedent is that silver manufacturingfor photography released a quantity of silverapproximately equiv alent to photographic development ( Table 1). I fdischarges fr om manufacturing plants add to the mass released fr om the pr oducts themselv es, then an analysis of inputs fr om consumer pr od- ucts is a minimum estimate of discharges to the aquatic envir onment, perhaps b yhalf. Mathematically ,the mass of silv er dis - charged to the environment is estimated from the mass of silver in a product and assump-tions about the rate at which that silver from that product enters the environment (Text box 11). Blaser et al. (2008) used a relativelycomplicated formula to determine releases towastewaters, lumping types of materials andestimating water-contact times for each. Inthe approach taken here, we use data availableon the silver content of known products thatmight discharge their silver to wastewaters.Their releases of silver are estimated frommanufacturers' information. Releases from multiple products are calculated assuming similarity to products for which some data are available. Scenarios were devised for three types of new silver technologies: 1. Silver socks and similar consumer products that might be frequently washed to release nanosilver; 2. Silver Wash machines and similar silver- generating devices (dish washers, etc.); and 3. Swimming pools or other spa equipment that use silver as a bactericide. The details of the calculations are described in Text box 11 and in Appendix A, Table A.1. Table 6 shows the range of silver releases from the products and uses as described inText box 11. Variability in the estimates fromconsumer pr oducts such as silv er socks is extremely large, r eflecting the gr eat variabili - ty found in the quantity of silv er in differ ent socks. Table 6 sho ws that r eleases fr om socks (or pr oducts) containing the minimum silv er that might kill bacteria ar esmall compar ed to those fr om photography .Use of multiple products loaded to r elease as much as 31 mg silver (Benn and Westerhoff, 2008) could result in substantially more silver dischargeto the environment than was the case for photographic development. Clearly, the quantity of silver used in each product willhave an immense impact on the significanceof silver releases to the environment, andcould be a consideration in regulating theseproducts. One lesser-known but notable use of silver is for sterilizing swimming pools, spas, Jacuzzisand other containers holding 10,000 L or more41Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment of water. Using the manufacturers' recommend- ed concentration, pools, spas, and hot tubs could discharge 150 tons of silver per year alone for each million such containers, if each con- tainer was emptied only once per year. A silver load to the environment in the tons per year from pools is probably realistic (or an underesti-mate), in that 7 tons of pesticides were used in California swimming pools alone in 2003, 12Table 6 emphasizes that it is in the wide- spread use of products employing the new sil- ver technologies, each of which itself seems intuitively innocuous, that the greatest envi- ronmental implications of the new silver tech- nologies lie. No individual product releases sil- ver at rates equal to those released by photo-graphic development in the 1980s. But the sum of silver releases from a proliferation of Text box 11. Estimating mass releases of silver from consumer products There are several steps in calculating the mass of silver (MTsilver)released to wastewaters fr om nanosilver pr od- ucts. If the concentration in the product (Csilver)is known, then the mass of silver in the product, MPsilver,in units of grams (g), kilograms (kg) or metric tons (T) of silver ,is determined by: MPsilver =Csilver/Mproduct (1) where Csilver/Mproduct is the concentration of silver in the product and Mproduct is the weight of the pr oduct. For silver socks, we use two scenarios. The minimum sce-nario is that the concentration in the socks is that citedas the lowest bactericidal concentration: 10 \u00b5g/g. The mass of silver r eleased in one year can be determined byassuming that some fraction (F year)of the total silver in each product is released per year. The minimum sockscenario assumes that each pair of socks with 10 ppmsilver will release one-fifth of its mass of silver per year ifsocks lose their silver in 50 washes, and each is washed10 times per year. The maximum scenario uses the high-est mass of silver lost from socks in a single wash, asobser ved experimentally: 0.031 g (Benn and Westerhoff, 2008). For Silver Wash machines, we assume a r elease of 0.05 g per year, as cited by one washing machine maker. For swimming pools, we assume the manufacturer's recommended concentration of 0.003 g/L and 10,000 liters per container ,the vol - ume usually cited for spas and similar uses (pools con- tain about 40,000 liters). We assume each container is emptied once a year. Ascenario for the number of pr oducts (N product )in use also must be devised. One approach is to assumeagiven percentage (X) of the population of a jurisdiction uses the pr oduct wher e, for example: Nproduct =X*NUSA(2) Scenarios are shown wherein 10 percent of the stated population and 30 percent of the stated population usesilver socks; all U.S. households that are wealthy enoughto hold equities buy Silver Wash machines , and 1 mil-lion swimming pools in the USA use silver as a biocide.Then, the total mass r elease fr om an individual pr oduct or use is: M Tsilverper year = Csilver*Fyear*Nproduct(3) To estimate what happens if silver technologies become the household standard, the total mass of silver dis-charged to the envir onment of a jurisdiction (MT silver,) must be multiplied by an assumed number of products (P) wher e: M TUSAsilver =MTsilver*P(4) Reasonable scenarios are that 100 products will be used that r esemble silver socks, 10 products exist that resemble Silver Wash machines, and 5 products could release silver like swimming pools (spas, hot tubs, Jacuzzis, silver filters for water purification, etc.). Finally , it is necessary to incorporate waste treatment. For this aspect of the scenario, the assumptions of Blaser et al. (2008) are used, in which 80 percent of waste is treat- ed suf ficiently to remove 90 percent of the silver. 42 different products could release much more sil- ver than did photographic development. Forexample, the maximum scenario of releases towastewaters for the three types of products weuse as illustrations are projected to be as highas 457 metric tons per year for the USA, and128 tons after waste treatment. Silver discharge from the metals and photographic industry in1978 was 124 tons per year, for comparison.Blaser et al. (2008) estimated, in intermediateand maximum scenarios, that 9-20 tons of sil-ver from biocidal uses would be discharged toTABLE 6.COMPARISON OF DISCHARGES FROM SILVER NANOTECHNOLOGIES FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT NEAR-TERM SCENARIOS FOR THE USA AND FOR SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

Our scenarios for 100 consumer products like silver socks, used by 10 percent of the popula- tion, would yield similar releases. However, if products and technologies releasing higher con- centrations of silver proliferate to a greaterextent, much larger discharges may be possible. Blaser et al. (2008) also noted that increased sil- ver concentrations in sewage sludges mightincrease environmental risks in the terrestrialecosystems if and where sludges are used asbiosolids to supplement fertilizers. Blaser et al. (2008) concluded that emission reductions for silver in recent years in Europecould be reversed by 2010 by new releases frombiocidal silver applications. It is possible to do asimilar estimate using data from South SanFrancisco Bay, where the history of silver dis-charges to the environment after waste treatmentis known. The maximum-discharge scenario inTable 6 sho ws that it is conceiv able that bacteri - cidal silv er discharges, after waste tr eatment, could be twice those obser ved in 1980 (969 kg versus 550 kg per y ear), and could be 20-fold larger than discharge rates in 2007. M oremod- erate scenarios (100 pr oducts like silv er socks used b y10 per cent of the population) could yield discharges ranging fr om insignificant to more than four times greater than 2007 dis-charges, depending on the silver content of theproducts. Silver technologies certainly also have the potential to reverse gains in removal of silver from human discharges to the aquatic environ-ment in the USA. A return to conditions that areequal to or worse than those of the 1980s is con-ceivable if the present approach to managing thisissue does not change. Despite the very large uncertainties, the esti- mates point out that order-of-magnitude load-ing projections from emerging silver technolo-gies are feasible at the present state of knowl- edge. Uncertainties lie as much in the variabili- ty of the products as in knowledge about them. It is also clear that potential cumulative release of silver from consumer products alone is like- ly to be within the order of historic releases of this persistent pollutant, especially if someproducts become as popular as some projec- tions suggest. Waste-treatment facilities will capture some of the contamination with anefficiency that depends upon the form of thesilver. But the possibility of a detectable impacton silver concentrations in the environmentcannot be ignored. As larger numbers of prod-ucts are used by larger numbers of households,the potential for environmental risks willincrease. The concentration of silver in eachproduct and the potential for dispersal (orrelease) of the generated silver ion or theembedded nanosilver seem a crucial require-ment for reporting about a product or for itsregistration. The silv er releases estimated her e areprobably the baseline lev els of risk fr om the technology .Cumulativ erisks will depend upon releases fr om manufacturing and whether or not occurr ence of silv er as a nanopar ticle adds to or is a multiple of the baseline. I naworst- case scenario, if the pr oliferation of silv er in consumer pr oducts \" takes off \"and r emains unregulated, every domestic waste-treatment plant could have a halo of silver contaminationsurrounding it. Some of these hot spots will be more intense than others. This was the charac- teristic of historic silver contamination (e.g.,Hornberger et al., 2000). The potential for significant mass releases of silver from the new technologies is not sur-prising news to the people who manage waste-treatment facilities. The Bay Area Clean WaterAgencies (BACWA), representing 44 waste-water authorities throughout the San Francisco44 Bay Area in California, requested in May 2007 that Samsung's Silver Wash machine be removed from the list of washers that qualify for a water-conservation rebate. T ri-TAC, a technical advisory group for POTWs in California, wrote a similar letter in January2006 to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. T ri-TAC is jointly spon- sored by the California Association of Sanitation Agencies, the California Water Environment Association and the League ofCalifornia Cities. The constituency base for Tri-TACcollects, tr eats and r eclaims mor e than 2 billion gallons of waste water each day and ser ves most of the se wered population of California. The dischargers w ereconcerned about costs and contamination associated with incr easing the loads of a persistent pollu - tant in their discharges to the local water body (P.Bobel, Tri-TACmember ,personal commu- nication). The same concerns w ereexpressed in both letters (quote fr om the J anuar y2006 Tri-TACletter): Silver is highly to xic to aquatic life at lowconcentrations, and also bioaccu - mulates in some aquatic organisms, such as clams. D ue to concerns about bioaccumulation and the placing ofstrict silver effluent limits in dischargepermits, POTWs have implemented pollution pr evention programs to identify and r educe silver discharges to sanitar ysewer systems. These pro- grams hav ebeen v ery successful in reducing PO TW influent and effluent silver concentrations. However, wide- spread use of household products thatrelease silver ions into sanitary sewersystems could gr silv er concentrations in PO TWinfluentsand effluents, leading to adverse effects on California waterways. POTWs are subject to Mandatory Minimum Penalties for the violations of their discharge permits that could result. ... To allow the unrestrictedusage of a product that intentionally releases silver into the environment would be an irresponsible neglect of the principles of environmental sus- tainability that should strongly influ-ence such decisions. InDecember 2007, sev eral ne wproducts werereleased that include silv er ion generators that can be fit to any standar dwashing machine. Tri-TACwrote again to USEP Aand cies, asking them to r equir eregistration of such products and r equesting consideration of legis - lation to limit addition of to xics to consumer and commer cial pr oducts. I nNovember USEP Aresponded and other r equests byregulating the S ilver Wash machine as a pes- ticide under the U.S. F ederal I nsecticide, R odenticide A ct (FIFRA). to what pr oducts such r egu- lations apply and to ho wthey will be applied to the rapidly gr owing plethora of ne wproducts remain to be resolved. PATHWAYS OF NANOSILVER IN THE ENVIRONMENT The natur eor form of nanosilver could greatly influence its fate in the envir onment, and ther e- foreits implications if r eleased. Nevertheless, commer cial institutions ar eoften incomplete and inconsistent in the descriptions of their products.13For example, the term silver colloid ,a common descriptor in silver health products,implies little specificity in the range of par ticle sizes. Some pr oducts explicitly define silv er col -45Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment loid systems as containing nanometer-sized par- ticles (e.g., 1-25 nm) suspended in water. Other manufacturers claim that their products contain silver nanoparticles but list particle sizes beyond the nanoscale (e.g., 25-250 nm14). Still others state that their particles are ions or describe theirproduct as containing \"ionic particles.\" Few ref- erence the scientific definitions of these terms (see Text box 1 for definitions). In fact, nanosil- ver is used in a wide array of forms. Silver coat- ings can be added to other nanoparticles likeTiO 2(Guin et al., 2007). Different-shaped par- ticles may confer differ ent reactivities (P al et al., 2007). Charged functional gr oups or sur face coatings can be added to silv er nanopar ticles to improvetheir dispersion in water .Nanosilv er composites can also be synthesiz ed bylayering the par ticles onto organic carrier molecules that themselv es aresoluble (B alogh et al., 2001). These composites appar ently can r etain antibac - terial activity and/or can also impar tselectivity in physical or chemical interactions. The B ritish Standar ds Institute (BSI) r ecently posted advice to manufactur ers about what information to include on labels for nanomaterials: the siz e range of the materials; whether the nanopar ti- cles ar efree or bound in a solid matrix; whether the pr oduct contains a mixtur eof various nanoparticles; the specific source of the nanoparticles; and a description of the specificfunction of the nanoparticles in the product, among other things. Complex interactions blur precise boundaries among macromolecules, nanopar ticles, colloids and par ticles (Lead and Wilkinson, 2006), but differ entiating nanopar- ticles using scientific definitions could pr ovide at least general guidelines for the commercial sector (as in Text box 1). Some of the above characteristics of a sil- ver nanopar ticle will determine which r eac- tion pathway it will follo win the envir on-ment and thus its fate. For example, silver nanomaterials may stay in suspension as individual particles; aggregate; dissolve; or react with natural materials like dissolved organic matter or natural particulates. Some nanosilv er par ticles ar eengineer ed to remain in water as single par ticles (e.g., Lee et al., 2007). Charged functional gr oups or sur - face coatings can be added to impr ovewater solubility and suspension characteristics. O ne company adv to 5-nm silv er par ticles surrounded coating them water dispersible. \" 15Ifsingle nanopar ti- cles in suspension pr oveto be a form of high toxicity ,or if the silv er nanopar ticle pr oves to be of greater to xicity than silv er itself ,then persist - ence of the dispersed par ticle will affect its ranking as an envir onmental hazar d. But the persistence of par ticles in dispersed form has not been studied on timescales r elevant to the envir onment. O nce a silv er nanoparticle is delivered to an aquatic environment it will be subject to reactions in that environment indef-initely. The longer the particle or the traits that aid dispersal r esist such reactions (over months, years or longer), the greater will be the buildup of such forms in natural waters. The persistence of the par ticle itself is also likely to be an issue, but that, again, has not been studied. At least some formulations of sil- ver nanoparticles dissolve or degrade in slightlyacidic conditions and at temperatures notmuch abo veroom temperatur e. 14The pr esence of chloride or dissolv ed organic materials in the46 water could accelerate the rate of nanoparticle dissolution if these ligands are abundant. Contact with strong dissolved ligands in wash water may also accelerate the rate at which sil- ver is released from products like clothing. Many nanoparticles have a tendency to clus- ter and attach to one another to form larger aggregates or agglomerates. BSI (2007) defines an aggregate as containing multiple strongly bonded particles and having a reduced surface area compared to the individual particles. An agglomer ateis a collection of loosely bound par - ticles or aggr egates. Aggr egation of nanosilv er can be caused b yasurface charge on the par ti- cle; typical of unmodified silv er par ticles. Less egated commer cial entities suggest the thr eshold for the aggr likeli - hood of aggr egation in natural waters may be reduced b ythe dilute concentrations expected but may be incr eased in waste-tr eatment plants, wherethe materials could be concentrated b y treatment pr ocesses. Water chemistry will also affect aggr egation. P articles of all dimensions aremorelikely to aggr egate as salinity increases, for example. Lee et al. (2007) found that one formulation of silver nanoparticles averaging11.6 nm in size remained stable for 120 hours at the salinity found within the egg of a fr esh- water fish: 1.2 nanomolar (nM) sodium chlo - ride (molar units r eflect the number of atoms of sodium and chloride per liter of water).However, at 100 nM sodium chloride, the par- ticles aggregated to an average size of 24.4 nm and lost some of their surface charge. Aggregation reactions will have a strong effect on the fate of the silv er nanopar ticle. Aggregates and agglomerates ar eboth mor elikely to ultimately settle to the sediments than are individual nanoparticles. Aggregation may reduce the effectiveness with which silver ions are released, if the surface area per unit mass declines. However the relationships between aggregation, surface area and ion release arecomplex. Despite the prevalence and impor- tance of aggregation reactions, few commercial producers comment on this property. Natural waters contain dissolved organic materials and natural particles of widely vary-ing chemistries. R eactions of nanosilver with these natural materials also seem likely . Coating nanosilv er par ticles with natural organic materials would be expected to r educe reactivity .Association with the par ticulates sus - pended in water could r emovenanosilv er from the water and either transpor tit with the sus - pended par ticulates or cr eate concentrated deposits in sediments, analogous to the domi - nant r eactions of the silv er ion. U nderstanding such pathways will be cr ucial to connecting mass inputs of nanosilv er to the envir onmental concentrations that ar eultimately r esponsible for any potential to xicity . The concentrations of silv er or nanosilv er in natural waters ar elikely to be within the same order of magnitude as w erehistoric concentra- tions of silver metal during the times of elevat- ed discharges, if mass discharges from new sil-ver technologies rise to historic levels and reac- tions follo wsimilar pathways. For example, concentrations of 26-189 ng/L in S outh San Francisco B ay, like those observed in the 1980s, might be expected to accompany a r eturn to discharges of silv er of the same or der as occurred in the 1980s (550 kg/year; Table 2). If the new inputs are as reactive with particulatematerial as is silver metal, such dischargeswould incr ease sediment concentrations fr om the 2007 baseline of 0.2 ppm to the historic47Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment highs of ~3 ppm in such a system. Concentrations of a similar magnitude were forecast by Blaser et al. (2008) in the Rhine River in response to their projected increases in use of bactericidal nanosilver. They forecast dis- solved concentrations of silver in the Rhine ofup to 40 ng/L (minimum-use scenario) and up to 340 ng/L (maximum-use scenario). They forecast maximum sediment concentrations of 2-14 ppm (\u00b5g/g) in the different scenarios, but suggested those estimates were high comparedto data fr om contaminated natural waters. Thus, their conclusion that manufacturing, production and widespr ead use of silv er wash machines, silv er-impr egnated clothing and dishwar e, silv er-sanitiz ed spas and swimming pools and a myriad of other pr oducts could reverse the pr esent tr end of declining silv er con - centrations in natural waters acr oss the histori - cally dev eloped world. E ven such coarse esti - mates pr ovide a perspectiv efrom which al- uate needs envir onmental sur veillance and toxicity testing for nanosilv er. Environmental sur veillance is especially problematic for nanomaterials. A tpresent, ther e areno fully dev eloped monitoring y that can r outinely detect nanopar ticles or quantify their abundances in natural waters or sediments (Maynard et al.,2006; Owen and Handy, 2007), especially atconcentrations in the ng/L range. Methods are, however, available for quantifying colloid abun- dance or characterizing metal speciation. S ome of these might be adapted to quantifyingnanopar ticles in natural waters (Lead and Wilkinson, 2006), but most would be chal - lenged to reliably and routinely detect ng/L changes in nanosilver concentrations. Monitoring silver itself might be an interim step in envir onmental sur veillance for which silver lematic levels, the baseline silver metal concen- trations are likely to reflect that change. The environment is sensitive to new inputs because baseline concentrations of silver are naturally very low. Detecting a change in silver concen-trations alone would not provide sufficient information about the nature of the silver con- tamination (e.g., is it nanosilver or silver); how- ever, detection of changes in total silver concen- trations might provide a first warning that dis-charges fr om new technologies are becoming envir onmentally influential. NANOSIL VER BIOA VAILABLE? erequisite to xicity for nanosilv er,just as it is for silv er metal. Bioavailability is usually defined b ythe abil - ity of the nanopar ticle the organism; the bioav ailable becomes to xic when its pr esence disr upts processes within cells. Toxicity can disr uptions caused b ythe nanopar ticle itself it could occur because the ticle deliv ers and pr ocesses. A par ticle must also be consider ed bioav ailable if it associates with and disr upts essential pr ocess - es on the surface of the external membrane and/or delivers silver ions that do so.Although much remains to be learned, it is clear that mechanisms exist to allo wnanosil- ver penetration into organisms and into their cells. These mechanisms, ho wever, are proba- bly differ ent fr om those that control uptake of the silv er ion. It seems unlikely that nanoparticles of sil- ver would mimic a major ion in a way similarto that in which the silver ion mimics sodium(although the nanopar ticle could deliv er sil - ver itself to the transpor ter). H owever,asec-48 Text box 12. How nanosilver particles might enter cells Endocytosis is the pr ocess by which materials ranging up to 100 nm in size enter cells. It is a likely mecha-nism by which nanoparticles are taken up. During endocytosis, cells absorb materials by engulfing them using the cell membrane. There are three kinds of endocytosis. In phagocytosis, the membrane folds around a larger object and seals it off. In pinocytosis, an infolding of the membrane engulfs solutes and sin- gle molecules such as pr oteins. Receptor-mediated endocytosis involves the for mation of inward, coated pits with specific receptors. In all cases, the membrane forms a saclike vesicle, or endosome, into which the material is incorporated and then pulled into the cell.The endosomes can selectively concentrate some mate- rials or exclude other materials during for mation.Within the cell, the endosomes may merge with anoth- er saclike piece of cellular machinery, the lysosomes.These vesicles are specifically designed to break down the material or otherwise protect the other cell machin- ery from disruption by potentially toxic materials (Moor e, 2006). If toxic materials become too concen - trated within lysosomes, they can begin to leak toxins into the cell. Endosomal pathways also exist sorganelles (the machin - erywithin the cell that has specific functions). Examples of organelles include mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and the nucleus. Association of a nanopar- ticle with organelles is likely to disturb the functioningof those systems. 17ond transport system, the endocytotic system, is well suited as a portal for nanoparticle entry into cells (Text box 12). Endocytosis is the process whereby the membrane engulfs parti- cles and transports them across the cell mem- brane and into the interior (Figure 8). It is the process that medical engineers exploit to getfluorescent nanoparticles into cells; thus it is known that nanoparticles can be taken up via such mechanisms. Endocytosis is common tothe cells of all advanced organisms. Exposures to nanosilver as free nanoparti- cles in water ar ethe most common form used in most studies of aquatic organisms (Lee etal., 2007; Asharani et al., 2008). B ut ticles ar ealso likely to be incorporat - ed into suspended par ticulate materials, taken up byplants and bacteria or bound onto sed - iments. E xposur ecould also occur when ani - mals eat and digest such materials for food, or when pr edators eat pr ey that has taken up nanosilv er.The membranes of the digestiv e tract hav eabundant systems specifical - ly utiliz ed to transpor tnanosiz ed materials, including amino acids, small pr oteins and FIGURE 8. Graphic representation of a cell showing critical cell machinery and the process of endocytosis (Moore, 2006).49Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment micelles. Endocytosis is also common in the gut. Invertebrates like clams, mussels and oys- ters, for example, process much of their food in an organ system termed the digestive gland , or hepatopancreas .In some organisms, a high proportion of digestion occurs via engulfing of particles, termed intracellular digestion , where food is digested within the endocytotic vesicles within cells. Nutrients are then released into the cell. Even though a mechanism for uptake of silver nanoparticles exists at the cellular level,it is impor tant only if par ticles ar eretained sufficiently to accumulate within the cell. The physiological pr ocesses that go vern ho w much nanosilv er would be accumulated with - in an organism ar ethe same as those that drivesilver bioaccumulation: the sum of rates of uptake fr om food and water ,balanced b y the rate of loss. M echanistically ,the gr eatest risks will come fr om formulations or envir on- mental conditions that induce high-uptake rates fr om food or water and/or for organisms unable to rapidly ex crete the par ticles (with a lowrate constant of loss). Thus, uptake is impor tant, but nanopar ticles that hav eaten- dency to get trapped within cells can be expected to accumulate to high concentra - tions. Q uantifying these basic physiological rates can pr ovide a basis for comparing bioavailability and bioaccumulation of differ- ent types of nanosilv er par ticles, differ ent envir onmental conditions and differ ent organisms. Comparisons with silv er itself would also be informativ e. Protocols are well developed for comparing such rates (L uoma and Rainbo w,2005), but quantification of the rate will r equir emethods that can trace nanopar ticles as they ar Nanopar ticles markers, a radioactiv elabel or an enrichedstable isotope ratio, are potential methods of tracing the nanomaterials, although little experience exists with any of these in nanoparticle or nanosilver studies. It remains uncertain whether uptake of nanosilver particles occurs into bacteria cells (e.g., Balogh et al., 2001). But bacteria andcyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are classified biologically in a unique kingdom, the prokaryotes. These organisms do not havecapabilities for endocytotsis, so they may beless likely than are other higher-order organ-isms to pass nanosilv er thr ough their cell wall (Moore, 2006). The organisms that ar emorehighly evolved than bacteria (almost all other life forms, classified as eukar yotes) ar ecapable of endocytosis. Thus, it is not surprising that nanosiz ed par ticles can be taken up b ythese higher-or der organisms. M ost studies sho w transpor tinto and r etention b yisolated cells in vitr o.Fewer studies consider living organ- isms in viv o.Nanosized particles of sucrose polyester (M oore, 2006) or silicate fibrils (Koehler et al., 2008) w ereshown to be taken into the cells of the gills and the diges - tivegland of blue mussels ( Mytilus edulis ) exposur eof the whole organism. The smallest silicate fibrils appear ed to pass across the gill cell membrane by diffusion, whereas larger particles were taken up by endocytosis (K oehler et al., 2008). The sucrose poly ester was taken up b yendocyto- sis only (M oore, 2006). U ptake of sucrose polyester into the cells occurr ed whether the nanopar ticles w ere ingested or were sus- pended in water .The nanoparticles appeared to be taken into lysosomes within the cell after uptake in both studies. Uptake of fr ee, unaggregated nanosilver particles was r ecently demonstrated in the50 embryos of zebrafish (Lee et al., 2007; Text box 13). Single silver nanoparticles in water were observed crossing the external tissue that protects the embryo via diffusion through unusually large pores. The particles then penetrated the embryo itself, although the mechanism was not clear. As the embryomatured to an adult, the nanoparticles were retained and spread through a number of major organs. Ultimately, a body of suchwork with a variety of organisms and condi-tions will be necessary for definitive conclu-sions about the pr ocesses inv olved. B ut the study with z ebrafish (Lee et al., 2007) r efut- ed the simplest null hypothesis: that risks from silv er nanopar ticles can be discounted because the par ticles ar enot av ailable for uptake b yorganisms. N anosilv er is bioav ail- able, although details like rates of uptake and fate within the cell ar eless kno wn. The charge potential, sur face ar ea, sur face structur e, oxidation state and sur face compo- sition of nanopar ticles that affect their chemi r eactivity will also affect bioav ailability , just as speciation and transformation affectbioavailability of silver metal. But beyond that general statement, little is known. USEPA's white papers on nanotechnology (USEPA, 2007) implied that metallo-nanoparticles were unlikely to be bioavailable, based on the assumption that only the free ion of metals such as silver are taken up. It seems unlikelythat nanosilver would mimic a sodium ion, but the effects of the nature of the nanosilver particle on uptake by endocytosis are morecomplex and completely unknown. Changesin the form or stability of nanosilver during itsresidence in natural waters or within the com - plex gut envir onment also seem likely ,but again, ther studies implica - tions for bioav ailability ar eunkno challenges to deliv ering nanopar ticle- based dr ugs, for example, is their tendency to aggregate in the gut, which incr eases their siz e and lo wers their absorption (F lorence, 2004; Ngo et al., in pr ess). An impor tant pr operty of silv er nanomate- rials appears be an ability to incr ease acces - sibility of silv er ions to organisms. E ngineer ed silver nanopar ticles can be thought of as a Text box 13. Bioavailability of nanosilver to zebrafish (Danio rerio) Lee et al. (2007) r ecently published one of the first authoritative works addressing bioavailability of a silvernanopar ticle for mulation using environmentally realistic concentrations of silver. The nanosilver was engineered so that it did not aggregate. Zebrafish embryos were bathed in water of the same salinity as occurs naturallyin the egg (1.2 nM sodium chloride) with different con-centrations of silver nanopar ticles. The embryos were exposed over the entire period of development, begin- ning at a cr ucial life stage; the eight-cell cleavage stage. This cleavage stage is the most sensitive of sev - eral stages in the development of the embryo because its eight cells eventually proliferate into many cells that ultimately form the functioning organ systems in the adult or ganism. Disruption of one cell has great impli-cations for nor mal development of the embryo into an adult. Lee et al. (2007) showed that single silvernanopar ticles moved acr oss the protective membranous tissue that protects the embryo from the external envi- ronment; termed the chorion. The nanoparticles were obser ough large pores in the chorion, 1,500-2,500 nm in size. Pores also occur in the mem- branes that sur round internal cells, but they are typical- ly much smaller. The silver nanoparticles also made their way into the inner mass of the embr yo, although the mechanisms by which they passed thr ough that membrane were not visible. The single silver nanopar- ticles were retained by the embryo as it matured and were eventually found embedded in the retina, brain, heart, gill arches and tail of the mature fish. 51Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment large number of \"potential\" silver ions amassed in one \"package\" and modified by sophisticated nanometer-scale engineering in ways that might affect accessibility to cells. For example, Balogh et al. (2001) described face-modified poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) to pre-organize sil- ver ions and subsequently contain them in the form of solubilized and stable, high surfacearea silver domains.\" Such a product deliversthe package of silver ions to a target (e.g., bac-teria). E fficient deliv eryof many silv er ions to the exterior of bacterial cells appears to be one of the r easons nanosilv er accentuates the effec - tiveness of silv er as a bacterial biocide. The rate at which the silv er ion is r eleased fr om nanocomposites is about one or der of magni - tude higher than it is in micr ocomposites, because of the much larger specific sur face area of the nanopar ticles (B alogh et al., 2001). But effectiv eness would also be accentuated if the nanopar ticle pr otected the silv er ions it car- ries fr om speciation r eactions that educe ailability befor ethe verall bioavailabili- ty from the nanopar ticle could be much greater than for an equiv alent number of fr ee silver ions r eleased to natural waters. Limbach et al. (2007) noted that nanopar ticles, in general, could also be carriers for heavy metal uptake into human lung epithelial cells, accentuating the to xicity of the nanopar ticle. They termed this a \" Trojan horse-type mechanism.\" Moore (2006) also obser ved that the sucrose polyester nanopar ticles carried with them another pollu - tant; the organic chemical poly-ar omatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Uptake of the nanoparti- cles accelerated uptake of the P AH and increased its to xicity. It is conceivable that nanosilv er par ticles could similarly act as aT rojan horse if they carried silver across the membrane via endocytotic processes and then released this toxin into the sensitive internal environment of the living cell. It is also clear that nanosilver products can introduce silver to the human body. For exam- ple, silver colloidal solutions are promotedbecause they introduce silver to the blood- stream via intestinal uptake (Wadhera and Fung, 2005). Manufacturers claim that the sil-ver circulates, eliminating germs in the blood,and is then excreted. 5But deposition as silver chloride or silv er sulfide in tissues cer tainly occurs to at least some degr ee, as evidenced b y occurr ence of argyria in people who take v ery high doses of the colloidal silv er.Itis unclear whether the form of silv er in the blood in this circumstance is as a nanopar ticle or a com - plexed silv er ion. I nnocuous deposition of silv er metal in tissues is kno wn, but cir cumstances that might r esult in carr ying nanopar ticles to organs wher ethey might penetrate functional areas deser vegreater investigation. HOW DOES NANOSIL VER MANIFEST ITS TOXICITY? The envir onmental implications of the ne w nanosilv er technologies will r eflect the cumula- tiveimplications of exposure to the nanoparti- cles, and exposur eto the toxic and persistent pollutant of which the nanomaterials are com- posed. As w ehaveseen, the to xicity of silver metal has been studied, ev en though some aspects demand gr eater inv estigation. Whether silver occurring in the nanopar ticle form poses additional risks r emains poorly understood. Thereis little question that many of the commer cial pr oducts and medical devices con- taining nanosilv er aretoxic to bacteria, at least under ideal conditions. Thereis some contro- versy o ver the specifics, however. There is a52 long history of positive experience with the effectiveness of silver in treatment of burns (Brett, 2006), with or without the addition ofnanosilver. But questions arise about at least some claims about the effectiveness of using nanosilver to treat wounds. For example,Vermeulen et al. (2007) could find only threerandomized controlled trials (in Cochrane's reg-ister of such trials) that rigorously tested efficacy of silv er in treatment of wounds that were slow to heal (chr onic wounds). The authors conclud- ed that \" there is insufficient evidence to recom- mend the use of silver-containing dressings ortopical agents for treatment of infected or con-taminated chronic wounds.\" At least some com-mercial products recognize the limitations of thenew nanosilver treatments. For example, the lit-erature accompanying a commercially availablenano \"silverhealing\" bandage cites the broad-spectrum antibacterial effects of the silver ionthat is released, but states the product \"reducesthe risk of infection from the very beginning,but cannot heal wounds that are alreadyinflamed.\" There is also little doubt that nanotechnolo- gies can improve antibacterial capabilities com-pared to traditional uses of silver. One reason isthat the new technologies allow manipulation ofsilver onto or into products where it could notbe placed before (e.g., the lining of medicaldevices). The antibacterial function of the nanopar ticle is to er silv er ions to the bac - teria in such locations. The characteristics of the nanosilv er arealso impor tant. Corr elations ar e found betw een the silv er ion r elease rate of dif - ferent formulations and to xicity to common bacteria such as Escherichia coli (Damm et al., 2008) or pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus(Vallopil et al., 2007). E ffectiv eness is improved with r educed particle size. Smaller particles with larger sur face ar eas deliv er silverions faster than larger particles with less surface area do (Lok et al., 2007). Aggregated particles with a reduced surface area also are not as effec-tive as free particles. But formulations other than suspensions of free nanoparticles may also be effective antibactericides. For example, thesilver composites studied by Balogh et al. (2001)were effective in maintaining silver in a formthat can release the silver ion. The authors con- cluded that the nanosilv er prevented complexa- tion and/or pr ecipitation of silver into unavail- able forms befor eit contacted the bacteria. The body of research on the antibacterial nature of various formulations of silver nanoma-terials is growing rapidly as the quest for newapplications continues. The research searchengine Scopus found an average of 143 papersper year between 2002 and 2007 when queriedwith \"silver\" and \"bacteria.\" The number ofpapers averaged half that between 1992 and1997. A search of research specifically on nan-otechnology related to silver and bacteria usingthe International Council on Nanotechnology(ICON) website returned 95 research paperspublished between 2003 and 2007. Further sys-tematic study is needed, however, on doseresponse, how efficacy relates to particle proper-ties, the influences of the exposure medium andthe mechanisms by which nanosilver accentu-ates antibacterial capabilities (Brett, 2006). The R oyal Society (2004) identified free engineer ed or discr ete nanopar ticles as posing the gr eatest envir onmental risks. M ost studies to date hav efocused on such fr ee nanopar ticles, and found some consistencies in the mecha - nisms b ywhich they ar etoxic (see, for example, Text bo x14). The data av ailable suggest that the composition of such par ticles is also a consider - ation (H ussain et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007), but that has r eceived less emphasis. E ven if the particle is not intrinsically to xic in the case of53Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment nanosilver, the metal ion it releases is itself potentially a concern if the particle breaks down inside cells. For example, Hussain et al. (2005) found that ROS accumulation (Text box 14) in isolated liver cells from rats (in vitro) was accel- erated more by nanosilver exposure than byexposure to nanoparticles of other composi- tions. They compared the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to that of nanoparticles of molyb-denum, aluminum, iron oxide and titaniumdioxide. The liver cells were exposed to thenanoparticles for 24 hours. Concentrations of10-20 ppm nanosilver elicited increased ROSgeneration, but much higher doses were neededbefore other metals elicited similar effects.Among the other materials, molybdenum oxidewas moderately toxic, but iron, aluminum,manganese and titanium oxides displayed less orno toxicity at the doses tested. The experimentcould not resolve whether the presence of thenanoparticle or the release of silver was the ulti-mate cause of toxicity, but it was clear that par-ticle composition (the presence of silver in thenanoparticle) affected toxicity. As discussed earlier, most authors conclude that the to xicity of silv er metal to humans is lim - ited to local cell disr uption, effects associated with extr eme doses and/or the dev elopment ofargyria. Whether these conclusions carry over to nanosilver is not known. If transport of nanosil- ver particles occurs in the bloodstream (Hollinger, 1996), then accentuation of silver ion release in damaging situations seems worth further investigation, based upon in vitro stud-ies (e.g., Hussain et al., 2005). Similarly, if silver induces cell damage, thereby slowing the heal- ing of wounds, it is important to determine towhat extent nanosilver potentiates such effects.The decades of successful experience with silverin burn units with no evidence of cytotoxiceffects (Brett, 2006) has not yet been achievedwith nanosilver in the diverse uses for which itis being proposed. Indirect effects on human health from improper use of nanosilver technologies mightalso deserve investigation. The effects of indis-criminately eliminating beneficial bacteria bylong-term exposure to silver (whatever theform) may be important, but so far remainlargely unaddressed. Sawosz et al. (2007) stud-ied effects of ingestion of colloidal silver on themicroflora and cell structure of the gut of quail.Exposures were for only 12 days at concentra-tions up to 25 ppm. A tthe highest doses, researchers saw incr eases in populations of lactic acid bacteria in the gut, but other wise no major Text box 14. Mechanisms of nanoparticle toxicity to cells To evaluate toxicity to humans, cells cultured outside the body (in vitro tests) are often used. Such studies showevidence for altered behavior and toxicity in the nanorange for many types of particulate material (Owen and Handy ,2007). One cause of nanomaterial- induced toxicity consistently found in such studies is generation of reactive oxygen species, or ROS (Ober dorster et al., 2005, 2007). Reactive oxygen species are generated as by-products of normal cellu-lar function, but the cell's antioxidant defenses break them down. ROS accumulate when those antioxidantdefenses are harmed or otherwise cannot keep up withROS generation. ROS are harmful because they can damage cell membranes (membrane lipid per oxida - tion), leading to problems with transport systems. ROS can also affect the way proteins assemble and cause them to fragment, and they can cause damage to DNA (Ngo et al., in press). 54 disruption of gut microflora and no cell dam- age. Given the number of people chronically ingesting colloidal silver, and proposals to feedcolloidal silver to animals commercially grown for human consumption, further systematic investigation of such effects seems warranted.Effects on human skin of chronic contact withsilver-impregnated products may warrant con-sideration. Bacteria typically live on the skin in aharmless, mutually beneficial r elationship, without causing any infection. O nly when the skin is br oken or damaged are bacteria associat- ed with a risk of infection. If the normal bacte-rial flora are beneficial in preventing coloniza-tion by pathogens, or if they moderate the pres-ence of other potentially dangerous organismson the skin, then disruption of those benefitswould deserve investigation. In vivo studies of nanoparticle toxicity with living, higher-order organisms are just begin-ning. We know from experience with other con-taminants that dose response in classical toxicitytests is difficult to extrapolate directly to toxici-ty in nature, yet this remains the dominantapproach in the early experiments addressingecological effects of nanosilver. Lee et al. (2007)cited some of the specific limitations of theapproaches used to date, suggesting the scienceis unnecessarily revisiting approaches with seri-ous constraints. For example: 1. Test species ar etypically dosed with much higher concentrations and for much shor ter periods than would be expected in contami - nated natural settings. M ethodologies exist for tests that fully consider a stage in the life cycle or exposur efrom diet, but r emain uncommon. 2. Studies with whole living organisms (in viv o) remain rar ein the study of nanopar ticles. Anin vitro test with isolated cells is a powerful approach to address mechanisms and likeli- hood of toxicity, but it cannot address doseresponse. Realistic in vivo tests are necessary to determine what concentration in nature will be toxic. 3. Interdisciplinary study is essential. Nanoparticles can aggregate or change form during the experiment (H ussain et al., 2005), affecting exposur eand effects. It is essential that nanopar ticles be physically characterized and that any effects of residual chemicalsadded to promote stability be understood(Limbach et al., 2007; Asharani et al., 2008). 4. Nanomaterials are sometimes injected into organisms in vivo to avoid delivery issues likeaggregation. This approach is highly invasive.Most important, it does not address bioavail-ability, distribution or transport within theorganism (Lee et al., 2007). Short exposures to high concentrations are an example of a pragmatic trade-off made to assureeffects are observed, and that the experiment iscompleted on a timescale practical to the inves-tigator. Such screening tests can show toxicityfrom nanoparticles is possible, but are ineffec-tive in addressing the questions about effects inthe ng/L range that will be most impor tant for understanding implications of nanosilv er.For example, Asharani et al. (2008) conducted one of the first studies of nanosilv er effects on dev el- opment of embr yos of z ebrafish. The experi - ment was informativ ein sho wing nanosilv er accumulation into the embr yo, occurr ence of toxicity and ho wtoxicity was expr essed, but it was less useful in defining what concentrations might be of concern. The lo west exposur econ- sidered was 5,000 ng/L, at which some effects55Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment were apparent. The exposure period was also not sufficient to include full development of all embryos. In contrast, Lee et al. (2007) avoided the limitations associated with high concentrations,exposures of a limited duration and aggregation in tests of nanosilver toxicity to the embryos of zebrafish (see also Text box 13). They bathed a sensitive stage of the embryo in water chemical- ly similar to the physiological environment ofthe embryo that was spiked with nanosilver. Theparticles were formulated to avoid aggregationand r etained an 11 nm diameter during the experiment. The tests were conducted on a sen- sitivedevelopmental stage of the organism and for the entir edevelopmental period from the embryo to adult, which in zebrafish is only 120hours. They used concentrations of nanosilverthat were realistic in terms of expectation forcontaminated waters. Their findings suggestnanosilver toxicity to zebrafish reproduction isfeasible at environmentally realistic concentra-tions. For example, maturation of the zebrafishembryo was normal at 8 ng/L but was affectedatthe next highest dose levels that were used. Lee and colleagues (2007) conclude that \"asnanoparticle concentration increases, the num-ber of normally developed zebrafish decreases,while the number of dead z ebrafish increases. As nanopar ticle concentration increases beyond 19 ng/L, only dead and deformed z ebrafish ar e obser ved, sho wing a critical concentration of Ag nanopar ticles in the dev elopment of z ebrafish embr yo....The number of deformed z ebrafish increased maximum as nanopar ticle con - centration incr eased to 19 ng/L and then decreased as nanopar ticle concentration increased fr om 19-71 ng/L because the number of dead z ebrafish incr eased. \" Different abnormalities also occurr ed as dose increased. F in abnormalities and spinal cor ddeformities occurred at the lowest effective doses (beginning at 19 ng/L). Malformation of the heart and swelling (edema) of the yolk sacoccurred at the next highest doses. At 44-66ng/L, swelling of the head and eye abnormalitiesoccurred. Both quickly resulted in death. Eye abnormalities included eyelessness and undevel- oped optic cups with no retina or lens. Asharani et al. (2008) observed similar effects on zebrafish at the much higher doses. Several aspects of the results of Lee et al. (2007) are especially important: Toxicity followed a dose response defined by the total concentration of silv er. The number of par ticles or particle surface area may have co-varied with total silver, but total silver inthe nanoparticles defined the effective doseadequately. Nanosilver toxicity occurred within a range of total silver concentrations that might beexpected in contaminated natural waters(ng/L). Thus, the ng/L range expected in con-taminated environments does not exclude thepotential for adverse effects. Toxicity occurred at concentrations that are toxic to reproduction in other organisms when exposed to silv er metal. The exposur eto nanosilv er affected the dev el- opmental pr ocess in the organism\u2014a r esult similar to that obser ved for silv er itself when accumulated fr om diet in other species (H ook and F isher,2001). D eformities of this natur e arealso typical of xins that associate ther ebyinflu- ence the ter tiarystructur eof proteins, an effect typical of silv er metal. 56 Toxicity testing across the range of concentra- tions and over time periods that are meaning- ful in natural waters was shown to be feasible. Abody of work will be necessary for definitive conclusions with regard to the concentrations atwhich nanosilver is toxic and the effects thatmight be expected. But it is clear that sophisti-cated alternatives to traditional tests of acute mortality from exposures in water at the ppm level are available. Such tests should be given the enhanced cr edibility they deserve as regulatory decisions are made. Like Hussain et al. (2005), Lee et al. (2007) could not differentiate whether the adverseeffects observed were caused by the nanoparticleor by the silver. Asharani et al. (2008) foundnanosilver exposures were more toxic thanequivalent silver ion exposures. But their seawa-ter was made with natural sea salt, which wouldprobably contain high concentrations of organicmaterials capable of complexing the silver ionand reducing its toxicity. Many of the signs ofstress were consistent with silver toxicity in allthese experiments, but that does not eliminatethe possibility that nanosilver might potentiatethe effects of the silver ion; as might occur if thenanoparticle acts as a vehicle to deliver the silverto the interior of cells (see earlier discussion).Moore (2006) also discussed delivery of contam-inants into cells via the nanopar ticle \" container.\" These authors note that \" exploitation of the ... endocytotic r outes of entr yto the w pollutant nanopar ticles to embed themselv es within the functional machiner yof the cell in ways that ar etoxicologically quite differ ent fr om conventional to xic chemicals. N anopar ticles sit- uated in the and endolysosomal as foci for o xidativ edamage thatcould not be readily expelled from the cell and generation of radicals could lead to organelle dysfunction.\" As noted earlier, complexation of the dis- solved silver ion with sulfides or organic materi- als limits the silver available for transport acrossthe membrane. But if organisms can mistakenlytake up \"a container of potential silver ions,\"then these natural protections are bypassed. Such amechanism is suppor ted by observations that both solubility and to xicity are retained in silver nanocomposites, ev en in the presence of sulfate or chloride ions (Balogh et al., 2001). Oncetrapped within a cell, nanosilver may deliver sil-ver ions directly into the cell machinery. Muchmore study of this potential T rojan horse deliv-ery system is necessary, but it is an interestingexample of potential interactive implications ofbuilding nanomaterials with unique physicalattributes from chemicals with known toxicity. Finally, toxicity can be expected only if uptake occurs faster than the sum of excretionplus detoxification, whether it is silver, nanosil-ver or an interaction of the two that is toxic.Detoxification reactions in humans and inverte-brates are known for silver. Silver can be taken upin high concentrations into the bodies of somebivalves, as it can in humans. But in somespecies, most of it is deposited in nontoxic, insol-uble silver sulfide granules in basement mem-branes, away fr om cr ucial cell machinery (Berthet et al., 1992). nothers, such eless effectiv eand animals ar emorevul- nerable to to xic effects. F or example, scallops ar e morevulnerable than o ysters to silv er to xicity because scallops deto xify a smaller pr oportion of the silv er taken up (B erthet et al., 1992). Differences in deto xification capabilities among species r emain a cr ucial uncer tainty for most organisms, ho wever.57Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment Silver is an effective antibacterial agent with a long history of use, but it also has a long his- tory as an environmental pollutant.Nanotechnologies offer the potential for dra-matic impr ovements in both traditional and newuses of silver. Great potential exists for invaluable uses in medical devices and water purification, to name two. But it is na\u00efve to assume benefits will come from every imagi-nable nanosilver product without potential tocause harm. The sophistication of this newnanotechnology and its proliferation (largelyuncontrolled) raise new questions of healthand environmental impact. The unique properties of nanomaterials present formidable challenges, both in termsof technical understanding (science) and ofpolicy decisions (how to use the technologysafely). Nanosilver illustrates the added chal-lenge when nanoproducts are composed ofmaterials that can be toxic themselves, at leastin certain circumstances. Institutions need torise to the challenges posed by these newcombinations of physical and chemical traits,if safe, sustainable and beneficial nanotech - nologies are to flourish. Ultimately, policy decisions must be sci- ence based. As this report has shown, there isawealth of knowledge on silver in the envi- ronment, and this knowledge provides a start-ing point for science-based decision making.We cannot afford to fall into the trap ofassuming that because nano is new, we haveno basis for managing its impacts. But nanodoes raise new questions, and a research strat-egy is necessary to address them. Some ques-tions will need long-term exploratory research before answers are found. But opportunities also exist to address other questions in a time-lier manner, if research is strategically target-ed. Alone, neither bottom-up ,principal investigator-led research nor a top-down wish list of r esearch needs is likely to result in adequately targeted studies. A strategy is defined by mapping out what knowledge isneeded and how we are to generate it, as wellas identifying both basic research needs andimmediate opportunities. Addressing nanosilver specifically, the Owen-Handy (2007) framework is useful forcharacterizing the state of knowledge andthereby identifying where basic knowledge issufficient to identify shorter-term opportuni-ties for progress. The information generatedby the source-pathway-receptor-impactframework also aligns well with the hazardand exposure data needed for risk assessmentand management. Table 7 outlines some pri-ority research goals that fall into that catego-ryof opportunities. An agenda that addressed these needs would quickly position betterunderstanding and regulation of the impactof nanosilver. But that agenda is not short.Significant investment will be necessary toaddress just the immediate opportunitiesavailable to better manage this one set ofnanoproducts. History teaches us that a balance is needed between targeted, goal-driven research andresearch that is more exploratory. Under-standing mechanisms, in the long term, willuncover the unasked questions and lead to IV. THE WAY FORWARD: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS58 TABLE 7*. Critical research and (in some cases) policy goals for ensuring rapid improvements in the safe use of nanosilver. Goal SourceDevelop terminologies that will allow nanosilver physicochemical properties to be related to behavior, and potential impact Classify products by their potential to lead to human exposure and dispersal of silver in the environment Establish consistent registration and reporting requirements for nanoproducts, and thereby begin genera- tion of data from different sources of nanosilver and silver. Quantify silver loads to the environment (and the form of the loading) from individual nanosilver products aswell as cumulative loads as the number of products grows. Pathways Develop methods to detect and programs to monitor nanosilver, or silver as its surrogate, in natural waters, sediments and soils. Mobility, persistence and transformation: Investigate the physical/chemical interactions of different nanosilver formulations in natural waters, sediments and soils. Important data gaps include knowledgeof stability of different types of nanosilver on long timescales, effects of water chemistry on reactivity and bioavailability, as well as the likelihood and nature of associations with natural particulates. Receptor Understand if and how nanosilver particles penetrate the membranes of higher-order organisms. Understand how particle characteristics affect transport. Adaptexisting me thodologies and compare uptake rates from diet and water, as well as rate constants defining excretion for critical species and cell lines. How efficiently is nanosilver transferred from prey to predator via diet? Compare rates between nanosilver and silver or among formulations of nanosilver (bioaccumulation). Investigat ewhether different physicochemical reactions in the environmental influence the bioavailability of nanosil ver. In particular, do nanosilver particles deliver silver ions directly to nontarget organisms and thereby increase bioavailability by protecting the silver ions from speciation reactions that reduce bioavailability? Determine if biological traits influence bioaccumulation of nanosilver and thereby make some species morelikelythan others to accumulate high levels of the nanomaterials. Impact Underst and the im plications or im pacts of nanoparticles once they are inside cells (in vitro). Questions include: Howstable are particles in the intracellular environment? Do mechanisms for detoxification exist and what controls the rates? What is t he natur eof the disturbance (ROS generation, DNA instability, disruption of reproduction or successful development) Is the disturbance from the particle itself or the release of silver? Can par ticles be excreted once they penetrate into a cell? In humans, ar ethere direct effects from uptake of nanosilver into the bloodstream? Does nanosilver slow wound healing, and how is that balanced by improved antibacterial activity? Are there indirect effects on human health from exposure to silver products, such as skin disturbances from disruption of bacterial populations? Are there intestinal problems from ingestion of nanosilver or from disruption of bacteria inthe gut or collection of nanodebris? What are the implications of transporting nanosilver particles in thebloodstream? Is deposition of nanosilver similar to deposition of silver itself? *While some goals will be achievable sooner and some later ,these are all opportunities for relatively rapid advancement. Research should begin as soon as possible, within the framework of a nanotechnology risk research strategy, if science-based decisions are to be made on the safe use of nanosilver .unforeseen solutions. But where our basic knowledge points to clear questions, we must take advantage of immediate opportunities toobtain information critical to decision mak-ing in the short and medium terms. Implementing long-term basic research and exploiting short- and medium-term opportunities is not enough, however. Adequately addressing the challenges present- ed by a rapidly growing silver nanotechnolo-gy will require a broader plan, the ingredientsof which are so far in short supply. That planmust be characteriz ed by interdisciplinary collaboration at an unpr ecedented level; an investment of resources comparable to the potential for economic benefits fr om the new opportunities; collaboration among agencies,stakeholders and universities; and interna-tional collaboration that involves sharing oftalent and resources. Linkage betweenresearch and decision making is also funda-mental to moving policies for managing envi-ronmental risks forward as fast as the growthof the commercial uses. T ranslating researchinto decisions in government, industry andamong consumers remains a challenge in allof environmental science. But progress in thisregard is essential if we are to learn and toteach others ho wto use nanosilver wisely. Nanosilver is only one of a plethora of nan- otechnologies rapidly adv ancing into eareanumber needs wher eresearch and policy connect: Integrate nanosilv er into aunified, multi-agency ,stakeholder-v etted nanotech dialogue. P articipation of all interested par ties in defining the questions and timetables is impor tant. G enerating the interest of talented scientists fr om the pri -vate sector, the agencies and the universities in working across historically sacred bound- aries is essential. Assign responsibilities, resources and time- lines for implementing the research strategy, and clearly identify mechanisms that will lead to better and more effective translation of the new knowledge into decision making. Integrate research among international research programs to leverage resources andensur etimely and relevant progress. This must include finding ways to cr oss what often seem to be impenetrable impedimentsto resource sharing among international institutions. Develop and share appropriate terminolo- gies to underpin research and oversight. Define clear rules for defining a product's ingredients that take into account its uniquephysical and chemical attributes. Use thatinformation to track production, use andenvironmental release/dispersal data. Assess what information is needed to over- see safe use of nanosilv er, over and above that for managing the impact of ionic silv er (or non-nanosilv er). Assess the r elevance and shor tcomings of current silv er-relevant regulations. The unique pr operties of nanomaterials pr es- ent some formidable technical obstacles to bet - ter understanding envir onmental and health risks (M aynar det al., 2006; O berdorster et al., 2005). The kno wledge base is limited, the technical challenges ar egreat and the gr owth of commer cial applications is rapid. B ut as w e59 Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment60 have shown in the case of nanosilver, existing knowledge provides a powerful baseline from which to identify research priorities and beginmaking scientifically defensible policy deci- sions. Systematic evaluation of that baseline for anumber of specific nanomaterials might be afirst step. The sophisticated advances in engi- neering nanosilver products have created new challenges to accompany the new opportuni-ties. All institutions need to rise to these chal- lenges if we are to see the benefits the new technologies promise.
