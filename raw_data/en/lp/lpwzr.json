Jihyun studied Design and Illustration at the University of Brighton and Seoul National University. She lives in Seoul with her partner and their young daughter.The Depth of the Lake and the Height of the Sky is an uplifting wordless story of a child's independent discovery of the natural world. Details and emotions are deftly captured with intricate illustrations and a deceptively simple colour palette. Hardback | 48pp | \u00a312.99What happens when you eschew the structure of a written story in favour of a book in which the illustrations, and by extension the reader, do all of the telling? illustrations of the four seasons and the different ways they can be enjoyed. Children, caregivers and teachers can create their own stories and relate to their own experiences. Take this scene above from Gerda Muller's Summer. Are the children on holiday, or do they live by the seaside? Is the oldest girl playing with her baby sister, cousin or a new friend? In the distance, do the children spot a boat, a dinghy or a yacht?Can you read a book without words? At Floris we certainly think that yes, you can! In this type of book, the story emerges through exploring the illustrations, rather than the words on the page. Caregivers and children can become more involved in the storytelling process - naming characters and spotting details. Reading a set story again and again can act as a comfort for small children. But a more free-form reading experience can have benefits too. A study by the University of Waterloo in Canada has shown that wordless picture books can increase toddlers' vocabulary more than traditional picture books. The study gave twenty-five parents two books to read to their toddlers. One book had words, the other didn't. The parents tended to use more complex language when 'reading' the book without words. They described objects in more detail and related them to real life experiences. Muller's wordless Seasons board books have been loved for over twenty years. They feature uniquely detailed The children could even spot un bateau or un voilier. Muller adopted France as her home in the 1950s, so many of her books have been translated into French. But without the confinement of words, children from anywhere in the world can pick up the Seasons books and tell their story in their own language. Wordless picture books remove the idea of words that are 'too easy' or 'too difficult' for different age groups. Through the Seasons (below) features artwork from Sarah Laidlaw and, because it has no words, can be enjoyed by children of varied ages. In this illustration, toddlers can practise their growing vocabulary by spotting the girls, boys and the moon. Older children can create a narrative about the lanterns and the night-time adventure. This type of book can also help to develop confidence, encouraging a sense of independent discovery and exploration. This feeling is perfectly evoked in The Depth of the Lake and the Height of the Sky (above) by illustrator Kim Jihyun. This worldess story follows a young boy and his dog as they leave the big city for a holiday in the countryside. Seeing a trail leading away from the house, the boy sets out to see what he can discover. His sense of excitement, independent exploration and, ultimately, wonder at the beauty of his new surroundings are subtly conveyed through Kim's delicate artwork. Children following the boy's adventure are encouraged to share in his new-found freedom, but are equally free to explore the story and illustrations in their own way. Is the boy excited or cautious? What is the dog's name? Does the boy live in the reader's city, or far away in another country? What are his thoughts and feelings? What plants, fish, animals and small details can the reader spot that the boy might have missed? We often say that books fuel the imagination, and the sharing of wordless picture books is a special experience - one that can fire curiosity and creativity in a way that is unique, refreshing and vital. | 5 4 | The Care and Development of the Human Senses: Rudolf Steiner's Work on the Significance of the Senses in Education WILLI AEPPLI A presentation of Steiner's ideas about the nature of the twelve human senses as he saw them, and their role in education. 144pp | \u00a39.99 Children and Their Temperaments MARIEKE ANSCH\u00dcTZ A guide to children's different temperaments and their role in child character, health and personality development. 128pp | \u00a38.99 Children's Creative Play: How Simple Dolls and Toys Help Your Child Develop KARIN NEUSCH\u00dcTZ Explores children's developmental stages up to age seven, and suggests suitable toys, dolls, games and activities to nurture and develop them. b/w illus | 120pp | \u00a37.99 Difficult Children: There Is No Such Thing: An Appeal for the Transformation of Educational Thinking HENNING K\u00d6HLER Challenges the labelling of children with so-called 'educationally difficult'. 216pp | \u00a314.99Educating Traumatized Children: Waldorf Education in Crisis Intervention BERND RUF Reveals the work of international relief organisation Friends of Waldorf Education with children in war zones and disaster areas around the world. 28 b/w illus | 220pp | \u00a320.00 The First Three Years of the Child: Walking, Speaking, Thinking KARL K\u00d6NIG A detailed analysis of the major achievements that dominate the first three years of life: learning to walk, to speak and to think. 128pp | \u00a314.99 From Images to Thinking DAVID MITCHELL (ED) An insightful collection of essays that explore the development of children's imagination and capacities, from pictures and stories through to scientific thinking. colour illus | 132pp | \u00a320.00Growing Children, Thriving Children: Raising 7 to 12 Year Olds With Confidence and Awareness LOU HARVEY-ZAHRA Parenting books often forget the primary school years (from seven to twelve years old).

In a brief chapter in The Extra Lesson, \"Reintroduction to Formal Work in Reading and Arithmetic,\" McAllen stated: \"In view of the reading methods which some children have experienced before coming to us, it is essential that a new child of any age should experience the letters as pictures.\" Then in \"Writing a Story\", she suggests painting writing - with a brush, in Copperplate style - as a valuable exercise for activating the lifting system, hand and eye, and recapitulating the Waldorf first grader's introduction to the beauty of written language. I've worked with these indications with grades one through eight and have found that much can be accomplished and enjoyed by progressively working with every grade on the art of painting handwriting. This can be used for its own sake as a whole-class developmental exercise and as a beautiful enhancement for the Main Lesson books. It can also be used in lessons with individual students. Working to attain control for thicker and thinner parts of the alphabet educates the radius and ulna and requires quite a bit of patience.In 1921, when the first Waldorf tenth grade was about to begin, Rudolf Steiner gave eight lectures to the teachers of the Waldorf School in Stuttgart (now collected in Education for Adolescents ). The first six of these provide a concise review of Dr Steiner's guidance for teaching the elementary grades; before taking up the topic of teaching adolescents, he went back over what children between seven and fourteen need in order to be well prepared for the next phase of school. During these lectures he stated: \"We really ought to get people to write in a way that is akin to painting. Writing in that way is far more hygienic... We should cultivate this painting-like writing. It pushes the actual mechanical activity into the body, and the writer's connection to the writing is brought to and beyond the surface.\" I believe he was probably indicating a \"painterly\" An excerpt from Steiner's July 15, 1921, lecture: \"There are two types of people in regard to writing. There are those who write as though the writing is flowing from their wrists. The forming of the letters is carried out from the wrist. Future business people are actually trained to write in this way. Their writing flows from their wrists, and this is all there is to it. The other type is disposed to looking at the letters. These people always contemplate what they write, deriving an almost aesthetic pleasure from it. These are the painter type, and they do not so much write from the wrist. When writing is accompanied by an aesthetic pleasure, the mechanical aspect is pushed into the body. It is the inner organism rather than the wrist which is writing. And this is most important, because the mechanical aspect is then diverted from the periphery to the whole of the person. We love to see examples of your pupils' artwork! Remember to tag us if you're sharing the results of these exercises on social media. @FlorisBooks You will notice that when you teach children to write in this painting way, they will also be able to write with their toes. This would, in fact, constitute a triumph, a success - when a child is able to hold a pencil between the toes and form adequate letters. I do not say that this ability should be developed artistically. But we do have in such an instance a shifting of the mechanical activity to the whole human being. We should cultivate this painting- like writing. It pushes the actual mechanical activity into the body, and the writer's connection to the writing is brought to and beyond the surface. The human being is imparted into the environment. We should really get used to seeing everything we do, rather than doing things thoughtlessly, mechanically. Because writing is a many-sided activity, we can, in a certain way, consider it as a significant aspect in our lessons.\" McAllen indicated a fine #1 brush. I've had more success with a #6 round. A quality brush, such as the Princeton Golden Taklon, keeps its shape and flexibility. Watercolour paint should be a bit on the thin side. In the lower grades, students will need helper guidelines for each row of exercises or lettering. In her description of the \"Shaded Drawing Exercise,\" Audrey McAllen points to the connection between the diagonal line and the will, and notes that shaded drawing calls on attention and patience. I might add that helping children break away from the mental fixedness imposed by drawing outlined shapes is an important and noble teaching pursuit. Flexible thinking and the willingness to wait and see what might emerge form the interplay of filled and unfilled space: these are attributes that underlay success in so many realms of life. Following are some suggestions for building up this artistic method through a progressive series of whole-class or individual exercises over time. The Extra Lesson indicates that the entire drawing is to consist of short diagonals drawn from top right toward bottom left. However, I believe it is appropriate to allow left-handed students to instead shade from the top left to bottom right. In either case, from upper to lower. Exercise 1. Filling a page with 'raindrop' strokesHave each student fill a Main Lesson book page or a form drawing sheet with diagonal dashes using stick crayons. The first lesson could be done with just one colour, and the second (below) as a colour study with two colours, one on each side of the sheet. If you use blue for the first lesson, you can give the mental image of filling the page with raindrops. It is important with this exercise that dashes be placed randomly around the page, not just drawn in rows. In this way, an image is built up over time. Exercise 2. A landscape with raindrop strokes Again using stick crayons, have each student create a landscape scene, such as a mountain with trees. This will strengthen the students' ability to build up an image over time. As mentioned, no outlines of shapes are to be drawn. \"We really ought to get people to write in a way that is akin to painting.\" \"Helping children break away from the mental fixedness imposed by drawing outlined shapes is an important and noble teaching pursuit.\" 12 | | 13 EARLY YEARS GENERAL Autumn and Winter Nature Activities for Waldorf Kindergartens IRMGARD KUTSCH AND BRIGITTE WALDEN A wonderful resource book for any Waldorf or Waldorf-inspired kindergarten.

It's good for children to understand how the bees have laboured long and hard all summer to make wax and honey. When honeycombs are removed from the hive, they are placed in a honey centrifuge and spun to extract the honey. The honey flows like liquid gold to the bottom of the centrifuge and through several fine sieves. A rich, delicious odour fills the room. What remains is the precious wax; the wax combs are gathered and put in the melter. Impurities are caught in the sieve as the wax runs down into the collecting tray. At this cold time of year it is a real blessing for children to be able to do modelling with warm, aromatic beeswax. Give them enough wax so that they can work with both hands and have enough to make a little house. This wonderfully aromatic, precious material appeals to the children's impulse to give something form and to experience the joy of creation.Preparing the Wax For a kindergarten group of 25 children, you need at least 4 kg of beeswax. Put 1 kg of pure beeswax in an enamelled pan (preferably a flat one), place in an oven heated to 70\u00b0C, and let it melt. Stir in 60 g of lanolin ( adeps lanae, available from a pharmacy). Let the mixture slowly cool until it is hard. Remove the hardened wax with a wooden spoon and place on wax/greaseproof paper. Break the wax into wax 'dumplings' that are the right size for the hands of the children. Put these back into the flat pot. Wax prepared in this way can be remelted many times. An hour to an hour and a half before the modelling session, warm the wax in the oven at 50\u00b0C, being careful that it doesn't melt. A wooden board or a cross-section of a tree trunk make good work surfaces.Making the most of the season Irmgard Kutsch established the Children's Nature and Garden Centre in Reichshof in 1994, where children and teachers can learn about nature and participate in workshops. Brigitte Walden worked as a Steiner-Waldorf teacher for fifteen years. She is a carer at a centre for people with additional support needs in Germany.Autumn and Winter Nature Activities for Waldorf Kindergartens is a wonderful new edition of a perennial book for Steiner-Waldorf kindergartens, full of engaging and educational nature activities to help children connect with the seasons alongside valuable background reading and advice. 200 colour illus | HB | 120pp | \u00a316.99Encourage children to engage with the seasons with educational indoor and outdoor activities. These easy to implement projects from Autumn and Winter Nature Activities for Waldorf Kindergartens are a great place to start. Modelling with beeswaxWith a little help, even four-year-olds can weave a flower basket. In the bottom right photo, shoots of a privet hedge are being used as the spokes for a frame and wild grape creepers are woven through them. The bottom is laid out as a star base; it then develops a rounded ball form, and finally comes to a point. Because the base and the sides are not woven separately, this is an excellent project for children. Newly-cut willow shoots must be soaked in water for two or three weeks before use. You Will Need: A sturdy knife A small pair of pliers or tweezers A basketry awl for making space to insert a new shoot Method Begin the willow basket with a cross base, a star base, or a rectangular base (see illustrations opposite). When the bottom is finished, bend the shoots 90 degrees and weave the sides of the basket. To finish off the lip of the basket, cut the shoots, moisten them again, then bend and weave them back into the basket (see below).Willow hanging baskets Top tip: To make the lip of the basket very stable, it is important to soak the material so it doesn't crack when bent. Top tip: Beeswax mixed with lanolin stays malleable for 15 to 30 minutes, then becomes hard and stable. Many little works of art can be made from beeswax. 1. Laying the base of the spokes2.

Is it important to you to feel connected to nature? A deep connection to nature is at the absolute centre of my life. I could not function without it. There are places Where did the story of this book begin for you? I have three great loves: nature, animals and the beauty of Scotland. I think this book has lived inside me all my life. The fawn is probably a metaphor for everything I feel about animals and their need for our understanding and protection whether they are wild or tame. It all seemed to bubble up to the surface and once I had the first line it took wings. Were there any special places, people or experiences that inspired the story? Some years ago we had a cottage in Strathdon and my neighbours in a remote glen rescued an orphan fawn. They called him Scooter and although he ultimately lived out in the glen he used to come in now and again and lie by the kitchen range with their family dogs. Home of the Wild is loosely based on this enchanting memory.that mean so much to me where the rivers, the woods and the fields have become my friends. It is a fundamental need in my life. I am eternally grateful for the endless nourishment, comfort and inspiration nature has given me. Sharing picture books with young children is a wonderful way to fire the imagination and help them explore ideas about the world around them. We spoke to Louise Greig about feeling connected to the natural world, and her new book Home of the Wild.Deep connections to natureHow important do you think it is for children to have access to nature? I think it's crucial for today's children to connect with nature when so much of their lives today are screen based and screen stimulated. As humans we are of nature, our ancestors were hunter-gatherers living to the pulse of nature. The seasons defined what we ate and when we slept. There is a song of nature deep within all of us. Thank goodness for the wonderful initiatives that exist to get children connecting with nature. Do you have a special spot in nature that you'd like to visit if you get the chance? I would love to visit the Outer Hebrides some day and see the wild Eriskay ponies. I am also one for a bit of a pilgrimage so I would love to visit Sandaig Bay where Gavin Maxwell, the writer, lived with his otters. Ring of Brightwater is one of my favourite nature books. Have you ever had an animal companion you've connected with in the way that the young boy and Alba the deer connect in the story? I have had many animal companions in my life and all of them have touched me greatly, but the one that stands out was my rescue greyhound, Smoky. I had him from 2007 to 2018 and from the first day we were inseparable friends. He was with me all the time. He had lived a rough life and was picked up stray in terrible condition before he came to me. The connection I had with him was profoundly special. Julia's illustrations are such a special part of the book. How did it feel to see the story come to life on the page for the first time? It was incredible. I had been shown samples of Julia's work, which were beautiful, but nothing could have prepared me for the finished artwork. She has captured the wild and wistful beauty of the Scottish landscape perfectly, but most of all she has Louise Greig is a multi-award winning poet and author born in Scotland. Louise's picture books are inspired by the Scottish landscape and the company of animals. J\u00falia Moscard\u00f3 is a Spanish illustrator and visual artist currently based in Nottingham, UK. Home of the Wild is a lyrical and uplifting story about a friendship between a boy and a wild fawn, with a tender message of love and letting wild animals be free. Atmospheric illustrations, full of vibrant detail and glorious colours, bring the authentic Scottish landscapes to life. Hardback | 32pp | \u00a312.99absolutely nailed the relationship between the boy and Alba. I am captivated, utterly, by what Julia has done. Do you have a favourite illustration from the book? I am one for small telling details and there is a spread of the boy's bedroom that is full of glorious clues that give the reader a real insight into the little boy's interior world. He is a child of nature and the details are gorgeous. But the spread that carries the most emotional resonance for me is the very last one where there is now a deep understanding between the boy and Alba. Alba belongs to the wild but they are always together in spirit. The wind is blowing and will carry their bond forever. It actually brings a tear to my eye every time I look at it. That is the power of Julia's work. \"There is a boy who has mended tails and patched up wings, who has tended, nursed and fed small things. Inside a house, safe and warm, a welcome shelter from any storm.\" There is a fawn who breathes the wild, who is learning ever y rustle in the circling pines...

And they let him keep the fairy pot, which boiled water in less time than it took to fill, and which, together with his cows, Luran prized more highly than anything else on earth. Luran started to run across the field, and he had hardly reached the gate before sixteen of the fairies were in hot pursuit. Luran raced through the gate - and after him raced the fairies. Over a ditch leapt Luran - and over the ditch leapt the fairies. Through heather and bracken scrambled Luran through heather and bracken scrambled the fairies. Luran began to breathe heavily with exhaustion, but the fairies seemed as fresh as when they had left the hillock. Luran turned his head to see how far behind they were, and found that they were quickly gaining on him. \"If I drop the pot, I could run faster,\" he thought. But still he clung on to it. On he ran - and on ran the fairies. They had nearly caught up with him when he heard a mysterious voice call, \"Luran, get among the black stones by the shore.\"shouts, towards the open hillock. Luran thought quickly. \"If I want to find out what is happening to my cows,\" he reasoned, \"I need to get inside that hillock.\" He crept across the field and mingled with the fairies, hoping they would not notice him in the crowd. The thieves drove the cow towards their home, and Luran followed. Inside the hill, Luran lurked in the shadows and watched as his cow was slaughtered. He did not dare to speak, but his heart was full of dismay. The fairies sat down to a good meal of beefsteak, and there was much laughing, joking and singing. At last the fairies began to yawn, and Luran watched as they fell asleep, one by one. Soon the hillock was silent but Once upon a time there lived a farmer called Luran, who was very proud of his herd of cattle. One morning when he went to the fields to drive the cows to the shed for milking, he noticed that one was missing. \"Perhaps she's strayed and will turn up later,\" he thought, and did not let himself become unduly worried. Yet when nightfall came, the cow was still missing. Worse than that, the next morning another cow had gone. Each morning for a week, Luran found he had lost another cow. Soon he would have no cows left! So Luran decided to keep an eye on them for a night or two, in the hope of solving the mystery. He hid in a ditch and waited. Soon after midnight, he heard mysterious noises coming from a hillock at the far end of his field. It was a moonlit night, and he clearly saw the side of the hillock open and a band of little people stream out. The fairies - for that's what they were - surrounded one of Luran's cows and began to urge it, with cries and for the occasional snore and grunt of a sleeping fairy. \"How dare they steal my cows?\" Luran thought angrily. He looked around the great fairy hall and his eyes fell upon the many precious goblets standing on the dining table. \"One of those would be compensation for the cows I've lost,\" he thought. \"Or would it? Maybe one goblet is worth more than a whole herd of cows! It wouldn't be fair for me to take more than I've lost.\" He looked around again, and there on the fire he saw a large copper pot. \"That's better,\" he thought. \"It's fair to take this in return for my cows. After all, it's a fine pot. The fairies might do the best out of the deal.\" He tiptoed over and lifted it off the fire. Then he carefully stepped between the bodies of the sleepers and made for the entrance of the hillock. But as he went through the doorway, he accidentally banged the pot against the side. Clang!The fairies woke up with a start. Illustrated Tales of Dwarfs, Gnomes and Fairy Folk is a treasure trove of classic European folk stories and gorgeous illustrations from celebrated artist Daniela Drescher. Why not share this Scottish tale of fairy mischief with your class at story time?Luran and the Fairies \"Ah, fairy folk are frightened of the sea,\" he thought, remembering that fairies never ventured on the sea shore below the high-tide mark. He ran towards the beach. The sea was out, and there was a line of dark rocks high on the shore, beyond which the tide never came. Luran clambered over them and collapsed, exhausted, on the sand. The sixteen fairies danced with rage on the rocks, but none dared come closer. They knew they were beaten, and Daniela Drescher was born in Munich and trained in art therapy. She is the author and illustrator of more than twenty books for children, which are now available in several languages. Her best known books for younger children include In the Land of Fairies , the Little Fairy stories and the Pippa and Pelle stories. Luran and the Fairies is just one story from Illustrated Tales of Dwarfs, Gnomes and Fairy Folk - an enchanting, lavishly illustrated anthology of classic European folk tales, featuring dwarfs, gnomes, fairies and more, all beautifully presented in a hardback gift edition.

That's how it's supposed to be. When we weave, the white ones stay fixed in place and the black ones are pulled back and forth as we pass the thread between them. But you will learn all of that. For now I want you to go and find seven rough stones as big as your fist. We're going to tie those to the bottom of the black threads.\" Saul ran outside and was soon back with seven large stones. His father took one and tied it to the bottom of one of the black threads, and then Saul helped him with the remaining six stones. A week before he turned twelve, Saul's father came to him and said, \"It's time you learnt how to weave.\" So they went to the workshop where Joachim kept the large loom. \"This bench loom is too big for you at the moment,\" he said. \"We'll use that one instead.\" Joachim pointed to the smaller loom leaning against the wall next to the window. It consisted of a wooden frame, with a pole across the top, another one near the bottom, and one in the middle, resting on pegs hammered into the frame either side. \"My father taught me to weave standing in front of that, and I've taken great care of it ever since. Look, the warp is still on it. Can you count the threads?\" \"Yes father, there are seven white ones alternating with seven black ones. The white ones are attached to the top and bottom bars, but the black ones hang loose.\"\"We will begin the lessons properly tomorrow,\" his father said. \"When your birthday arrives, we'll be able to get you started on your first little rug.\" On his birthday, Saul's mother had spun pretty wool for him, ready for weaving. Saul's father stood next to him in front of the loom, teaching him how to weave, just as he had shown him how to make tents. In this way, Saul began to learn his trade as a weaver and tentmaker. * One day when he got home from school, Saul went to the workshop to see his father. Joachim was sitting at the loom with the shuttle in his hand, passing it back and forth. Saul had only just begun to use the large loom, and although he was still quite small and the loom was large, he was beginning to grasp it. The smaller loom stood once more against the wall next to the window. The rug Saul had begun The Remarkable Story of Paul the Apostle is an engrossing narrative retelling of the life of Saint Paul for children aged ten and over. In this excerpt from Siegwart Knijpenga's compelling adaption of this inspiring story, young Saul considers some valuable lessons and contemplates his future.Lessons from St Paul's childhoodon his twelfth birthday now lay on the floor next to his bed, and he had made many more since then. Saul sat down on a pile of skins and watched his father as he worked. A new tent lay nearby. \"Who is that for?\" Saul asked.\"The shepherds in the mountains,\" his father replied. \"Are they coming to pick it up?\"\"No, they aren't able to leave their flocks, so I will have to take it to them. Would you like to come?\" \"Yes, please. Do the shepherds live up in the mountains then?\" \"During the summer they do. There are wonderful pastures up there, as well as lakes and villages. It's quite a climb, but I always enjoy visiting.\" Saul's father asked him how school had been, and Saul told him about his day. When he had finished, his father asked: \"Have you given any more thought to where would you like to go once you have become a scholar of the law?\" Saul thought about this for a moment. \"I don't know, father,\" he said. \"My Greek teacher said that I'm still too young to know, but in a few years I might hear a voice that will tell me. Not in a dream but during the day, a voice that tells me what I want to do.\" \"Did your teacher mean the voice of an angel?\" his father asked. \"I don't know, perhaps. In any case, he said it is very near, close to your heart. He said that when you hear that voice, you sense that it already knows what you want, even if you're still unsure. He called it the voice of your conscience. He said that you are yourself that voice and, at the same time, it is more than you are yourself.\" Saul's father listened carefully as he made another few passes with his shuttle. \"I am sure your teacher is right,\" he said, \"for he knows a lot. But whatever way that voice shows you, you will have to walk it yourself, and that may be quite a climb too.\" They both rose early the next morning to begin their journey into the mountains. They divided up the tent between them. Saul's father carried most of it on his back and gave Saul the groundsheet and the ropes and poles. Then they set off. After they had been climbing for a while, they stopped to rest. Sitting on a large rock by the side of the path, they drank some of the water Saul's father had brought in a leather flask and ate some of the bread and cheese he had wrapped in a cloth. It was near dawn, the sky was getting lighter, and on the horizon they could see the bright glow of the sun just before it rose. \"Well Saul,\" his father said, \"I think it would be good if you became a rabbi, a teacher. You talk about so many things even your mother and I have never thought about.\" \"But father, there is still so much that I don't understand. For example, the rabbi told us about the coming of the Messiah. But what is supposed to happen when the Messiah comes? One rabbi says that everything will Siegwart Knijpenga was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands and attended the Waldorf school in The Hague. Ordained in 1962, he went on to serve as Lenker of The Christian Community in the Netherlands for eight years. He is also the author of Stories of the Saints, a collection of stories for children.The Remarkable Story of Paul the Apostle is both an engaging account of life in the first century and a unique narrative chronicle of the key events that ultimately laid the foundations for Christianity.

Later, the sun will rise high over Persia, then it will take its course over Arabia, Israel, Egypt, and Crete. In the evening, it will set over Greece and Rome and Spain, and whatever lands may lie beyond them.\" As he spoke, Joachim made a great arc in the air with his hand, rising from the horizon in the east, high up in the sky to the south, and descending in the west. \"That is the path the sun will travel today, and that is the path it travels, day in day out, throughout the year, a little lower in the winter, a little higher in the summer. I am no scholar, but I sincerely hope that the Messiah will come in this way, just as my grandmother imagined it. As a light for all the people on earth, one that shines in the East and is seen in the West.\" Saul and his father sat in silence together, watching the sun as it rose, while they ate their bread and cheese and sipped at the water. Then they gathered their bundles and continued their climb. \"My father taught me to weave standing in front of that, and I've taken great care of it ever since. Look, the warp is still on it. Can you count the threads?\"\"He called it the voice of your conscience. He said that you are yourself that voice and, at the same time, it is more than you are yourself.\" | 31 30 | MATHS Active Arithmetic!: Movement and Mathematics Teaching in the Lower Grades of a Waldorf School HENNING ANDERSON Explores techniques for making maths lessons more engaging and real for children using movement and drawing. 216pp | Classes 1-4 | \u00a312.99 First Steps in Proven Geometry for the Upper Elementary Grades ERNST SCHUBERTH A resource for teaching geometry, focusing on triangles and platonic solids. 136 b/w illus | 96pp | Class 6 | \u00a312.99 Geometry and the Imagination: The Imaginative Treatment of Geometry in Waldorf Education A.

This makes it all the more important that they receive a good schooling in physical education (P.E.) and movement. A young person caught up in the dynamics of sporting activity drinks from the spring which gives health and zest for life. When physically active, children have a direct and profound experience of who they are - spiritually, emotionally and physically. Games and physical movement activate each child's will, which places them anew in space and time. Waldorf education sets out to encourage this phenomenon of experiencing identity through physical Encouraging a physically active life also promotes a more direct sense of self, suggest Gerlinde Idler and Lutz Gerding in this extract from the introduction of Physical Education and Movement in Waldorf Schools . Physicality fosters identityGame: Spaceball 1. Two well-matched teams are given coloured team bands. The players of one team try to pass a ball from one to another ten times without the other team taking the ball from them. If they are successful, they get a point and the other team gets the ball. 2. The opponents must keep at least an arm's length from the person who has the ball. 3. Return passes are not allowed; the penalty for this is losing possession of the ball. 4. A pass can bounce only once. 5. The game is played on an area roughly the size of a handball court. Depending on the size of the class, teams can be between five and twelve players. If there are more players, then make four teams and play on two smaller pitches. Gerlinde Idler has taught PE in Waldorf schools for many years. She lectures at the Kassel Teacher Training College in Germany. Lutz Gerding has also been a tutor at Kassel Teacher Training College. He is now a lecturer and coordinator for Waldorf teacher training in China. Physical Education and Movement in Waldorf Schools is an essential guide for all Waldorf teachers. From Bothmer Movement to archery, climbing and swimming, this resource will inspire confidence when preparing and delivering activities. Paperback | 304pp | \u00a325.00activity by using a method of teaching P.E. that accords with children's stages of development. Wherever possible, Waldorf schools work according to the principle that teachers should seek to discover, support and encourage the 'person within the person'. When teachers combine their study of anthroposophy (in particular Rudolf Steiner's Study of Man) with their first-hand experience of young people, they find ample scope for researching and developing P.E. lessons. This then has a knock-on effect on the rest of the children's learning experience. When the choice of a certain game in Class 3 or a particular exercise in the Upper School fits with the children's developmental stage, this creates enjoyment and encourages initiative within P.E. lessons. But it also helps bring children alive in their other lessons. Developmental resonances like these affect not only the quality of the will, but also the depth of children's awareness. When the children of Class 5 from different Waldorf schools meet to compete in the classical Greek pentathlon and live the Olympic ideal, three elements merge into one: the current developmental stage of the children, cultural history in the form of physical education, and community building. Regional factors and the need to focus on particular physical activities in particular places combines with the aforementioned developmental approach to create a wide variety in P.E. lessons within different Waldorf schools. Where some Waldorf schools have built up a flourishing circus with a well-established tradition of regular, intensive training, others can boast of strong volleyball, basketball, running or dragon boat teams. This book illustrates this necessarily varied approach, while at the same time elaborating on the characteristic features of P.E. in Waldorf schools: from the inclusion of Bothmer exercises, which were devised in the early days of Waldorf education, to the holistic approach to child development, and interdisciplinary teaching. Between the diversity and the standard features, there are exciting opportunities for cultivating new pedagogical ideas. Game: The Secret Two 1. A variation of spaceball. Each team secretly nominates one player to be their secret player. Every pass this player catches will count for double points. The referee is told who the two players are. 2. The rules are the same as for Spaceball. When a point is won, the ball changes teams. 3. After about ten minutes, the referee calls a halt and the teams hold a private discussion. The team in front has one guess as to who the opposing secret player is, then the other team guesses. 4. The team that guesses correctly, wins, because a right guess counts more than points won. If both teams are right (or wrong), the team with more points wins. 5. After the game, a talk about tactics is beneficial to the children.Obstacle course: A Trip to the Mountains 1. The apparatus is set up to represent a mountain range with a route through it that avoids touching the floor. 2. The children are divided into groups of three or four, and each group is given a different colour of team band. One child in each group is picked to be the mountain guide. 3. The teacher tells the class about a trip to the mountains, describing rocks and streams, ravines and narrow paths, ridges and rope bridges. The teacher explains how important it is that the teams stay together and that they keep to the path to avoid getting their feet wet. 4. One group after another sets off along the path over the mountains, following their team guide. The children can climb from one piece of equipment to the next or use the gymnastic hoops on the ground as stepping-stones. They must avoid touching the floor, which would mean getting their feet wet. 5. After a time, the teacher calls, 'Three, two, one, game is done' and the children return to their places in the circle. \"A young person caught up in the dynamics of sporting activity drinks from the spring which gives health and zest for life.\" Why not try these games and activities as part of your next PE lesson?

If you are using corn grains, take fresh soft ones straight from the cob. If these are not available, you can boil dried grains until they become soft. Before threading bore a little hole in the beechnut husks. Do the same for the acorns, acorn cups and hazelnuts which have already been dried. If the pumpkin seeds are still fresh and moist the needle will easily go through them, but with dried seeds you must first bore a hole. Of course it is not necessary to hang up all the garlands at the same time as shown in the above image. Some of the fruits will slowly but surely shrivel up, so you can replace them after a while with fresh ones. It is often nice to separate fruits and nuts with short lengths of straw so their full shape can be seen. Autumn garlands Autumn garlands can be made using all sorts of materials. While you are out walking in the country have a good look round to see what can be found in the way of ripe fruits and seeds. Suitable materials are: fresh grains of corn (maize) and silks, dried leaves, rosehips, beechnuts and their husks, acorns and acorn cups, chestnuts, hazelnuts, straw, Spanish chestnuts, conkers and their shells, pumpkin seeds, hop cones and so on.Foraged materials from nature walks in the autumn can make delightful, warming decorations for the classroom. Why not encourage your class to gather fruits and seeds for these projects from Crafts Through the Year ?Joyful seasonal crafting Bee mobile Materials: Alder cones Maple or sycamore seeds Rattan (cane) Thomas and Petra Berger live and work in The Netherlands. Together, they developed creative ways of celebrating the festivals and seasons of the year with their three children. Over 200,000 of their books have been sold in English.Crafts Through the Year is a practical and inspiring full-colour book featuring step-by-step instructions for making a range of toys and decorations to help children engage with festivals and seasons of the year. Paperback | 176pp | \u00a314.99 Mobile with autumn garlands All the fruits, chestnuts, nuts etc. on the garlands hanging down from this mobile (bottom left) are separated by little bits of straw of different lengths. To cut these, make a quick snip with a pair of very sharp scissors. If you cut too slowly, the scissors will flatten the straw and it may break. In this example, a ring of plaited straw is used for the mobile, but other materials and forms are of course possible (such as the bee mobile, opposite). Window garlands Depending on what materials you have collected, you can adorn your window. For example, thread some dried leaves carefully on to a strong thread, making sure that they are well spaced so their full shape can easily be seen. You can also use leaves which are not yet dry, but they are likely to curl up and lose their colour in a heated room. If the leaves are well dried they will generally keep their colours. Make a loop in the thread at both ends of the garland and fix it in place Straw stars Materials: Natural-coloured straw Sharp knife Pointed scissors Basin of water An ironIn the examples given in this book gold thread is always used for suspending the stars, but any other colour can be used, for instance, red. Cut the stalks into two or three lengths depending on the size of the star. 1. Cut off the seedpods from the maple- seed wings and glue the wings into the alder cones. 2. Tie a thin thread round the middle of the bees so that they can fly. 3. Make a hoop from a bit of rattan. If the rattan is too pliant use two canes, gluing or tying the ends together. 4. Now hang the bees up at different heights on to the hoop (as below).Soak the straw in water for about an hour. For flat straw, cut down into the tops a little way with a sharp knife and iron them open further with a hot iron. You can also leave the wet straws uncut and hollow, and just iron them flat. You can use both flat and hollow stalks, and make them into very wide or very narrow strips (cut with a ruler and a sharp knife). Straw stars made of flat straws have the disadvantage that they have a good side and a bad side, so they look best against a background. Straw stars made from hollow straw are the same on both sides, and are more suitable for mobiles, for use on the Christmas tree or to be hung in front of a window. Method: 8-pointed star 1. Lay two stalks of equal length crosswise upon each other. 2. Add another two diagonal stalks. Put your forefinger on the point where the stalks cross each other to hold them in place and weave a thread round the stalks, taking it first over the topmost straw, then under the next, then over the one after that, and so on. 3. Finally tie the two ends of the thread together behind the star. 4. Alternatively, you could lay the straw crosswise on a block of wood and pin it down so you have both hands free to bind the straws together. 5. Cut the points of the stars to your preferred shape. If the leaves are thoroughly dried they will generally keep their colours.Top tip:| 41 40 | Easy Wood Carving for Children: Fun Whittling Projects for Adventurous Kids FRANK EGHOLM Wood carving is the perfect outdoor hobby for adventurous children.

This extract discusses different animals' forms and physical features. Tracing how these animals have adapted, the author uses this information to tell us more about the nature of each animal and its place in the environment. relationship by observing the animal itself? Which of the mammal species seek out water as their environment? We first addressed this question in our description of the river otter. The sleek power of its playful movements, its effortless speed, its confident finesse that exudes sovereign coordination, its enlarged size in comparison to the martens, but without appearing clumsy \u2014 all this led to the conclusion that the otter is a very harmonious middle animal with a secondary emphasis on the metabolism. We can now begin to see this relationship as a rule that has been repeatedly confirmed. If originally We know a great deal about genetic factors, basic physiological processes, predictable instinctive reactions, and the social behavior of animals. But no one can tell us why well-known hoofed mammals, like cattle, deer, and rhinoceroses, have head protuberances, while horses, donkeys, tapirs, and camels do not. Neither molecular biology nor behavioral research concerns itself with the significance of an animal's form. One view regards it as a collection of randomly acquired adaptations, while the other sees it as the result of responses to external stimuli. But we will never rid ourselves of the suspicion that a living organism's form expresses more than what is conveyed by such conventional interpretations. An animal, especially a vertebrate, is visible material substance, living form, and animated, sentient life. How are these different aspects related to each other, and how can we comprehend this terrestrial members of a central group develop a strong metabolism, they secondarily seek out water as a habitat. We encountered this \"river otter motif\" also in the mink and, among the rodents, especially in the beaver, but also in the water rat, muskrat, brown rat, and the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus), all of which are metabolically enhanced species of \"central\" groups within the rodents. Among the carnivores, which as a group are most strongly dominated by middle processes, the more metabolically oriented members are also the most adapted to life in the water: the seals, and particularly the whales! A dog is less averse to water than a cat, and the large cats are less so than the small cats: jaguars have been know to swim the Amazon, tigers to cross the Ganges. Even the hoofed mammals are organized according to this rule insofar as they include middle groups. The hippopotamus, for example, as the most metabolically-oriented member of the Bunodontia, the central peccary-swine-hippopotamus group (i.e., even-toed nonruminants), is the ungulate best adapted to an aquatic way of life. Among the deer, another central group, a special attraction to water is expressed by the metabolically powerful moose. Even the red deer enjoys wallowing occasionally, whereas the roe deer shies away from water. The moose drinks water much more often than the red deer, and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) almost never drink. The musk ox, as a metabolically-oriented representative of the central group of horned animals (the Caprinae within the Bovidae), enjoys rolling in the shallow pools that form during the short arctic summer and is an excellent swimmer. A similar, although not quite as strong, relationship can be observed in the reverse case: in the middle forms of primarily metabolic animals. Thus all central hoofed mammals are typically swamp dwellers: the tapirs, pigs, musk deer, and many deer species are drawn to marshes and overall close proximity to water. Let us now turn our attention to those animals whose preferred habitat is in the trees. The pine marten possesses a well-developed rhythmic organization, yet it is secondarily more sense-active than other martens. It feels at home in the canopy of forests where it employs its powerful mobility in chasing squirrels. Here we encounter another correlation: Rhythmic, middle animals secondarily dominated by the sense pole are climbers and, in most cases, live in trees. Through our threefold analysis and synthesis we find that, due to their own specific, highly evolved organs, the mammals adopt specific environments and inhabit them as organ systems of the landscape itself. Once we become aware of this relationship, we can explore its ramifications for each animal group, as long as our approach is broad enough. Once it has been discovered, every attempt to explore this relationship will prove worthwhile. Thus we can speak in a new way of all the diverse landscapes of the Earth as forming one great organism. And we can come to know and understand this all-encompassing organism, the Earth's biosphere, by studying its living inhabitants. \"Neither molecular biology nor behavioral research concerns itself with the significance of an animal's form.\" \"A dog is less averse to water than a cat, and the large cats are less so than the small cats: jaguars have been known to swim the Amazon, tigers to cross the Ganges.\" \"Rhythmic, middle animals secondarily dominated by the sense pole are climbers and, in most cases, live in trees.\" | 47 46 | EARLY YEARS Creating a Home for Body, Soul, and Spirit: A New Approach to Childcare BERNADETTE RAICHLE A comprehensive guide to planning and running an anthroposophical kindergarten. 194pp | \u00a320.00 Nurturing Children and Families: One Model of a Parent/Child Program in a Waldorf School SARAH BALDWIN A comprehensive how-to guide for anyone interested in beginning a parent/child program in a Steiner-Waldorf context. b/w photographs | 98pp | \u00a314.99 LOWER & UPPER SCHOOL Developing the Observing Eye: Teacher Observation and Assessment in Early Childhood Education CYNTHIA MURPHY-LANG Guidance and tools to help teachers develop their observation skills, one of the most important parts of teaching. 116pp | \u00a311.99 Education - Health for Life: Education and Medicine Working Together for Healthy Development MICHAELA GL\u00d6CKLER AND STEFAN LANGHAMMER A revised collection of twenty articles from the 2006 Kolisko conferences on pedagogical and therapeutic tools within Waldorf education. 20 b/w illus | 360pp | \u00a314.99Engaged Community: The Challenge of Self-governance in Waldorf Schools JON MCALICE Gives Steiner-Waldorf teachers the tools and language to think honestly and ambitiously about the structure of their school 148pp | \u00a314.99 Entry Points: A Guide to Rudolf Steiner's Study of Man ELAN LEIBNER AND BETTY STALEY (EDS) A useful and insightful study guide to the series of lectures that Rudolf Steiner gave to the teachers at the first Waldorf school. 156pp | \u00a325.00 Evaluation, Homework and Teacher Support DAVID MITCHELL (ED) A rich collection of contributions from Waldorf teachers that discusses the meaning and effectiveness of homework and student evaluation. colour illus | 136pp | \u00a320.00 Finding Your Self: Supporting the Inner Life of the Teacher TORIN M.

They indicate that they experience in the blocks, more than in the other lessons, the potential to arrive at their own conceptual understanding, and that this understanding goes beyond that in the other lessons, and is also more lasting. \"In the blocks I understand the subject very well, and it stays longer with me.\" Block education is experienced as a haven of quiet amid the busy stream of daily education. Philosopher Matthew Crawford states that humanity is in an attention crisis. Because of the fragmentation of life it is difficult for young people to keep focused on something for a longer period of time. Crawford pleads for doing and experiencing things on our own, based on research into embodied cognition which shows that we do not get to know the world just by observing it as an outsider, but especially by actively doing things in it. He asks us to strengthen our connection with the reality around us and to bring about a feeling of belonging together. The students make a connection between their development of conceptual understanding and several different characteristics of block education. The specific practices used, including the free presentation of the lesson material by the teacher, contribute to their conceptual understanding. \"Especially the stories, questions or assignments that lead you deeper into the material also very often stimulate the brain.\" \"Knowledge was addressed during storytelling and working on the text, while experience and activity were emphasised during drawing and other creative activities.\" Another helpful aspect that the students frequently mentioned is that block teaching focuses their attention for a longer time on one particular subject. In this way they experience their potential to arrive at their own conceptual understanding. \"Block education gives me more time and opportunity to understand the lesson material.\" \"I like block teaching because you Can alternative teaching methods help to address pupils' dwindling attention spans? Frans Lutters explores the major benefits of, and students' reactions to, the block teaching approach in this extract from Immersion Learning.Deep, personal understanding are busy with one subject for a certain length of time. This makes it easier to understand and absorb the material.\" For the students this better understanding is connected with the fact that the blocks are focused on a specific aspect of a subject. \"...in the block you go more deeply into a specific aspect of the subject and stay with it for some time.\" The students connect such conceptual understanding through deepening with a qualitative change in their own judgement capacity. They experience that block teaching brings more perspective in their judgement capacity. \"Because you learn to immerse yourself deeply into something you can look at things in real life from different angles, before you judge too quickly.\" Frans Lutters has been a Waldorf teacher in the Netherlands for over 30 years. He is the author of Who Is Harry Potter?, The Grail Mystery and the Seven Liberal Arts, and An Exploration into the Destiny of the Waldorf School Movement.Immersion Learning is a comprehensive picture of the Waldorf block approach to teaching. It outlines the compelling effectiveness of this technique, which gives pupils deeper understanding of a subject.
