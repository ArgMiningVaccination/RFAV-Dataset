{"title": "Working Through Menopause: The Impact on Women, Businesses and the Bottom Line", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2022-01-01", "cleaned_text": "As a menopause expert, Dr. Mache Seibel has advocated for menopause awareness and treatment in his previous books, The Estrogen Fix and The Estrogen Window, and while serving as an editor for The Hot Years magazine. He is a dynamic and passionate voice in the field, who partners with his psychiatrist wife, Dr. Sharon Seibel, in exploring this topic. Further, the book is endorsed by Dr. Joann Pinkerton of NAMS history and fame. The authors are clear that the purpose of the book is to reframe menopause while urging reconsideration for how this phase in women's lives affects workplace culture. This book's ideal readers are probably leaders in companies considering a menopause policy and women looking to explain how menopause affects their presenteeism and performance. The authors argue that all women who live long enough will go through menopause, so although pregnancy and motherhood benefits have been explored and put into place, menopause benefits have yet to be effectively investigated and applied. The authors cite academic and case studies, of course. They also incorporate popular voices, including that of Michelle Obama. In a public interview, the former First Lady commented how \"half of us are going through this, but we're living like it's not happening.\" The book makes the case for the effect of menopause and the abysmally low application of its treatment. It tries to summarize symptoms and effects of menopause while explaining the limitations and biases in applying appropriate treatment. In a book of 118 pages, this is an enormous amount of material to cover. Working Through Menopause also summarizes the effect of women affected by menopause symptoms while working. Unfortunately, the focus is on professional women who have resources and capacity to miss work or modify their schedules. The reality for women who are paid hourly and navigate more economic constraints is not as transparently considered. Still, the authors have identified a gap in employment and women's health. They have put together an argument with evidence that will, hopefully, be a useful resource for future consideration. Reviewed by Denise M.
