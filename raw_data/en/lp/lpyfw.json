Price: Circles 525628 $58.40 Support Resource This program explores the problems that arise when the Canadian judicial system is imposed on Aboriginal people. It shows how the mainstream justice system is foreign and confusing to many Aboriginal offenders because it is ignorant of Aboriginal social problems. The video explains th at many offenders faced longterm institutionalization, starting in mandatory Mission Schools and ending in jail. Even while many Aboriginal communities continu e to work on healing from the impacts of residential schooling and paternalistic government policies, they are still exposed to the foreign Canadian justice system. The video focuses on an innovative program that began in 1991 where a partnership was formed between the Canadian justice system and the traditional Yu kon practice of Circle Sentencing. In this program, an offender is viewed as a whole person and is surrounded by significant people in his or her com munity. The individual is given an opportunity to see the consequences of his or her actions and redress the wrongs in a context that makes cultural sense. The p rogram has proven to be a powerful tool in healing communities and fighting biases against Aboriginal peoples. This video is positioned to support a discussion.

Brass tells of her experiences at boarding school in the 1920s, including many accounts of the physical and emotional abuse that occurred at the school. She also describes her marriage to Hector Brass and her varied work experience as a younger person (e.g., waitress, secretary, labour job on a chicken farm, and l ater as a reporter/writer for the Saskatchewan government). Brass was one of the early founders for the Friendship Center movement in Saskatchewan, a social org anization intended to bridge the gap between non-Aboriginal people and urban/small town Natives. The book includes negative references to \"white\" people/sp ecific individuals, but these are balanced with positive comments about other non-Aboriginal people. The resourse reflects the fact that Eleanor Brass lived in an era when prejudice and discrimination were shown loudly and overtly; it also reflects a story of hard work, perseverance and survival against the soci al environment of today. The book includes numerous archival photos. Brass, E. Author(s):Cautions: This resource is a personal account of the author's world and as such reflects her time. Teachers should ensure that student s know this is a personal reflection of how life was for some Aboriginal people.

The organization is portrayed from its beginnings in 1939, and the general trends of the IAA are summarized up to the late 1960s. The history of indigenous political action in Canada is long and hard-fought; this book documents Aboriginal politics in Canada at both national and provincial lev els.

The resource provides thorough information on the activities, leadership, struggles and advocacy of the IAA. A cross section of the reserves in Alberta that were involved with the IAA is included.

Price: Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World 559023 $14.75 Teaching Resource This resource looks at the fields of history, economics, agriculture, medicine and political science and uses these to analyze the contributions of Aboriginal peoples from North, central and South America to the world of the 21st century. Contributions from various Aboriginal nations are anal yzed in detail and the material enhances considerably the images of most of these groups. Contributions of European individuals and institutions are analyzed critically and some groups have their images reduced. In particular, the multinational corporation and the Catholic Church (as a corporation, not as a religio n) have their images tarnished. The evidence for this reduction of image is clearly documented, if somewhat controversial. Indian Givers encapsulates the accomplishments, successes, technologies and basic survival needs of the many Native tribes of the Americas. The information is presented in storytelling form. This is a very interesting read for high school students as it is highly motivational. This book can be used to further research on various topics of European contact and cou ld be a starting point for research on how the Indians of the Americas transformed the world.

Price: Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion 479148 $15.40 Support Resource Loyal Till Death is the first comprehensive look at the Indian side of the North-West Rebellion. The resource presents a significantly differe nt view of the 1885 M\u00e9tis conflict and of the role of First Nations compared to other sources on the subject. It brings to life many personalitite s, particularly those of the Indian leaders whose voices have seldom been heard in convential histories of the Canadian West. One of the two writers is Aboriginal, and Ab original groups were consulted to establish and verify the authenticity of this perspective. The standpoint of the book also supports the Alberta position on th e North West Resistance. Illustrations and maps will assist teachers with material on settlement patterns of Aboriginal people.

The analysis of Cree history during this era is broken into three stages: a first stage in which an alliance with the Blackfoot allowed both nation s to expand their territory and influence; a second stage where the alliance broke down and warfare became common; and a third stage in which the Blackfoot and Cree compete d for access to diminishing buffalo herds.

Price: Wandering Spirit (Subtitled Version) Out of print Teaching Resource This video presents the story of Sounding Lake through songs and oral tradition. The video illustrates how the producer taught young Aboriginal peoples about powwow singing by having them sing and hit the drum. The producer explains that this is a spiritual activity. The video demonst rates a spirituality connected to the environment and the songs that come from that spirituality. The accompanying CD, Northern Lights , contains 19 songs in Cree. Bonaise, W. Author(s):Cautions: Alberta Education strongly recommends that teachers preview this resource. Careful consideration should be given to the sens itivities of both the student audience and the community. This video shows the smoking of the pipe and women handling a ceremonial drum. These parts of the video may offend some Abor iginal communities, which may consider such depictions disrespectful of protocol. If this video is presented to students in an Aboriginal community, teachers should first consult with the Aboriginal communit y liaison or Elder regarding community protocol. It is suggested that teachers caution students that the videotaping of ceremonies such as these may be offensive to Aboriginal communities in that this video shares only one person's perspective. 2003\u00a910 / 30 Aboriginal Studies Theme 1 - Origin and Settlement PatternsTheme 2 - Aboriginal Worldviews Theme 3 - Political and Economic OrganizationTheme 4 - Aboriginal Symbolism and Expression \u0001\u0001 \u0001ABORIGINAL STUDIES 10 Theme 1 - The M\u00e9tis: Conflict and Cultural ChangeTheme 2 - Treaties and Cultural ChangeTheme 3 - Legislation, Policies and Cultural ChangeTheme 4 - Schooling and Cultural ChangeABORIGINAL STUDIES 20 Theme 1 - Aboriginal Rights and Self-GovernmentTheme 2 - Aboriginal Land Claims Theme 3 - Aboriginal Peoples In Canadian SocietyTheme 4 - Aboriginal World Issues \u0001 \u0001ABORIGINAL STUDIES 30 Authorized Annotated Resource List \u00a9Alberta Education, Alberta, CanadaAboriginal Studies 10-20-30 / 145 November 2007 Order No.: Est. Price: War Paint: Blackfoot and Sarcee Painted Buffalo Robes in the Royal Ontario Museum Support Resource War Paint contains very interesting material from the Buffalo Robe stories. The stories are informative and close to being factual. So me of the introductory comments may be misleading but the book can survive solely on the \"Indian stories.\" Of particular interest are the intricate s amples of symbolism and expression shown in the robe drawings and depictions as unique forms of literacy, typical of Plains culture. Some tribes may take offense to some of the war stories, but the material is useful as regional teaching material. Some minor corrections to Blackfoot spellings are necessary, for example, p. 68 cites \"Apisomakau\" but contemporary Blackfoot spelling would be \"Apisomaahka.\" Teachers may wish to emphasize to students that the way of the warrior today could involve warring against poverty, illness a nd illiteracy. Some caution should be made in relation to the community's perspective (Cree, Den\u00e9 or other Aboriginal groups) and how this r eference is used in the classroom (as one group's perspective of history told by people belonging to that particular group).Comments:Vendor Direct Brownstone, A.

Price: The Washing of Tears 525602 $58.40 Support Resource This package demonstrates the devastating effects of government relocation policy and the tragedy that befalls a people when th eir ties to their ancestral lands and culture are severed. It illustrates a clash of Aboriginal worldviews of an animated spirit world with the values of the ma instream society. It also addresses the fallout of government policy as it affects First Nations peoples negatively when attempts are made to impose mainstream cultura l values on Canada's First peoples. This video demonstrate cultural reclamation and renewal in times of hardship and tragedy. The events motivate some c ommunity members to begin to reclaim their culture and heritage and to help show the way for others. The cinematography of this video is beautifully shot and is effective in demonstrating the contrast between the pristine ance stral communities and the appalling spirit-breaking conditions of the communities of relocation.Comments: Cautions: The impact of negative government policy hits hard in the emotionally laden content of this film. There is a scene when a committee of individuals visit their confiscated whaler's shrine in a museum in New York. The ceremo ny to honour their whaling ancestors is high impact, yet sacred, and may feel exploitive. The video depicts negative references to the Canadian Government as well as to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interactions. T eachers are encouraged to balance these references with positive actions and interactions reflecting present efforts to encourage an environment where ev eryone is recognized and respected. 1994\u00a910 / 20 Aboriginal Studies Theme 1 - Origin and Settlement PatternsTheme 2 - Aboriginal Worldviews Theme 3 - Political and Economic OrganizationTheme 4 - Aboriginal Symbolism and Expression \u0001ABORIGINAL STUDIES 10 Theme 1 - The M\u00e9tis: Conflict and Cultural ChangeTheme 2 - Treaties and Cultural ChangeTheme 3 - Legislation, Policies and Cultural ChangeTheme 4 - Schooling and Cultural Change \u0001ABORIGINAL STUDIES 20 Theme 1 - Aboriginal Rights and Self-GovernmentTheme 2 - Aboriginal Land Claims Theme 3 - Aboriginal Peoples In Canadian SocietyTheme 4 - Aboriginal World IssuesABORIGINAL STUDIES 30 Authorized Annotated Resource List \u00a9Alberta Education, Alberta, CanadaAboriginal Studies 10-20-30 / 147 November 2007 (Draft)LRC Order No.: Price: The Ways of the People: Tipi 525438 $21.00 Support Resource This video details the traditional steps to making a buffalo hide Tipi, including the resurrection and blessing, as a social an d sacred event for the community.
