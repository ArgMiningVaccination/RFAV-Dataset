Natrum Muriaticum Another efficient remedy for Psoriatic Arthritis treatment in Homeopathy is Natrum Muriaticum. This remedy is an interesting example of homeopathic medicine prepared from a common food substance, the common salt, NaCl, sodium chloride. As a rule, the common salt undergoes a special medicine preparation process called potentization, whereby its inner healing power is activated to make it available for the healing process. Natrum Muriaticum is almost 200 years old, one of the most commonly used medicines in homeopathy, introduced by the founder of homeopathy Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, MD. There are over 2000 possible indicating symptoms for Natrum Muriaticum.

That means the medicines are capable of inducing the healing process in any kind of disease. Every patient requiring a particular remedy will not have all the indications of the remedy. Again, every remedy may not cover all the symptoms of the patient. The selection of the remedy is made by the attending physician when he or she looks at the case as a whole.

The sensation of heat in the affected parts is also a key indication. This medicine is very strong in action. Only a few doses; too; under professional care, may need to be administered. Self-prescribing could be harmful. Thuja Occidentalis: This is a drug prepared from the plant Thuja occidentalis commonly known as Arbor Vitae.

These patients are better in dry weather and worse in a humid climate and damp Sepia: It is the beauty of homeopathy that it can use a wide range of natural sources ranging from plants and their products, minerals and compounds, and even animal products for its medicines. Sepia is one such example of medicine prepared from the inky juice of Cuttlefish. The latent medicinal power of this juice is aroused by means of homeopathic potentization. Sepia is one of the greatest contributions made to Homeopathy Materia Medica by the founder of homeopathy, Dr. Hahnemann. So it goes without saying that this medicine is as old as homeopathy itself and is one of the favourite medicines of Homeopaths world over. Before elaborating on the indications of this remedy I would like to share with you its birth story. Dr. Hahnemann got the clue to initiate proving of this remedy from a patient, who was an artist and had a regular habit of wetting his brush containing Indian ink with his own saliva. Every time he did so, a very small portion of the ink would naturally find its way into the stomach to be absorbed by the system. By and by, he developed certain chronic ailments. Hahnemann treated him with all the known similimums to the best of skills and ability but without any appreciable benefit. Excepting that his habit of wetting his brush with his own saliva and consequent affection of the ink, would have been the maintaining cause, the artist was advised to discontinue his profession. The artist obeyed him and he was completely redeemed of all his chronic ailments. This unique pleasant experience ultimately led Dr. Hahnemann to prove sepia for the benefit of generations of mankind. Sepia, in the true sense, is called a polychrest remedy as it has a broad spectrum of action, useful for a wide range of disease processes. There are thousands of indications enlisted in our Materia Medica about the effectiveness of Sepia. To enumerate them briefly: Sepia positively influences female genital organs, digestive system, liver, skin, glands, lungs, and nerves. It is one of the most commonly used medicines for Arthritis of all types (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing asthma, urinary tract infection. It is one of the best medicines for all possible gynecological and pregnancy-related complaints. The mental personality of a patient requiring sepia is more or less as follows: Sepia is indicated for individuals who feel a lack of interest and concern about their family members and friends, whom they loved once best. This stage comes from their mental or physical overexertion and fatigue. They usually have a sad, depressed mood. Even while narrating their complaints they tend to weep. However, they feel annoyed when somebody consoles and sympathizes with them. They don't like much of the company and feel irritated about small affairs. They cannot bear disagreement with their opinion and decision. They feel mentally tired and do not feel like working. They are anxious individuals, constantly worrying about their health and imaginary problems. It may be noted that homeopathic medicines are a largely broad spectrum. That means the medicines are capable of inducing the healing process in any kind of disease. Every patient requiring a particular remedy will not have all the indications of the remedy. Again, every remedy will not have all the symptoms of the patient. The attending physician makes the selection of the remedy when he or she looks at the case as a whole. Silica: It is one of the splendid acts of homeopathy that substances labelled as inert can also be used effectively to treat a large variety of disorders. Silica is an example of one such substance, which is chemically inert in its natural form, but after undergoing the process of potentization it gets transformed into a wonderful, deep-acting remedy. Silica is in a true sense called as polychrest remedy as it has a broad spectrum of action, useful for a wide range of disease processes. In fact, this remedy has helped Homeopaths the world over to treat so-called surgical conditions gently without requiring a knife. Silica positively influences bones and joints, mucous membranes, skin, cellular tissue, nerves, glands, lungs, the digestive system, etc. Silica is a frequently used medicine for complaints of asthmatic bronchitis, joint diseases, Psoriatic of nails, tonsillitis, etc. Patients requiring silica usually have a tendency to easily suppuration of skin injuries. Silica positively influences nutrition as well and hence it's one of the prominent remedies used for rickets in children. "}
