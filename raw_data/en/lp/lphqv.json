This vulnerable population includes, among others, people who have a weakened immune system and may not generate adequate protection from vaccination, such as those who are immunocompromised. Leveraging state-of-the-art viral surveillance, predictive modeling, and advanced antibody engineering techniques, we are taking a platform-based approach to the continuous discovery and optimization of monoclonal antibody candidates designed to protect the vulnerable from serious viral threats. We are generating a robust pipeline of monoclonal antibody candidates, which could be used in prevention or treatment of serious viral diseases, starting with COVID-19 and expanding into influenza and other high-need indications. Our lead candidate, VYD222, is in development for the prevention of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised people. This vulnerable population includes many different groups, such as people fighting cancer, organ transplant recipients, and people taking immunosuppressive drugs to treat autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. We are united by a shared commitment to protecting the most vulnerable people in our communities from today's and tomorrow's serious viral threats. To keep pace with viral evolution, we have created a culture that embraces change, nimble decision making, and the relentless pursuit of our mission. "}
