However, most effective vaccines require several booster shots, and it is challenging to generate potent responses against small molecules and synthetic peptide anti gens often used to increase target specificity and improve vaccine stability. As continuous antigen uptake and processing by APCs and persistent toll -like receptor (TLR) priming have been shown to amplify antigen specific humoral immunity, we explored whet her a single injection of a mesoporous silica micro -rod (MSR) vaccine containing synthetic molecules and peptides can effectively generate potent and durable antigen -specific humoral immunity. A single injection of the MSR vaccine against a gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) decapeptide elicited highly potent anti -GnRH response that lasted for over 12 months. The MSR vaccine generated higher titers than bolus or alhydrogel alum vaccine formulations. Moreover, a MSR vaccine directed against a Her2/neu pe ptide within the Trastuzumab binding domain showed immunoreactivity to native Her2 protein on tumor cell surface and, when directed against nicotine, generated long -term anti -nicotine antibodies. Mechanistically, we found that the MSR vaccine induced persi stent germinal center (GC) B -cell activity for more than 3 weeks after a single injection, generation of memory B cells, and that at least 7 days of immunostimulation by the vaccine was required to generate an effective humoral response. Together, these da ta suggest that the MSR vaccine represents a promising technology .

Introduction Immunotherapies are rapidly becoming a standard approach for cancer and chronic infectious disease treatment [1]. Vaccines can induce strong protective and therapeutic responses against many forms of live and attenuated virus, toxoids, irradiated autologous tumor cells and protein subunits. However, most effective vaccines require several boosts after the primary immunization [2]. These dosing regimens are costly, inc rease hospital/clinic visitation for patients and are especially challenging in regions where limited healthcare access poses a major logistical barrier to disease treatment and management [2,3]. An effective single -shot vaccine could overcome these limitations. Most approaches for single -shot vaccines i n clinical testing to date have used depots of antigens that were released in a controlled manner for months after immunization [2,4-6]. However, passive diffusion of the antigen and adjuvant to the lymph nodes alone is l ikely unable to maximally and rapidly stimulate immune cells and provide life -long benefit. Indeed, besides B- cell stimulation by antigen , humoral responses development requires a complex immune cascade involving antigen -presenting cells (APC) activation, subsequent T -helper cell generation and finally cognate T -cell/B -cell interactions . However, t hese steps that occur in parallel during infection are not easily recapitulated by current vaccine technolog ies. Therefore, achieving a .

Small molecules and peptides have many potential advantages as antigens but generating potent responses is challenging. The use of small antigens in vaccine can help focus the immune response with high epitope specificity and biological activity while avoiding off -target effects. For instance, a synthetic peptide vaccine against subtypes of influenza using Keyh ole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a carrier protein generated anti -hemagglutinin antibodies and neutralizing activity [7]. Peptides can be particularly advantageous for vaccine development as they can be chemically synthesized quickly and with low variability. Their production can be easily up -scaled and they have good safety and stability [8]. In contrast to the time and cost -intensive approaches that require the production of recombinant protein, attenuated virus or cancer cell culture, synthetic peptides can expedite the manufacturing of personalized cancer vaccines and ensure the timely development of vaccines against new pandemics [9-11]. Peptides are also readily presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to induce subsequent effector T cell and humoral responses. However, synthetic peptide vaccines generally cannot confer long -lived, therapeutic benefit. This limitation is likely cau sed by a combination of 1) short peptide half -life due to rapid systemic clearance, 2) weak immunogenicity due to lack of a co -stimulatory signal and either absent or .

An example of a n attractive target for vaccination is gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide hypothalamic hormone that and female estrogen and follicular development [14]. GnRH determines both fertility and sexual behavior and is highly conserved among mammals. GnRH activity has also been implicated in the progression of several types of malignancies including prostate, breast and ovarian cancers [15-17]. Blocking GnRH activity using androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs) and gene therapy have shown pre - clinical promise, but such therapies have s trong toxic side effects and lack long term potency [12,16 ]. Active immunizations against GnRH using various carrier proteins such as KLH, ovalbumin (OVA) and diphtheria toxoid (DT) have been shown to decrease sexual organ function, reduce testosterone levels in pat ients with advanced prostate cancer and reduce reproductive capability in feral animals as a humane alternative to surgical desexing [16-18,20 ]. However, these vaccines require multiple immunizations and the effects are variable and not potent enough to produce long -term immune -castration [21]. Here we propose a single injection vaccine platform using a mesoporous silica micro -rod (MSR) vaccine system to generate high antibody titers against synthetic peptide and other small antigens. Biomaterials have shown substantial potential to integrate with conventional vaccine .

In particular, biomaterial scaffold vaccines have been demonstrated to locally recruit and program host antigen presenting cells (APCs) to induce effective innate and adaptive immunity [25,26 ]. Using this approach, an implantable poly(lactide - co-glycolide) (PLGA) based scaffold cancer vaccine was shown to induce complete melanoma regression in subsets of mice [27]. To eliminate the need for surgical implantation, we recently developed a new approach of injectable scaffolds using mesoporous silica rods ( [28,29 ]. We demonstrated that MSR micro particles could spontaneously assemble into a 3D scaffold after subcutaneous injection; the m acropores formed by random particle stacking allowed for cell infiltration and active cell -scaffold interactions. The controlled release of GM -CSF and CpG from the MSR vaccine modulated host APC infiltration into the vaccine and, consequently, continuousl y programmed host APCs. Continuous antigen uptake and processing by APCs and persistent toll -like receptor (TLR) priming have been shown to amplify antigen specific humoral immunity. Overall, we reasoned that concomitant release of antigen from MSR scaffold and local APC activation could enable continuous B -cell activation in the lymph node and enhance cognate T -helper cell prim ing (Figure 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that a single injection of the MSR vaccine could generate rob ust and long -lasting humoral immunity and enhance the response compared to traditional vaccine approaches.

Single injection vaccine with GnRH peptide conjugated to OVA (GnRH -OVA) induced higher and more durable anti -GnRH humoral response compared to bolus vaccines. To evaluate whether a CD4 helper T cell epitope was necessary to generate an anti -GnRH response, we incorporated either free GnRH peptide or GnRH peptide conjugated to the carrier protein ovalbumin (OVA) into the MSR vaccine. MSR vaccines were formulated to contain 1 \u00b5g GM-CSF and 100 \u00b5g CpG -ODN, as previously described, and either 100 \u00b5g free G nRH or 100 using spectrometry (Figure The loading efficiencies of free GnRH and GnRH -OVA onto the MSRs were 91 + 2% and 85 + 1%, respectively (Figure S2). Vaccines were injected into the subcutaneous tissue of mice, and antibody titers were subsequently measured using ELISA. Strikingly, a single immunization with the MSR vaccine containing GnRH -OVA elicited strong titers of IgG1 (Figure 2b) and IgG2a (Figure 2c) serum antibody for over 12 months. In comparison, immunization with MSRs loaded with unconjugated GnRH did not elicit detectable anti -GnRH titer. To confirm the serum anti -GnRH antibody recognized the .

Finally, to confirm that the anti - GnRH antibody response was specific to the MSR GnRH -OVA vaccine, we immunized mice with MSR 200\u00b5g OVA (MSR OVA). Serum from animals vaccinate d with the MSR OVA vaccine did not elicit any detectable anti -GnRH IgG1 (Figure S3b) or IgG2a (Figure S3c) titers. We next investigated whether the MSR vaccine can elicit higher antibody titers compared to traditional bolus immunizations (Figure 2d). Mice were again immunized with a single injection of the MSR vaccine loaded with 1 \u00b5g GM-CSF, 100 and 100 \u00b5g GnRH conjugated to 200\u00b5g OVA or a single injection of a bolus vaccine containing 1 \u00b5g GM-CSF, 100 100 Bolus Vax) (Figure 2d). The MSR vaccine anti -GnRH IgG1 (Figure 2e) and IgG2a (Figure 2f) antibody titers compared to the bolus vaccine. The effect was also durable, lasting for at least 100 days post immuni zation. Impressively, the MSR vaccine induced rapid onset of antibody production. On day 14, the titer elicited by the MSR vaccine was 35 fold and 80 fold higher than that elicited by the bolus vaccine for IgG2a International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Using GnRH -KLH conjugate as the antigen, MSR again significantly enhanced the total serum anti -GnRH IgG response compared to a bolus KLH -GnRH vaccine (Fig ure 2g). At the peak of the response, the titer elicited by the MSR vaccine was nearly 10 fold higher than that elicited by the bolus vaccine. 2.2 Single injection of MSR vaccine induced persistent Germinal Center (GC) activity . A strong humoral response depends on activated B cells forming GCs in secondary lymphoid organs, where they further undergo somatic hypermutation and isotype switching, and eventually differentiate into plasma cells that can rapidly produce antibodies upon secondary encounter with the antigen [31]. Therefore, we investigated whether a single injection of the MSR GnRH -OVA vaccine can stimulate enhanced GC formation compared to the conventional bolus vaccination. The MSR GnRH -OVA vaccine induced a prolonged immune response, as indicated by the increased total cell number in the dLN from 7 days to 25 days after immunization (Figure 3a). In contrast, although the bolus GnRH -OVA vaccine enhanced dLN cell number on day 7, the response rapidly dissipated. Next, the percentage and total cell numbe r of GC B cells in the dLN were quantified using the markers B220+GL7+ (Figure 3b and 3c) and B220+GL7+PNA+ (Figure .

By day 7 after immunization, both the MSR vaccine and the bolus vaccine led to an enhanced GC response. Notably, the enhanced GC response in the MSR vaccinated animals persisted until after day 25. The number of GC B cells in t he MSR vaccinated mice was approximately 10 fold higher than those in the bolus vaccine treated mice on days 14 and 25. In contrast, the GC response in the bolus vaccinated animals sharply dissipated after 7 days. These findings were further supported by immunofluorescence staining of GC B cells in the dLNs over time (Figure 3d). 2.3 Single injection of MSR vaccine improves memory B -cell generation . Efficient prophylactic vaccination requires the induction of long -term immunological memory to protect ag ainst pathogen encounter at a later time. Memory B -cells generated by vaccination can persist for years and be reactivated upon antigen encounter to produce rapid antibody responses [31]. Therefore, we compared the capacity of bolus and MSR -based vaccines to induce such responses. To detect the rare memory B -cells generated by the vaccine, we use d fluorescent protein phycoerythrin (PE) as both the antigen and the detection reagent (Figure 4a) [32]. 10-12 weeks after immunization, several weeks after all vaccine components had cleared (Figure 4b), cells from the draining lymph node (dLN), spleen and bone marrow were stained with PE, enriched for PE -binding cells using anti -PE B -cells were .

By contrast, bolus immunization did not provide a significant boost in antigen -specific B -cells compared to the na\u00efve baseline. No differences were observed in the bone marrow for any of the groups (Figure 4c). Overall, this data illustrates that MSR vaccine can enhance memory B -cell generation compared to traditional bolus vaccination. 2.4 MSR scaffold persistence and cell -recruitment is required for robust humoral response generation To begin to investigate how the dynamics of immune cell recruitment and antigen availability impacted on the humoral response generated by MSR scaffolds, we determined the kinetics of antigen presentation and cellular infiltration in GnRH -OVA MSR vaccines. Following subcutaneous injection, the vaccine formed a dynamic nodule which peaked in size on day 7 and slowly degraded over the next several weeks. Scaffolds were undetectable 45 days after injection (Figure 5a). MSR scaffolds released antigen slowly with 27 \u00b1 3% of the GnRH -OVA cargo desorbing in the first 1 2 hours followed by minimal release (10 \u00b1 1% of total load) over 25 days in vitro (Figure 5b). To track antigen in scaffolds in vivo , we immunized mice with MSR -OVA as the antigen (MSR -OVA*) and imaged the vaccine site 7, 14 .

OVA* fluorescence was detected at all timepoints , with scaffold area decreasing after day 7, confirming scaffold dynamics and the persistence of antigen for up to 30 days (Figure 5c). Next, the kinetics of cell recruitment by the MSR GnRH -OVA vaccines was quantified. The MSR vaccine has been engineered to recruit and activate host immune cells by incorporating and releasing GM -CSF and CpG -ODN [28]. Consistent with our previous work, host immune cells were shown to infiltrate the MSR scaffold in a time dependent manner, peaking at day 7 (Figure 5d). CD11c+CD11b+ DCs were detectable at day 1 post immunization, their percentage peaked at day 3 and dropped sharply at day 5, followed by a secondary increase from day 7 to day 14 (Figure 5e). Recruited DCs were activated by the released CpG -ODN, as indicated by a high er percentage of CD11c+CD86+ DCs on day 3 after immunization (Figure 5f). The percentage of activated DCs dropped from day 3 to day 5, likely due to their homing to the draining lymph node (dLN). The percentage of activated DCs in the scaffold remained low from day 5 to day 14. Together, these data suggest the MSR GnRH -OVA vaccine induces rapid DC infiltration, activation and exfiltration, and serves as a site of sustained antigen presentation that may program immune cells for extended periods. To inves tigate the relationship between the infiltrated immune cells and the anti -GnRH titer, the MSR vaccines were explanted at days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 15 after immunization (Figure 6a). .

Vaccines that were explanted on day 5 led to detectable amounts of IgG1 titer on day 14 and 20, but the response was transient and no titers were detected from this condition after 20 days. In contras t, a vaccination duration of 7 days or greater led to prolonged anti-GnRH IgG1 (Figure 6d) and IgG2a (Figure 6e) titers. Vaccines that were explanted on day 7 resulted in a significantly slower onset of titer production compared to vaccines that were explanted on day 15 and those that were not explanted. There was no difference in titer levels between vaccines that were explanted on day 15 and those that were not explanted. Together, this data suggest that vaccine duration of 15 days is necessary to gener ate both rapid onset and durable high anti -GnRH titers. To further probe the importance of cell recruitment for antibody generation, we created MSR vaccines with diminished cell recruitment capabilities. We previously reported that the compression of MSR scaffolds into a tablet (Monolith) decreased cell infiltration by reducing the 3D space available for immune cell infiltration [28]. In addition, we encapsulated MSR solution into a nanoporo us alginate hydrogel (MSR -Alginate) to prevent cell ingress (Figure 7a). When the .

To demonstrate the broader potential of MSR vaccines, we tested their capacity to generate antibodies against different small molecule and linear peptide antigens (Figure 8a). Besides protein -derived antigens, there is broad interest in eliciting neutralizing antibodies against small molecules such as toxins or psychoactive substances to nullify their action [33,34 ]. For example, vaccination has been investigated to produce antibodies that bind nicotine in the bloodstream to reduce the rewarding effect of tobacco and assist in smoking cessation [33,35 ]. A single injection of MSR vaccines containing OVA -conjugated nicotine could induce high titers of anti -nicotine IgG, which remained elevated 6 months post injection (Figure 8b). Vaccines that generate antibody responses using carrier proteins may require cumbersome recombinant protein production and chemical conjugation processes, which can be costly, lead to batch -to-batch variability, and elicit off -target antibody responses against other T and B cell epitopes on the carrier protein itself [36]. To circumvent this issue, we designed peptide constructs that incorporate a promiscuous T -helper cell epitope derived from mea sles virus fusion protein .

In a first example, we targeted the oncogenic protein HER2/neu, a surface receptor that has been successfully targeted by monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Her2+ breast and gastric cancer [37]. To specifically induce therapeutic antibodi es, we used Her2 613-626 as the B -cell epitope, as it is within the portion of the protein bound by trastuzumab (Herceptin), a clinically approved monoclonal antibody that antagonizes the function of the Her2 receptor. Compared to a bolus, the MSR vaccine s ignificantly enhanced both the IgG1 and IgG2a titer generated against Her2 protein (Figure 8b). Moreover, serum IgG from MSR mice could bind to the Her2+ SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell line but not to CT26 Her2 - cells. In contrast, serum from a bolus vaccine showed no detectab le binding to Her2 - expressing cancer cells (Figure 8d -e). Finally, we investigated the anti -GnRH response generated against a synthetic MVF GnRH peptide antigen, comparing our MSR vaccine and MVF GnRH formu lated in the gold standard adjuvant Alum. In both cases, the total IgG titer induced by the MSR was on average an order of magnitude higher following a single injection (Figure 8f and g). Overall, this .

Discussion The findings of this study demonstrate that a single injection of the MSR vaccine elicits potent and durable serum antibody titers against small antigens, including small molecules and short peptides . Both peptide -carrier protein constructs (e.g. GnRH and MVF Her2) demonstrated that the MSR vaccine induced more potent and durable humoral responses than traditional vaccinations . Notably, the MSR GnRH -OVA vaccine generated high anti -GnRH titers even 12 months after vaccination. Although carrier proteins can significantly increase immune responses against a peptide, this approach has several limitations. First, chemical coupling of specific residues on the carrier protein and the peptide can be diffi cult to control, and may lead to variability in vaccine response [38]. Second, because the carrier protein contains multiple antigenic epitopes, there is likely skewed clonal dominance of carrier -specific B cell responses [36,39 ]. For these reasons, tandem peptide constructs containing a single CD4 T -helper epitope and the target peptide were also explored. The MSR MVF GnRH vaccine produced 10 -20 fold highe r antibody titers compared to the bolus formulations, and MSR vaccination led to faster antibody production and overall higher response .

Incorporating the antigen into the MSR scaffold likely resulted in m ultivalent display of the antigen on the MSR pores and surface, which may facilitate BCR crosslinking and enhance B cell activation for stronger humoral responses. The MSR vaccine generated antibodies against a portion of the Her2 epitope that exhibited immunoreactivity to the native Her2 structure on a tumor cell surface. While Trastuzumab can inhibit tumor growth, mAb therapy lacks long -term efficacy due to the limited half -life time of the immunoglobulins, and repeated administration of the mAb resul ts in many side effects [40-42]. It has been demonstrated that Trastuzumab binds to the portion of the Her2 extracellular domain spanning between residues 563 -626 that contains three loops [43]. Previous studies identified a number of peptides that mimic portions of the Her2 domain at the Her2/Trastuzumab interface [44- 46]. Repeated vaccination using these peptides led to antibodies that could recognize Her2/neu displayed on a cell surface and induced Her2 internalization in a similar manner as Trastuzumab. Here we chose a short and linear peptide Her2 613-626 to evaluate the robustness of the MSR vaccine. Other studies using the same peptide construct showed that multiple vaccinations were required to raise high titers [46]. In comparison, a single injection of the MSR vaccine was able to induce antibody titers up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the bolus vaccine. In particular, the antibodies recognized Her2 displayed on human breast tumor cells, whereas the antibodies produced by the bolus vaccine did not show any significant binding.

Therefore, future studies should explore various cyclic peptides mimicking the Her2 loop to confer antibody specificity, and evaluate the anti -tumor efficacy. Overall, these data suggest that the MSR vaccine can likely promote continuous in situ antibody production, generate focused and robust humoral anti -tumor immunity and form long -term immunological memory. The relationship between MSR vaccine duration and the kinetics and maintenance of the humoral response suggests the importance of prolonged DC programming in the MSR vaccine. The DC profile in the MSR vaccine showed two distinct waves; the first one peaked on day 3 and rapidly diminished by day 5, and the second initiated after day 7. The first wave of DCs was likely due to recruitment mediated by release of GM -CSF. The residence of these DCs in the v accine was transient, likely due to activation by the released CpG -ODN and homing to the dLN. The second wave of DCs was possibly a result of cytokines and chemokines secreted by the first wave of DCs and other immune cells. Interestingly, the first wave of DCs exhibited an activated phenotype, while the DCs in the second wave were mostly immature. Explanting the MSR vaccine between day 1 and day 5, before the first wave of DCs could be accumulated and subsequently home to the dLNs, resulted in no signif icant humoral response. When the vaccine was explanted after day 7, the vaccine effectively generated and maintained potent humoral responses over 100 .

Studies have shown that prolonged durations of vaccination (> 16 days) using engineered biomateria l scaffold vaccines significantly augmented persistent CTL responses locally and slowed tumor progression [47]. Here, we showed that vaccine duration was also important in humoral responses. Explanting the scaffolds not only impacts local APC activation by MSR but also suppresses antigen delivery to draining lymph nodes. However, when the capacity of the MSR scaffold for cell infiltration was reduced ( using MSR monolith or alginate encapsulation) and antigen presence maintain ed, the antibody was also partially diminished . This data suggest that the high antibody titer generated by MSR are, in part, generated by APC recruitment and trafficking through the scaffolds. The enhanced humoral responses generated by the MSR vaccine correlated strongly with persistent GC activity. After encountering an antigen, activated B cells form GCs where they switch their immunoglobulin constant region from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE, and undergo somatic hypermutation in the variable region to produce antibodies with high specificity and avidity [32]. A number of biomaterial -based vaccine systems have been shown to stimulat e persistent GC activity. For instance, poly(lactic -co-glycolic superior GC compa red to bolus formulations on day 14 [48,49 ]. However, these strategies required multiple injections to achieve this effect.

Specialized B cells that emerge from the GC secrete high affinity an tibodies and can also differentiate into long-lived plasma and memory cells, which are necessary to generate life -long antibody production and rapid immune r e-activat ion upon antigen re -encounter , respectively[31]. Consistent with the sustained GC responses , MSR vaccines generated long-term antibody production and higher numbers of memory B -cells than their bolus counterparts . Overall, this data illustrates to the potential of the MSR vaccines to generate both therapeutic and prophylactic antibody responses. The duration of the GC activity after immunization with the MSR vaccine also correlated with the amount of time the MSR vaccine remained visible at the injection site. Future studies could explore how varying MSR vaccine degradation kinetics impacts GC activity and antibody production . In addition, the kinetics of antigen presentation after vaccination with the MSR system could likely be further optimized, as recent studies have demonstrated a dramatic impact of the antigen presentation profile on the immune response [50,51 ]. The role of persistent antigen presentation by different subtypes of APCs is also an important topic for further study. 4. Conclusion The findings of these studies suggest the MSR vaccine may have high utility as a single - injection platform to generate potent humoral responses. We demonstrated that MSR vaccine s .

Different subunits antigens were and can easily be swapped using the MSR system, which could therefore have significant impact in other areas, such as chronic bacteria or viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases. Compared to conventional vaccination strategies, MSR scaffolds improved the magnitude of antibody response , boosted GC persistence, and increased memory B -cell generation , all desirable features of efficient immunization schemes. The magnitude of the humor al response generated was dependent on scaffold persistence and local cell recruitment , which co uld be further modulated to refine MSR vaccine s. These findings have broader implication s for our understanding of current vaccine s and the de sign of new vaccine technologies . 5. Experimental Section Peptides and proteins .

Mesoporous Silica Rods vaccines for humoral response generation Mesoporous Silica loaded with GM -CSF, CpG -ODN and subunit antigens are injected subcutaneously to form a 3D immunomodulating scaffold to produce antibodies against small antigen targets. MSR scaffold serves two purposes (1) as a long -term depot for sustained antigen release and presentation to B -cells in the draining lymph node. (2) as a local niche for dendriti c cell (DC) recruitment where they pick up antigen and get activated by TLR -9 agonist CpG. Mature DCs can migrate to the lymph node where they prime antigen -specific T -cells that support the development of the humoral response. .
