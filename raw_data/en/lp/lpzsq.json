Acupuncture, defined as the insertion of needles into specific points on the body to cause a desired healing effect, is used all over the world, either by itself or in conjunction with Western medicine, to treat a wide variety of maladies in every species of domestic and exotic animals. Acupuncture can assist the body to heal itself by affecting certain physiological changes. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves, increase blood circulation, relieve muscle spasms, and cause the release of hormones, such as endorphins (one of the body's pain control chemicals) and cortisol (a natural steroid). We would be pleased to discuss whether your dog or cat would benefit from acupuncture. Please give us a call to arrange an appointment. Additional Information Concerning Veterinary Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the safest forms of treatment for animals when it is administered by a professionally trained veterinarian. Side effects of acupuncture are rare, but they do exist. Your pet's condition might seem worse for up to 48 hours after a treatment. Other animals might become sleepy or lethargic for 24 hours after acupuncture. These effects are an indication that some physiological changes are developing, and they are most often followed by an improvement in your pet's condition. Like humans, most dogs and cats feel very relaxed simply because of the release of endorphins soon after the first acupuncture needle is inserted. They may experience a moment of sensitivity as the needle penetrates the skin in certain sensitive areas. Once the needles are in place, however, most animals relax and will often fall asleep during treatment. Some pets with high levels of anxiety or fear might take longer to reach a relaxed state, but they will often become more relaxed with subsequent treatments. "}
