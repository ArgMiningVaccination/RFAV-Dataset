One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Alternative Medicine Program: The Power of a Journey Jomiryz Thomas Everglades University Abstract Upon entering the Alternative Medicine degree program at Everglades University I did not know what I was going to do with the degree. I did know, however, that I wanted to understand the concepts of alternative healing methods better because I had just experienced the death of my grandfather from a diabetic induced disease while I had stood idly by\u2014with nothing I could do to help. I also understood that I wanted to learn more about the subject that I had become quite passionate about through my own 100-pound weight loss journey\u2014nutrition. Little did I know that this decision would not only further spark my passion, but Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be characterized as a gathering of restorative, human services, and healing systems other than those incorporated into health care in the United States. CAM incorporates the perspectives, speculations, modalities, items, and practices connected with these systems and their utilization to treat disease and advance health and prosperity (McKenzie, 2012). Even though heterogeneous, the significant CAM frameworks have numerous normal attributes, including an attention on individualizing medications, treating the entire individual, advancing self-consideration and self-recuperating, and perceiving the otherworldly way of every person. What's more, numerous CAM frameworks have attributes generally found in standard human services, for example, an emphasis on great sustenance and preventive practices. Dissimilar to standard medication, CAM frequently needs or has just restricted trial and clinical concentrate; then again, experimental examination of CAM is starting to address this learning crevice. In this manner, limits in the With the huge diversity and changeability of human biology, it is impossible to imagine a reality without some mutations, changes, or issues in the organs and tissues of humans. Thus, it rightly follows that medications and pharmaceuticals have been created in an effort to counteract the various ailments and illnesses that people can experience. However, as time has gone on and these pharmaceuticals have become more and more high-tech, regulated, and trusted, they have also become incredibly commercialized. Worse still, medications have become incredibly expensive and can be unattainable for some people. Although not everything is bad about prescribed medication. There are some positive effects to go with taking prescribed medication. One of them is that when you take physician endorsed medications, they can frequently be the response forever undermining conditions including hypertension, elevated cholesterol or much malignancy. These medications fortify and imitate a well-working body, so there are various individuals whose lives are spared every day on account of doctor prescribed medications. Without them, they would have a lower personal satisfaction and even hazard demise. Not all medications are utilized to treat genuine illnesses. Some treat little illnesses every once in a while with extraordinary achievement. Anti-toxins for diseases, Through the enthusiasm of alternative medicine by patients, the health and social care sector comes across to:\" ethical issues of efficacy, training, competence and patient safety, \"according to (Nursing times ,2005). Therefore, it is important to understand the principles behind complementary therapies and their usage. Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. The first reason for supporting alternative medicine is because it's effective. In fact, Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for more than 5,000 years with proof of its effectiveness (Sutton, 2010, 95). In addition, TCM has punch of methods for treating patient's widely such as herbs and other (Sutton, 2010, 94-95). That means alternative medicine has proved its worth and won people's respect. Introduction In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in complementary medicine, and indeed alternative medicine (Lee-Treweek 2002, Andrews 2004, Barry 2006). Moreover the number of professionally trained therapist and practitioners has increased giving the patient/client a better choice and at more competitive rates (Smallwood, 2005). People need to realize that going against basic treatment is not always a bad thing. Not using synthetic drugs for treatment is a smart and healthy choice. There are certain stigmas related to natural medicine, but being aware of the benefits may result in more people believing in these resources. People have been using herbal medicines and plants long before synthetic medicine was designed. Alternative Medicine Therapies Alternative remedies, sometimes known as complementary remedies, offer a wide variety of products and methods in improving well-being separate from contemporary medicinal practices. According to Alternative Medicine Although \"Alternative\" or \"Complementary\" medicine has been kept on the fringes of the medical sciences in the past, it is becoming increasingly more popular, and more reputable. Alternative medicines are those medical systems which are not taught to or practiced by most conventional medical doctors. Alternative medicines seemingly have always existed, changing and conforming to the current climate of society. There seems to be an almost endless number of alternative medicines, each with their own method of gaining perfect health. Often people who are dissatisfied with conventional medicine turn to alternative medicine for their medical needs. Many similarities link the diverse extremities of alternative medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
