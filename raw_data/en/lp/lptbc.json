(classen 2005, 2) Placing the Senses So, where has touch been within social theory and spatial scholarship all this time? Where is it now and where might it be placed in the future? What kinds of knowledges are produced, validated and employed in researching the spaces of touch and the places of touching in different social contexts? These are the central concerns of Touching Space, Placing Touch. Before focussing on those distinctive aspects of touch, let us first consider the troubled place of the senses in general. 'The [origin of all thoughts] is that which we sense, for there is no conception in Man's [sic] mind which hath not at first totally or in parts, been begotten upon the organs of sense', declares Thomas hobbes in the opening chapter of his celebrated 1651 work of political philosophy Leviathan (1962, 21). his formulation evokes a deep, pervasive channel running throughout Western philosophy, from pre-Socratic thinking, through enlightenment debates around rationalism and empiricism, right up to contemporary poststructuralist concerns, in considering grounds for the relationship between sensory experiences and the formulation of more complex knowledge and ideas. Hobbes' reasoning involves building from first principles, beginning by understanding the most immediate and seemingly straightforward components of individual experience, sensation, and building from there into more complex social ideas. hobbes claimed we were subject to two types of phenomena, in his parlance 'sensation' and 'imagination' (thought). From this, hobbes formulates a more realistic hypothesis of a 'commonwealth' as the principle of a just social order constituted by an artificial collective of people. Starting from those most basic units of human experience, sensations and thoughts, a political philosophy of a fairer society is formed, connecting the individual sensorium to a larger social order. any accusation that sensory knowledge is trivial, ephemeral or 'merely' subjective therefore misses the point. John locke (1690) broadly agreed with hobbes' thesis, claiming that the entirety of human experience was derived from two sources, sensation and reflections. 'This great Source, of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly on our Senses, 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 1 7/13/2012 4:41:20 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 2 and derived by them to the understanding, i call Sensation' (locke 1975, 105). The assumption that the senses were the foundation of individual experience, an epistemology of corporeal objects rather than spiritual ideas, is a tenet of empiricism as opposed to the earlier rationalism of Descartes and others, but also consistent with earlier medieval philosophy. The broad and pervasive consensus throughout Western philosophy from Plato onwards is also exemplified by one of the founding fathers of Christianity, Saint Augustine, who also starts from 'first knowledge' of corporeal beings through the senses in order to attain higher knowledge of spiritual matters, more permanent knowledge 'towards god' (1950, 109). Such hierarchies of knowledge, with the preliminary nature of the senses, is clearly well established, despite the acknowledgement that 'first knowledge' of the body and senses is unreliable, susceptible to biases, and only a starting point on the much longer journey to 'higher knowledge' and apotheosis. This epistemological model is unmistakable and pervasive, illustrated and instantiated within literary tropes and high art alike. For example the famous renaissance painting The Allegory of Touch (Figure i.1), which harvey (2011, 393) declares represents 'the nexus between the body and its affective life (being emotionally \"touched\"), the medical and anatomical understanding of skin as both a bodily covering and a receptor of touch... and the mythological narratives about touch that undergird early modern culture'. Further illustrations include Peter Damian in the eleventh century, likening each of the senses to 'five vulnerable and poorly guarded gates of a city' (in J\u00fctte 2005, 77) The purpose of this historical synopsis is not to construct an all-encompassing argument or assert any grand narrative for the place of the senses in Western history, philosophy or cultural life. instead, we wish to make three substantive points. Firstly, to foreground and contest the historical pervasiveness of a model of thinking that tries to bypass the importance of immanent sensory knowledges in order to assert the superiority of 'higher' wisdom, or transcendent truths. Secondly, to contest any unitary or easily universalistic conception of 'place', 'sense' or 'touch' that such a template might assume, signalled by the diversity of topics and approaches within this edited collection. The contributors to Touching Space, Placing Touch derive their approaches from cultural geography, art history, psychotherapy, social theory, empirical fieldwork-based social science, and much else besides. The multiplicity of ways that 'sense', 'touch' and the diversity of 'places' wherein these are encountered, belies any such generalising assumption. Thirdly, and most significantly, we make the case that the primacy and living immediacy of sensory experience does not reside solely within the boundaries of the skin, somehow locked within discrete, disconnected bodies. This is why the historic narrative of hobbes' Leviathan is worth reprising. The senses are not equivalent to the tissues and cells of the sense organs themselves, nor reduced to nerves that connect to the brain. The cultural chronology of the formulation of a 'sensorium' necessitates that the senses are ineluctably social: felt individually, but also always shared intersubjectively. a sensorium is the sum of an organism's perception, the seat of sensation, and 'the subject's way of coordinating all the body's perceptual and proprioceptive signals as well as the changing sensory envelope of the self' (Jones 2007, 8). although physiologically 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 2 7/13/2012 4:41:20 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 3 located within an individual body, its operation is continually shifting and culturally variable. as hobbes and others have detailed, complex knowledges originate from the position that the sense modalities are a necessary prerequisite for experiences of embodied consciousness and are the principal source of contact with the world for corporeal beings. By implication, then, there are congruent slippages in that consciousness as a result of sensory impairments of any kind (say from processes of aging, illness or genetic inheritance), and humans are always open to experiencing the social and spatial world differently as a result. Yet often there remains a tendency to take the senses as given, or somehow superfluous or inconsequential, especially in social science scholarship. The senses are relegated to common sense or parcelled off as automatic biological function, unworthy of more detailed social exploration and nuanced explanation. While so central to the embodied experience of researcher and researched alike, there has been surprisingly little reflexivity about the role of the senses in the actual practice of doing research in the social sciences. as we shall see, in a post-embodiment scholarship alert to 'more-than representational' sensibilities in recent years, a renewed interest and concern with the senses, including touch, is beginning, part of a collective upsurge of research across several disciplines. an increased attention to touch and its modalities necessarily results in a widening array of attendant research questions. For example, should touch be researched as a unitary sense or modality? is touch straightforwardly cutaneous, a surface feeling upon the skin, and how far might it be related to other, less distinct, sensations within the body? 'Things are quite simple until a scientist comes along and complicates Figure I.1 The Allegory of Touch, painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens (Ca. 1617; oil on panel 65cm x 110 cm) Source: courtesy of Museo Madrid 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 3 7/13/2012 4:41:20 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 4 them', the biologist otto lowenstein (1966, 121) once declared, having conducted pioneering laboratory experiments on the pressure sensors in different animals in the 1950s and 1960s. The way that the senses of balance, movement and bodily orientation in space were constituted through sensing cells and organs distributed throughout the body of animals and humans alike, owes much to his research. another way of characterising such research was, as lowenstein (1966, 121) himself pithily put it, in converting 'common sense' to 'uncommon sense', yet with far-reaching and unforeseen implications. Within experimental biology and the near-contemporary field of Gibson's (e.g. 1968) ecological psychology, the role of detailed laboratory findings in challenging and contesting previously straightforward and long held philosophical assumptions about the sensory modalities, their neurological pathways and information channels was crucial. in a similar vein, an agenda for rethinking divisions between sensory modalities and for grasping how they have been historically, culturally and socially formed is increasingly a concern for current social science. We hope that Touching Space, Placing Touch contributes in its own way to this grander project, turning common sense into uncommon sense by questioning assumptions about the senses, their felt experience as immediate and/or unmediated, their interaction, their role in the perception of space, and the role of the social in the formation of a sensorium. as with lowenstein's characterisation, such assumptions had been largely unchallenged until recent social scientific scholarship came along to try to complicate them. The Place of Touch and a Renewed Interest the Body With the 'turn to the body' in social theory in previous decades and the so-called 'cultural turn' in human geography and anthropology, some claims have been made about a 'return to the senses' (cf. paterson 2008), marked by the rise of a transdisciplinary field known as 'sensory studies' that connects developments across a number of academic areas and methodological approaches, weaving historical, theoretical, and empirical study into something rich, relevant and potentially revealing (see http://sensorystudies.org for an ongoing database of scholars compiled by anthropologist David howes' team). if the senses have previously been largely the preserve of biology and experimental psychology, a 'sensory turn' across a number of fields in the humanities and social sciences can be identified which involves the examination or re-examination of the senses according to the conceptual specificities and methodological limitations of each discipline. Not an intellectual movement as such, it is more a collation of a series of parallel strands threaded through and interconnecting with much larger disciplinary histories, and we will examine the specific story of human geography in this regard below. The development of book series and new journals, including Senses & Society (founded by David howes in 2005), speak to the transdisciplinary potential of taking the senses seriously in the humanities and social sciences. 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 4 7/13/2012 4:41:20 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 5 Yet, while there is evident promise within a transdisciplinary 'sensory studies' the scope for original findings is, we believe, more questionable. This is because the weave between the theoretical complexity necessary to do justice to human senses, sensibilities and bodily dispositions is not often matched with the kinds of flexible and nuanced empirical approaches required to do them justice. Moreover, the role of the senses within academic research has not always been explicitly demarcated, nor the sole focus of study. Sensory experience has obviously been implicit, pervasive within research activities and therefore inherently present in some form or another, but rarely recorded or deemed worthy of analysis in itself. linked to this trend, if the late twentieth century interest in embodiment was characterised by thinking about the body as a site of signification for the politics of gender, or the production of meaning through adornment, inscription and so on, the early twenty-first century is seeing another blooming of interest in 'the body', this time as an explicit research tool. For, despite the vast quantity written about the body across academic disciplines in the 1980s and 1990s, very rarely was the body used intimately and reflexively as an actual instrument for 'doing' the research, as not simply the focus but the means through which social science investigation were conducted, something that geographers crang (2003) and longhurst et al. (2008 and 2009) have made a powerful case for. employing a cross-disciplinary approach in a post-embodiment context we can therefore identify a burgeoning area of work that addresses individual sensory experiences, yet which also remains conscious of the embeddedness of the senses in society, and in the spirit of hobbes, how a sensorium is historically formed and socially co-constituted. examples of some of the most compelling work include lisa law's (2001) article 'home cooking', whose ethnographic work amongst immigrant Filipino workers in hong kong evoked the smells and tastes of their cooking as an integral component in reproducing 'home'. Yet it must still be broadly acknowledged that there is much to do, within specific disciplines, to better attend to such concerns and address a sensory lacuna in their historicity. Studies of visual culture and historical accounts of vision and socio-technical means of seeing have proliferated, most notably crary (1990 and 1999), Mitchell (2002) and Danius (2002), demonstrating that the scopic has enjoyed a disproportionate amount of research interest compared to the other sense modalities. By comparison touch remains under-explored, under-represented and marginal across these broad categories of research. nevertheless, an increasing amount of work is contesting this prioritisation of the visual, what Martin Jay in Downcast Eyes (1994) famously called 'ocularcentrism', or reconsiders the visual in relation to other modalities through renewed approaches to art history, film studies, literary studies, or traditional aesthetics for example. re-examining the visual's relationship with the non-visual has been a concern within art history, architecture and cultural geography (e.g. harvey's 2003, 2011 work on touch in art history; pallasmaa's architectural theory, 2005; the \"more-than visual\" approach to the built environment of paterson, 2010), thereby contributing perspectives that enfold visual and non-visual cultures. In anthropology the move to consider the embodied nature of fieldwork has already 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 5 7/13/2012 4:41:20 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 6 brought valuable attention to the non-visual modalities, such as the ethnographic monographs of Stoller (1997), howes (2003) and geurts (2002). While in sports science, Sparkes (2009) and hockey (2006) for example are similarly connecting anthropology and psychology literature and attending to the more explicitly somatic processes involved in physical activity. By examining their disciplinary histories in parallel ways, establishing a corrective to a previously visual bias, or attempting to reconsider the relationship between the visual and the non-visual, a considerable amount of cross-pollination is taking place across academic fields which, in some cases, is reinvigorating existing debates. For example, in film studies the idea of haptic cinema has a hold, thanks in part to phenomenologically-inflected contributions from Sobchack (2004) and Marks (2002). Where technologies are involved, such as medicine or computer mediated communications, a shift in those relations may be considerable. The Places of Touch in Geographical Scholarship Where, then, is the place of touch? until recently, social science research that dealt specifically with touch and tactility was thin on the ground. Moreover, given the deep importance of touch in all aspects of spatial experience, the tactile senses have been surprisingly poorly researched by human geography. it is evident that geographers have quite simply and literally been out of touch. There are many reasons why touch is an overlooked spatial practice. as suggested above, this neglect by geographers is part and parcel of orientations to the senses in general. The nature of touch is classified as immediate, obvious or trivial, yet it is hard to encode these intimate sensations and their subtle meanings into representational forms that prioritise text and the print medium, the usual means of outputting academic research. Furthermore it is an under-theorised sense in geography. perhaps, as rose (2003) has argued, the heart of the geographic enterprise is historically visual, originating from scientific cultures of detachment and observation during fieldwork. Furthermore, the processes of data collection and manipulation involved in giS (geographic information System) similarly works by abstracting data from the inevitably embodied processes of collecting and collating, representing it in primarily visual terms through digital cartography. given the return to the body in previous decades, the intermittent scholarly flirtations with phenomenology in sociology, anthropology and human geography in the 1980s, and the more recent upsurge of interest in the body as an instrument of research, whether through feminist programmes of research (e.g. longhurst et al 2008) or so-called non-representational theory, especially the more body-centric and experimental focus of edensor (2007), Mccormack (2008) or paterson (2009), this is surprising. Tracing the path of touch within human geography in particular it is largely through the uptake of reading across disciplines, for example the influential work of ecological psychologist gibson on the haptic system (1968), that rodaway writes a corresponding chapter on the haptic in Geographies (1994). 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 6 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 7 Meanwhile, a niche body of related research around visual impairment, cognitive mapping and navigation aligned some geography scholars, such as reginald golledge and his co-workers, with wider literatures on blindness and environmental psychology (e.g. golledge 1993). it takes another leap through the decades to see touch reappear, being loosely connected with the emergence of sensory studies within other disciplines, but also part of the ongoing operationalisation of somatocentric research. given both the historical origins of the geographic discipline as predominantly visual survey and cartographic display and the resurgence of interest on scholarship around the body in the 1990s it is curious that, firstly, relations between geographical scholarship, spatiality and touch remained under-explored, and secondly that rigorous attention to somatosensory experience in general was ignored for so long. While touch still remains marginal in geographical scholarship something is beginning to shift, connections between disciplinary fields interested in space and place are occurring, and particularly fertile transdisciplinary research programmes in health and well-being, in therapeutic spaces and landscapes (e.g. Bingley 2003, Butler and parr 1999), in the new performative spaces of the body and movement through landscape, sports and tourism (e.g. edensor 2006, Spinney 2006, Saville 2008) and elsewhere are coalescing to provide fertile ground for research in touch, haptics and the body to take root and flourish. The more recent interest within human geography with the affective aspects of everyday spaces and performance sometimes invites a specific focus on the sensual and the pre-cognitive (e.g. Thrift 2007). Much of this work moves beyond representational (visual and textual) readings of place and environmental interaction to an interpretative emphasis on emotive states and embodied practices. however, any so-called 'performative turn' in human geography has, we believe, so far underplayed the socio-cultural complexity that regulates touch in different places - the conventions of when, where and with whom one can touch. how are these conventions policed? To what degree are places of touch gendered, and how does age, culture or ability become associated with touch? To what degree do spatial contexts for activities matter (work places, retail space, domestic homes, etc.). Some of the new work presented in Touching Space, Placing Touch are speaking to this. As should be evident by now, and as reflected in the chapters brought together in Touching Space, Placing Touch, we are moving away from the seeming immediacy of an individualised cutaneous touch, moving simultaneously 'inwards' by complicating ideas of sensations throughout the dispersed body, but also 'outwards' between bodies and subjectivities. Touch is integral to every aspect of social action and its symbols and meanings deeply infuse all cultures. it is the most intimate spatial relationship between people, and a vital and subtle communicative practice. The places where people want to touch, are allowed to, obliged to, refuse to, or are forbidden to touch form a complex and delicately-patterned socio-spatial landscape that is negotiated largely subconsciously. children learn their place and where to touch and, importantly, not touch. Furthermore, people understand and organise the world through touch in differing ways. as classen (2005, 1) notes '[t]ouch is not 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 7 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 8 just a private act. it is a fundamental medium for the expression, experience and contestation of social values and hierarchies.' importantly, the role of touch is not universally positive. our project is no simple-minded call for more, or better, touching practices. The inequalities and unevenness of tactile experience materialise and are enacted within particular places, and are accordingly processed and read within those places. We believe there is much valuable work to be done in mapping the differentiated landscapes of touch in some detail, seeking to highlight varying patterns of tactile interactions within specific places and within the conduct of particularised spatial practices. The places of touch are inevitably and sometimes powerfully experientially differentiated, and status and social role unquestionably affects how we come into contact with the spaces brought into being. a strong example of this is the difference between being a nurse or patient in a hospital, involving professional touching (cf. andrieu et al. chapter in this volume). This offers up routes for those who want to modify space to effect progressive social change. as an illustration of this we cite the work of radical geographer William Bunge (1971) who sought to map the everyday experiential landscape of children in the Fitzgerald neighbourhood of Detroit, detailing, for example, how designated school playgrounds were haptically hostile and undesirable for children to play on. his analysis highlights the extent of jagged objects and sharp glass fragments on the playgrounds. he asks pointedly with respect to the ground-level view of a school playground displayed in Figure i.2: What is it that the human child in Fitzgerald actually touches? is this a suitable surface for human contact, or is it just cheap, easy to maintain, easy to drain? or is it deliberately inhuman so as to discourage after-school use? Would anyone want to picnic here? (Bunge 1971, 155) Empirical Research on the Spaces of Touch if, as already suggested, it remains impossible to presuppose any unitary conception either of 'place' or 'touch', any claims to 'know' either are indeterminate. consequently we believe it unwise to assume any consistency in how researchers engage with such concepts empirically, or to impose any artificial classification scheme. Thinking about method has, therefore, been an illuminating part of developing Touching Space, Placing Touch. The social sciences as a whole have woken up to the idea that 'place matters', in particular in terms of the metaphorical and psychological dimensions and experiences of place, as opposed to rooting our understanding of place in any concrete spatial framework. a diversity of methodological approaches has arisen in human geography as a result, with a growing appreciation for, and playfulness with, the situated research encounter (cf. hawkins 2011, Mackian 2010). in particular researchers have used storytelling, performance and visual ways of representing their empirical encounters (see, for example, latham 2003, laurier 1998, pearce 2008). 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 8 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 9 The nuanced socio-spatiality of tactile engagements, however, has remained less empirically interrogated. While Wylie (2002 and 2006) for example has conducted fieldwork exploring the performativity of landscapes in terms of embodied sensory experience, and explicitly acknowledges the role of the haptic in this, he is more interested in the kinetics of narrative than the place of touch. Yet, as anne V olvey in this volume argues, touch has always been a part of what geographers do during fieldwork, but only recently has it been considered a valuable and valid source of real 'data', thereby opening up numerous questions about the place of touch at the heart of scholarly practice. given the range of contributions in Touching Space, Placing Touch we might ask how the varied methodological approaches of social scientists, and human geographers in particular, could be reconfigured, adapted and extended to do greater justice to the intricacies, delicacies and contradictions of touch. Does the researcher try to measure touch itself in some way, or satisfy themselves with (often imperfect) proxies for it in the form of words and categories? is it ethical and appropriate for academics to attend to their own haptic experiences as an undeniable part of the empirical process? as a number of the chapters in this volume begin to demonstrate, the answers to such questions are plural, but all highlight to varying degrees how attention to touch grants scholars some form of access to a subjectively-constituted interior experience and understanding not always discernible through behavioral observations. For touch lies at the interface between the perceived interiority of an embodied subject and the exteriority of Figure I.2 Tactile hostility of school playground exhibited in the critical analysis of radical geographer William Bunge 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 10 the world they bring into existence through actions and relations. Several of the authors in Touching Space, Placing Touch engage with the modalities of touch through discursive analysis without themselves touching the places they delineate, others openly embrace the inevitability of immediate and intimate tactile encounters during their empirical investigations, reminding us that touch exists in a relational space between those touching and those being touched. if some use well established interview approaches to obtain rich empirical material, as demonstrated in Jennifer lea's interviews with massage practitioners, others, such as Sarah cant, pau obrador and elizabeth Straughan, opt for more participatory research methods in an effort to get closer to the place of touch in their particular research contexts. This, as hannah Macpherson says, requires a bodily and sensory immersion on the part of the researcher which, taken against the more positivist demands within social science for investigative rigour in large samples and generalisable results, sits at odds with the way academic geography has habitually been conceived. an attention to one's own embodied touch therefore - either as a substantive topic or as an element of fieldwork experience - demands that scholars take a more involved role as researchers, and reminds academics of the need to consider their auto-ethnographic role in researching, experiencing and representing tactile senses within fieldwork and research dissemination. Touch in any context can become markedly personal and private, and as a necessary corollary to this researchers can never be certain they truly grasp the meanings and sensations of those they research. Whilst interviews can be used to probe verbalised representations of what such encounters may embody, there will always be the feeling that words alone fail to grasp the non-textual kernel of tactile experience, that that which struggles with representation strains to be articulated through language. Alternatively, by immersing themselves fully in the field of touch as participants, researchers may feel closer to what they are teasing apart, but this may be re-presented only from their own embodied position and perceived social situation. in writing about touch research, then, the danger remains that the form of embodiment assumed, the imputed body of the researcher that attempts to articulate what touch feels like, is a solipsistic body, an artificial horizon, an introspective abyss. The extent of rigorous research about subjective and inter-subjective touching might thereby be constrained to rich descriptive pieces of self-reflection, always mired in the local, the idiosyncratic, and unable to say anything of wider significance beyond that very personal account. The degree of consideration given to personal reflection by several of the chapters here would suggest attention to touch throws the spotlight on the researcher as the medium through which the reader understands. Since each personal interpretation of the meaning of touch and its spatial contexts is unique, this potentially leaves researchers grappling once more with questions of representation and authenticity. in qualitative research methods more generally there always remains the possibility of falling back upon the particular words that people choose to describe or explain experiences, with the insertion of lengthy and carefully transcribed quotes in academic analysis. however, when investigating the place of touch experience, the 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 10 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 11 inability of verbalised text or visual observations to truly convey embodied meaning and experience is one of the main concerns underlying the development of 'sensual studies', and necessitates an inquiry into supplementary means of, if not 'knowing' exactly, then 'reporting' that world. if what we claim is self-evident - namely that touch is about something more than the language available to describe it or the representations of it through words and images - where does that leave scholars in terms of understanding genuine and authentic experiences of touch for others? Sarah cant's chapter in this volume left the question of gender implicit, for example, and the reader cannot ascertain whether she danced with a man or a woman. however, the reader might assume that the experience would be very different for both partners depending on the gender of each for all sorts of personal, cultural and physical reasons. Whilst this does not detract from the seductive storytelling of the embrace and the haptics of the dance, it suggests there are other routes into touch which might be attempted from researchers' own embodied positionalities. echoing our earlier observation that touch is not universally positive, several chapters in this volume highlight the therapeutic value of touch. it is perhaps not by chance that the subjects chosen for fieldwork involve largely non-threatening haptic experiences, often those the researcher themselves were already personally immersed within, such as recreational dancing (Sarah cant), receiving beauty treatments (elizabeth Straughan), or participating in countryside walking (hannah Macpherson). Since not all touch is therapeutic, nor altogether positive, we should acknowledge that Touching Space, Placing Touch as a whole fails to engage with some of the more problematic aspects of touch and its associated intimacies. Whilst Jennifer lea's massage practitioners may suggest touch can help a client 'return' to their bodies, instances of touch such as an unwanted grope will instead become the catalyst for a disruptive experience, abruptly ripping the subject from their usual habitus. completely new and potentially uncomfortable issues then irrupt for social science researchers, both physically and ethically, and few researchers would wish to open themselves to unwelcome or potentially threatening tactile encounters. Nonetheless, such considerations suggest there is another significant terrain of touching place and placing touch unintentionally omitted from this particular collection. While no contributor volunteered this topic, it would inevitably have offered significant empirical difficulties and potentially stark provocations for considering touch otherwise, outside of the predominantly positive associations within this collection. Despite this limitation, and given the centrality of touch to our basic human flourishing (as shown in this collection by Bernard Andrieu et al.), sense of self and identity (amanda Bingley), and ability to relate to others (hannah Macpherson), any methodological advances in understanding, engaging with, and explaining touch can only be welcomed. Haptic experiences of and in fieldwork are a core part of what many academics do as researchers, and how one produces knowledge, regardless of the substantive topic under consideration. in acknowledging the importance of touch we must also accept that, as paterson (2006, 2007), pau obrador (this volume) and numerous others recognise, there is a close relationship between touching 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 11 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 12 and feeling. To attend more fully to touch in academic research, therefore, invites scholars to attend to their feelings, potentially an uncomfortable and unfamiliar demand in many professional settings. Touching methodologies therefore prompt us as researchers to explore how we feel and how we feel about our subject matter. Viewed in this way, as anne V olvey succinctly puts it in this collection, we work 'with' rather than 'in' the field, and this raises issues of responsibility which are rarely considered in the routinised process of 'ethics committee' clearances. above all, collectively the chapters in Touching Space, Placing Touch remind us that touch is relational, is co-produced, is co-constituted in a series of configurations between human and (non)human, and people and spaces alike. if in late capitalism the prevailing cultural and corporate tendency is, contra hobbes' collective 'commonwealth', towards individual insularity and atomisation, we should welcome an empirical stance which approaches such intertwined and intersubjective realities. as we continue to seek opportunities for deep connection in such a world, placing empirical touch centre-stage represents a collective phenomenological 'feeling our way', or perhaps a tentative 'groping', within this emerging, exciting, haptic territory. The Shape of Touching Space, Placing Touch The twelve new chapters brought together in Touching Space, Placing Touch reflect an openness to various approaches to tactility and spatiality. The diversity of material, at once a measure of the liveliness of the research going on right now in terms of both theoretical positions and methodological approaches. indeed, within human geography this research interest continues to expand and develop, indicated for example by subsequent conference sessions such as Touched by Geography organised by Deborah Dixon and elizabeth Straughan at the association of american geographers (aag) conference in 2009. Since 2007, as we note elsewhere in more detail, work on moving bodies, on kinaesthesia and sporting bodies has grown in interest, alongside work more recently on visceral geographies (e.g., hayes-conroy and hayes-conroy 2010) which clearly complements this area. The chapters here are not consciously arrayed in thematic order, nor grouped into artificially imposed categories invented by the editors. While acknowledging that the contributors give a diverse set of snapshot viewpoints onto tactility and spatiality, we do see some significant commonality in terms of the thrust of their theoretical arguments. We can identify six points of intellectual intersection shared across the chapters to varying degrees. Before summarising the chapters and identifying ways in which they respectively speak to these themes, we outline the themes in general terms. Firstly, many contributors make the case that research on the geography of touch has been hidebound by the dominance of the visual register as a way of knowing the world, and awareness of the constraints of textual inscription for representation. The second point advanced effectively by several of the contributions is the use of their own bodies, and its haptic experiences, as the central 'investigative 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 12 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 13 tool' for generating valid empirical observation for scholarly interpretation. Thirdly, nearly all the chapters speak to the point, albeit in heterogeneous ways, that touch necessitates a relational approach and not simply the solipsistic subjectivity assumed in thinking about touch on the skin, or individualistically-determined isolated sets of sensations. Accordingly, for some contributors, the most significant observations within their empirical analysis is the attempt to 'map' the relational spaces in-between bodies that acts of touch bring into being, in some senses, and thereby to really begin to understand what effects touch has on people's sense of the world and their place within it. The fourth theme develops from that of the third. rooted in the haptic, and emerging from sensual relations with others, if the sense of 'placing' our bodies through touch fosters the acknowledgement that 'touch' and 'touching' is irreducible to superficial 'surface' or cutaneous (skin) sensations, then there is a concomitant need to investigate more thoroughly how the haptic realm operates not as a single modality, as a consistent but vague visceral 'sense' in itself, but instead is neurologically constituted and consciously felt in multiple ways, often at different 'depths', or is felt as several steps removed from the bodily site or situation of actual or assumed physical contact. The focus on the multiplicity of touch therefore foregrounds a relation between an assumed interiority of the body, something reiterated throughout folk psychology, and the consciousness of touching and being touched by other bodies. The reciprocity of physical touching, the observation repeated from husserl, Merleau-ponty and irigaray that touching always inevitably implies being simultaneously touched, has an affective correlate. in other words, that profound yet indirect relationship between acts of physical touching and being emotionally 'touched' finds its echo in contemporary metaphors and idiomatic expressions, where 'touching' and 'feeling' persist as metaphorical expressions of a physical act, and relates to the fifth theoretical theme that several chapters consider. This theme identifies how physical tactility helps people connect emotionally, and often in novel ways. in the cases of therapeutic spaces and healing practices this connection might be to an inner sense of selfhood assumed by the research participants, but this does not foreclose alternative conceptions of relationality between bodies and energies, nor the multitude of ways that affective and tactile practices are or could be enfolded and co-constituted in various spatial contexts. lastly, the sixth thread that draws several of the chapters together is a focus on the work of touch in the different parts of the 'body industry', and in particular on those who make their living performing 'body work' by selling haptic labour. This type of relationship between spacing touch deals most significantly with the novel ways that the body and tactility enters the sphere of leisure-oriented capitalism, whereby the body and the haptic senses enjoy a new significance. There are new modes of somatic address that proliferate from certain sectors of the service industry that complement more traditional or established therapies and care of the body. While issues of gender pervade each of the themes to varying degrees, the uses of tactility and the body within therapeutic spaces, and the asymmetrically deployment of haptic 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 13 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 14 labour within the body industry, entail that gendered labour and power relations are more pointed in this regard. Jennifer lea's work on the place of touch has focused on the spaces of health and care giving, especially in relation to the practices and meanings around therapeutic massage. her chapter, Negotiating therapeutic touch, focuses on extending existing scholarship around the political economy of 'body work' (such as nursing, social care, beauty treatments) by conferring more concern for the phenomenological experience of the body actually doing the work. her analysis draws upon the influential writing of Michel Serres (2008) which offers a complex, and therefore perhaps a more comprehensive, reading of the body in terms of corporeal sensations and most significantly the ways these emerge through social relations. Serres' ideas, according to lea's interpretation, attend to the ways that touch can reach through the surface of the body and connect across bodies, admixing being and world in ongoing and unpredictable relations. This notion of 'mixing' effectively complicates the easy trap of inside/outside dualism around the analysis of embodied touch, where sensations are not created simply at the skin boundaries but arise from the relations. The body therefore is not a meaningfully bounded entity. The significance of sensory relations for understanding the world needs to be addressed, for this is how we become: through feeling the world. Jennifer Lea argues that Serres' ideas of fleshy and feeling bodies, and his concepts of 'mixing' in particular, can help social scientists conceptualise the places of touch in novel ways and begin to reveal how bodies are constituted in relation to their spatial context. considering how the body is not a bounded, unitary object, but emergent through relations including sensory ones, using in-depth interviews she analyses the working touch of therapeutic massage practitioners. her analysis shows how language - in the form of verbal accounts of clients given when undergoing massage treatment - is insufficient to explain their bodies and expose the 'problems' residing within. The massage practitioners, in the act of 'mixing' their bodies with the clients', can in some way connect to a kind of demonstrable 'truth' through their skilled touch that is inexpressible through words. Yet, as lea details, such truth when activated through touch comes laden with tensions. These tensions can arise from the real difficulty some clients have in dealing with the impact of a truth 'exposed' to their consciousness through the touch of massage. Furthermore, there can be issues in coping with ongoing emotional problems that emerge through mixing bodies because the place of touch is bounded by the time and space of the treatment room and constrained by the business relation that exists between client and therapist (and their profit derived by offering their haptic labour). The mixing of bodies in this way is problematic as it is part of 'body work', and cannot be freely expressed as an open-ended care-giving relationship. pau obrador engages with ideas around the place of touch in the context of tourist activity, focusing on the intellectual gap in academic studies of tourism in understanding the sensuality of material practices. his chapter, Touching the beach, makes a case for the significance of bodies, their corporeality and the sensual nature of encounters with spaces, to extend tourism studies beyond its conventional 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 14 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 15 analytical concern with the optical senses and visual culture exemplified by the centrality of the gaze metaphor to much literature on tourism. A specific focus on the haptic basis of tourist activities, obrador argues, can help to understand the power of their sensual experiences, pleasurable feelings and playful meanings, and thereby move scholarship beyond the constraints put up by the conventional focus on the predominantly visual consumption of places. Drawing on earlier empirical material, obrador's spatial context is the beach, a site essential to much of the tourist industry, renowned as a space offering a distinctive ensemble of materialities - the famed three 'Ss' of sand, sea and sun. The beach is also lionised as a public space for playful encounters in contemporary Western culture. as such beaches are interesting tactile spaces to investigate and, according to obrador, their range of sensual opportunities are surprisingly under-researched by tourist studies. given the ways bodies can have multiple, and quite often distinctive, sensual encounters at the beach, as an essential part of its broad ludic appeal - freedom to get onto the ground and play in the sand, laying flat out soaking up the sun, splashing about in the sea - clearly the beach cannot be fully explained by documenting the visual register alone. obrador looks to understand the beach by an engagement with the tactile appeal of sand, sea and sun, and deploys three distinct conceptual tools to achieve this. Firstly, he shows how a focus on the complex modalities of touch can overcome the isolated viewpoint, which are inherent in ocularcentric approaches. his concern for looking beyond vision to use the tactile senses to unlock experiences of place speaks directly with anne V olvey's call in chapter 5 for attention to the more-than visual fieldwork practices in geographical scholarship. Obrador's readiness to engage with the embodied reality of sensual experiences of play and pleasure also correlates with other recreational tactilities such as those documented in Jamie lorimer's chapter on tourist encounters with wild animals and hannah Macpherson's discussion of practices of guided walking holidays. Secondly, obrador conceptualises an expanded realm for the haptic, one that extends touch well beyond the bio-psychological feelings received at the fingertips. As he shows the sensual encounters with the plasticity of sand, the heating rays of the sun and the enveloping motion of the sea can only be meaningfully read with a 'thick' haptic perspective that registers the many ways touch occurs upon, within and across our bodies. The notion that touch is more than skin deep is a thematic current in several other chapters, including Jennifer lea's discussion of the depth of feelings released through therapeutic massage. Thirdly, he conceptualises the value of touch for its capacity to bring forth the textures of places and highlight the feeling of authenticity that comes through the haptic sensorium. Being able to describe more fully the textures that make places unique is valuable for materialistic approaches in social sciences. The focus on materialities is shared with Martin Dodge and rob kitchin examining the changing tactilities of public toilets arising from new technologies. Furthermore, the analysis obrador presents in Touching the beach draws upon first-hand insights from participant observations on beaches and interviews with beachgoers, along with some insightful and 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 15 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 16 introspective use of his own bodily experiences. in this regard obrador's empirical approach has clear methodological parallels with work presented in this volume by Sarah cant on bodily experiences of tango dancing and elizabeth Straughan on receiving beauty treatments. The significance of touch in art therapy is explored in Amanda Bingley's chapter where she draws on influential ideas from psychoanalysis such as Winnicott (1971) to explore the notion that the tactile senses are a pragmatic alternative for articulating more than can be verbalised within a therapeutic context. not only non-verbal communication, but more-than-verbal expression, Bingley believes, is the essence of why art therapy can be so effective in helping people recover from trauma or cope with serious and terminal illnesses. as she shows in Touching space in hurt and healing, haptic mechanics in the body can make certain kinds of 'deep' connections to the brain to unlock emotions and memories in ways that other senses cannot. Bingley's empirical context is creative play and art making which is now widely deployed in the healing practices across many different institutional settings. art therapy 'works' because touch is the deepest sense, the least deceptive, the most difficult to fake or be fooled by. This is because the haptic realm forms the 'ground' upon which everything else is built, it comes first to us as we form in utero and it matters the most throughout life. Tactile art activities in therapy sessions can simultaneously bring somatic responses and emotional feelings to the surface, to re-present within consciousness, helping to reconnect them with their body, which is often the 'problem' that a person must confront in their healing. here Bingley's analysis articulates similar ideas to those advanced by anne V olvey on the elemental nature of touch and how it works to unlock new knowledge about the self. The purposeful exploration of inner selfhood through the medium of touch is also a central notion in the discussion by Sara MacKian on the significance of spiritual encounters, Jennifer lea's contribution on therapeutic massage and Jamie lorimer's discussion of people 'finding themselves' through tactile encounters with elephants on volunteer holidays. Bingley develops Winnicott's notion that touch works within a domain, the 'potential space', that lies at the interface between perceived Self and observed other, inner being and exterior world. But for Bingley what one is touching matters, as some objects simply work better as a tactile medium. They are not just bare materialities but active agents within this 'potential space', enrolling bodies into the world. She looks in particular at the materialities of clay and sand and their tactile effectiveness in art therapy practices, detailing ways these materials provide naturalistic, workable forms of physical expression of people's inner, imaginary, world, through the intensely sensitive feelings of hand and fingers. Such materials can be made to 'talk' without conscious effort, the inner voice can 'speak' to them through the subtle, elusive power of touch. Yet Bingley argues from her wide reading of the applied literature on art therapy that the fundamental significance of the tactile is all too often eluded. She delineates how the act of touching, what it can do for individuals seeking healing, and how it does it, are rarely acknowledged. possible reasons for this include the primacy of the visual in recorded research, the unspoken 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 16 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 17 hierarchy of senses that tends to diminish the significance of the haptic realm, and the fact that touch forms a fundamental 'ground' for everyday perception means that often it is dismissed as mere background, and as such is hard to articulate through text. This argument has much in common other chapters on the need to look beyond the visual register including pau obrador's analysis of the beach, Jamie lorimer's examination of touching environmentalism, and more generally anne V olvey's call for new forms of fieldwork attendant to the tactile. elizabeth Straughan's chapter is concerned with the 'body industry' and the everyday place of therapeutic touch as conducted in high street beauty salons. She is particularly concerned with understanding the nature of facial treatments in terms of the emotional exchanges and tactile relations between the touch giver, the beautician, and the touch receiver, the paying client. This 'body work' involves a significant amount of haptic labour with a range of tactile practices, coming from the key site of the hands of the beautician and directed to one of the most sensitive parts of the body, the face. Delivering a distinct form of therapeutic touch which will improve the (perceived) appearance of the client's skin, the emotional labour of the beautician's job should not be underestimated. Success in this regard, as Straughan shows in Facing touch in the beauty salon, is as much concerned with psychological connections as it is with the physiological condition of the skin. empirically Straughan's work is focused on the feminised nature of the salon space and draws upon her own experiences of receiving facial treatments, recounting the routines and the staged ambiance of the place, the verbal discussions with the beauticians and the variety of feelings engendered within her, both at a somatic and an emotional level. To provide an explanatory interpretation of her own embodied experiences of receiving therapeutic touch in beauty salons, Straughan seeks to delineate the contradictory process of generating a sense of relaxation under soothing hands whilst also unleashing anxieties about this very process, since skin 'problems' are necessarily being exposed to scrutiny in order to be 'treated'. She brings to the fore katherine hayles' (1997) theoretical concept of 'corporeal anxiety' to account for the dialectical nature of beautification: that it depends on the decaying nature of our bodies and simultaneously the desire to counter this decay. The result is a compulsion to seek external 'solutions' that promise the restoration of something 'lost', now centred in a commercial salon context that proffers scientifically labelled products with their restorative and regenerative properties. Straughan's analysis of therapeutic touch and the anxieties provoked in terms of corporeality and the effectiveness of commercial performances around 'body work' and emotional labour, resonates strongly with Jennifer lea's work on massage practitioners and andrieu et al.'s chapter on research regarding the tactile work of doctors and nursing staff in medical settings. Straughan's analysis of the nature of bodies suffering corporeal anxiety draws upon two elemental ideas from luce irigaray's (1993) work. Firstly, she asks us to think about the nature of bodies in the salon using the notion of 'morph\u00e9', which acknowledges the temporality of the body, continually coming into being and breaking apart, requiring ongoing care. Secondly, Straughan uses irigaray's notion 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 17 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 18 of 'porosity' to account for the body's vulnerability to fragmentation and yet its fundamental openness to treatment. Bodies are not closed entities, and the porosity of the beautician's hands and the face of the client is a factor in facilitating 'good' or effective therapeutic touch. along with rachel colls' contribution in this volume looking at the tactile fatness of women's bodies, and Sarah cant's discussion of embracing tango dancers performing fluid movement, Straughan's theoretical engagement develops irigaray's work on bodily difference and subjectivity for placing and conceptualising touch. anne V olvey's chapter charts the shifting 'knowledge regimes' that she argues underpin empirical, fieldwork-based, geographical scholarship. Such regimes have an often unacknowledged episteme that is critical in guiding how geographers come to know what they know about the world. as others have done, she contends that much traditional geographical fieldwork has been based upon the primacy of the visual survey as a way of knowing the world and has been criticised for its inherent masculine biases. addressing this, V olvey delineates the emergence of an alternative knowledge regime for fieldwork, again spurred on in part by feminist geographers, one that is qualitative and based on discursive ways of knowing. While V olvey acknowledges the positive potential of this 'qualitative turn' in fieldwork she is simultaneously critical of this knowledge regime, centred as it is around 'talking' to subjects, and its tendency to overlook the other embodied senses, particularly the innate haptic registers of the researchers themselves. consequently, in her chapter Fieldwork: how to get in(to) touch, V olvey calls for an 'expanded' knowledge regime for fieldwork that encompasses not just what is seen or said, but also how scholars feel about the world. This entails an ambition to accept the tactile experience of researchers as a valid form of data that should be treated as seriously as any other source in the production of scientific information. For a truly haptic 'knowledge regime' V olvey deploys ideas from psychotherapy around 'transitionality', focussing our attention on the significance of the 'between-ness' of bodies and the world, the interface of 'me' and 'not-me', as a central part of our being. using the ideas of 'transitionality', derived partly from Winnicottian psychotherapy, as a way to think about the significance of the haptic realm to self-being, clearly shares a sympathetic conceptual background with amanda Bingley's chapter on touch in art therapy. V olvey argues fieldwork should be seen as a transitional practice, one that brings to the fore the unconscious incorporation of all manner of 'data' from feeling (as opposed, presumably, to the more usual 'surveying') the field. Thus, fieldwork should not be seen in terms of an external agent collecting material 'in' the field, but more an experience performed 'with' the field. It enhances fieldwork, giving substance to non-visual experience and also more-than verbal explanations, enhancing the repertoire of social science scholarship. To some extent this effectively demonstrates comparable approaches in this volume (especially hannah Macpherson and pau obrador), where the research builds upon empirics felt by the researchers' own bodies. V olvey argues this agenda extends feminist approaches to fieldwork by moving towards an episteme purposefully centred on more embodied, corporeal feelings.

This could move geographical scholarship forward in some surprising directions. hannah Macpherson's chapter describes the activity of guiding blind and visually impaired people in the context of recreational countryside walking. This leisure context provides a revealing and singular context to consider relations between embodiment and touch. her work seeks to understand what it means for two people to 'move as one' through the landscape. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork in which she was a volunteer guide on holidays with blind and visually impaired people, Macpherson's analysis demonstrates the value of 'sensuous ethnographic observations' in combination with interviews and photography. in her chapter Guiding visually impaired walking groups, Macpherson deploys her own guiding experiences to delineate the 'in-betweenness' of the touching bodies, of guide and follower, and highlights how subtle yet significant these inter-corporeal spaces are. Such inter-corporeal spaces are all too easily overlooked in geographical scholarship, but especially in much conventional individual-centred 'wayfinding' research with visually impaired people. Thus her research has wider value in highlighting the nature of the spaces and practices where bodies come together experientially, beckoning the intercorporeal world into some kind of symmetry, if only in fleeting and partial ways. Such temporary inter-corporeality through touch is shared to some extent with Sarah cant's analysis of the social embrace and paired movements of tango dancers, and also in Martin Dodge and rob kitchin's consideration of use of public toilets that are shared with strangers. Macpherson develops this notion of 'inter-corporeality', building upon Merleau- ponty's (1962) well known idea of 'body schema' and how they are extensible beyond the strict physical bounds of skin and bone. her analysis of guided walking in the countryside illustrates how body schemas can become coupled, with two bodies exhibiting kinetic synchrony, like a dance along the rural footpaths and mountain trails rather than a mechanical follow-my-leader march. in trying to understand how coupled body schemas work Macpherson deploys an ethical perspective, thinking of touch as a gift that is given and received. in this inter-corporeality, importantly, the visually impaired person is not a passive vessel or pitiable recipient of charity, but is instead empowered by surrendering their independence and by choosing to gift their trust to the guide. The guide's body does not give help as such, but receives this gift of trust and has responsibility for its care. The gift of trust is made real in the incorporeal space of touch. We can see parallels in this exchange of trust within an inter-corporeal space of touch with Jennifer lea's chapter on 'mixing bodies' in therapeutic massage and elizabeth Straughan's chapter on the touch between client and beautician in the gift of facial treatment. The chapter by Bernard andrieu, anne-Flore lalo\u00eb and alexandre klein examine touch in the context of medical models of the body and health spaces, deploying a range of conceptual cases studies to shed light on what they see as new kinds of 'biosubjective care'. it shares the focus on touch in therapeutic spaces and practices 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 19 7/13/2012 4:41:21 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 20 by Jennifer lea and amanda Bingley in this volume, but concentrates on the relation between medical models of the body and strategies of healthcare. They argue that the caring potential of empathetic touch for therapeutic purposes has been consciously disregarded in mainstream, science-centric, masculinist, medicine, and has also been elided in conventional modes of nursing that are focused on material hygiene and the orderly management of ill bodies. healing touch has been relegated to the margins by trained health professionals, and stereotyped (even stigmatised) as 'alternative' medicine. in Touch, skin cultures and the space of medicine, andrieu, lalo\u00eb and klein seek to explain this through the dispersed ontological status of the body in scholarly knowledge. They discuss the tendency to divide ways of understanding, with the 'lived body' on one side with its concern for surgical dissection of tissues and organs, differentiated from the 'living of the body' and its critical questioning of representations and discourses. andrieu et al. contend that a focus on touch in terms of biosubjective care could be a useful epistemological tool for investigating the body, fusing together bio-physical and psycho-social bodily models. Furthermore, andrieu et al. aim to counter the particular kind of professionalisation of touch within medical practice and thereby to rethink medicine as a 'tale of the skin', one that acknowledges and integrates diverse tactile therapies and their expanded and enhanced capacity to heal patients. in this sense their chapter has resonances with the holistic arguments around touch and the body advanced by amanda Bingley's chapter in her consideration of tactile art for healing, the commercially determined 'body work' discussed by elizabeth Straughan, and the professionalisation of kinds of healing touching within the beauty industry by Jennifer lea. Jamie lorimer's chapter takes us in quite a different direction and into a distinctive empirical context, concerned as he is with the touching that marks interspecies relations, in particular the complex patterns of embodied and non-verbal interactions that occur between humans and companion animals within recreational spaces. Drawing upon his fieldwork, Lorimer speaks of a 'touching environmentalism' which exploits the capacity to be in touch with, and to have actual tactile encounters, especially with charismatic animals such as koala bears or dolphins, and has become central to the wildlife conservation strategies of ngos and ecotourism companies. as he discusses, there is an inherent 'captivity paradox' here, whereby wild animals are kept under close control so that paying visitors can get close to them, yet also have supposedly 'authentic' encounters with them. in Touching environmentalism, lorimer investigates the triangular relationship between an aging elephant, a Western woman on a volunteer holiday, and the local mahout who cares for the animal. using empirical material gathered at a Sri Lankan elephant sanctuary through participant observations, filming and interviews he considers the different kinds of feelings generated, and possible meanings in, episodes of touching in staged encounters. in this context, lorimer also exposes conflicts around how interspecies encounters should proceed and the different models of welfare, care and cruelty are at play in the sanctuary situation. how should human-elephant contact be considered? The elephant is ambiguously positioned: neither a wild beast nor a subservient pet. instead, the elephant exists within a web 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 20 7/13/2012 4:41:22 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 21 of relations and knowledges as what Donna haraway (2008) terms 'companion species', with long histories of relationships with humans. By making reference to influential ideas from Haraway's work, Lorimer proceeds to think about the deeper histories and troubling relations that mark many kinds of human exploitation of animals, and how contemporary responsibilities might be renegotiated. For this he delineates various modalities of touch and identifies how these vary across different actors (involving asymmetrical power relations and often incompatible embodied knowledges), along with attention to their discrete historical antecedences. in particular he explains how pre-existing colonialist notions, centred around particular kinds of appropriate and inappropriate human-animal relations, is still significant to contemporary touching environmentalism. He charts how the elephant in particular has been perceived as an exotic icon because of its size and strangely compelling physiology, sought after by hunters and subject to the deadly touch of their rifle bullets, and also subjected to the scopic curiosity of nascent natural historians. This attention has more recently morphed as feminised conservation agendas have shifted the episteme from masculinist knowing (derived from elevated visual observation) to a closer, more embodied and literal way of getting in touch with animals. lorimer shows how such connections can be made to heighten interest in the therapeutic potential (for the human) of the tactile sensations within human-animal encounters. in many of these encounters people recount being touched, in some spiritual dimension, through their communing with 'pure' nature by the supposedly unmediated act of touching sentient animals. This has become another of those packaged experiences for affluent consumers, such as swimming with dolphins, as part of the wider growth of the postmodern 'experience economy'. it is certainly the case that those paying to work as a volunteer with elephants in the Sri lankan sanctuary sought some spiritual self-healing from their physical contact with the animals. in making the conceptual connection between the immediacy of tactile encounters and communing with something much larger, an other that awakens larger spiritual feelings, lorimer's chapter shares some corresponding concerns with Sara MacKian's chapter by looking at the significance of tactile connections to spirit for everyday well-being. The importance of tactile engagement within everyday environments is the subject of the chapter by Martin Dodge and rob kitchin. While their techno-centric empirical approach diverges from other contributions, they seek similarly to understand something of the social meaning of socio-spatial tactile interactions. They also demonstrate the potential to mediate and modulate the haptic landscape in contemporary practices of technologies such as computers, software algorithms and digital sensors. Towards touch-free spaces provides a preliminary analysis focused on the mundane but overlooked space of the shared public toilet. examining the ways that sensors and software are deployed to automate bathroom fixtures and fittings, key aspects of toileting practice can proceed without the need for direct hand touch. Their contribution draws upon anthropological ideas around the emotive power of disgust and the cultural categorisation of dirt using Mary Douglas' (1966) influential 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 21 7/13/2012 4:41:22 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 22 notion of 'matter out of place'. Toilets are inherently dirty places, and the desire to control disgust by reducing points of potential contact and contamination is strong. in the context of shared public toilets, the problem of surfaces that have been touched and thereby contaminated by strangers' bodies becomes prominent. The analysis advanced by Dodge and Kitchin speaks to the relational significance of touch within the quotidian space of the bathroom, the apprehension and anticipation of the (now absent yet, evidenced by dirt and detritus, somewhat materially present) body of the other, and complements the discussions of the importance of inter-personal tactility in therapeutic spaces (see Jennifer lea and elizabeth Straughan chapters) and recreational activity including Sarah cant's dissection of tango dancing. Much of Dodge and kitchin's chapter audits the range of touch-free technologies that have become available from bathroom manufacturers and the kinds of promotional discourses expounded to sell these products, including the central claim around their hygienic capacity, the offer of efficiency and the promise of control. Looking at how touch-free technologies are being sold is bound into wider capitalist enterprises that exploit tactile landscapes and haptic labour for profit, something that is well explored in a number of other chapters including Bernard andrieu et al.'s analysis of 'biosubjective care'. a key conclusion of their chapter is to highlight the current real- world failure of technologies to meaningfully produce consistently touch-free spaces, that accordingly deliver to users a way to control these contaminatory contacts and therefore their disgust. in terms of a broader consideration of wholesale attempts to automate the landscape as 'intelligent environment' and 'smart spaces' using software technologies, the central question posed by this work concerns the feasibility and, crucially, desirability of the removal of so many routine tactile encounters within material space. Questioning the marketing and managerial rhetorics that desire to engineer away touch is important, because these are misguided in their utilitarian reading of the haptic realm, and fail to understand that touch is comprised of much more than surface sensations, a point consistently raised in other chapters. Sarah Cant's chapter considers the significant role of touch, but also 'listening', in the experience of dancers of argentine tango, a popular social activity around the world. The inherently improvised nature of tango, with its small repertoire of moves, handholds and forms of embrace means the dancing couple must be attuned to each other's bodies, bringing shared kinesthetic experience into inter-corporeal being. in its popular image tango is bound up with strongly gendered roles of the male dancer leading a female partner, but cant uses this form of dancing to think more subtly and with more suppleness about difference and subjectivity by using ideas from irigaray. in drawing upon her own experiences of tango dancing, cant seeks to challenge simplistic male-female binaries, deploying irigaray's notion of 'listening' across the silent shared spaces of touching bodies in the dancing embrace without reducing these to determined gendered differences. Social dances, like tango, with their varying degrees of touch-in-the-moment, are therefore interesting places to explore some routes to post-patriarchical discourses that are focused on how bodies multifariously and fleetingly 'fit' together physically and symbolically. in the milonga context in the uk that cant examines, people are often dancing with 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 22 7/13/2012 4:41:22 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 23 strangers and the tactile intimacy of embrace needed for real 'listening' to the partner is a challenge, requiring an inner confidence to open oneself to another person, to be sufficiently 'in touch' to let the dance flow. As Cant reveals from her own experience, it does not always work. The touching embrace that links two bodies may not necessarily form more emergent connections and may simply reassert traditional follower-leader roles, because one side is not 'listening' to the other. her analysis also shows how successful social dancing relies on more-than-physical tactile sensations exchanged between paired bodies, and in tango it is the emotional connection growing out of the tactility of embrace, but not defined solely by the 'haptic', that works because it breaks down normative passive/active gendered roles. holding in the embrace should not be a competition, a struggle for control, but 'two singularities respectful of the other's difference'. it is not about 'equalising' that difference somehow but about 'listening' to each other through touch. Dancing bodies are replete with sensations, and the magnitude of emotional connection cannot be equated to the tactile closeness of the embrace. Sometimes light touching in open embrace facilitates greater 'listening' and engenders a stronger sensual bond between dancing bodies. The physical extent of touch is less important than the degree to which it communicates trust and a willingness to anticipate and take risks together in bodily movements. in this respect there are substantive correspondences here to hannah Macpherson's chapter, while in cant's engagement with, and development of, irigrary's corpus, there is an overt overlap with the contributions by rachel colls and elizabeth Straughan, who provide a reading of touch relations based on Irigaray's psychoanalytically influenced feminist philosophy that aims to rework those simplistic inherited categories of bodily being based on male/female binaries, and instead articulate alternatives expressed through linguistic constructions and metaphor celebrating bodily differences. rachel colls' chapter uses paintings of self-proclaimed 'fat' female bodies by artist Jenny Saville as a way to think about particular modalities of touch and to challenge what she sees as the underlying masculinist readings of sensations emanating from Merleau-Ponty's influential writing in the mid twentieth century. like Sarah cant and elizabeth Straughan, colls' analysis in Intra-body touching and the over life-sized paintings of Jenny Saville draws upon the critical feminist theories of Irigaray, as well as recent 'visceral' scholarship attending to the very fleshy nature of bodily sensations and their social relations. colls' intellectual agenda centres upon an irigarayan understanding of touch as a relation roughly between interiority and exteriority, the materiality of fleshly bodies and world, extending this by arguing for the need to consider the particularities of size and sex of the bodies involved. Most significantly she wants to highlight how bodies touch themselves (what she terms 'intra-body touching') and the fact that size does matter - hence her direct political call to look at fat bodies in new a light. again employing and developing terms from irigaray, in this case colls focuses upon the notion of 'morpho-logic' for female bodies centred on Irigaray's metaphor of the fluidity of mucous, as opposed to the solidity of the phallus. This highlights the distinctive nature of female bodies and how they touch - something overlooked in Merleau-ponty's work - and reminds 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 23 7/13/2012 4:41:22 PM1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344123 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 13 1415 16 1718 19 2021 22 2324 34 3536 37 3839 40 4142 43 44 Proof Copy Touching Space, Placing Touch 24 us that not all touching is visible and therefore available for objectification by an inquiring and acquiring gaze. colls' chapter provides an insightful visual analysis through a reading of two politically-loaded paintings of fleshy bodies. She proceeds in this fashion firstly for pragmatic reasons, arguing that Saville's painting envisions a reality of how bodies touch themselves, but secondly she asserts that the analysis of such artworks is valuable in making sense of 'how bodies, things and matter relate \"with\" and \"to\" each other', granting evidence of touching relations residing in mucous which are not usually visible to external scrutiny, and also confronting historicised masculinist conventions in the visualisation of the female nude. This opens up an approach that challenges the normative view of fat bodies as estranged from the self and stereotypically read as socially disgusting. rendering visceral bodies as visible in this way is potent, blurring simple boundaries between self and other, as folds of fat press against part of that same body - another quite literal way of bodies simultaneously touching and being touched. Sara Mackian's chapter completes Touching Space, Placing Touch and provides an innovative dual reading of the tactile as both physical contact and psychical connection. She points to the mass acceptance of spiritual beliefs in the global north that constitute significant aspects of everyday life for many, and yet the majority may not participate in organised religious practices or churchgoing. This is most evident in self-adapted spiritualities, such as crystal healing and tarot readings, that operate beyond the institutional governmentalities of church or temple. given this massive undercurrent of everyday alternative spiritualities her analysis highlights the therapeutic nature of spiritual touch, which need not be physically haptic to have real healing effects. in this regard there is commonality between Mackian's focus on spirituality and other kinds of 'alternative' self-help through tactile engagement discussed in other chapters in this volume, such as amanda Bingley's consideration of art therapy and Jamie lorimer's look at the healing that can come from getting 'in touch with' those larger natural (and supernatural) forces of nature, where swimming with dolphins is widely described as spiritually uplifting. if the presence of spirit is unacknowledged and overlooked in much academic analysis, Mackian argues there needs to be consideration of how the more-than-bodily sensations that many people seem to genuinely experience influence their behaviours, and thereby contribute to the larger social structures and the material forms of contemporary culture. in Touched by spirit, Mackian looks beyond the physical structures, material practices and visual iconicity of conventional religions, to engage with the pervasive influence of everyday spiritualities. MacKian's chapter discusses how the 'lens of touch' affords a potentially valuable way to gain more nuanced sociological understandings of 'how' and 'where' spirit makes a difference within the unfolding practices of modern living. She examines in detail a range of 'points of contact' with spirit by speaking to spiritual practitioners, recounting the sensations of tactile encounters, and also considering the deeper meanings people derive from being metaphorically 'in touch with' otherworldliness in the everyday. often extended (and non-physical) senses of touch are realised (and literally made real) through the use of specific material objects in rituals, like the white feather 978-1-4094-0214-5 Paterson.indb 24 7/13/2012 4:41:22 PMProof Copy 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 434412 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 33 3435 36 3738 39 4041 42 4344Introduction 25 mentioned by several spiritual practitioners. here bodily contact with such special objects works as a bridging device, opening connections or channels in a tangible and immediately comprehensible way between material world and immaterial spirit. This radically relational nature of touch, and the ways tactile experiences seem to bridge across and between bodies in physical and spiritual realms, speaks to the concerns of inter-corporeality and being in touch with far larger forces echoed elsewhere in this volume. Mackian's rich descriptions of the multiple ways that people are 'touched' by spirit can be taken as a progressive call for more inclusive social science scholarship. Such work not only acknowledges the importance of touch in the place of spirit, but solidifies the observation that touch, in its multifarious forms, impacts upon us in everyday life, yet is so rarely seriously considered within the social sciences. Placing Touch in Touching Space, Placing Touch each author with their adopted methodological framework contributes valuable points of reference for our growing mapping of the topographies of touch. The future of empirical research in the cross-disciplinary field of 'sensual studies' will have to feel its way, sometimes gropingly and imprecisely, in some cases using the traditional tools at its disposal, and revisiting the implications of some well-worn debates around issues like power, gender and positionality, before scholars can feel more fully at ease with writing about knowing the places of touch. There are numerous ways in which we might locate, dissect and understand touch. The chapters collected together here range from those with a specific focus on methods of touch, to those exploring methodologies for understanding touch, and represent just the beginning. We are in the early stages of encountering, mapping and negotiating this particular territory within the academy. The project of Touching Space, Placing Touch therefore entreats scholars to consider, in all their empirical investigations - regardless of whether there is a substantive focus on touch - how their methods touch, and thereby alter, the worlds they are investigating. Do they want their touches to move those worlds, and can they avoid such touches even if they do not? The contributors in this volume go some way to exploring these questions about the methods of touch and the touch of method, thereby stimulating readers to consider and reflect upon the touching, feeling or haptic influences of their own research encounters.
