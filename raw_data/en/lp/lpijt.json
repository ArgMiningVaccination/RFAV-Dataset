The list is intended to be used by the food-service industry in deal- ing with workers who are infected with contagious diseases. contamination during processing are more important causes of foodbome diseases than is contamination of food by persons with infectious or contagious diseases.\" But, it ac- knowledged, some pathogens are frequently transmitted through food by infected people. Compromise provision No other industry is singled out in the ADA in its treatment of people with contagious diseases. The issue arose during the congressional debate on the law, when several legislators attempted to remove all food han- dlers with contagious diseases from the act's coverage. Opponents of the amendment argued that the bill ad- equately protected the public from the risk of catching an infectious disease from infected workers. As a compromise, Congress re- quired the U.S. DepartmentofHealth and Human Services to annually publish and distribute a list of infec- tious diseases that can be transmit- ted through the food supply and the means by which such diseases are spread. CDC developed the list (pub- lished in the May 16Federal Regis- ter) along with the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, state and local health See CDC, Page 3 People with communicable dis- eases are protected by the ADA as long as they don't pose a threat to the health and safety ofothers. How- ever, Congress provided a limited exemption to that coverage by al- lowing restaurant owners and other food-related employers to transfer employees who are infected with any of the pathogens on the list (such as hepatitis-A and salmo- nella- see complete chart on p. 3) to non-foodhandling jobs, if any are available. House passes revised civil rights bill; margin too small to override promised Bush veto If no other positions are open or the risk of spreading the disease can't be eliminated by reasonably accommodating the affected work- ers, the employer can fire them without violating the ADA. CDC noted that \"the contamina- tion of raw ingredients from in- fected food-producing animals and IN THIS ISSUE Amid acrimonious debate, heightened rhetoric and promises of a veto, the House voted last month to approve anew version ofH.R. 1, the embattled civil rights bill that propo- nents claim would restore workers' protections against discrimination. The Bush administration claims that the bill would force employers to use hiring and promotion quotas. 1 CDC pub- lishes list of diseases 4 Disability Digest 6 Justice offers technical assistance grants THOMPSON PuBLISHING GROUP 1725 K ST. N.W., SUITE 200 The bill is designed to over- turn a series of Supreme Court decisions that have made it harder for women and minorities to sue their employers for discrimination. (The bill would also apply, in an indirect way, to discrimination against disabled people covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.) 7 See Civil, Page 2 Questions and answers about the ADA WASHINGTON, D.C. 20006 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 1 of 290Civil ~~~~~~~~~~ Continued from Page 1 It would allow women and ethnic and religious minorities to col- lect punitive damages for cases of intentional discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Racial minorities can sue for mon- etary awards under a separate federal statute. To make the measure palatable to business groups and conservative lawmakers, the House Democratic leadership substantially rewrote the original legislation. Provisions were added that would specifically out- law quotas, set a $150,000 cap on damages sought under title VII and ease the burden on businesses to prove that an employment practice is not discriminatory. In a backdoor fashion , passage of H.R. 1 would affect the Ameri- cans with Disabilities Act. The em- ployment provision of the ADA references title VII as its enforce- ment scheme; any changes to title VII would automatically apply un- der the ADA. Therefore, if punitive damages became available for women and minorities in job dis- crimination suits, they would be available to disabled people as well. President Bush, who contends that H.R. 1 would force businesses to adopt hiring and promotion quotas to avoid lawsuits, has repeatedly prom- ised to veto H.R. 1 (as he did a similar measure last year). The 273-158 House vote in favor of the bill is 17 votes short of the margin that would be needed to override a veto. Prior to the vote, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the revised bill a \"hoax,\" saying it \"only bars an employer from using a quota system that required the hiring of unqualified persons.\" In response, H.R. 1 sponsor and House Judiciary Committee Chair- man Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said: \"This is a carefully crafted bill with 2 a straightforward purpose -to as- sure that all Americans have the opportunity to compete in the work- place on the basis of their indi- vidual abilities, free from discrimi- nation based on race, color, sex, religion or national origin. \"And despite the inflammatory rhetoric coming out of the White House and the Department of Jus- tice these days, this is absolutely not a 'quota bill.'\" Cap controversy All the attention focused on the quota controversy somewhat ob- scured another dispute that sprung from the revised H.R. 1 - the cap on damages. As passed by the House, the bill would allow plaintiffs to recover punitive and compensatory dam- ages in cases of intentional dis- crimination under title VII, but would cap recovery at $150,000 for punitive damages or the amount of compensatory damages, which- ever amount is greater. Currently, title VII provides only for back pay and attorneys' fees. Because racial minorities can sue for unlimited damages under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the cap would essen- tially apply only to victims of dis- crimination based on sex, religion and ethnicity (under title VII) and disability (under the ADA). Advocacy groups representing women and disabled people tried unsuccessfully to lift the cap, which they charged makes them second- class citizens. An alternative bill that contained no limits on dam- ages failed in the House, as did a Bush-backed proposal that was less sweeping. Danforth proposal The debate now moves to the Senate, where, in an attempt to de- fuse the tension between congres- sional Democrats and the adminis- tration, nine moderate Republicans have drafted yet another version of new civil rights legislation. Sponsored primarily by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., the Senate legislation would consist of three bills. Two of the bills (S. 1207 and S. 1208) address the effects of vari- ous Supreme Court decisions that shifted the burden of proof in Title VII cases from the employer to the employee.

Two categories The CDC list is divided into two categories, the first consisting of pathogens often transmitted through food handling by contaminated people. Included in this list are vi- ruses that cause hepatitis-A, salmo- nella and dysentery, which could be present in people who have symp- toms of diarrhea, vomiting, open skin sores, dark urine or jaundice. CDC said these diseases can be spread if infected food workers fail to wash their hands (in situations such as after using the toilet, handling raw chicken, cleaning spills or carrying garbage), wear clean gloves or use clean utensils. Non-foodbome trans- mission (i.e., person to person) is an- other means of transmitting these pathogens. The second category consists of pathogens occasionally transmitted through food by infected people, but usually spread by other routes (in- cluding at the source, in food pro- cessing or by non-foodbome means). Preventing food contact by people who have acute diarrhea will de- crease the risk of transmitting these pathogens, CDC said. The AIDS debate AIDS and HIV infection are not included in the CDC list. When the so-called \"food-handlers\" amend- ment was being debated in Con- gress, proponents argued that res- taurant owners needed the ability to transfer or fire HIV -infected work- ers, even if there was no scientific link between food handling and the spread of AIDS. People would not eat at a restaurant where a chef or waiter was known to have the dis- ease, supporters said, causing a loss of business and jobs. Opponents of the amendment argued that such reasoning pandered to unfounded fears about AIDS and served to perpetuate discrimination against people with the disease, run- ning counter to the purpose of the ADA. D Category I Pathogens (Pathogens often transmitted through food handling) Hepatitis A virus Norwalk and Norwalk-like vi- ruses Salmonella typhi (which cause salmonella) Shigella species (which cause dysentery) Staphylococcus aureus (which cause pus formations in boils and abscesses) Streptococcus pyogenes (which cause various diseases) Category II Pathogens (Pathogens occasionally transmit- ted through food handling) Preventing food contact by people who have acute diarrheal illness will decrease the risk of transmit- ting the 01 Yersinia enterocolitica States consider restricting HIV protection The AIDS debate is now being replayed in several states. North Carolina lawmakers are considering legis- lation that would remove food workers from protection under the state's law against HIV discrimination. The bill passed the state Senate 41-3 in May and is pending in the House of Representatives. A spokesman for the North Carolina Lesbian and Gay Health Project said the proposed legislation would permanently exempt restaurants from the state's Com- municable Diseases Act. Restaurants were given a two- year exemption from the law when it was enacted in 1989. An alternative move to make the North Carolina law parallel to the ADA's provision on food handlers failed in the state Senate, he said. According to the AIDS Policy Center (an arm of the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project at George Wash- ington University), two other states are considering simi- lar legislation. A bill introduced in the Oklahoma legislature would require the state board of health to test food service personnel for HIV infection. Those who test positive for the virus would not be allowed to handle food or drink. In Mississippi, proposed legislation would establish a certification process for food service workers. Under the bill, a person applying for or working in food han- dling would have to be tested every six months for HIV; those who tested negative would carry a card indicating their status. The Mississippi bill would make it illegal for HIV- positive people to work in food services. Uncertified employees and their employers could face a $1,000 fine and up to a year in jail. Corporations that violate the certification process could face a $10,000 fine. These laws could face challenges under the ADA, which doesn't pre-empt state laws that provide greater protection, but does apply if the state law offers disabled people lesser coverage. In this case, the individual state laws would take away protections available to people with HIV that are provided under the ADA. Section 103(d)(3) of the act states that the ADA doesn't pre-empt or modify state or local laws designed to protect the public from people who pose a significant health or safety risk, \"pursuant to the list of infectious or communicable diseases\" published by HHS. Given that AIDS and HIV aren't on that list, laws which aim at removing protections from HIV-infected food workers could face scrutiny. 0 July 1991 ADA Compliance Guide 3 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 3 of 290Disability Digest Kansas amends state civil rights law to parallel ADA-Kan- sas Gov. Joan Finney has signed legislation that makes the Kansas Act Against Discrimination parallel to the Americans with Disabilities Act. In some areas, the Kansas law goes beyond the federal law. For example, Kansas employers with four or more employees are covered by the state's non-discrimination requirements; the ADA will eventu- ally apply to businesses with 15 or more workers. The law was also amended to prohibit certain private membership clubs (such as country clubs) from discriminating in their membership practices. Organizations that have 100 or more members, serve food on a regular basis to non-members and collect dues are subject to the act. Fraternities, sororities and religious organizations are not covered. States and cities are not required to amend existing anti-discrimina- tion statutes to conform with the ADA. The ADA doesn't invalidate or limit any state or local law that provides equal or greater protection to disabled people. But where a state or local law has less stringent re- quirements, the ADA applies. Title II accessibility guidelines postponed-State and local govern- ments and transportation officials will have to wait a couple of months for ADA accessibility guidelines from the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Access board Executive Direc- tor Larry Roffe announced in May that work on title II standards will be postponed until after final guide- lines for title III (public accommo- dations) are issued. He predicted that the remaining standards would be finished by the fall. Under the ADA, the board was to have issued final standards for 4 titles II and III by April 26, 1991. Most of the access board's effort has been directed at developing ac- cessibility guidelines for private businesses covered by title III. Roffe said a revised version of the public accommodations guidelines (pro- posed in January) has been sent to the Office of Management and Bud- get for final approval. The Justice Department will likely reference the board's standards in its final title III regulations. But concentrating on title III guidelines has caused the board to put off work on rules for state and local governments, Roffe said. In the interim, he suggested that public officials use the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS - see Appendix IV) for ADA compli- ance. Most federal agencies cite UFAS in their regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the statute which applies to federal fund recipients and on which the ADA is modeled. Similarly, workhas been delayed on final transportation guidelines (which the Department of Transpor- tation will probably use in its ADA regulations). The access board pro- posed standards for transit vehicles and facilities in March. Suspending HIV-infected doctor's surgery privileges did not violate state discrimination law, New Jersey court rules-A hospi- tal did not violate New Jersey's anti- discrimination law when it sus- pended the surgery privileges of a doctor who had AIDS, the New Jer- sey Superior Court for Mercer County ruled. The ear, nose and throat surgeon was a patient at the hospital where he worked. During his stay, he tested positive for HIV and was diagnosed with AIDS. The infection was plainly noted on his chart and staff members openly discussed his case. ADA Compliance Guide A few weeks after his diagnosis, the hospital suspended the doctor's surgical privileges. Hospital policy restricts health care providers from participating in any activity, includ- ing surgery, that would pose a risk of transmitting HIV to patients. The hos- pital also required the doctor's pa- tients to sign informed consent forms noting his HIV status. After his death, the doctor's es- tate sued the hospital for violating the New Jersey Law Against Dis- crimination, charging the suspen- sion discriminated against the doctor based on disability. As does the Amer- icans with Disabilities Act, the New Jersey law includes AIDS and HIV infection as a protected disability. The state court agreed that New Jersey's law protects the doctor as a disabled person. But it ruled that the hospital does not violate the state law in requiring HIV-positive doc- tors to inform their patients and lim- iting their medical activities. Pa- tients must be included in the deci- sion-making process, it said, and disclosing potential, even remote, risks is material to that process. \"The risk of transmission is not the sole risk involved,\" the court said. \"The risk of a surgical acci- dent, no matter how small, per- formed by an HIV-positive surgeon may subject a previously uninfected patient to months or even years of continual HIV testing.\" A doctor's right to perform invasive procedures fails when weighed against New Jersey's \"strong policy\" supporting patient rights, the court added. \"Where the ultimate harm is death, even the low risk of transmis- sion justifies the adoption of a policy that precludes invasive procedures where there is 'any' risk of transmis- sion,\" it concluded. The court awarded damages to the doctor's estate for breach of con- fidentiality regarding his stay at the July 1991 ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 4 of 290hospital as a patient, ruling that the hospital's procedures do not pro- vide adequate privacy protection to the patient. New York court upholds deci- sion to keep HIV off communi- cable disease list-A New York court has upheld a decision by the state's health commission to keep HIV infection off a list of communi- cable diseases, rejecting a challenge from several doctors' organizations that sought to have the condition classified as \"dangerous to the pub- lic health.\" New York law permits the state health commissioner to place dis- eases on a list of communicable diseases that are dangerous to the public health. Cases of any disease on the list must be reported and traced. The health commissioner decided not to include HIV infec- tion because he thought the report- ing requirement would deter people from voluntarily being tested for the virus. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that the word \"may\" in the statute gives the health commission discretion about including diseases Civil---------- Continued from Page 2 The last part of Danforth' s triad (S. 1209) would address monetary damages. Unlike the House bill, S. 1209 would limit compensatory damages for women, disabled people and non-racial minorities in cases of intentional discrimination, based on the size of the employer. The bill would not provide punitive damages. Danforth' s bill would make busi- nesses with fewer than lOOemploy- ees liable for up to $50,000 in pain and suffering costs; the figure would rise to $150,000 for businesses with 100 or more workers. D July 1991 on the list, even if they are commu- nicable (as HIV is). Also, the court said a New York law calling for a list of sexually transmitted diseases also gives the commissioner latitude. On Capitol Hill -The Senate last month passed a bill (S. 173) that would allow regional Bell telephone companies to manufacture telecom- munications equipment, lifting a ban that was imposed after AT&T was order to divest in the early 1980s. Sponsored by Sen. Ernest Hollings, the proposed Telecommu- nications Equipment Research and Manufacturing Competition Act would allow the so-called \"Baby Bells\" to join with small manufac- turing companies to develop new products, such as adaptive telecom- munications equipment for hearing- impaired people. The committee report on the bill (S. Rpt. 102-41) says: \"lifting the manufacturing restriction should benefit all citizens and particularly those with disabilities .... Allowing the [regional companies] to engage in manufacturing will help ensure [the development] of products and services specifically designed to meet the needs of disabled persons.\" A number of disability groups support the measure. Alfred Sonnestrahl, executive director of Telecommunications for the Deaf Inc., said S. 173 would help \"deaf, hard-of-hearing and speech-im- paired persons gain access to the 'information age,' creating the inte- gration of ... people with disabili- ties and the general public.\" AT&T and a number of con- sumer groups oppose the bill on the grounds that it would lead to higher phone bills and allow the Bell com- panies to monopolize the industry. Also in the Senate, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has introduced leg- islation that would provide at least $2 million a year to conduct re- search and create demonstration projects on transportation for people with disabilities. The bill (S. 1224), the Accessible Transportation Ac- cess Act, would extend a program begun by Congress in 1988. The bill would fund training programs for transit drivers on serving disabled passengers and help transit agencies in purchasing accessible vehicles. 0 Mark your calendars July 26 marks the one-year anniversary of the signing of the ADA -and is also the day that the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the law must have their regulations completed and pub- lished. The federal government isn't known for meeting deadlines, but officials from the Justice Department and the EEOC insist that their rules (covering public accommodations and employment) will be out on time. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, which is devising ADA accessibility standards, also says it will make the July 26 deadline. Rules from the Transportation Department will probably be issued later in the year. Another date to keep in mind -Jan. 26, 1992 -is the effective date for the public accommodations and state and local government provisions of the act. 0 ADA Compliance Guide 5 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 5 of 290Justice Dept. to award technical assistance grants for ADA compliance programs The U.S. Justice Department plans to award up to $2.5 million in technical assistance grants to help public accommodations and state and local governments comply with the ADA. The department is seeking ap- plications from individuals and non- profit entities that propose \"cost ef- fective and efficient approaches of disseminating information and pro- ducing voluntary compliance with the requirements of the ADA.\" Pref- erence will be given to projects that are joint ventures between covered entities and people with disabilities. Justice must provide technical assistance for public agencies and private businesses covered by titles II and ill of the act, and it wants to get these projects off the ground soon in anticipation of the Jan. 26, 1992, ef- fective date for both sections. Targeted industries Although the technical assis- tance efforts are open to all types of businesses subject to title III of the ADA, Justice is particularly inter- ested in developing guidance on barrier removal and auxiliary aids for six targeted industries: restau- rants, hotels and motels, retail stores, hospitals and health care facilities, places of assembly (such as stadi- ums, theaters and convention cen- ters) and day care facilities. Materi- als would focus on issues unique to these industries, such as accessibil- ity in restaurant dining rooms or hotel check-in procedures. Other issues include training law enforcement personnel to better in- teract with disabled people whose conditions may mistakenly appear to be disorderly conduct (such as epilepsy) and developing auxiliary aids and accommodations that would enable disabled people to partici- pate in courses and examinations. 6 Strategies Applications for technical as- sistance grants must discuss com- ponents of program strategy, Jus- tice said. Although not required, Justice suggested several program activities that could be included in the proposals: achieve specific cases of vol- untarycompliance ( whichJustice con- a \"very important\" activity); and distribute ADA materials; set up telephone information lines; create training courses; develop model compliance programs; and develop dispute resolution programs. Coordinating with other federal agencies An important aspect of the pro- posals, the department said, is to coordinate Justice-funded programs with technical assistance sponsored by other federal agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportu- nity Commission (EEOC). EEOC and Justice plan to jointly fund a contract to train a cross- section of disabled people in under- standirig the requirements of titles I, II and III of the ADA. People trained under this program would then edu- cate other disabled people, busi- nesses and state and local govern- ments about the act, as well as work to develop informal dispute resolu- tion methods. (For more informa- tion about this contract, contact Chris Bell at EEOC (202) 663-4177 or James Bennett at Justice (202) 307-2220.) In addition, the National Insti- tute of Disability Research and ADA Compliance Guide Rehabilitation (NIDRR) and the Re- habilitation Services Administration (RSA) intend to fund ADA-related assistance projects (see below). What works, what doesn't Finally, Justice said part of its long-term planning is to determine what types of technical assistance programs (e.g., education or com- pliance strategies) are most effec- tive. Applications therefore should describe ways and criteria to measure the performance of the proposal. Applications for the Justice grants (which will range between $85,000and$120,000)mustbesub- mitted by July 22. For more infor- mation, contact James Bennett or Philip Breen in the Office on the Americans with Disabilities Act, (202)307-2220and(202)307-2226, respectively. This notice was pub- lished in the June 5 Federal Regis- ter, Pages 25980-25983. NIDRR proposes ADA projects The National Institute on Dis- ability Research and Rehabilitation atthe U.S. Department of Education has proposed funding priorities to help implement the ADA. Under NIDRR's plan, grants would be awarded for establishing national peer training, developing training materials and resources (on accessibility/public accommoda- tions, employment and communi- cations/telecommunications) and setting-up regional disability and business accommodation centers. Both the Senate and House re- ports that accompanied the fiscal 1991 appropriations bill for the de- partments of Labor, Health and Hu- man Services and Education and related agencies called on NID RR to provide technical assistance for the July 1991 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 6 of 290I ( new disability law. The House spe- cifically recommended that 10 new regional centers on disability be established. For more information NIDRR's proposal, contact David Esquith (202) 732-5081. This notice was published in the May 21 Federal Register, on Pages 23336-23342. Also within the Education De-partment, the Rehabilitation Services Administration has proposed two ADA-related initiatives. The first project would create statewide advo- cacy and protection pilot projects so that people with severe disabilities would be ensured their rights under federal and state disability laws, including the ADA, the Fair Ho\u00b5sing Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Additionally, RSA plans to fund projects that would train vocational rehabilitation and employment counselors in the requirements of titles I (employment) and III (public accommodations) of the ADA.

It's unlikely July 1991 ADA Complian ce Guid e that cards themselves will have to be available in braille to accommodate visually-impaired users because the cardholder' s name and card number are already printed in raised letter- ing on the front. It may be necessary, however, to raise the customer ser- vice phone number that appears on the back of the card (and perhaps move it to the front of the card). Customer service telephone fa- cilities will probably have to have telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDDs) available to handle calls from hearing-impaired people. Our company is holding a busi- ness meeting for several field of- fices. As part of the conference, we are sponsoring field trips to tourist sites for the employees. Are we responsible for ensuring the accessibility of the tourist spots under the ADA? You aren't responsible for mak- ing the tourist sites accessible, but under the ADA, you must offer the employees with disabilities the ben- efits you offer to non-disabled em- ployees. This would include provid- ing accessible transportation and equivalent sightseeing benefits. Gen- erally, the purpose of these sidetrips is to boost morale by allowing em- ployees to socialize informally. Not all employees need to interact at the same places, but disabled employ- ees must have the opportunity to socialize. There's nothing to pre- vent you from offering some trips or activities at accessible sites. 0 7 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 7 of 290( \\ ( ADA COMPLIANCE GUIDE Filing Instructions: July 1991 In this month's update you'll find the latest issue of your ADA Monthly Bulletin newsletter.

July 1991 xiii This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 11 of 290Applicability of the ADA ~241 Also, Section 104(d)(2) of the ADA specifically permits employers to conduct drug testing of job applicants and employees and make employment decisions based on the results of those tests. Employers must, of course, comply with other applicable federal, state or local laws concerning quality control, confidentiality and rehabilitation in conducting the tests, however. Finally, the act specifically permits employers to \"adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug testing\" (\u00a7104(b)(3)) to ensure that individuals who are participating in or have completed supervised drug rehabilitation programs are not currently using illegal drugs. Employers may refuse to hire an applicant or may take action against an employee who tests positive for drugs if the test accurately detects the presence of drugs. This is true even if the individual who tested positive states that he or she has ceased using drugs. ~242 Communicable Diseases People with contagious diseases, such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, AIDS or infection with the HIV virus, are considered disabled under the ADA. However, this coverage extends only to people whose condition does not pose a health or safety risk to themselves or co-workers. Specifically, section 103(b) of the ADA permits employers to require that individuals with ( currently infectious diseases or infections do not pose a \"direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the work place.\" According to the Senate report that accompanied the legisla- tion (Sen. Rpt. 101-116, p. 40), this direct threat would mean \"the person [poses] a significant risk of transmitting the infection to others in the work place which cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\" This is consistent with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is based on interpretations of the Rehabilitation Act by Congress, the U.S. Su- preme Court and the U.S. Justice Department. The Supreme Court best explained this policy in connection with a teacher who had recur- ring, but non-contagious, tuberculosis (School Board of Nassau County v. Arline , 480 U.S. 273 (1987); see Appendix V:2). The teacher was fired after a relapse of the disease, without any attempt to provide accommodation, because of the fears that she might infect her students and co-workers. In determining whether to include contagious diseases as disabilities for purposes of section 504, the Court wrote: The fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose a serious health threat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the act all persons with actual or perceived contagious diseases. Such exclusion would mean that those accused of being contagious would never have the opportunity to have their condition evaluated \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. July 1991 Tab 200 Page 63 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 12 of 2901[242 Applicability of the ADA in light of medical evidence and a determination made as to whether they were \"otherwise qualified.\" Following that decision, the Justice Department reversed its 2-year-old position considering people with AIDS and HIV infection not disabled for purposes of section 504. Also, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act in 1988 to expand the definition of disability in section 504 to include contagious diseases, provided infected persons do not threaten the health and safety of others and are able to perform their jobs. The Arline decision also makes it clear that any claim that an individual's contagiousness poses a direct threat must be established on the basis of objective evidence, such as the sound medical judgments of public health officials. Generalized assumptions, subjective fears and speculation are not sufficient to prove such a direct threat. *Special considerations for food handlers After much debate, Congress included special provisions in the ADA concerning employees who handle food and have communicable diseases. First of all, the act directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and publish annually a list of \"infectious and commu- nicable diseases which are transmitted through handling of the food supply,\" as well as the \"methods by which such diseases are transmitted\" (\u00a7 103(d)(l)). This list was published in the May 16, 1991, Federal Register (Pages 22726-22727) by the national Centers for Disease Control. (The list is reprinted in Figure 242-A.) CDC developed the list in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, state and local health officers and national public health organizations. Section 103(d)(2) of the act permits employers to \"refuse to assign or continue to assign\" to a job involving food handling any individual who has a disease on this list and the risk of contagion cannot be eliminated through the use of reasonable accommodation. Naturally, reas- signment to a job that does not involve food handling would always be a reasonable accommoda- tion in this case. (See ~250 and ~330 for discussions of reasonable accommodations.) *Two categories The CDC list is divided into two categories. The first consists of pathogens often transmitted through food handling by contaminated people. CDC noted that \"the contamination of raw ingre- dients from infected food-producing animals and contamination during processing are more important causes of foodborne diseases than is contamination of food by persons with infectious or contagious diseases.\" However, CDC acknowledged that some pathogens are frequently trans- mitted through food by infected people. * Indicates new or revised material. Page 64 Tab 200 July 1991 ADA Compliance Guide This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 13 of 290( Applicability of the ADA ~242 Included in this first category are viruses that cause hepatitis-A, salmonella and dysentery, which could be present in people who have symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, open skin sores, dark urine or jaundice. These conditions can be spread if infected food workers fail to wash their hands (in situations such as after using the toilet, handling raw chicken, cleaning spills or carry- ing garbage), wear clean gloves or use clean utensils. Non-foodborne transmission (person to person) is another means of transmitting these pathogens. The second category consists of pathogens occasionally transmitted through food by infected people, but usually spread by other routes (including at the source, in food processing or by non- foodborne means). Preventing food contact by people who have acute diarrhea will decrease the risk of transmitting these pathogens, CDC said.

July 1991 Tab 200 Page 65 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 14 of 290( ( Employment ~310 For example, a person in a wheelchair applies to be the only secretary at Company A. At this company, the essential job functions for the secretary are typing, taking shorthand, answering the phone and delivering mail. The secretary also lifts boxes and runs occasional errands, but these are considered non-essential duties because they are infrequent and could be assigned to any of several other employees. Under the ADA, Company A may evaluate only the applicant's ability to perform the essen- tial tasks (testing her typing, shorthand and phone skills). It may not, however, inquire about her ability to drive or lift heavy items, or deny her the job (if she is the most qualified applicant) because her condition precludes these things. Company A would be required to reasonably accommodate her disability. In this case, the accommodation could be as simple as reassigning errands and lifting to another employee, per- haps in exchange for the secretary assuming other tasks. If steps within the office prevented mail delivery, then a ramp could be installed. No employer is required to employ any individual who, even with an accommodation, is unable to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and safely. Such an individual would not be considered qualified . If no reasonable accommodation would enable the disabled individual to perform the job in question, the employer can, solely on the basis of the individual's disability, terminate the employee or deny employment to the applicant. In the example above, Company A would not have to hire the applicant if she did not know shorthand. Reassigning that responsibility (an essential function) to another employee would not be a reasonable accommodation, because there are not other employees who have that skill . The employer cannot establish any blanket rule excluding people with certain disabilities, except in the very limited situation where in all cases a physical condition by its very nature would prevent a person with a disability, even with reasonable accommodation, from performing the essential functions of that position. An example of such a case might be to exclude all deaf people as telephone operators. ~311 Health and Safety Considerations Even if a disabled person is qualified to perform a job, an employer may deny employment to an applicant or dismiss an employee if the employment would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others or to property (\u00a7103(b)). Such a determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, and the employer must show that the person poses a significant risk, not just a speculative or remote one. The ADA defines a direct threat as a \"significant risk to the health and safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation\" (\u00a7101(3)). \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. July 1991 Tab 300 Page 27 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 15 of 290~311 Employment Health and safety considerations probably receive the most attention in the area of contagious diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis. The ADA makes it clear that people with communicable diseases are covered by the act, and that they can be denied employment only if they pose a threat to the health and safety of others. The ADA contains a limited exception of coverage for people with contagious diseases in food-handling positions (\u00a7103(d)). The law requires the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to publish a list of communicable diseases that may be transmitted through food-handling (~242). As a reasonable accommodation, employers may reassign employ- ees with a disease included on that list to positions not involving food-handling. Such an accom- modation is subject to the undue harship limitation (~251). Thus, if no appropriate position were available, then the employer would have the right to terminate the affected employee or not hire the job applicant. See ~230 for a detailed discussion of how ADA protects people with communicable diseases. ~312 Perception of Disability The ADA's definition of disability also bars employers from discriminating against people who have had a disabling condition or are perceived to be disabled. One situation in which this can occur is when a person has had a disability that has been cured. An employer cannot base an ( employment decision on an employee's or applicant's history of a disability, such as cancer, because the employer is afraid that the disease will recur, or because the employer believes that the individual is somehow \"less able\" to perform the work. Similarly, an employer may not discriminate against someone with an impairment that is not a disability but that the employer regards as a disability. Common examples of this include burns, limps and lisps. The ADA also prohibits employers from discriminating against an able-bodied employee or applicant because of any association or relationship that person might have with a disabled individual. Thus, it would be illegal to deny employment to an able-bodied person whose spouse has AIDS because the employer fears that the employee will have frequent absences to attend to the spouse. Likewise, it would be discriminatory to terminate employees whose spouses or chil- dren became disabled because of a fear that the employees might miss work to care for them. However, if such an employee proved unable to comply with the regular time and attendance policy -for whatever reason, including the illness of a family member -then it would not be discriminatory to fire that employee.

The list is intended to be used by the food-service industry in dealing with workers who are infected with conta- gious diseases. People with communicable diseases are protected by the ADA, as long as they don't pose a threat to the health and safety of others. However, Congress provided a limited exemp- tion to that coverage by allowing restaurant owners and other food-related employers to transfer employees who are infected with any of the pathogens on the list (such as hepatitis- A and salmonella) to non-foodhandling jobs, if any are available. If no other positions are open or the risk of spreading the disease can't be eliminated by reasonably accommodating the affected work- ers, the employer can fire them without violat- ing the ADA. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services must annually publish and distribute a list of infectious diseases that can be trans- mitted through the food supply and the means by which such diseases are spread. CDC de- veloped this first list (published in the May 16 Federal Register) along with the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, state and local health officials and na- tional public health organizations. Two categories The CDC list is divided into two categories, the first consisting of pathogens often trans- mitted through food handling by infected people. Included in this list are viruses that cause hepatitis-A, salmonella and dysentery, which could be present in people who have symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, open skin sores, dark urine or jaundice. CDC said these pathogens can be spread if infected food workers fail to wash their hands (in situations such as after using the toilet , handling raw chicken, cleaning spills or carry- ing garbage), wear clean gloves or use clean utensils. Non-foodbome transmission (i.e., per- son to person) is another means of transmission. The second category consists of pathogens occasionally transmitted through food by Federal Programs Advisory Service Thompson Publishing Group 1725 K Street, N.W.

Prevent- ing food contact by people who have acute di- arrhea will decrease the risk of transmitting these pathogens, CDC said. AIDS and HIV infection are not included in the CDC list. Title II accessibility guidelines postponed State and local governments and transporta- tion officials will have to wait a couple of months for ADA accessibility guidelines from the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Access board Executive Director Larry Roffe announced that work on title II stan- dards will be postponed until after final guide- lines for title III (public accommodations) are issued. He predicted that the title II standards would be finished by the fall. Under the ADA, the board was to have issued final standards for titles II and III by April 26, 1991. Most of the access board's effort has been directed at developing accessibility guidelines for private businesses covered by title III, which has delayed work on the rules for state and local governments, Roffe said. In the in- terim, he suggested that public officials use the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UF AS -see Appendix ill) for ADA compliance. Most federal agencies cite UF AS in their sec- tion 504 regulations. Similarly, work has been delayed on final transportation guidelines, which the Depart- ment of Transportation will probably use in its ADA regulations. The access board proposed standards for transit vehicles and facilities in March. New York court upholds decision to keep HIV off communicable disease list A New York court has upheld a decision by the state's health commission to keep HIV in- fection off a list of communicable diseases, re- jecting a challenge from several doctors' orga- nizations that sought to have the condition classified as \"dangerous to the public health.\" New York law permits the state health com- missioner to place diseases on a list of com- municable diseases that are dangerous to the public health. Cases of any disease on the list must be reported and traced. The health com- missioner decided not to include HIV infec- tion because he thought the reporting require- ment would deter people from voluntarily be- ing tested for the virus. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that the word \"may\" in the statute gives the health commission discretion about including diseases on the list, even if they are communicable (as HIV is). Also, the court said a New York law calling for a list of sexually transmitted diseases also gives the commissioner latitude.

Congress intends to overhaul the law next year to incor- porate provisions of the ADA (see Supple- ment No. 151, June 1991). The House Subcommittee on Health has ap- proved legislation (H.R. 2311) that would create a new block grant for states to help people with mental disabilities. The bill would authorize $270 million in fiscal year 1992. States would have to submit plans outlining their needs for fa- cilities to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Senate last month passed a bill (S. 173) that would allow regional Bell telephone compa- nies to manufacture telecornrnunications equip- ment, lifting a ban that was imposed after Court rules compensatory, but not punitive, damages available under section 504 A person may sue for compensatory dam- ages and request a jury trial under section 504, the U.S. District Court for the Northern Dis- trict of Illinois has ruled. But, the court said, punitive relief is not available. . . . Julio Cortes sued Northeastern Illm01s Um- versity for alleged employment discrimination based on disability. Cortes, who uses a wheel- chair, was passed over for a position at the university, despite being rated the most quali- fied candidate. According to testimony, a member of the committee interviewing candi- dates repeatedly asked Cortes improper ques- tions about his disability. The Rehabilitation Act doesn't specify if people can sue for damages under section 504. The Supreme Court has ruled that equitable relief (such as back pay) is available, but lower federal courts are divided over whether compensatory damages are available. Looking to other decisions, the District Court ruled that \"the weight of authority sup- ports the view\" that plaintiffs may seek com- pensatory damages under section 504. Such damages, it added, are \"arguably necessary to accomplish the statutory goals.\" July 1991 3 AT&T was ordered to reorganize in the early 1980s. Sponsored by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D- S.C., the proposed Telecommunications Equipment Research and Manufacturing Com- petition Act would allow the so-called \"Baby Bells\" to join with small manufacturing com- panies to develop new products, such as adap- tive telecommunications equipment for hear- ing-impaired people. Also in the Senate, Sen. John Kerry, D- Mass., has introduced legislation that would provide at least $2 million a year to conduct research and create demonstration projects on transportation for people with disabilities. The bill (S. 1224), the Accessible Transportation Access Act, would extend a program begun by Congress in 1988, fund training programs for transit drivers on serving disabled passengers and help transit agencies purchase accessible vehicles. The court held that punitive damages are not available. Such a remedy is \"not necessary to 'make good the wrong' when [the] plaintiff is already being allowed to seek back pay, front pay, compensatory damages and even re- instatement,\" the court said. Finally, the court held that Cortes was en- titled to a jury trial because he was seeking a legal remedy (compensatory damages) as well as equitable relief. This case is Cortes v. Board of Governors, Appendix IV:495. Employee with back pain who could perform most job tasks not handicapped under section 504, court rules An employee who complained of pain but could perform most of her responsibilities is not handicapped under section 504, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has ruled. Sandra Mitchiner is a position classification specialist for the D.C. Office of Personnel. She claimed that the agency discriminated against her based on disability after she had experienced back and wrist pain from muscle strains and falls. Mitchiner cited a report of a doctor who di- agnosed her as having \"chronic pain syndrome.\" Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 19 of 2904 The doctor recommended that Mitchiner's job functions be modified to reduce the amount of lifting and writing, and that she be equipped with special furniture to reduce the strain on her back and wrist. But the court stated that the agency did ac- commodate Mitchiner, such as giving her a word processor, liberal leave, special furniture and more space than other employees. It also cited other medical reports, one of which said Justice Dept. to award grants for ADA technical assistance programs The U.S. Justice Department plans to award up to $2.5 million in technical assistance grants to help public establishments and state and local governments comply with the ADA. The department is seeking applications from individuals and non-profit organizations that propose \"cost effective and efficient approaches of disseminating information and producing vol- untary compliance with the requirements of the ADA.\" Preference will be given to joint ventures of covered entities and people with disabilities. Although the grants will be awarded to pro- vide technical assistance to all types of entities subject to titles II and ill of the ADA, Justice is particularly interested in developing guidance on barrier removal and auxiliary aids for six tar- geted industries: restaurants, hotels and motels, retail stores, hospitals and health care facilities, places of assembly (such as stadiums, theaters and convention centers) and day care facilities. Materials would focus on issues unique to these industries, such as accessibility in restaurant din- ing rooms or hotel check-in procedures. Other issues include training law enforce- ment personnel to better interact with disabled people whose conditions may mistakenly ap- pear to be disorderly conduct (such as epi- lepsy) and developing auxiliary aids and accom- modations that would enable disabled people to participate in courses and examinations. Applications for technical assistance grants must discuss components of program strategy, Justice said. Although not required, Justice Handicapped Requirements Handbook that although Mitchiner complained of pain, she could perform \"the vast majority of the functions assigned to her.\" The court concluded that Mitchiner did not suffer from any impairment which substan- tially limited her ability to work, and thus was not handicapped under the act. This case is Mitchiner v. District of Columbia, Appendix IV:496. suggested several program activities that could be included in the proposals: achieve specific cases of voluntary com- pliance (which Justice considers a \"very im- portant\" activity) develop and disseminate information on the ADA; set up telephone information lines; create training courses; develop model compliance programs; and develop dispute resolution programs. Applications for the grants (which will range from $85,000 to $120,000) must be submitted by July 22.

(June 5 Fed- eral Register, Pages 25980-25983.) HUD proposes internal section 504 regulations The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed regulations that would implement section 504 as it applies to HUD's programs and activities (24 C.F.R. Part 9). The rule would define handicapped, set standards for what constitutes discrimina- tion and establish a mechanism to resolve complaints.

The guidelines provide design and con- struction standards to help builders comply with the Fair Housing Amendments Act. HUD said builders, building code officials, architects and disabled people, among others, should attend the seminars. Topics to be dis- cussed include requirements of the Fair Hous- ing Act, relationship of the act to other laws, and design and construction requirements. For more information, contact the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, (202) 708-0015 (voice!fDD). The seminars are free, but advance registration is required.

Sept. 26 -Swissotel Chicago July 1991 ED proposes rule for state transition services programs 5 The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has proposed regulations (34 C.F.R. Part 325) that would enable the department to award one-time, five-year grants to state rehabilitation and educa- tional agencies to develop and improve transition services for disabled youth after they leave school. Congress created the authority for state transi- tion services programs when it reauthorized the Education of the Handicapped Act (and renamed it the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) last year. States that receive grants would be re- quired to increase the availability and improve the quality of transition services for disabled youth, help counselors, parents and advocates work with students, and improve working rela- tionships among educational personnel. For more information on the proposal, con- tact William Halloran at ED, (202) 732-1112. (June 11 Federal Register, Pages 26856- 26859.) Personnel training grants proposed by ED The Education Department intends to amend its regulations for the Training Personnel for the Education of Individuals with Disabilities pro- gram (34 C.F.R. Part 318) to incorporate changes in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act enacted by Congress in 1990. The proposed rules include provisions that would focus on special education of minority groups, add reporting re- quirements and change target populations. In addition, the department has proposed rules for a new program focusing on children and youth with serious emotion disturbance (34 C.F.R. Part 328). The proposed regulation would provide information about the kinds of projects supported under the program and ap- plication and selection criteria. These notices were published in the June 14 Federal Register, Pages 27473-27484. ED issues interim rules on 'protection of human subjects' An interim rule from the Education Department would ensure protections for disabled children and mentally disabled people who are the subject of research conducted by the National Institute of Disability Research and Rehabilitation. Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 21 of 2906 The regulation (34 C.F.R Parts 350 and 356) would require institutional review boards to in- clude at least one person concerned with the wel- fare of disabled children and mentally disabled people when the board reviews research that in- volves them. Our company, a federal grantee, is holding a business meeting for several field offices. As part of the conference, we are sponsor- ing field trips to tourist sites for the em- ployees. Are we responsible for ensuring the accessibility of the tourist spots under section 504? You aren't responsible for making the tour- ist sites accessible, but under section 504, you must offer the employees with disabilities the benefits you offer to non-disabled employees. This would include providing accessible trans- portation and equivalent sightseeing benefits. Generally, the purpose of these sidetrips is to boost morale by allowing employees to social- ize informally. Not all employees need to in- teract at the same places, but disabled employ- ees must have the opportunity to socialize. There's nothing to prevent you from offering some trips or activities at accessible sites. Would it be legal under section 504 for our municipal pool to charge disabled members a higher fee than it charges non-disabled members? The Parks Department receives federal funds. Charging a special rate could for disabled people would violate section 504. Fee struc- tures for facilities such as community pools can be based on several things, such as: usage (e.g., a higher rate for unlimited use), family status (e.g., higher rates for families than for singles), or income. However, it would appear difficult to justify a special rate for disabled members. Must all of our state parks have accessible trails as a result of the ADA or section 504? We have received funding from the U.S. Department of the Interior over the years, Handicapped Requirements Handbook The ED rule is a common rule issued by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and adopted by several other agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services. For more information, contact Edward Glassman (202) 401-3132. (June 18 Federal Register, Pages 28029-28032.) and some parks (but not all) have accessible trails and facilities. If you have been in compliance with the Re- habilitation Act because you receive federal funding, then you will likely be in compliance with the ADA. The question is whether your programs and services, including the trails, are accessible \"when viewed in their entirety.\" This means that not every trail has to be accessible, but could mean that at least one be accessible in a single park. This, too, would apply to camp- sites, nature centers and any other facilities you make available to the public in your parks. Currently, the National Council on Disabil- ity is conducting an ADA-mandated study on the accessibility of federal wilderness areas. Our university offers an adult education \"extension program\" through which classes are offered off-campus for a fee. The pro- gram is self-sufficient, paid for through the fee charged to participants. Would this pro- gram be covered by section 504? Yes, if your university receives federal funds, including student loans. When Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act in 1988, it amended section 504 to clarify that all programs and activities of a university are covered, not just the ones receiving federal funds. This means that even if the adult education program is self-suffi- cient, you would still have to make it accessible to disabled people if any of your other programs were federally funded. Additionally, such programs will be cov- ered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, regardless of whether or not you are subject to section 504. Programs offered by state and lo- cal public universities are covered by Title II of the ADA; private universities are covered by title III.

City of League City, 920 F.2d 311 (Sth Cir. 1991) Cons truction inspector who has Parkinson ' s diseas e not otherwise qualified to perform essential functions of the job A city did not violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act when it fired a construction inspector who would lose his balance and thus was unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. Antonio Chiari , an engineer who has Parkinson's disease, was a construction inspector for League City, Texas. Inspectors are re- sponsible for approving construction plans and verifying that the work was properly completed . Nearly half of the job is spent at construction sites visually inspecting contractors ' work, which re- quires considerable walking and climbing . In early 1987, Chiari began to have trouble walking; he was seen stumbling in the city hall and falling while at a construction site. At the request of his supervisor, Chiari was examined sepa- rately by two neurosurgeons, who found he had an unsteady \"shuffling gait and body rigidity.\" They both said his loss of bal- ance rendered him unable to continue his job as a construction in- spector and that he would be a danger to himself and others if he continued to work. Chiari's personal physician also examined him, and saw \"no particular limitation of [Chiari's] work, as long as he [did] not climb.\" City officials tried unsucces sfully to restructure the job to ac- commodate Chiari's condition. First, they assigned another in- spector to do on-site work while Chiari remained at his desk to re- view the plans. That arrangement did not work because to do the job properly , an inspector must review plans before visiting the site. They tried to create a new position, but could not due to budgetary constraints, and the city had no open positions for a transfer. After these attempts failed , the city fired Chiari in April 1987. He sued, charging that the dismissal violated section 504 and the Texas Human Rights Act. He said he had never fallen on or in- jured a co-worker , and that the risk of personal injury was not a factor under section 504. Chiari also argued that the city could have provided him with part-time work as an accommodation. The city said Chiari was not protected by section 504 because he could not perform the essential functions of the job, namely walking and climbing around construction sites safely. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled in favor of the city. That ruling was upheld by the 5th Cir- cuit, which agreed that Chiari was no longer qualified to be a con- struction inspector. Citing Arlin e (see Appendix IV:329) and other section 504 cases, the appeals court said a \"handicapped person cannot perform the essential functions of a job if his handicap poses a significant safety risk to those around him.\" To support its judgment, the court cited the neurosurgeons' di- agnoses that Chiari 's balance problem would prevent him from working safely. Chiari 's doctor concluded similarly when he was read the job description during the case. The appeals court disagreed with Chiari that the risk of per- sonal injury was immaterial. It cited section 501 regulations that include \"health and safety of the individual\" in the definition of qualified handicapped person. The existence of a personal safety rule in section 501 creates a similar rule under section 504, the court said. Finally, the court ruled that city officials \"went beyond their statutory duty in an effort to accommodate Chiari's disease\" and that they were not required to create a new part-time position as an accommodation. \"All the city must do is demon strate that a part-time schedule would not accommodate Chiari 's performance on that job that he is currently doing ,\" it said. \"Even if Chiari worked fewer hours, he still would not be able to climb buildings or climb into ditches , \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. July 1991 PAGE 257 [which are] 'essential functions ' of a construction inspector 's job.\" For the same reasons cited under section 504, the court found no violations of the Texas discrimination law. 493 Gault v. University of Chicago Hospitals, No. 90-C0321 (N.D. Ill. 1991) Epileptic nurse not otherwise qualified to work in burn unit of hospital A nurse who suffer s from epileptic seizures is not \"otherwise qualified\" within in the meaning of Section 504 of the Rehabilita- tion Act to work in the bum unit of a hospital, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled. Freida Gault sued the University of Chicago Hospitals for al- legedly violating section 504 when it dismissed her as a bum-unit nurse . Gault has idiopathic epilepsy, which causes her to have un- predictable generalized seizures. Before the onset of a seizure, Gault will stare blankly . She then experiences convulsions, falls to floor and loses consciousness. After she recovers, there is a period of confusion. Gault suffered seizures while on duty. According to hospital officials , seizures occurred while she was: using scissors to change a dressing ; assisting an infant's breathing apparatus \"re- sulting in extubation of the patient and her inability to summon needed medical care\" ; and cutting a dressing , which caused the patient to leave his room to summon help. Additionally, Gault suffered a head injury during one seizure that required emergency room treatment and made her unable to help a seriously burned patient on a ventilator and tube feeding. The hospitals knew of Gault's condition before they hired her, and did not relieve her from duty after the first seizure . One doc- tor at the hospital thought the seizures were under control and would not endanger her or others. Several seizures followed, how- ever, and Gault agreed to consult an expert from another hospital. That doctor told Gault that the seizures were not under control and that it was dangerous for her to work in a bum unit or operat- ing room. Gault would not tell hospital officials about this diagno- sis, and as a result, the hospitals placed her on leave. Based on these circumstances, the court ruled that Gault is not otherwise qualified because she was not meeting the position re- quirements of a bum-unit nurse . Further, the court found no sec- tion 504 violations on the part of the hospitals. Gault cannot \"contend that the decision process to remove her from the bum unit ... was motivated by prejudice against her handicap or was conducted unfairly ,\" the court said. \"The hospi- tals are indisputably willing to hire epileptics and to assign them to critical care units.\" 494 Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, No. 88 Civ. 5376 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) Recovered alcoholic fails to prove disability as sole basis for job dismissal A rehabilitated alcoholic failed to prove he was fired from his job solely because of his disability , the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled. John Teahan, a telephone and telegraph maintainer for Metro- North Railroad , was fired for what the railroad said was excessive, unauthorized absenteeism . During a four-year span, Teahan 's drug and alcohol addiction caused him to miss many work days . In 1984 he was absent 19 days ; his absenteeism rose to 139 days in 1986 . He was disciplined for these absences. In early 1986 , Teahan sought help from the company's reha- bilitation program and voluntarily entered a hospital program. The treatment failed , however, and his substance abuse and absentee Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 26 of 290PAGE 258 ism returned. He missed 57 work days in 1987. Later that year, Teahan entered and successfully completed a month-long treat- ment program. As required by union rules, he returned to work in January 1988 and was not absent for any reason until being fired in April 1988. Teahan claimed the firing violated section 504 because the railroad acted against his disability. Section 504 protects rehabili- tated substance abusers from discrimination based on disability, but does not cover people whose current use of drugs or alcohol prevents them from performing their jobs or constitutes a direct threat to others or property. The railroad claimed that it acted solely based on Teahan's ex- cessive absenteeism and asked for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. The court acknowledged that Teahan raised issues of material fact that Metro-North did not disprove. First, the railroad argued that Teahan was not disabled within the meaning of section 504. However, the court said, Teahan had successfully completed treat- ment and was not absent before being fired. Based on this evi- dence, he could qualify as being rehabilitated and \"therefore within the protection of the act,\" the court noted. Second, Metro-North contended that Teahan was not otherwise qualified for his job because he could not be depended on to re- port to work. But noting that his prior absences were due to addic- tion and that he had not missed work since being rehabilitated, the court suggested that Teahan could be capable of reporting to work at the time of his dismissal. The court found that Metro-North would succeed on the issue that Teahan was legitimately fired only because of his absentee record. The court said Teahan failed to prove his argument that he was terminated solely based on his disability. Teahan, the court said, argued only that he was a member of a protected group without presenting evidence of disparate treat- ment. \"Teahan's assertion that Metro-North knew he had an alco- hol and drug problem is insufficient proof of discriminatory intent to survive a summary judgment,\" the court said. \"In fact, Teahan fails to present any affidavits, deposition or other evidence at all in opposition to Metro-North's motion.\" 495 Cortes v. Board of Governors, No. 89 C 3449 (N.D. Ill. 1991) Compensatory, but not punitive, damages available under section 504 A plaintiff may sue for compensatory damages and request a jury trial under section 504, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled. However, the court said punitive relief is not available. Julio Cortes, an employee of Northeastern Illinois University, sued the school for alleged employment discrimination based on disability. Cortes, who uses a wheelchair, was passed over for a position as director of a university program for Hispanic students, despite being rated the most qualified candidate. According to testimony, a member of the committee interviewing candidates repeatedly asked Cortes improper questions about his disability. The court denied the university's request for summary judgment, on the grounds that material issues of fact existed in the case. In this separate motion, the university asked the court to throw out Cortes' claim for damages (including compensatory and punitive damages, back pay and attorneys' fees) and a jury trial. The Rehabilitation Act does not specify whether a plaintiff can sue for damages under section 504. Instead, it references Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which authorizes relief \"consistent with the objectives of the statute.\" The Supreme Court, in Guardians v. \u00a9Th ompson Publishing Group, Inc. July 1991 Appendix IV Civil Service Commission (Appendix IV: 904), ruled that plaintiffs must allege intentional discrimination to get monetary relief under title VI. The Court further stated that victims of intentional discrimination may be entitled to compensatory awards. The District Court noted that federal courts are divided over the issue of whether compensatory damages are available under section 504. Some, it said, have cited Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which specifically states that only equitable relief is available. But the District Court held that the remedy portions of title VII are not analogous to section 504. Instead it cited Miener v. Missouri (Appendix IV:69), in which the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted that a House/Senate conference committee eliminated a provision that would have prohibited monetary damages when Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act in 1978. \"The weight of authority supports the view,\" the District Court said, that plaintiffs are entitled to seek compensatory damages under section 504. Such damages, it added, \"are arguably necessary to accomplish the statutory goals.\" The court held that punitive damages are not available. Such a remedy is \"not necessary to 'make good the wrong' when [the] plaintiff is already being allowed to seek back pay, front pay, compensatory damages and even reinstatement,\" the court said. Finally, the court held that Cortes was entitled to a jury trial because he was seeking a legal remedy (compensatory damages) as well as equitable relief. 496 Mitchiner v. District of Columbia, No. 89-0720 (D.D.C. 1991) Employee with history of back and wrist pain is not handicapped under section 504 An employee who complained of pain but was able to perform the vast majority of her responsibilities is not handicapped under section 504, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled. Sandra Mitchiner, a position classification specialist for the Washington, D.C. Office of Personnel, alleged that the agency discriminated against her based on disability after she had experienced back and wrist pain from muscle strains and falls. Mitchiner cited a report of a doctor who diagnosed her as having \"chronic pain syndrome.\" This doctor recommended that Mitchiner's job functions be modified to reduce the amount of lifting and writing, and that she be equipped with special furniture to reduce the strain on her back and wrist. The court noted that the agency did accommodate Mitchiner, giving her a word processor, liberal leave, special furniture and more space than other employees. It also cited other medical reports, one of which indicated that although Mitchiner com- plained of pain, she could perform \"the vast majority of the functions assigned to her.\" One doctor found that she could work 8-hour days (with specific breaks every 30 minutes), as well as lift and grip items with both hands. Another said Mitchiner had \"no compensable disability ... and nothing to prevent [her] from returning to work immediately without limitations.\" The court concluded that Mitchiner did not suffer from any impairment which substantially limited her ability to work, and thus was not considered handicapped under the act.

This new service will help us do that,\" said EEOC Chairman Evan J. Kemp, Jr. Businesses urge restraint, disability groups seek rights in comments to EEOC According to the commission, ADA Services will have two divi- sions: ADA Policy and ADA Tech- nical Assistance. The policy branch will develop regulations under both the ADA and sections 501and504 of the Rehabilitation Act (which cover non-discrimination by the fed- eral government and federal grant- ees, respectively). The EEOC pro- posed ADA regulations in February (see March 1991 Monthly Bulletin). IN THIS ISSUE Nearly 800 groups and individu- als have submitted comments to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concerning its proposed rules on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Overall, the comments were sup- portive of the commission's attempt to put the employment provisions of the act into a regulatory framework (although one Washington-state business owner complained that the \"whole thing is bunk and should be thrown out\"). As can be expected, disability groups generally sought a broad reading of the statute with respect to the rights of disabled people. 1 ADAcom- ments flood EEOC 4 John Wodatch: the ADA 'point man' at Justice 6 Making accommoda- tions beyond the physical THOMPSON PuBLISHING GROUP 1725 K ST.

Published in the Feb. 28 Fed- eral Register, the draft regulations would prohibit public and private employers from discriminating against qualified job applicants and employees on the basis of disability (see March 1991 Monthly Bulletin). The rules would bar disability bias in all aspects of the employment process, from applications and in- terviews to employee benefits and 7 See Comments, Page 2 New civil rights bill offered WASHINGTON, D.C. 20006 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 28 of 290Comments-------- Continuedfrom Page 1 employer-sponsored social activi- ties. The EEOC must issue final rules by July 26, 1991. The em- ployment provisions become ef- fective July 26, 1992, for businesses with 25 or more employees and July 26, 1994, for employers with 15 or more workers. \"An administrative and legal quagmire\" A sampling of the comments reveals a willingness from busi- ness groups to embrace the spirit of the ADA, although there is some resistance to certain parts of the law. A representative of Arby's restaurants wrote that the proposed rule will \"create an administrative and legal quagmire that will inhibit and possibly prohibit a small busi- ness like ours to remain solvent.\" Writing on behalf of The Bai- ley Company (which operates, builds and staffs Arby's), J. Mark Eagleton had many concerns about the draft rules, among them a con- tention that disabled workers, while dependable, are \"less productive workers.\" Among his comments were suggestions that a company need not spend more than .5 per- cent of its after-tax profits on all reasonable accommodations, and that the cost of hiring readers, inter- preters or other assistants for a dis- abled worker should come out of that person's salary. The Bailey Company also con- tends that employers should be ex- cused from lawsuits or fines until the EEOC offers technical assis- tance. A lengthy set of comments was submitted by the Equal Employ- ment Advisory Council, a Wash- ington, D.C.-based coalition of businesses. The council raised nu- merous issues in its comments, 2 among them the use of the words \"primary\" and \"intrinsic\" in the EEOC's proposed definition of es- sential job functions. The council said these terms are subjective and not useful for determining whether a particular function is essential. Neither word appears in the statute or legislative history, the council said. Instead, it suggested that the EEOC focus on the difference between whether a task is essential or marginal to the position. Regarding reasonable accom- modation, the council said an em- ployer should only be responsible for accommodating known disabili- ties, and that the employee is re- sponsible for identifying and re- questing an accommodation. Em- ployers should not have to elimi- nate essential job functions through job restructuring, the comments stated. Further, the council said, the final rule should clarify that an ac- commodation is not necessarily \"reasonable\" for one employee merely because the employer made it for a different individual. In other areas, the council rec- ommended that the EEOC: recognize \"good faith efforts\" as evidence of compliance, even if a particular accommodation is not provided; coordinate with requirements imposed on federal contractors un- der Section 503 of the Rehabilita- tion Act (such as the invitation for self-identification); incorporate into the final rules much of the interpretative guid- ance found in the appendix to the draft rules; and retain language in the pro- posed rules that employers may legitimately consider individual safety when determining if a dis- abled applicant can perform the essential job functions. Substance abuse One issue raised by several commenters was the EEOC' s pro- posed coverage of substance abus- ers. Current illegal drug users are not protected by the ADA.

It also protects alcoholics, as long as their alcoholism doesn't in- terfere with their work or pose a threat to others or property. Employer groups generally sup- ported a conservative approach to- ward covering substance abusers. The Equal Employment Advisory Council, for example, said the final rule should \"clarify that private em- ployers, as well as law enforcement agencies, may impose a qualifica- tion standard excluding past users of illegal drugs.\" Additionally, the council pro- posed that employers be allowed to refuse to rehire someone fired for substance abuse, even if the em- ployee successfully undergoes treat- ment. It also asked the EEOC to make clear in the rules that casual drug users are not covered by the act. Substance-abuse rehabilitation organizations and agencies took the position that drug use and alcohol- ism should be specifically mentioned in the rules as examples of physical and mental impairments, as the Jus- tice Department did in its proposed public accommodations rules (see March 1991 Monthly Bulletin). One recurring issue raised was the EEOC time frame to determine if someone is \"currently engaging\" in drug use. In the appendix to the draft rules, the commission indi- cated that \"current\" is not limited to drug use \"on the day of, or within a matter of days or weeks before the employment action in question.\" Christine Lubinski, public policy director for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc., said this definition provides no time frame at all and would allow inquiries about \"drug use occurring many weeks or months before the June 1991 employment decision.\" Arthur Webb, director of New York state's Division of Substance Abuse, said the definition \"opens the door to the legal discrimination of substance abusers in employment and contin- ues a propensity for exclusion.\" Lubinski recommended that EEOC adopt language from the Jus- tice Department, which defines \"cur- rent\" as the illegal use of drugs that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current or that continu- ing use is a real and ongoing prob- lem.\" Disability groups contend that the 'risk-to-self' argument, as used by employers, is perhaps \"the most pervasive basis of discrimination\" against disabled people. She also objected to a provision in the appendix that allows employ- ers to categorically exclude people with a history of drug use from cer- tain positions. \"This suggestion flies in the face of the legislative history of the [ADA] which clearly sup- ported individualized determina- tions and prohibited this kind of blanket rule,\" she said. \"This appendix reference invites business and industry to establish policies which effectively screen out recovered drug-dependent persons, regardless of length of sobriety and ability to perform the job.\" Fear of paternalism Many disabled individuals and advocacy groups submitted com- ments prepared by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF), which had several con- cerns with the EEOC draft. Among ADA Compliance Guide them was the issue of \"threat to oneself.\" Under the EEOC rules, an em- ployer could require individuals to be able to perform the essential func- tions of a job, without posing a di- rect threat to the health or safety of themselves or others. The ADA mentions only the threat to others, although courts have invoked the \"risk to self' standard in cases under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. DREDF contends that the risk- to-self argument \"is perhaps the most pervasive basis of discrimination against persons with disabilities. The concern about risk to self is usually economic or paternalistic. Neither are strong policy reasons to deny work to a person with a disability for 'his own good.\"' The group would like the risk- to-self standard eliminated. But if it's kept, DREDF said, the rules should make clear that \"concerns about increased costs or paternalism based on stereotype will not suf- fice\" as a defense for not hiring a disabled person. Also, risk should be based on a present condition, not on speculation about the future course of the disability. In other areas, DREDF wrote that including daily attendant care in the list of possible reasonable accommodations is of \"the highest priority.\" EEOC indicated that per- sonal assistants, for page turning or travel, are examples of accommo- dations, but that employers are not required to provide aids for per- sonal, non-job related services. DREDF said the regulations should make clear that daily atten- dant care during work hours for toileting, eating, driving, etc., isjob- related. \"Without this explicit clari- fication, many severely disabled in- dividuals will be unable to attain or retain employment. \"D 3 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 30 of 290John Wodatch: the ADA \"point man\" at the Department of Justice Civil rights official says ADA compliance involves \"common sense\" John Wodatch has been a busy man lately. Across from his desk sit 16 loose-leaf notebooks filled with 2,500 comments -more than 15,000 pages -that were submitted in response to the Justice Department's proposed rules on titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. And as the department's point man on the ADA, it's his job to read them. \"We are going through them, we are reading every single one, analyzing them all,\" Wodatch said. \"They're very good- they're very we didn't get a lot of 'we're shocked and appalled that that you 're doing this.' Certainly there were disagreements with choices we have made. There were a lot of suggestions.\" W odatch heads the Office on the Americans with Disabilities Act, the division at Justice respon- sible for getting out the rules and technical advice to the estimated 3.8 million businesses that will be affected by the public accommodations provisions of the act. His office will also issue regulations for state and local governments. For Wodatch and his colleagues at Justice, the comment process (what he calls \"our reality check\") is the second stage in the long and involved process of codifying the ADA. The department issued draft rules for both public accommodations and public services in February (see March 1991 Monthly Bulle- tin). Final versions are due July 26, 1991. \"Our goal in the regulation is to keep the same balance as there is in the statute, which is between providing access for persons with disabilities while still recognizing that there's a price tag that comes along with this for business,\" he said. W odatch sometimes refers to that balance in the ADA as the \"unlesses\" - a business must provide auxiliary aids, unless it imposes an undue burden or a fundamental alteration, for example. An employer must provide reasonable accommodations to dis- abled employees, unless that imposes an undue hard- ship. This equivocal aspect of the law is an issue for Justice in writing the regulations. \"There's a certain tension between giving flex- ibility to the entities covered by the ADA and at the same time giving them enough guidance so they know what's expected of them,\" Wodatch noted. \"We're trying to find the right mix of that in the regulations and it's a daunting task.\" The section 504 experience Wodatch is no stranger to disability issues. A veteran government lawyer, he's been involved with federal disability law for more than 15 years. He was director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Depart- ment of Health, Education and Welfare in 1977 when HEW issued the first regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The predecessor of the ADA, section 504 prohibits federal grantees from discriminating based on disability in their programs and activities. Wodatch believes the section 504 experience should ease the transition to ADA compliance for both the federal government and entities covered by the new law. Many of the terms in the ADA, such as reasonable accommodation, undue hardship and oth- erwise qualified, come from section 504. \"It was very important to have section 504 be the basis for the ADA because we did have the track record, we knew what it meant, and it would not only ease compliance, it would [also] let people know what was expected of them,\" he noted. Myths and misconceptions Wodatch said that while there is a \"great deal of knowledge\" that the ADA has been enacted, \"there's a great deal of misinformation about what it is.\" The ADA is a flexible law, he stressed. \"The federal government is not telling you how to run your businesses. It's telling you that you must open up your business to persons with disabilities and leaving op- tions to do it in the way that makes most sense given the services you provide and facility you provide them in.\" A common misconception among business is that altering one part of a building means that the entire building must be made accessible, Wodatch said. Under the ADA and the proposed Justice Department rules, if part of a building is renovated, the altered part must be accessible, but not the whole building. From the disabled community, W odatch senses an \"unawareness\" of some of the limitations in the ADA. Some activists portray the ADA as a \"new day\" for disabled people, he noted. And while that's true to a large extent, he said, \"the ADA is a very limited piece of legislation in terms of what's required.\" As an example, Wodatch pointed out that while businesses must provide auxiliary aids, they can 4 ADA Compliance Guide June 1991 ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 31 of 290( ( choose which auxiliary aid to provide and they don't have to do it if it's an undue burden. \"I don't think people have an appreciation of the checks and bal- ances in the ADA,\" he said. Issues to address Wodatch has identified a number of trends in the comments. One concerns people with hearing impair- ments, who feel that the proposed rule pays too much attention to mobility impairments and not enough to communications barriers. Title III of the ADA requires businesses to re- move communication barriers that are structural in nature, if it's readily achievable to do so. \"We don't have a lot about that in the rule tions may appear to be disorderly conduct (e.g., epilepsy, cerebral palsy); accessibility of state courts; and licensing procedures (i.e., hunting, pharmacy). What to do now Wodatch is heartened by the business-commu- nity response to the ADA, finding a \"great deal of willingness\" to comply with the law. The business attitude, he says, is \"just let us know what it is that we have to do.\" His advice? First, he said, businesses should become familiar with the law and develop ways to accommodate disabled people. \"Businesses should see this as an opportunity to provide their and we will correct that,\" W odatch said. Some disability groups want the department to reorder priori- ties for removing barriers. In the draft rule, Justice advised busi-\"Businesses should see [ADA] as an opportunity to provide their goods and services to a wider audience.\" goods and services to a wider audience,\" he said. \"They can see this as a marketing tool, not just another federal obligation.\" Compliance, he said, should involve a functional nesses with limited budgets to first remove barriers to entrances. Accessible bathrooms would be the second priority, access to goods and services the third, and any other changes to remove barriers the fourth. Groups would like the second and third priorities switched. Wodatch said the main complaint from the busi- ness community stemmed from the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's pro- posed ADA guidelines (see February 1991 Monthly Bulletin). Many disagreements with the specifics of the guidelines were based on a misunderstanding of what they meant, he said, but some were valid and will be addressed in the final standards. Justice ex- pects to reference the access board's guidelines in its final title III rules. State and local governments Wodatch said title II of the ADA, which covers state and local governments, hasn't gotten the atten- tion that has been paid to parts of the act that apply to the private sector. Many jurisdictions are covered by section 504 because they receive federal funds. \"[Title II] is not as ground-breaking as titles I or III, so it doesn't have the potential for major impact,\" he said. \"But in those areas where there will be changes, the impact will be great.\" Examples of key issues? Town halls (most aren't covered by section 504, and there are a lot of com- plaints about them, he said); \"911\" emergency ser- vices for hearing-impaired people; police department arrest procedures for disabled people whose condi--John Wodatch approach. During the debate on the ADA, some groups claimed the measure would cover \"900 different types\" of disabilities. Wodatch believes that's not a fair way of looking at the ADA. \"We're not talking about medical issues,\" he said. Instead, he said, a place of public accommodation will have to look at its business from just a few perspectives -mobility impairment, visual impair- ment, hearing impairment, limited manual dexterity and reduced mental capacity. For example, how will a dry cleaner work with someone in a wheelchair, or how will a store communicate with a deaf customer? W odatch also recommends that businesses seek advice from disability-rights and community organi- zations on accessibility issues. \"They shouldn't just rush off and hire an architect or talk to their attorney,\" he said. \"They should start doing some planning-can they put in a simple ramp, do they have to widen the door?\" Services normally offered to customers could be provided or adapted for disabled people, he added. Training staff to accommodate disabled custom- ers is also essential. (In their comments, disability groups spoke of \"codifying common courtesy,\" Wodatch said.) For example, a company can instruct staff to read menus or prices for blind people, to be patient when a customer needs more time to get a wallet, or to use a pad and pen with a deaf person. \"Alotof[compliance] iscommonsense,\"Wodatch said. \"And it's a different way of thinking about their business. But I think the first step is understanding the law.\"O June 1991 ADA Compliance Guide 5 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 32 of 290Psychologist advises businesses on making accommodations beyond the physical Mention \"reasonable accommo- dations\" to some employers and they think of one thing only-struc- tural changes to their offices or fa- cilities. Reasonable accommodation to them is synonymous with con- struction crews. It's true that some disabled em- ployees will need physical alter- ations in the workplace. Building a ramp over a couple of steps, install- ing grab bars in the restroom, per- haps widening a doorway, are some examples of what could be required of businesses as a result of the Ameri- cans with Disabilities Act. But many accommodations don't require a hammer and nails. Instead, according to a specialist in adaptive design, accommodations can often involve simple steps to help integrate disabled workers into the workplace, without causing fi- nancial burdens or renovation head- aches for the employer. \"With a reasonable accommo- dation, a [disabled] person can in- teract with the environment in a way that allows him or her to do the job,\" says Dr. Deborah Kearney, a psychologist and mechanical engi- neer. Accommodations, she says, help increase a person's capacity for work. Kearney spoke during a panel discussion on \"Accommodating Beyond the Physical\" at Expo '91: Access to the Workplace, sponsored by the Brooklyn Center for Inde- pendence of the Disabled and the United Way of New York City. Her Massachusetts-based firm, WorkStations, advises businesses on integrating ergonomics and adap- tive design into the workplace. Attitude change Kearney believes the first ac- commodation employers should 6 make is changing stereotypical atti- tudes about disabilities. Age, in- jury, disease -they affect every- one,\" she says. On average, Kearney notes, a person with a disabling condition will have 70 percent of the capaci- ties considered necessary for work. For example, a person with arthritis may not be able to reach or grip well, but will likely have other faculties, such as mobility, speech, vision, hearing, intellect and memory, that allow them to perform most jobs. All of these capacities, if im- paired, can be enhanced through technology (e.g., \"speaking\" com- puters, assistive listening devices, headset-controlled keyboards or mobility aids). Kearney noted that the cost of such technology has and will continue to drop as advances are made. \"See what the person is bringing to the job, not the disabling condi- tion,\" she says. \"Don't look at a person in a wheelchair and only see the wheelchair.\" \"Essential factors\" As part of her service, Kearney evaluates how a particular work- place can be adapted for greater ac- cess with respect to 22 \"essential factors.\" These factors can be physi- cal -for example, the layout of an office -but many involve non- physical aspects, such as noise, fa- tigue, participation and signage. Assessing these factors, Kearney says, helps determine the types of accommodations that can be made for disabled workers. And while the goal is to integrate the individual worker, often the change will have broader ramifications. \"You should consider the radius of effect,\" she says. \"One accommo- ADA Compliance Guide dation for one disabled worker may help the whole department. And there is a cross-benefit: the accom- modation aligns disabled workers with their peers, instead of making them different.\" Keeping these essential factors in mind, Kearney offered some sug- gestions on making non-physical accommodations in the workplace: Centralize offices in a \"circu- lar array.\" Most offices are arranged in a linear layout -cubicles or individual offices placed in a row. \"That layout makes it easy to vacuum, but doesn't do a thing for accessibility,\" Kearney says. As an accommodation for people with mobility impairments, she suggests that companies centralize important office functions, such as files, copy- ing facilities and lunch/break rooms. This would help provide access to people in wheelchairs by cutting down on the amount of travel and perhaps eliminating some barriers. Also, the circular layout fosters in- tegration of all employees, dis- abled or not, who would come to- gether in a central meeting place, Kearney noted . \"Map\" individual offices. One possible accommodation for an em- ployee in a wheelchair is to reduce the amount of maneuvering needed to get through the door and behind a desk in an office. This can be achieved, Kearney says, by \"map- ping\" the office -rearranging fur- niture and supplies so that equip- ment and items are easily within the employee's reach. What are some steps an employer can take? Kearney suggests reposi- tioning desks to expose the \"open\" side, placing heavier items closer, See Kearney, Page 7 June 1991 ( \\ This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 33 of 290( ( Democrats offer alternative civil rights package Democratic congressional lead- ers unveiled last month a compro- mise anti-job discrimination bill de- signed to break the impasse among lawmakers, business groups and the Bush administration that has sty- mied passage of new civil rights legislation.

Take advantage of resources on hand. Disabled people are often the best source of accommodations ideas. After interviewing disabled job applicants, Kearney advises, take them on a tour of the facility. This way, they can become familiar with the work environment and perhaps suggest accommodations they would need if employed there. Another approach is to ask cur- rent disabled employees for new ideas they may have about work- place accommodations. Fight noise with noise. Back- ground noise can be a problem for people who use hearing aids. Some hearing aids amplify sounds, mak- ing all noises louder. This makes it hard for the person using the device June 1991 ties Act references title VII as its enforcement scheme, passage of the civil rights bill would allow dis- abled workers to seek monetary awards under the ADA. In attempt to boost the bill's chance of passage, the Democrats proposed setting a $150,000 cap on to hear co-workers, speakers or phone conversations. Eliminating background noise in an office is a difficult, if not impossible task. To mitigate its ef- fects, Kearney suggests adding \"white noise\" that will diminish ex- traneous sounds and allow a person to concentrate. A small portable fan can often do the trick, she says. Recognize \"not obvious\" dis- abilities. Employers should recog- lead to \"not-obvious\" disabilities, particu- larly stress and fatigue, that also need accommodations. \"Everyone will face stress and fatigue on the job,\" says Kearney, \"but they're exacerbated by dis- abling conditions.\" For example, dependency on others leads to stress, while the need to shift positions while seated (something everyone does) contributes to fatigue. Common sense can be an effec- tive accommodation to mitigate the effects of stress and fatigue. Rather than evaluating employees for fa- ADA Compliance Guide the amount of punitive damages that women and minorities could col- lect. Currently, money damages are unavailable under title VII. Blacks may sue employers for unlimited damages to redress race discrimina- tion under a separate statute (known as section 1983). Civil rights groups claim that imposing a cap for women would be unfair. Meanwhile, the House was scheduled to take up H.R. 1, the version of the legislation originally endorsed by the Democrats and civil rights leaders. That bill, which passed both the House Judiciary and Education and Labor committees, contains no limit on damages.O tigue and stress at 9:00, wait until mid-morning, Kearney suggests, when work factors start to work against them. Flexibility also helps. Instead of scheduling out-of-office meetings for a disabled employee at 10:00 or 3:00, make them the first or last item of the day. This avoids the employee having to come to the office, leave, and come back again, which adds to the stress and fatigue levels. An- other alternative would be to hold the meeting in the employee's worksite. Make signs readable. \"Path- finding\" and display signs within offices can fall victim to art, while forsaking any practical value they would otherwise have. \"Take into consideration what people can see,\" Kearney says, recalling one client that mounted white signs with light- blue lettering -attractive, but not very useful. Consider color, letter size and contrast when designing signs, she advises.D 7 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 34 of 290ADA COMPLIANCE GUIDE Filing Instructions: June 1991 In this month's update you'll find the latest issue of your ADA Monthly Bulletin newsletter.

It is a survey of state laws that parallel the protections at the federal level extended under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilita- tion Act and the Architectural Barriers Act. The following citations reference who is protected under the state law (e.g., physically disabled people); where there is special coverage (e.g., public employment only), it is so noted. Citations to \"White Cane\" laws are included. These are statutes that traditionally provide crimi- nal sanctions for discrimination against blind people but now also extend in many cases to other disabled people. In certain states there are generic anti-discrimination laws related to employment or housing that may or may not cover disabled people. These laws are commonly referred to, for instance, as fair housing, fair employment or civil rights laws. Where such laws protect disabled people, it is so noted. In the accessibility area, coverage of the law to public and private buildings is noted. Also noted are the current architectural standards in use. For standards, the following abbreviations are used: American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI); Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS); Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB); and Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA). Where there is a blank space next to a category, it means the absence of a civil rights law in this area protecting disabled people. It could also mean that an existing civil rights law in the area does not extend protection to disabled people. (NOTE: In all of these areas, the laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to change. A cite, therefore, should be checked with legal counsel before relying on it. Also, laws covering state- funded programs, such as Individuals with Disabilities Education Act programs, are not noted.) 1[720 Employment Public Accommodations Housing Education Accessibility Alabama Alaska Public employment White Cane Law only.

Part 27) that would replace entire subparts of the rule with references to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Mass transit requirements removed Perhaps the most notable change DOT would make is to remove Subpart E of the section 504 rules, the standards for accessible mass transit. Bedeviled by controversy since they were first issued in 1979, the mass transit rules have been the subject of two court cases and congressional and executive scrutiny over matters such as scope, spending limits and local options on how to provide accessible transportation . The ADA effectively settled these disputes by requiring all public and private transporta- tion operators -whether or not they receive federal funds -to acquire only accessible buses, train cars and vans after Aug. 25, 1990. The law also requires all public transit agen- cies that operate fixed-route transportation (e.g., city bus or subway service) to provide complementary paratransit service for people whose disabilities make it impossible for them to use mainline service. DOT noted that Subpart E will no longer be needed after the final ADA rules go into effect Jan. 26, 1992. For that same reason, DOT would also delete from the section 504 rules portions of Subparts B (employment) and D (program accessibility requirements in specific operat- ing administration programs), a number of definitions and all of Subpart C (program accessibility -general). DOT emphasized that grantees will be required to comply with all ADA regulations, including those issued by the Equal Employ- Federal Programs Advisory Service Thompson Publishing Group 1725 K Street, N.W.

DOT issued new Section 504 proposal last month (April 4 Federal Register , Pages 13856-13981) along with its proposals for paratransit service under ADA. DOT had issued final regulations mandating accessible buses and trains in public transportation last October (49 C.F.R. Part 37 - see Supplement No. 144, November 1990). Also with that ADA Update DOT outlines requirements for paratransit service New rules that would require transit agen- cies to provide alternative form s of public transportation for disabled people were pro- posed last month by the U.S. Department of Tran sportation. Publi shed in the April 4 Federal Register, the draft regulations (49 C.F.R. Part 37) would partially implement Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires public transportation agencie s to offer \"paratransit \" servic e to disabled people. Additionally, DOT proposed amendments to final rules on accessible vehicles and service standards that it issued last year (see Supplement No. 140, November 1990), making mostly technical changes and reorder- ing the subparts of the regulation for greater clarity. Under DOT's section 504 regulations, final rule, DOT had added a provision to its section 504 rules that tied receipt of federal transportation funding to ADA compliance. The department is seeking comment on whether any of the deleted sections should be kept or other parts removed. Written com- ments should be sent by June 3 to Docket Clerk, Docket No. 47483, DOT, 400 Seventh St. S.W., Room 4107, Washington, D.C. 20590. compliance with the ADA is a prerequisite to receiving federal transportation funding. \"One of the primary goal s of the ADA is to make it easier for people with disabilitie s to become part of the American mainstream by ensuring they have access to adequate public transportation, \" said DOT Secretary Samuel K. Skinner. \"This proposed rule would help individuals with disabilities to better meet their basic employment, educational and health needs, and also allow them to take advantage of social, recreational and cultural opportunities. \" Paratransit requirements Under the ADA, public transit agencies that operate \"fixed-route\" transportation (e.g., city bus or subway lines) are required to offer paratransit service for disabled people who, because of their condition, are unable to use conventional transit.

Many communities have been offering paratransit, some as an alternative to acces- sible mainline service, as a way of complying with section 504. However, the ADA requires all public transit agencies to provide paratransit as a complement to their fixed- route operations, even if the entire system is lift-equipped. The only exceptions are agen- cies that operate only commuter bus service (e.g., running from a suburban area into a city) or demand-responsive systems (e.g., where people must first make reservations before the bus comes -often found in rural areas). The paratransit provisions of the ADA become effective Jan. 26, 1992. Who is eligible? Not every disabled person would be eligible for paratransit service under the DOT pro- posed rules. Instead, transit agencies would have to provide service to \"ADA paratransit eligible\" individuals, whom the rules define as people who: because of their disabilities cannot inde- pendently board, ride or disembark from accessible vehicles; have a \"specific impairment-related condition\" (such as chronic fatigue syndrome or visual or mental impairments) that prevents them from getting to or from boarding and exiting spots (but not people who find it uncomfortable or difficult to get to or from stops); and need to ride accessible vehicles when accessible mainline service is not offered (e.g., a person in a wheelchair wants to use public transit on a route not served by a lift-equipped bus, or when the accessible bus isn't running). Additionally, a transit agency would always have to provide paratransit to at least one companion of an \"eligible\" person (and others, if space is available). This would include anyone the eligible persons wants to travel with -friends, family, a date, etc. Service area, response time and fares In the rule, DOT proposes several criteria for transit agencies to incorporate into their paratransit operations; one concerns service area. Under the draft, a transit agency would have to offer paratransit to destinations within corridors along each side of a bus or train May 1991 route. (The width of that corridor hasn't been set; DOT suggests a range between one- quarter of a mile and 1-1/2 miles, depending on whether the route is urban, suburban or rural.) For example, a bus route runs the length of a city thoroughfare. Under the DOT rules, a disabled person could request (and receive) paratransit service to any points up to one- quarter of a mile from each side of the street. 3 When a disabled person requests paratransit, the ADA requires that the re- sponse time be \"comparable, to the extent practicable\" with fixed-route service. The proposed rule specifies a \"next-day service\" standard for paratransit response time. A disabled person would call the transit provider during business hours on one day (Monday) to reserve a ride for the next (Tuesday). DOT noted that \"real-time scheduling,\" in which the paratransit van comes on request, was considered as a response time alternative. Advocates of this arrangement said it would be more convenient for passengers as well as being more cost efficient, because it would cut down on the number of cancellations and no- shows. DOT opted for next-day service in the rules, but wants comments on the costs and effi- ciency of real-time scheduling. Paratransit fares, under the proposed rules, could be comparable to fares charged for conventional transit. The base paratransit fare could be no higher than twice the base con- ventional fare, but could include surcharges that apply to fixed-route transportation (e.g., express service, transfers or rush-hour rides). Paratransit would have to be available during the same days and hours of operation as fixed-route service. No trip restrictions Transit agencies would be prohibited from restricting a person's use of paratransit based on trip purpose. For example, a transit agency could not limit paratransittrips to only doc- tors' offices or grocery stores, or refuse to take people to visit friends. Moreover, the rules would not allow transit agencies to impose \"capacity control con- straints\" on the availability of paratransit. DOT points out that constraints such as waiting lists, limiting the number of times a Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 41 of 2904 person can use the service (e.g., 15 times a month only) or denying service because the van isn't full would run counter to the \"com- parable service\" concept. Plans The ADA requires transit agencies to submit plans outlining the paratransit service they will provide. Under the proposed DOT rules, the plans would include: information about local fixed-route ser- vice (e.g., overall service area, population served, number of accessible vehicles); a description of existing paratransit ser- vice; a description of the proposed paratransit service that would comply with the ADA (including budget, timetable for implementa- tion and changes to existing service). Plans would also have to note if paratransit is offered by a provider other than the transit agency. Transit agencies would not be re- quired to duplicate service, but would have to supplement gaps in the other provider's service. For example, a private company may transport disabled people to and from a hospi- tal twice a week. That service alone would not qualify as \"complementary paratransit\" under the ADA. Also, transit agencies would have to allow the general public to participate in crafting the plan. Agencies should hold hearings, provide a comment period and make outreach efforts to disabled people and disability organiza- tions. Plans should be available in accessible formats (braille, taped). The ADA requires that initial paratransit plans be submitted (generally to state trans- portation agencies) by Jan. 26, 1992. The Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMT A) at DOT will have final say in ap- proving the plans. DOT did not set an effective date for plans to be fully operational, pointing out that communities will differ in their ability to implement paratransit. Instead, the proposed rule would allow transit agencies to phase in paratransit service beginning Jan. 26, 1992. The department wants comments on whether a 5-year phase-in period would be appropriate for ADA-related paratransit. Handicapped Requirements Handbook Paratransit rule would apply to public universities, DOT says Will public universities have to provide paratransit under the ADA, in addition to any campus shuttle service they may provide? According to the Department of Transportation, the answer is yes. Title II of the ADA applies to public entities operating fixed -route transportation service. Commenters to DOT have argued that college transportation systems should not be covered by the act because they serve only a limited population (students and faculty), not the general public. But DOT has rejected that argument, noting that the statute contains no explicit exemption for colleges and universities in this area (the law exempts only public school transportation provided by elementary and secondary schools). Public universities are clearly public entities, the department said in the preamble to proposed ADA rule changes, adding that most campus bus systems are fixed-route transporta- tion systems as defined by the ADA (i.e., travel along a prescribed route according to a fixed schedule). As a result, public universities would be subject to the same transportation requirements as other public entities. That means acquiring only accessible new vehicles, making accom- modations for disabled riders, providing accessible route and schedule information, etc. It would also mean providing paratransit. As a public provider of fixed-route service, DOT said, a university would be subject to the complementary paratransit requirements and eligible to apply for a waiver based on undue financial burden. The department wants comment on whether paratransit requirements for public universities should be modified in the final rule. Private universities, DOT said, would be covered by Title III of the ADA, which applies to private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. Consequently, they would not be required to provide paratransit, although under both section 504 and the ADA, their regular shuttle services would have to be accessible to disabled riders. Supplement No. 150 ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 42 of 290( Undue burden exception The ADA allows exemptions for mandatory paratransit if a transit agency can demonstrate that providing it would impose an undue financial burden. DOT proposed three options as \"triggers\" that would allow transit agencies to request a waiver: Option 1 - Providing paratransit would have a \"significant adverse effect\" on the agency's overall transit service; Option 2 - The agency could not provide as many per capita paratransit trips as it does per capita fixed-route trips without jeopardiz- ing overall service; Option 3 - The cost of providing paratransit in that community would exceed the average cost for its size (as calculated by DOT). UMT A would consider several factors in determining whether paratransit would create a financial hardship. These would include fare increases, the effects of paratransit on current fixed-route service, the current level of acces- sible service and funding (as a percentage of total budget) needed to implement the plan. Hearings and comments DOT must issued final ADA rules by July 26, 1991. Written comments can be submitted (by June 3) to Docket Clerk, Docket No. 91- A, DOT, 400 Seventh St. S.W., Room 4107, Washington, D.C. 20590.

Part 37) it issued last year concerning accessible public transportation required under the ADA and section 504. Last month the department published the proposed changes along with draft rules for paratransit service and accessible transporta- tion facilities. In its section 504 rules, DOT has made compliance with the ADA a prereq- uisite for receiving federal transportation funding. May 1991 5 Most of the proposed amendments would be technical, addressing comments that were submitted in response to the Oct. 4, 1990, rulemaking (see Supplement No. 144, Novem- ber 1990). Additionally, DOT would rearrange provisions in Part 37 for greater clarity and better organization. Selecting \"key stations\" The ADA and the DOT rules require transit agencies to make existing \"key\" stations in subway and light-rail systems accessible to disabled riders. Generally, this applies to high- ridership stations located in downtown areas or near tourist/cultural attractions. New York City and Philadelphia have used the key- station concept to retrofit certain stations in their rapid transit systems. The DOT proposed rules would set criteria for determining key stations. High-ridership stations, defined as stations where passenger boardings are least 15 percent greater than the system's average, would be key stations, as would transfer, end and feeder stations. Sta- tions serving major activity centers and \"ma- jor trip generators\" for disabled people would also be considered key stations. DOT noted that transit agencies would not have to nominate every station that meets one of these criteria as a key station. Rather, DOT said, the goal is to ensure overall accessibility to the transit system. Accessibility standards DOT said it would incorporate accessibility guidelines being developed by the Architec- tural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (see Supplement No. 149, April 1991) into its regulations as the standards for trans- portation vehicles and facilities. The access board's guidelines would replace interim standards in the Oct. 4 final rule. In addition, DOT said it would closely follow the Justice Department's requirements for new construction and alteration of public buildings as the guidelines for transportation facilities (see Supplement No. 148, March 1991). Under the Justice rules, new and altered facilities would have to be readily accessible to and usable by disabled people. In addition, if alterations are made to a \"primary function area\" of a facility, the \"path of travel\" to that area would have to be accessible.

Other changes DOT would also amend the ADA rules to: prohibit transit agencies from charging disabled people for reasonable accommoda- tions; cite enforcement procedures under section 504 for ADA violations, and the Justice Department's ADA enforcement rules for \"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"' In the Courts University must demonstrate attempts to accommodate disabled student, court rules A medical school failed to show that it considered alternative testing methods to accommodate a dyslexic student, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled. Steven Wynne sued Tufts University for dismissing him after he twice failed to pass the first year of the medical program. Doctors diagnosed Wynne as having dyslexia, which they said impaired his ability to answer mul- tiple choice questions. Wynne asked Tufts to give him oral exams as an accommodation. The university agreed to provide notetakers and tutors, but would not change its testing method. Wynne argued that despite his poor aca- \u00b7 demic record, he was qualified to be a medical student. He noted that he performed better on tests, such as his practicum, that used testing methods different from the multiple choice approach. Tufts countered that Wynne was not other- wise qualified under section 504. Multiple choice exams, officials said, measure a person's ability to understand and analyze complex material, which is essential to be- coming a good doctor. The university argued that Wynne's inability to perform well on multiple choice tests demonstrated that he was Handicapped Requirements Handbook public entities that do not receive DOT funds; and require that accessibility features (e.g, elevators) be in working order and that accom- modations be provided when they break down (e.g., announce to subway riders that an elevator is out of service at a particular stop and provide shuttle service from the nearest station).

The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled in favor of the university, but in 1990, a panel of the 1st Circuit ruled in favor of Wynne (Wynne v. Tufts University School of Medicine, Appendix IV:483). Ruling en bane, the appeals court upheld that decision and remanded the case. Under section 504, the court said, a univer- sity must demonstrate that it sought \"suitable means of reasonably accommodating a handi- capped person.\" The university never indi- cated that it considered alternatives to multiple choice exams, it said. In a dissent, three judges said the university had effectively proved that Wynne was not otherwise qualified and that the court was not giving enough credence to educators' profes- sional judgment about how the demands of medicine are \"best-tested.\" The dissent said Tufts is not required to accommodate characteristics (such as Wynne's condition) that inhibit a person's ability to learn to become a good doctor. Further, the dissenting judges said designing tests aimed at screening out people who will not become good doctors is a \"quintessential academic task close to the heart of a profes- sional school's basic mission\" that doctors ' not judges, should carry out. Supplement No. 150 ( ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 44 of 290( ( Recovered alcoholic fails to prove disability led to job dismissal, court says A rehabilitated alcoholic failed to prove he was fired from his job solely because of his disability, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has ruled. John Teahan was a telephone and telegraph maintainer for Metro-North Railroad. Over a three-year span, his work absences increased due to a drug and alcohol addiction (from 19 days in 1984 to 139 days in 1986). In 1986 Teahan entered a hospital program, but the treatment failed and his substance abuse and absenteeism returned. He missed 57 work days in 1987. Late that year, Teahan entered and successfully completed a month- long treatment program. As required by union rules, he was allowed to return to work in January 1988 and was not absent for any reason until being fired in April. The railroad said it fired Teahan because of his excessive absenteeism. Teahan, however, claimed he was fired because of his disability, which he said violated section 504. Section 504 protects rehabilitated substance abusers but doesn't cover people whose current dru~ or alcohol use prevents them from performing ED proposes funding priority for attention deficit disorder research The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has proposed as a funding priority the estab- lishment of research centers on children with attention deficit disorder. Knowledge obtained through this research will help educators, researchers and parents respond to the educa- tional needs of children with this condition. Congress mandated that ED explore attention deficit disorder when it reauthorized (and renamed) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act) last year. May 1991 their jobs or poses a direct threat to others or property. 7 In handing down summary judgment for Metro-North, the court said Teahan failed to prove that he was fired solely because of his disability. Teahan argued only that he was a member of a protected group without present- ing evidence of disparate treatment, the court said, and his \"assertion that Metro-North knew he had an alcohol and drug problem is insuffi- cient proof of discriminatory intent to survive a summary judgment.\" On other issues, the court acknowledged that questions of material fact remained. The railroad argued that Teahan was not disabled within the meaning of section 504. But the court noted that Teahan had successfully completed treatment; therefore, he could be considered rehabilitated and be \"within the protection of the act.\" Metro-North also contended that Teahan was not otherwise qualified for his job be- cause he could not be depended on to report to work. But the court disagreed, noting that his record was due to past addiction and that he had not missed work since being rehabilitated. The court ruled that Teahan could be found to be capable of reporting to work at the time of his dismissal. This case is Teahan v. Metro-North Com- muter Railroad Company, Appendix IV:494.

Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 732 F. Supp. 665 (W.D. Va. 1990) Section 504 claims limited by statute of limitations in analogous state law Claims brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are limited to the statut e of limitation s prescribed by the analogous law of the state in which the case is brought, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia ruled. Ann Eastman, a former employee of Virginia Polytechnic University (VPI), was transferred in 1986 to another depart- ment in the school. She told the university that she was dis- abled and would need help with both her move and with some of her new responsibilities. The university promised as- sistance, but provided little help for the move and none for her new job. The plaintiff claimed that because the university did not provide the assistance, her physical condition worsened. In 1987 , she was placed on disability retirement. She sued VPI, claiming its failure to provide assistance violated section 504. Seeking to dismiss the suit, VPI argued that Eastman's claim was barred by a statute of limitations. The court agreed. The Rehabilitation Act does not specify a statute of limita- tions. As a general rule, the court noted , \"where there is no federal statute of limitations expressly applicable to a federal claim, the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law applies.\" In this case, the Virginia Rights of Persons with Disabili- ties Act provides a one-year statute of limitations. The al- leged violation of section 504 occurred in 1986 , but Eastman did not file suit until 1988. Therefore , the court ruled , her ac- tion is barred by the appropriate one-year statute of limita- tions. 482 Doe v. Southeastern University, 732 F. Supp. 7 (D. D. C. 1990) Non-equitable damages not available under section 504. Statute of limitations for section 504 claims gov- erned by appropriate state law Claims brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in the District of Columbia are limited to the three-year statute of limitations in the Distrit of Columbia's personal in- jury law, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled. The court also ruled that monetary damages are not available under section 504. The plaintiff in this case, a former student at Southeastern University, said he tested positive for the HIV virus (the virus which causes AIDS). He was hospitalized in 1986 and had to be excused from his fall semester classes. His doctor con- firmed his medical condition in a letter to the university. According to the plaintiff , the university gave information about his condition to faculty and staff. As a result, he said, he was embarrassed , harassed and felt forced to transfer to the University of Maryland. He further charged that South- eastern officials improperly told University of Maryland staff about his condition. Claiming that the university's actions inflicted emotional distress, caused an invasion of privacy, and discriminated against his disability, plaintiff sued, seeking compensatory and punitive damages under section 504. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. May 1991 PAGE 251 University officials said the charges should be dismissed because the Rehabilitation Act does not provide monetary damages. They also argued that his claims are barred by a one-year statute of limitations under the District of Columbia's invasion of privacy law. The court noted that the Rehabilitation Act does not spec- ify a statute of limitations. Instead, courts have relied on stat- ute of limitations prescribed by appropriate state laws, and in- creasingly, that has been a state's personal injury statute. Be- cause the District of Columbia's personal injury law allows a three-year time span, the court held in favor of the plaintiff on the statute of limitations issue. However , it dismissed his claim for punitive damages. \"Even reading the complaint liberally and assuming that test- ing positive for AIDS antibodies is a handicap, and assuming he could prove damages, the court determines that plaintiff would be limited to equitable relief, \" the court ruled. Courts are divided on whether monetary damages are available under section 504, and the Supreme Court has ex- pressly declined to rule on the issue. The District Court said it found persuasive decisions affording only equitable relief in section 504 cases, adding that monetary relief should be pro- vided through a change in the law. \"If Congress feels that additional remedies are necessary to protect the rights of handicapped individuals , Congress must make that law, not this court,\" it said. The court also dismissed the invasion of privacy and emo- tional distress claims. 483 Wynne v. Tufts University School of Medicine, No. 89-1670 (1st. Cir 1990) Dyslexic medical student may be otherwise qualified under section 504 A dyslexic medical student could be considered otherwise qualified and entitled to reasonable accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the I st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. Tufts University Medical School dismissed Steven Wynne after he failed several courses during two attempts to finish the first year of the medical program. Doctors diagnosed Wynne as having dyslexia, which they said impairs his ability to answer multiple choice questions. Wynne asked the univer- sity to modify its testing method and give him oral instead of multiple choice exams for certain courses. The university agreed to provide notetakers and tutoring, but would not change its testing method. Wynne charged that Tufts ' refusal to accommodate his condition violates section 504. Despite his poor academic rec- ord, Wynne contended that he is qualified to be a medical student. He noted that he scored \"substantially higher\" on practicum and other exams that used methods other than mul- tiple choice questions to test knowledge. University officials, however, said Wynne's problem with multiple choice exams demonstrates \"an inability to process complex information,\" which prevents him from meeting an essential requirement for a degree -passing all his courses. They cited other cases, including Southeastern Community College v. Davis (Appendix IV:22), in which courts upheld the decision to dismiss a disabled student who could not meet the essential requirements of an academic program . Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 50 of 290PAGE 252 Additionally , Tufts contended that a school's testing policy is a matter of academic \"substance\" that should not be sec- ond-guessed by a court. The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts found in favor of Tufts, ruling that Wynne was unable to prove that he could meet the school ' s requirements. The ap- pellate court reversed that decision, ruling that Wynne ' s sta- tus as otherwise qualified was not resolved. The appeals court noted that in Davis , the Supreme Court held that educational institutions are not required to lower their standards or make substantial changes to their programs to accommodate disabled students . But, the Court added , rea- sonable accommodations are sometimes necessary to fulfill section 504 's mandate. In this case , the appeals court said, the issue is not about Wynne ' s ability to meet the requirements of the Tufts Medi- cal School. Instead, it is \"whether there is a reasonable ac- commodation to his disability that can be made by the school so as to give him 'meaningful access ' to the education offered there. \" And while it acknowledged that deference should given to academic decision making , the court said \"section 504 re- quires us to examine closely supposedly academic decisions to be certain that they do not mask even unintended discrimi- nation against the handicapped. \" The court said Tufts did not explain why multiple choice exams, as opposed to other types of exams, could alone meas- ure a student 's mastery of a complex subject , except to say that they are \"necessary. \" \"We find it hard to understand why essay examinations would not meet the same objective, \" the court observed. Further, the court rejected the parallel between the student in Davis and Wynne. In the former case , the disabled student could not perform a technical requirement of the academic program . Jn this case, \"the alleged discrimination stems not from the particular skill required -the ability to work with complex data -but from tne method by which Tufts meas- ures that ability.\" The court found insufficient evidence to determine that changing the testing method would be a \"fundamental altera- tion\" of the Tufts medical program or that Wynne would fail his courses if tested by other exams. \"A dispute remains,\" the court concluded , \"over whether [he] could survive in medical school if his abilities were evaluated in a different way.\" On appeal - Ruling en bane, the First Circuit reversed the District Court 's summary judgment in favor of Tufts and remanded the case. Un- der section 504, the court said, a university must \"seek suitable means of reasonably accommodating a handicapped person and ... submit a factual record indicating that it conscientiously car- ried out\" this duty. Tufts argued that multiple-choice exams are essential in evalu- ating whether someone will become a good doctor. However, the court noted, the university neither indicated that it considered al- ternatives to those exams nor who made such a decision. Without such evidence , the court said it could not properly review the is- sues as required by statute. In a dissent , three judges said the university had effectively proved that Wynne was not otherwise qualified and that the ma- jority was not giving enough credence to educators' professional judgment about how the demands of medicine are \"best-tested. \" The dissent noted three circumstances to support the university: (I) Tufts is not reasonably or lawfully required to accommodate a \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. May 1991 Appendix IV characteristic (such as Wynne ' s condition) that inhibits one's abil- ity to learn to become a good doctor; (2) designing tests aimed at screening out people who will not become good doctors is a \"quintessential academic task close to the heart of a professional school ' s basic mission\" ; and (3) designing proper tests is a judg- mental matter \"to which teachers and doctors are far more expert than judges and juries.\" 484 Blissitt v. City of Chicago, No. 86 C 9684 (N.D. Ill. 1990) Chicago police department reinstatement policy for of- ficers on disability leave does not violate section 504 The Chicago Police Department ' s policy of restricting light- duty assignments to police officers injured while on duty does not violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the U.S. Dis- trict Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled. Chicago police officers may take one year of medical leave with full pay and benefits. If after the year they are un- able to return to work, officers can apply for a disability pen- sion funded by the Police Pension Board. Under an agreement with the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police , police officers in- jured in the line-of-duty are entitled to limited- or light-duty assignments. These assignments involve aspects of police work other than field work (such as desk jobs). Disabled officers not injured on-the-job are assigned light duty at the discretion of the department. In addition, officers on disability pensions who seek reinstatement may only be placed in full-duty assignments. Shirley Blissitt is a sergeant in the Chicago Police Depart- ment. In 1983 , she was placed on medical leave for epin- condylitis of the right elbow (better known as \"tennis el- bow\"). When her medical leave expired in 1984 , she applied for and received disability benefits from the pension fund. Blissitt twice applied for a light-duty assignment. The first time she was denied because the department doctor consid- ered her unfit for full or limited police work. She was turned down a second time because she was receiving a disability pension. Blissitt sued the department , arguing that the rein- statement policy violated section 504. The court agreed that Blissitt met the criteria for being disabled under the act, but it said the police department did not exclude her from the light-duty assignment solely by rea- son of her disability. Noting that an officer is entitled to light duty only if injured in the line of duty , the court said \"Blissitt is simply off the mark to suggest the department denied her a light duty assignment only because she was handicapped.\" Blissitt claimed she was otherwise qualified for the posi- tion because she could perform clerical tasks, which she said were essential police functions . But the court called this defi- nition of essential police function \"inaccurate,\" noting that Chicago police officers are sworn to \"preserve order, peace and quiet and enforce the laws and ordinances throughout the city.\" Second, Blissitt argued that the department's return-from- disability policy required that officers satisfy physical tasks \"which may go beyond the demands of particular jobs that may be available.\" The court ruled that Blissitt had not been required to satisfy unreasonable physical requirements. \"Whatever the demands of the job,\" the court said, \"[she] ac\u00b7 - knowledged she did not meet them when she requested her removal to the medical roll.\" Handicapped Requirements Handbook ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 51 of 290( ( Appendix IV 492 Chiari v. City of League City, 920 F.2d 311 (5th Cir. 1991) Construction inspector who has Parkinson's disease not otherwise qualified to perform essential functions of the job A city did not violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act when it fired a construction inspector who would lose his balance and thus was unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. Antonio Chiari , an engineer who has Parkinson's disease , was a construction inspector for League City , Texas. Inspectors are re- sponsible for approving construction plans and verifying that the work was properly completed. Nearly half of the job is spent at construction sites visually inspecting contractors' work, which re- quires considerable walking and climbing. In early 1987, Chiari began to have trouble walking; he was seen stumbling in the city hall and falling while at a construction site. At the request of his supervisor. Chiari was examined sepa- rately by two neurosurgeons , who found he had an unsteady \"shuffling gait and body rigidity. \" They both said his loss of bal- ance rendered him unable to continue his job as a construction in- spector and that he would be a danger to himself and others if he continued to work. Chiari 's personal physician also examined him, and saw \"no particular limitation of [Chiari 's] work , as long as he [did] not climb.\" City officials tried unsuccessfully to restructure the job to ac- commodate Chiari 's condition . First , they assigned another in- spector to do on-site work while Chiari remained at his desk to re- view the plans. That arrangement did not work because to do the job properly, an inspector must review plans before visiting the site. They tried to create a new position , but could not due to budgetary constraints, and the city had no open positions for a transfer. After these attempts failed, the city fired Chiari in April 1987. He sued , charging that the dismissal violated section 504 and the Texa s Human Rights Act. He said he had never fallen on or in- jured a co-worker, and that the risk of personal injury was not a factor under section 504. Chiari also argued that the city could have provided him with part-time work as an accommodation. The city said Chiari was not protected by section 504 because he could not perform the essential functions of the job, namely walking and climbing around construction sites safely. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled in favor of the city. That ruling was upheld by the 5th Cir- cuit, which agreed that Chiari was no longer qualified to be a con- struction inspector. Citing Arline (see Appendix IV:329) and other section 504 cases , the appeals court said a \"handicapped person cannot perform the essential functions of a job if his handicap poses a significant safety risk to those around him.\" To support its judgment, the court cited the neurosurgeons ' di- agnoses that Chiari's balance problem would prevent him from working safely. Chiari's doctor concluded similarly when he was read the job description during the case. The appeals court disagreed with Chiari that the risk of per- sonal injury was immaterial. It cited section 501 regulations that include \"health and safety of the individual \" in the definition of qualified handicapped person. The existence of a personal safety rule in section 501 creates a similar rule under section 504, the court said. Finally , the court ruled that city officials \"went beyond their statutory duty in an effort to accommodate Chiari's disease \" and that they were not required to create a new part-time position as an accommodation. \"All the city must do is demonstrate that a part-time schedule would not accommodate Chiari 's performance on that job that he is currently doing,\" it said. \"Even if Chiari worked fewer hours, he still would not be able to climb buildings or climb into ditches, \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. May 1991 PAGE 257 [which are] 'essential functions ' of a construction inspector 's job.\" For the same reasons cited under section 504, the court found no violations of the Texas discrimination law. 493 Gault v. University of Chicago Hospitals, No. 90-C0321 (N.D. Ill. 1991) Epileptic nurse not otherwise qualified to work in burn unit of hospital A nurse who suffers from epileptic seizures is not \"otherwise qualified \" within in the meaning of Section 504 of the Rehabilita- tion Act to work in the burn unit of a hospital, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled. Freida Gault sued the University of Chicago Hospitals for al- legedly violating section 504 when it dismissed her as a burn-unit nurse . Gault has idiopathic epilepsy, which causes her to have un- predictable generalized seizures. Before the onset of a seizure, Gault will stare blankly. She then experiences convulsions, falls to floor and loses consciousness. After she recovers, there is a period of confusion . Gault suffered seizures while on duty. According to hospital officials, seizures occurred while she was: using scissor s to change a dressing ; assisting an infant 's breathing apparatus \"re- sulting in extubation of the patient and her inability to summon needed medical care\"; and cutting a dressing, which caused the patient to leave his room to summon help. Additionally, Gault suffered a head injury during one seizure that required emergency room treatment and made her unable to help a seriously burned patient on a ventilator and tube feeding. The hospitals knew of Gault's condition before they hired her, and did not relieve her from duty after the first seizure. One doc- tor at the hospital thought the seizures were under control and would not endanger her or others. Several seizures followed , how- ever, and Gault agreed to consult an expert from another hospital. That doctor told Gault that the seizures were not under control and that it was dangerous for her to work in a burn unit or operat- ing room. Gault would not tell hospital officials about this diagno- sis, and as a result , the hospitals placed her on leave. Based on these circumstances, the court ruled that Gault is not otherwise qualified because she was not meeting the position re- quirements of a burn -unit nurse . Further, the court found no sec- tion 504 violations on the part of the hospitals. Gault cannot \"contend that the decision process to remove her from the burn unit ... was motivated by prejudice against her handicap or was conducted unfairly ,\" the court said. \"The hospi- tals are indisputably willing to hire epileptics and to assign them to critical care units. \" Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 52 of 290PAGE 258 494 Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, No. 88 Civ. 5376 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) Recovered alcoholic fails to prove disability as sole basis for job dismissal A rehabilitated alcoholic failed to prove he was fired from his job solely because of his disability, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled. John Teahan, a telephone and telegraph maintainer for Metro- North Railroad , was fired for what the railroad said was excessive, unauthorized absenteeism. During a four-year span, Teahan's drug and alcohol addiction caused him to miss many work days. In 1984 he was absent 19 days; his absenteeism rose to 139 days in 1986. He was disciplined for these absences. ln early 1986 , Teahan sought help from the company's reha- bilitation program and voluntarily entered a hospital program. The treatment failed, however, and his substance abuse and absentee- ism returned. He missed 57 work days in 1987. Later that year, Teahan entered and successfully completed a month-long treat- ment program. As required by union rules , he returned to work in January 1988 and was not absent for any reason until being fired in April 1988. Teahan claimed the firing violated section 504 because the railroad acted against his disability. Section 504 protects rehabili- tated substance abusers from discrimination based on disability , but does not cover people whose current use of drugs or alcohol prevents them from performing their jobs or constitutes a direct threat to others or property. The railroad claimed that it acted solely based on Teahan's ex- cessive absenteeism and asked for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. The court acknowledged that Teahan raised issues of material fact that Metro-North did not disprove. First, the railroad argued that Teahan was not disabled within the meaning of section 504. However , the court said, Teahan had successfully completed treat- ment and was not absent before being fired. Based on this evi- dence, he could qualify as being rehabilitated and \"therefore within the protection of the act,\" the court noted. Second, Metro-North contended that Teahan was not otherwise qualified for his job because he could not be depended on to re- port to work. But noting that his prior absences were due to addic- tion and that he had not missed work since being rehabilitated, the court suggested that Teahan could be capable of reporting to work at the time of his dismissal. The court found that Metro-North would succeed on the issue that Teahan was legitimately fired only because of his absentee record. The court said Teahan failed to prove his argument that he was tenninated solely based on his disability. Teahan, the court said, argued only that he was a member of a protected group without presenting evidence of disparate treat- ment. \"Teahan's assertion that Metro-North knew he had an alco- hol and drug problem is insufficient proof of discriminatory intent to survive a summary judgment,\" the court said. \"In fact, Teahan fails to present any affidavits, deposition or other evidence at all in opposition to Metro-North's motion.\" \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

This prohibition (\u00a7102(a)) extends to a full range of employment activities, including: job application procedures; hiring and discharge; employee compensation; advancement; job training; and other terms, conditions and benefits of employment. Most of the concepts included in the employment provision of the ADA are based on experience gained under section 504. For a discussion of section 504 as it applies to employment, see Tab 600. *~1021 Who is Covered The ADA applies to all public and private employers, employment agencies, labor organizations and joint labor-management committees(\u00a7 101(2)). Title I becomes effective for employers with 25 or more employees on July 26, 1992; businesses with 15 or more workers must comply beginning July 26, 1994. State and local governments are also covered by these effective dates (see~ 1031). The act (\u00a7101(5)(B)) specifically exempts from title I coverage the U.S. government and corporations wholly owned by the U.S. government (which are covered by Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act), Indian tribes, and private membership clubs (other than labor organizations) that are tax-exempt under \u00a7501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. ~1022 Discrimination in Employment Title I of the ADA requires the fair treatment of \"qualified individuals with disabilities\" in employment. The statute defines such a person as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accom- modation, can perform the essential functions of a job.\" This is the same principle of non-discrimination in employment that applies to federal grantees under section 504 (and is discussed fully at Chapter 600). Basically, the ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified job applicants or employ- ees based on their disability. The law covers all aspects of the employment process, from job applications, interviews and hiring, to compensation, advancement, training and benefits. If a qualified disabled applicant or employee needs an accommodation, the employer must provide it, as long as the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the employer (see ~640, ~ 1023). As with section 504, it is important for employers covered by the ADA to identify the essential func- tions of a position (see ~630). Employers are not required to hire or accommodate a person who cannot perform the essential functions of a position, even if that person has a disability. * Indicates new or revised material. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. March 1991 Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 97 of 2901020:2 The ADA (\u00a7101(8)) provides that written job descriptions prepared before a position is advertised or an interview given must be considered evidence of essential job functions. The terms of any collective bargain- ing agreement can serve as evidence of this as well. Section 504 does not have a similar requirement. Pre-employment questions, exams The ADA adopts section 504's constraints on pre-employment screening of disabled applicants (see ~660). During the pre-employment process, employers are prohibited from using criteria (tests, inquiries, etc.) that screen out or tend to screen out disabled people or classes of disabled people, unless those criteria are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Under section 504, employers are permitted to make pre-employment inquiries regarding disabilities only to redress past discrimination. Based on the language of the House report accompanying the ADA (H. Rpt. 101-485, Part 2, p. 75), it is possible that questioning under the same conditions will be permitted under the ADA, since the rules implementing the ADA will likely parallel those under section 504. The same prohibition against pre-employment inquiries applies to medical exams. Under the ADA (and section 504), employers may not make medical inquiries that are not job-related(\u00a7 102(C)). Employers may require \"post-offer\" medical examinations that follow a conditional offer of employment, provided the results are kept confidential and exams are required of all entering employees in a particular category. The ADA does not make voluntary \"corporate wellness\" programs illegal. An employer may conduct voluntary medical examinations that are part of an employee health program available to employees at a particular work site. These programs are legal as long as the medical records are kept confidential and not used to limit health insurance eligibility or prevent the employee from advancing. Health insurance The ADA requires employers to provide equal medical coverage to disabled employees and non- disabled employees alike. The act also prohibits an employer from not hiring a disabled applicant because its insurance rates would increase as a result. But the ADA does not prohibit insurance policies that do not cover pre-existing conditions (including disabilities), nor does it require a private employer to change its insurance carrier if the carrier does not cover disabilities. Under section 504, a grantee is required to change its health insurance company if it hires a disabled person and its current carrier does not cover disabilities (see ~610). Discrimination by association Both section 504 and the ADA prohibit employers from discriminating against an individual based on a disability. The ADA goes a step further and bars employers from discriminating against a non-disabled individual because he or she is related to or associated with a disabled person. Thus, it would be illegal to deny employment to an able-bodied person whose spouse has AIDS because the employer fears that the employee will be absent frequently to attend to the spouse. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. March 1991 Handicapped Requirements Handbook ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 98 of 2901030:2 grantees that employ more than 15 people are still subject to section 504's employment requirements, regardless of the ADA. Chapter 800 discusses the administrative procedures used to monitor public sector compliance with section 504; ~ 1052 discusses enforcement under the ADA as it applies to state and local governments. ~1032 Services, Programs and Activities Title Il of the ADA requires all services, programs and activities of all state and local governments and their departments, agencies or special purpose districts, to be accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities. Jurisdictions that receive federal funding should find title H's requirements familiar, as they generally follow those imposed by section 504 (see Chapter 300). Unlike section 504, however, the ADA applies to programs and activities sponsored by all governmental entities, not merely the ones run by departments that receive federal funding. (The ADA does not require the self-evaluations or transition plans mandated by section 504.) There are no exemptions for the types of activities covered by title II -it applies to every state, county and municipal service, from libraries and swimming pools to housing and parks. Under the public accommodations title of the ADA, small businesses have a grace period during which they are exempt from lawsuits (see~ 1045). State and local governments are not entitled to such a grace period. ~1033 Effective Dates and Enforcement Title II of the ADA becomes effective Jan. 26, 1992, 18 months after the law was enacted. *With respect to title I, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is authorized to file suit against state and local governments in cases where a pattern or practice of employment discrimination against disabled people exists (in the same manner as is authorized for other protected classes under the 1964 Civil Rights Act). ~1034 Relationship of ADA to State and Local Laws The ADA does not invalidate or limit any existing state or local disability rights law that provides greater protection for disabled people. The ADA applies in situations in which the state or local law has less stringent requirements. Therefore, federal grantees must be aware that they continue to be affected by state and local discrimination laws, as well as the ADA.

However, it noted that Congress did not intend for courts to rely on DOT's view of the Rehabilitation Act, \"a statute it is not charged with administering and in respect to which it has no special expertise.\" Finally, the court said Cousins was free to submit any evi- dence or legal argument he wanted to include in another ap- peal or judicial review. 458 Bonner v. Lewis, 857 F.2d 559 (9th Cir. 1988); 714 F.Supp. 420 (D. Ariz., 1989) Deaf inmate at state correctional facility that receives federal financial assistance may sue prison officials un- der the Rehabilitation Act for not providing a qualified sign language interpreter District Court rules suit may proceed under Civil Rights Restoration Act A deaf inmate in the Arizona State Prison may sue prison officials under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for not providing him with a qualified interpreter, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled . Further, the court ruled, the di- rector of the state's correctional system is a plausible defen- dant in the case, under the idea of respondeat superior as it applies to Section 504. Nicki Bonner, the plaintiff, is a deaf prisoner who also suffers from deteriorating vision and reads at a fourth grade level. He communicates through American Sign Language, but none of the personnel at the Arizona State Prison knows sign language. As an inmate, Bonner had sev- eral counseling, medical and administrative contacts without the aid of a qualified sign language interpreter. Prison officials communicate with Bonner through a tele- communications device for the deaf (TDD) and through infor- mal inmate interpreter s, who admittedly don't know sign lan- guage properly. While the prison officials acknowledge their ways of communicating with Bonner are imperfect, they maintain that nothing more is constitutionally or statutorily required of them. Bonner charges that these practices consti- tute handicap discrimination and violate his rights under sec- tion 504. The appellate court reversed in part the summary judgment granted by the U.S. District Court for Arizona in favor of the defendants. In evaluating the summary judgment under sec- tion 504, the appellate court considered two things: did Con- gress intend that section 504 would require state prisons to provide deaf inmates with sign language interpreters; and were there any genuine issues of material fact which pre- vented summary judgment. The court noted that the first issue had never been tested specifically in the courts , but it cited Fifth and Seventh Cir- cuit decisions under section 504 where schools were required to provide sign language interpreters to deaf students who were \"otherwise qualified participants in programs receiving federal assistance. \" The court also cited U.S. Justice Department section 504 regulations applying to correctional facilities receiving federal money, which require prisons to \"provide appropriate auxil - iary aids to qualified handicapped persons with impaired sen- sory, manual or speaking skills\" where refusal would dis- criminate against handicapped inmates (28 CFR Part 42.503). A qualified interpreter is one such auxiliary aid. Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. March 1991 PAGE 239 The court rejected the prison officials' argument that Con- gress never intended section 504 to cover prisoners. First , it said, the \"plain language of the Justice Department's imple- menting regulations (28 CFR Part 42.503) and the Act itself, which states that it applies to 'any program or activity receiv- ing federal financial assistance' (29 USC Part 794) belies their arguement.\" Second, the court continued, the Act's goal of indepen- dent living and vocational rehabilitation \"should in fact mir- ror the goals of prison official s as they attempt to rehabilitate prisoners and prepare them to lead productive lives once their sentences are complete.\" The court then turned to issues of material fact and ruled that issues supporting Bonner 's claims did exist, precluding summary judgment. By being deaf, Bonner is handicapped under the Rehabilitation Act; the prison qualifies by receiving federal financial assistance . When the prison provided un- skilled interpreters, it perhaps discriminated against Bonner's handicap, impeding his ability to understand hearings or re- ceive proper medical treatments, the court said. The district court had dismissed Samuel Lewis, director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, as a defendant from the case. But the higher court reinstated him, holding that the doctrine of respondeat superior-that public officials are re- sponsible for the actions of their subordinates -applies to ac- tions taken under section 504. The court cited Patton V. Dumpson (Appendix IV:70) as precedent. Bonner had claimed violations of his constitutional rights of due process, equal protection and safeguards against cruel and unusual punishment. The district court rejected these , and the appellate court upheld that decision. The case was re- manded to the lower court. On remand: The U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona ruled that Bonner may sue the Department of Corrections (a federal funds recipient) retroactively under the Civil Rights Restora- tion Act, even though the programs involved did not directly receive federal assistance . Citing the decision in Leake v. Long Island Jewish Medi- cal Center (Appendix IV:465), the court said the Civil Rights Restoration Act does apply retroactively. \"Since the Civil Rights Restoration Act can be applied retroactively in this case, and the department has admitted that it receives a significant amount of federal assistance, the Rehabilitation Act's prohibition of discrimination against oth- erwise qualified handicapped individuals applie s to all the programs and activities of the department regardless of which specific program receives federal funds,\" the court held. The court said the department has two choices: provide qualified interpreters for Bonner or prove that not providing them is non-discriminatory. \"If the department can establish that Bonner is able to effectively communicate without the use of a qualified interpreter and that adequate communica - tion is achieved through the use of the telecommunication s device and inmate interpreter s, then no discrimination could have occurred ,\" the court ruled . 459 Moore v. Sun Bank of North Florida, 87- 617-Civ-J-16 (M.D.Fla., 1988); 923 F.2d 1423 (11th Cir. 1991) A bank, as a participant in a Small Business Admini- stration loan program , is a be neficiary of federal finan- cial assistance under section 504 of the Rehabilitati on Act Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 100 of 290PAGE 240 A bank, because it participates in a Small Business Ad- minstration loan program, is a recipient of federal financial assistance for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida has ruled. David E. Moore is suing his former employer, Sun Bank of North Florida, for relief under section S04 of the act. The law bars recipients of federaJ financial assistance from dis- criminating based on handicap. Contending that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, the bank filed for a dismissal. The court denied the motion for summary judgment, but it urged an appeal. This decision, said the court, \"involves a controlling interest of law where there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.\" An appeal could \"materially ad- vance the ultimate termination of this litigation.\" Moore claimed Sun Bank is subject to section S04 because it participates in SBA's Guaranteed Loan Program. SBA guarantees up to 90 percent of the value of a loan made by private lenders to small businesses. If a borrower defaults, then the lender receives money directly from SBA. Sun Bank made and collected on such loans during Moore's tenure. According to the court, the issue is whether such loans constitute federal financial assistance within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. While section S04 doesn't define as- sistance, it's patterned after two federal anti-discrimination statutes that do: Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the 1972 Civil Rights Act. In both, Congress ex- pressly excluded contracts of insurance or guaranty from its definition of federal financial assistance. Moore argued the absence of that exclusionary language in section S04 means that contracts of insurance or guaranty, such as SBA 's Guaranteed Loan Program, represent federal aid. Sun Bank, however, claimed that administrative regula- tions issued pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act support its in- terpretation. It also said Titles VI and IX, as models, indicate congressional intent for excluding such contracts for purposes of section S04. While the court found the defendant's arguments \"to be highly persuasive,\" it said it must adopt a strict reading of the statute. Citing the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals' reluc- tance to go beyond the plain wording of the language in Jones v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (IV: 142) and Arline v. School Board of Nassau County (IV:329), the court said it must conclude \"that the absence of a textually demonstrable exclusion of contracts of insurance or guaranty from section S04 is evidence of Congressional in- tent to not exclude such contracts.\" The court further rejected Sun Bank's claim that section SOS, which makes Title VI remedies, procedures and rights available under the Rehabilitation Act, restricts the meaning of federal financial assistance. Sun Bank, citing U.S. Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans (IV:274), also argued that it was a mere beneficiary of SBA's program, not a recipient of financial as- sistance and thus not covered by the Rehabilitation Act. But the court sided with Moore's claim that the facts of this case were more closely aligned with those in Grove City College v. Bell (IV:902). Due to its participation in the federal Guar- anteed Loan program, it held that the bank \"is able to make more attractive loans on which it earns interest and profits.\" Moore had also claimed that Sun Bank was a federal funds recipient because it received deposit insurance from the Fed- eral Deposit Insurance Corporation, and because it could get Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. March 1991 Appendix IV loans through the discount window of the Federal Reserve System. The court rejected both these arguments. On appeal- On appeal, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that participation in the loan program makes the bank subject to sec- tion S04 because because Congress did not specifically exclude such loans from the statute, as it had in other federal civil rights laws (e.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the 1972 Civil Rights Act). The court said it could not read into the statute any limitations that Congress had not included itself. Moreover, the court said, the loans are federal financial assis- tance because federal funds are directly reimbursed to the lending institution under the SBA guaranteed loan program upon default by the borrower. The lender, as recipient of federal financial assis- tance, is thus willing to make what otherwise might be a high risk loan, the court added. The appeals court denied Sun Bank's motion for summary judgment, but did not rule on the merits of the case. 460 Lemere v. Burnley, 683 F. Supp. 275 (D.D.C. 1988) The FAA reasonably accommodated an alcoholic em- ployee under the Rehabilitation Act by offering her sev- eral opportunities to receive treatment before it fired her for repeated on-the-job difficulties A federal agency fulfilled its duties to an alcoholic em- ployee under the Rehabilitation Act by offering her several chances to recover before it fired her for repeated perform- ance and attendance problems, ruled the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Mary Kathleen Lemere, an acknowledged alcoholic, worked as a contract specialist with the Federal Aviation Ad- ministration (FAA). She contends that FAA failed to accom- modate her condition, as required by the law, when it fired her. Instead, she argut;:s, the agency should have afforded her an extended leave so that she could enter a treatment pro- gram. She also seeks a reversal of the Merit System Protec- tion Board's (MSPB) affirmation of FAA's action. In 1984, plaintiff began to come to work intoxicated at times, and she suffered several seizures related to alcohol withdrawal. In July 1984, an FAA psychiatrist personally drove her to get treatment at an in-patient detoxification pro- gram at a hospital. The FAA granted Lemere five weeks sick leave to finish the program. Lemere returned to work sober that autumn. After a re- lapse, she again had problems with absenteeism and getting along with co-workers. FAA suspended Lemere for two days in the summer of l 98S and threatened to fire her. When she voluntarily reentered the treatment center, FAA rescinded the reprimand and granted her another leave. Again, Lemere returned to work sober, but again, she re- lapsed. In February 1986, FAA issued Lemere a second pro- posal of termination. It agreed in April to retract it and give her a minimum three months without pay for treatment if she would sign a letter agreeing to get help. Lemere signed but failed to enroll within the prescribed time limit, and later she told a supervisor that it would be \"ridiculous\" for her to pur- sue treatment. FAA fired her. Lemere eventually did enter the program. According to the court, the issue is the extent to which the Rehabilitation Act compels a federal employer to accommo- date a worker's alcoholism before it can fire the worker. It Handicapped Requirements Handbook ( I ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 101 of 290( ( Appendix IV found that the act \"does not require the FAA, as a matter of law, to make additional efforts to accommodate plaintiff's handicap.\" The court said FAA's attempts to help Lemere were \"reasonable, and, at times, even more than reasonable.\" The court further cited the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention , Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, which, the court noted, provides that \"federal employers can terminate alcoholic employees when repeated efforts at treat- ment prove unsuccessful.\" Plaintiff maintained that the FAA was required to rescind the termination when it learned she had actually entered the treatment program . The court rejected this, saying Lemere ' s \"unreliable and erratic\" behavior caused her employers an \"undue hardship\" which it was no longer willing to tolerate. Lemere also argued that, under Whitlock v. Donovan (IV :271 ), the FAA had to at least obtain a medical evaluation of her condition before it could fire her. But the court said that case did not apply here : \"The court in Whitlock stated that the purpose of a medical investigation is for the agency to determine whether an employee's problems are related to alcoholism, and thus to determine the agency ' s duties under the Rehabilitation Act.\" Lemere admitted that her problems were alcohol related. The court also noted that Lemere's two-year pattern of un- scheduled absences could remove her \"from the protections of the Rehabilitation Act as someone who had lost the status of a qualified handicapped employee.\" Being absent so often prevented her from performing the essential functions of her job, which is the minimum requirement for qualified handi- capped workers. The court granted summary judgment to the FAA and up- held the MSPB decision 1988) Infancy, by itself, is not a handicap for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act Infancy, by itself, cannot be characterized as a mental or physical impairment within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Penn- sylvania has ruled. Consequently, parents who sued a hospital and two of its doctors for allegedly discriminating against their infant daughter have no claim of action under section 504 of the law. Mary Ann and Jonathan Gerben ' s baby daughter, Erika, suffered and died from cystic fibrosis. The Gerbens contend that Erika's doctors unnecessarily prolonged her life with painful treatment to which, they said, they never consented . The parents sued, alleging that \"aggressive and persistent care\" designed to keep the infant alive caused her undue pain and violated section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. But rather than basing their claim on Erika's status as a handicapped in- dividual due to her cystic fibrosis, the Gerbens argued that in- fancy itself was a handicap . The doctors, they said, \"would not have adopted these policies and practices (had) Erika been a conscious adult and able to speak for herself. \" The two principal cases cited here are United States v. Univ ersity Hospital and Bowen v. Ameri can Hospital Ass' n. (both IV:248), where the Second Circuit and Supreme Court respectively heard Rehabilitation Act cases involving infants with birth defects .

City of League City, 920 F.2d 311 (5th Cir. 1991) Construction inspector who has Parkinson 's disease not otherwise qualified to pe1form essential functions of the job A city did not violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act when it fired a construction inspector who would lose his balance and thus was unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled . Antonio Chiari, an engineer who has Parkinson 's disease, was a construction inspector for League City, Texas. Inspectors are re- sponsible for approving construction plans and verifying that the work was properly completed. Nearly half of the job is spent at construction sites visually inspecting contractors' work, which re- quires considerable walking and climbing. In early 1987, Chiari began to have trouble walking; he was seen stumbling in the city hall and falling while at a construction site. At the request of his supervisor, Chiari was examined sepa- rately by two neurosurgeons , who found he had an unsteady \"shuffling gait and body rigidity .\" They both said his loss of bal- ance rendered him unable to continue his job as a construction in- spector and that he would be a danger to himself and others if he continued to work. Chiari 's personal physician also examined him, and saw \"no particular limitation of [Chiari 's] work , as long as he [did] not climb.\" City officials tried unsuccessfully to restructure the job to ac- commodate Chiari's condition. First, they assigned another in- spector to do on-site work while Chiari remained at his desk to re- view the plans. That arrangement did not work because to do the job properly, an inspector must review plans before visiting the site. They tried to create a new position, but could not due to budgetary constraints, and the city had no open positions for a transfer. After these attempts failed, the city fired Chiari in April 1987. He sued, charging that the dismissal violated section 504 and the Texas Human Rights Act. He said he had never fallen on or in- jured a co-worker, and that the risk of personal injury was not a factor under section 504. Chiari also argued that the city could have provided him with part-time work as an accommodation. The city said Chiari was not protected by section 504 because he could not perform the essential functions of the job, namely walking and climbing around construction sites safely. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled in favor of the city. That ruling was upheld by the 5th Cir- cuit, which agreed that Chiari was no longer qualified to be a con- struction inspector. Citing Arline (see Appendix IV:329) and other section 504 cases, the appeals court said a \"handicapped person cannot perform the essential functions of a job if his handicap poses a significant safety risk to those around him.\" To support its judgment, the court cited the neurosurgeons' di- agnoses that Chiari's balance problem would prevent him from working safely. Chiari 's doctor concluded similarly when he was read the job description during the case . The appeals court disagreed with Chiari that the risk of per- sona l injury was immaterial. It cited section 501 regulations that include \"health and safety of the individual\" in the definition of qualified handicapped person. The existence of a personal safety rule in section 501 creates a similar rule under section 504, the court said. Finally, the court ruled that city officials \"went beyond their statutory duty in an effort to accommodate Chiari 's disease\" and that they were not required to create a new part-time position as an accommodation. \"All the city must do is demonstrate that a part-time sched ule would not accommodate Chiari' s performance on that job that he is currently doing,\" it said. \"Even if Chiari worked fewer hour s, he still would not be able to climb buildings or climb into ditches, \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. April 1991 PAGE 257 [which are] 'esse ntial functions ' of a construction inspector 's job.\" For the same reasons cited under section 504, the court found no violations of the Texas discrimination law. 493 Gault v. University of Chicago Hospitals, No. 90-C0321 (N.D. Ill. 1991) Epileptic nurse not otherwise qualified to work in burn unit of hospital A nurse who suffers from epileptic seizures is not \"otherwise qualified \" within in the meaning of Section 504 of the Rehabilita- tion Act to work in the bum unit of a hospital, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled. Freida Gault sued the University of Chicago Hospitals for al- legedly violating section 504 when it dismissed her as a bum-unit nurse . Gault has idiopathic epilepsy, which causes her to have un- predictable generalized seizures. Before the onset of a seizure, Gault will stare blankly . She then experiences convulsions, falls to floor and loses consciousness. After she recovers, there is a period of confusion. Gault suffered seizures while on duty. According to hospital officials, seizures occurred while she was: using scissors to change a dressing; assisting an infant 's breathing apparatus \"re- sulting in extubation of the patient and her inability to summon needed medical care\"; and cutting a dressing, which caused the patient to leave his room to summon help. Additionally, Gault suffered a head injury during one seizure that required emergency room treatment and made her unable to help a seriously burned patient on a ventilator and tube feeding. The hospitals knew of Gault's condition before they hired her, and did not relieve her from duty after the first seizure. One doc- tor at the hospital thought the seizures were under control and would not endanger her or others. Several seizures followed, how- ever, and Gault agreed to consult an expert from another hospital. That doctor told Gault that the seizures were not under control and that it was dangerous for her to work in a burn unit or operat- ing room. Gault would not tell hospital officials about this diagno- sis, and as a result , the hospitals placed her on leave. Based on these circumstances, the court ruled that Gault is not otherwise qualified because she was not meeting the position re- quirements of a burn-unit nurse. Further, the court found no sec- tion 504 violations on the part of the hospitals. Gault cannot \"contend that the decision process to remove her from the burn unit ... was motivated by prejudice against her handicap or was conducted unfairly, \" the court said. \"The hospi- tals are indisputably willing to hire epileptics and to assign them to critica l care units.\" Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 106 of 290( ( Handbook Page Changes in Supplement No. 14 7 February 1991 Pages to be DISCARDED Pages to be ADDED Description of Revisions v & vi (January 1991) Appendix Ill Table of Contents (October 1990) Appendix Ill pp. 111:8:1-11 (July 1988) pp. 183-184 (November 1990) None 1-800-424-2959 Toll-Free (Dated February 1991) v & vi Update to Current Contents page.

On Jan. 13, 1978, HEW issued implementing regulations (45 CFR 85.1-85.58) at 43 Federal Register 2132. When the Department of Education (ED) was established in 1980, authority for coordinating the government-wide enforcement of section 504 was transferred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This authority was transferred again, by Executive Order 12250 on Nov. 2, 1980, to the Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). On Aug. 11, 1981, DOJ issued a final rule in the Federal Register, Page 40686, transferring the original HEW regulation issued as 45 CFR Part 85 (sections 85.1-85.58) to title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations and redesignating it as 28 CFR Part 41 (sections 41.1-41.58). The transfer did not change the guidelines substantively. In some cases throughout the Handbook, references are made to the HEW regulations (45 CFR 85.1-85.58) rather than the renumbered (but identical) DOJ regulations (28 CFR 41.1-41.58). To find the appropriate section of the government-wide regulation using the HEW references, look for the appropriate section number (which falls after the period -e.g., section 85.4 would refer to section 4). A reference to 45 CFR 85.4, for instance, can be found at 28 CFR 41.4, or 45 CFR 85.7 can be found at 28 CFR 41.7.

The Department of Jus\u00b7 tice has advised this Department, on the basis or Its analysis of the leglsla\u00b7 live history of section 504. that Con- gress intended the reach of section 504 to be \"co-extensive with that of <Lilies VI and IX>. thus excluding programs oC guarantee and insurance.\" The final regulation reflects that determination . Despite some difference in the word \u00b7 Ing o! the definitions of federa.l finan\u00b7 clal assistance in the regulations im\u00b7 plementlng section 504 and title VJ, the substance of the two dertnltlons does not di!Cer. Several commenlers misunderstood the \u00a7 an ul- timate beneficiary is not the final \"recipient,\" but the student, patient . or other individual who participates in the assisted program . One comment asked whether the definition of facility in\u00a7 85.Jtfl applies only to land\u00b7ba.sed facilities. Although the definition is not so limited. the De\u00b7 partment agrees with the observation that dif!erenl standards may be needed for vessels than for ot.her fa\u00b7 cilities. The appropriate mechanism for the recoinition of such differ\u00b7 ences. however. is in the regulations of the agencies that provide assi~tance to programs involving vessels . Section 85.4 contains procedures for the promulcaUon of ~ency regula\u00b7 tion.s. In accordance wit.h section 2 oC the. executive order, such regulations are required to be consistent with the standards and guidelines contained in this rea-ulation . Agencies are encour- aged to examine Subparts A. B. and C of Lhe HEW section 504 regulation to determine whet.her their regulations should Include any of the more de\u00b7 tailed provisions to be found there. In addition, each agency should examine the programs and activities to which it provides assistance to determine whether detailed requirements con\u00b7 cernlng any such program or activity should be Included In its regulation. slmJ,lar to those contained In Subparts D. E. and F oC the HEW section 504 regulation. A number of reciplenl..s objected to the requirement in paragraph <al that each a.gency is.sue a separate section 504 reiulation and would have pre- ferred implementation through one reiulation enforced by one agency - the system used for section 503. Al\u00b7 though the provision for interagency cooperation set forth in t 85.6 should take care of many of Lhe problems foreseen by these commenters. there are Bdmilted advantages to the single agency system. This approach is pre\u00b7 clud~d here. however. because section HEW regulations (45 CFR \u00a7\u00a785 .1-85.58) were replaced by Justice Department regulations (28 CFR \u00a7\u00a741.1-41 .58).

In response to comment , the time for preparation of a proposed rule ha.s been extended to 90 days. Three acen\u00b7 cles commented that more than 90 days would be ttqulred for this pur\u00b7 pose. While the Department recog- nizes that the problema to be resolved by these agencies are complex, It be\u00b7 lleves that every effort should be made to meet this schedule . M stated In the proposed regulation, the Secretary believes that the provi- sion for rniew of each agency's draft final rerutatlon by the Dln~ctor ot the HEW Office for.Civil Rights before It is Clnally Issued Is an eHectlve and ap- propriate method or promoting consls\u00b7 tency of regulation under section 504 throughout the government. Although :.. few commenters suggested the need ror some additional, formal mecha\u00b7 nlsm for detc:rmlnlne whether an agency rerulatlon conforms to this reculatlon . we believe that public com\u00b7 ment, together with review by the Office for Civil Rights, will suffice. One change has been made In para\u00b7 graph 4<c>. The phr&H \"aid , bencflta, or services\" has been substituted for the word \"services\" so aa to describe more adequately the nonemployment elements or various assisted prorr&rru1 and activities . One comment requested a statement by the Department that this ttgula\u00b7 lion creates no Judicially enforceable rl1ht.a. Such a statement, we believe, la Inappropriate and unnecessary. Whether any legally enforceable rl1hta are created by this rerulatlon la a matter for court.a to decide. We would only o~rve that the regulation applies to Federal agencies, not to re- cipients, and that It has no retroactive reach . Commenta led to three chanres In section 85.5 CEnforcementl . Adoption of title VI enforcement procedure. la not a required element of the enforce- ment ayatem; even thoae comment.en who do not entirely 1upport the title VI procedures favored their Inclusion becauae of the adv&n~ea of a 1lncle complaint mechanlam .

More specific guidance for conducting an evaluation, u well u a specific time for Its completion, should be provided In each agency's regulation. Despite these additions, f 85.5 la still not Intended to be exhaustive . Aren\u00b7 cles may wish to consider other addl\u00b7 Uons from the HEW section 504 recu\u00b7 latlon. such as the designation by a re\u00b7 elplent of an employee to coordinate 50-4 enforcement. Althou1h f 85.5 has not been amended to require aiencles to conduct pre-grant compliance re\u00b7 views, as surrested, the Department does arree that they are an effective means of ensuring compliance and therefore encouraaes agencies to con- duct such fevlews as a routine matter, especially with respect to major grants . Section 85.\u00abI conta.lns provisions con- cerning lnteragency cooperation . though were pleased that the Issue of coordlna.tlon of enforce\u00b7 ment among the various Federal agen\u00b7 cles had been addressed. many felt that this section failed to resolve a.de\u00b7 quately problems o! the recipient who receives rrants from more than one agency: Multiple assurance forms, In\u00b7 consistent regulations or enforcement procedures. multiple lnvestlratlons. Several commenters also surgested that the final regulation Incorporate some method for determlnln1 the prl\u00b7 ma.ry enforcement agency <such as the arency that provides the largest granta>. While the Department Is sym. pathetic wtth recipients' concerns, It believes that these problems can be re\u00b7 solved by the arencles themselves without further rerulatlon. M noted In the proPosed rerulatlon. agencies are encouraged to extend exlstlnr title VI deleratlons to section 504. Ensuring consistent. reculatlons should alleviate the problem aa well. If. however, theae mechanism.a prove to be Inadequate, the Department will la.sue further rules on the aubJect . One comment 1uggeated the need for standardized referral procedures when complaln&nts appeal to the wrong aaency. Althourh no chanre hu been made In the Deputment feels the islue la &n Im\u00b7 portant one. Each should adopt procedures to en.sure that miadlrected complaint.a are re- ferred to the proper &1ency, rather than belna returned to complainant., and to enaure that complainant.a are prompt.11 noWled of the referral.

The terms are not meant to specify any ex\u00b7 pllcll procedures. The requirement for consultation with the Architectural and TransPortatlon Barriers Compli- ance Board <ATBCB> In developing re- quirement.a for the acceulblllty of new construction and alteration ls based simply on the Department's belief that agencies should take advan~e of the Board 's expertise In this area. The coordination requirement ii de- signed to avoid Inconsistent or duplica- tive enforcement where the Jurlsdlc\u00b7 tlon of sectlona 502 or 503 overlaps with that of section 504. The ATBCB Itself suggested that each agency be required to enter Into a memorandum of understandlnr with the Board. Re\u00b7 qulrlnr formal agreements for this purpose, we believe, ts neither neces- sary nor advisable. Two arencles suggested that all mat- ters of employment discrimination against handicapped persons be co- ordinated by the Department of Labor <DOLi to avoid Inconsistent require\u00b7 ments being Imposed upon entitles that are both federal recipients and federal contractors. We believe that the requirements or the two rerula\u00b7 tlons are not Inconsistent despite some variance In languare. There must, of course, be close coordination of en- forcement wlth DOL when a recipient ls abo a contractor . A reneral rule that DOL should be the primary en\u00b7 forcement agency In this situation would not, however, be appropriate. Where a corporation that la a federal contractor geta minimal Ulllatance from another agency, DOL would be the natural lead &41ency. But where, for example, a university with a major HEW grant Is \u00b71.1ao a federal contrac- tor, HEW would more appropriately take the primary enforcement role, even with respect to employment. Several surrestlons were received concerning consultation &nd coordln&\u00b7 t.lon with other aaenclea In areu of po. tentlal overlap.

Another Issue raised during the com- ment period Is the question or the errect or \u00a7 85.57 upon the requirements or the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. Pub. L. 90-480. The relevant por\u00b7 Uon of that Act requires that, after 1968, all new construction and alter- ation receiving direct Federal financial assistance be accessible. One com- menter reared that recipients who had undertaken construction subject to the Architectural Barriers Act but who had !ailed to comply with the Act might feel that compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act would be excused If its program, on the whole. were accessible and thus in compliance with \u00a7 85.57. Such is not the case. The Department does not Intend, and has no authority, to interfere in any way with the requirements of the Architec- tural Barriers Act. Two comments requested that an ex- ception be added to \u00a7 85.57 Cor modtrl\u00b7 cations o! historic structures. While we a&\"ree that It Is Important to pre- serve historical structures. we believe that the nexlbility of the program ac- cessibility standard will permit recipi\u00b7 ent.s, with appropriate technicl\\l assis\u00b7 tance and advice. to make their pro-erams Impairing the lnteerlty of historic bulldlnes. Para.graph <cl, added In response to comment, requires that transition plans be developl'd in cases where structural modlCicatlons are necessary to achieve pro&\"ram &ecesslblllty. The schedule Cor completion or these plans, as well as any further require- ments deemed appropriate, Is left to the determination of each regulating agency. The plan Is to be developed with the aid of handicapped persons or their organlzaLlons. Section 85.58 requires new taclllties and, to the maximum extent feasible, alterations In existing facilities to be readily accessible. No accessibility standards have bet>n specified here: but &&\"encles should note that the HEW section 50-l regulation requires HEW rl'cipients either to meet the standards developed by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. <ANSI>. or to provide equivalent acces- sibility. Each agency should, In the In- terest or governmentwlde consistency, carefully consider adoption of the ANSI $tandards or their equivalent Cor any of Its programs to which the stan\u00b7 dards are applicable. A ~lff!cult problem that has arisen durlng the comment period with re\u00b7 spect to \u00a7 85.58 Is Its effect upon buses ordered in the Interval between the final issuance of individual agency 504 regull\\tions and the effective date of the Department of Transportation's ruling concernln& Transbus. <That ruling requires that all buses acquired with the a.sslstance of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration <UMT A>. ordered after September 30, 1979. meet the speclflcatlona for Transbus-a lo.w\u00b7floor, ramped bus.) Because or the complexity of the bus accessibility Issue, the final regulation has been amended to allow the De-8:11 pa.rlment of Transpartation <DOT> to defer the effective date for requlrinii all new buses to be accessible if DOT cC1ncludes durlne it.Ii section 504 rule\u00b7 ma.klnii process that It ls not possible to do so by the effective date of It.I own section 504 regulation and If com-parable. accessible .services are avail- able to handicapped persona in the meantime. The date may not. howev- er. be deferred beyond the present ef- fective date of the Tran.sbw declsion- Oct.ober l, 1979. Because this Department airrees that Transbus Is the most effective means of providtne handicapped per- sons with accessible bus transport&\u00b7 tion. It encoura&\"ea the Oepartml'nt of Transportation to take all possible steps to expedite the purcha.se of Transbus by Its recipients. The effective date of this reeulatlon ls January 13, 1978. Because the re1u- 1auon applies only to other federe.I agencies rather than to the public and because the eovernmentwlde Imple- mentation of section 504 should pro- ceed without further delay, the De\u00b7 partment believes that this departure from the normal 30\u00b7day waltlne period is warranted.

Access to pertinent records and facilities of a recipient pursuant to 45 CFR 80.6(c) (made applicable to this part by 45 CFR 84.61) shall not be limited to normal business hours when, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, immediate access is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped individual. (e) Expedited action to effect complian ce. The requirement of 45 CFR 80.8(d)(3) pertaining to notice to recipients prior to the initiation of action to effect compliance (made applicable to this part by 45 CFR 84.61) shall not apply when, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 129 of 290Appendix Ill immediate action to effect compliance is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped individual. In such cases the recipient will, as soon as practicable, be given oral or written notice of its failure to comply, of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and its continuing opportunity to comply voluntarily. (f) Model Infant Care Rel'iew Committee. Recipient health care providers wishing to establish Infant Care Review Committees should consider adoption of the following model. This model is advisory. Recipient health care providers are not required to establish a review committee or, if one is established, to adhere to this model. In seeking to determine compliance with this part, as it relates to health care for handicapped infants, by health care providers that have an lCRC established and operated substantially in accordance with this model , the Department will, to the extent possible, consult with the ICRC. ( 1) Establishment and purpose. (i) The hospital establishes an Infant Care Review Committee (ICRC) or joins with one or more other hospitals to create a joint ICRC. The establishing document will state that the ICRC is for the purpose of facilitating the development and implementation of standards, policies and procedures designed to assure that, while respecting reasonable medical judgments , treatment and nourishment not be withheld, solely on the basis of present or anticipated physical or mental impairments, from handicapped infants who, in spite of such impairments , will benefit medically from the treatment or nourishment. (ii) The activities of the lCRC will be guided by the following principles: (A) The interpretative guidelines of the Department relating to the applicability of this part to health care for handicapped infants. (B) As stated in the \"Principles of Treatment of Disabled Infants \" of the coalition of major medical and disability organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics , National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions , Association for Retarded Citizens, Down's Syndrome Congress, Spina Bifida Association, and others: When medical care is clearly beneficial, it should always be provided. When appropriate medical care is not available, arrangements should be made to transfer the infant to an appropriate medical facility. Consideration such as anticipated or actual limited potential of an individual and present or future lack of available community resources are irrelevant and must not determine the decisions concerning medical care. The individual' s medical condition should be the sole focus of the decision. These are very strict standards. It is ethically and legally justified to withhold medical or surgical procedures which are clearly futile and will only prolong HHS Agency Regulations the act of dying. However, supportive care should be provided , including sustenance as medically indicated and relief of pain and suffering. The needs of the dying person should be respected. The family also should be supported in its grieving. In cases where it is uncertain whether medical treatment will be beneficial, a person's disability must not be the basis for a decision to withhold treatment. At all times during the process when decisions are being made about the benefit or futility of medical treatment , the person should be cared for in the medically most appropriate ways. When doubt exists at any time about whether to treat , a presumption always should be in favor of treatment. (C) As stated by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research : This [standard for providing medically beneficial treatment] is a very strict standard in that it excludes consideration of the negative effects of an impaired child's life on other persons, including parents, siblings, and society. Although abiding by this standard may be difficult in specific cases, it is all too easy to undervalue the lives of handicapped infants ; the Commission finds it imperative to counteract this by treating them no less vigorously than their healthy peers or than older children with similar handicaps would be treated. (iii) The ICRC will carry out its purposes by: (A) Recommending institutional policies concerning the withholding or withdrawal of medical or surgical treatments to infants, including guidelines for ICRC action for specific categories of life-threatening conditions affecting infants; (B) Providing advice in specific cases when decisions are being considered to withhold or withdraw from infant life- sustaining medical or surgical treatment; and (C) Reviewing retrospectively on a regular basis infant medical records in situations in which life-sustaining medical or surgical treatment has been withheld or withdrawn. (2) Organization and staffing. The ICRC will consist of at least 7 members and include the following: (i) A practicing physician (e.g., a pediatrician, a neonatologist, or a pediatric surgeon), (ii) A practicing nurse , (iii) A hospital administrator, (iv) A representative of the legal profession , (v) A representative of a disability group. or a developmental disability expert, (vi) A lay community member, and (vii) A member of a facility's organized medical staff, who shall serve as chairperson. In connection with review of specific cases, one member of the ICRC shall be designated to act as \"spec ial advocate\" for the infant, as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(E) of the section. The hospital will provide staff \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:10 support for the ICRC , including legal counsel. The ICRC will meet on a regular basis , or as required below in connection with review of specific cases. It shall adopt or recommend to the appropriate hospital official or body such administrative policies as terms of office and quorum requirements. The ICRC will recommend procedures to ensure that both hospital personnel and patient families are fully informed of the existence and functions of the ICRC and its availability on a 24-hour basis. (3) Operation of ICRC-(i) Prospe ctive policy de1\u00b7elopme11t. (A) The ICRC will develop and recommend for adoption by the hospital institutional policies concerning the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment for infants with life-threatening conditions. These will include guidelines for management of specific types of cases or diagnoses, for example, Down 's syndrome and spina bifida , and procedures to be followed in such recurring circumstances as, for example, brain death and parental refusal to consent to life-saving treatment. The hospital, upon recommendation of the ICRC, may require attending physicians to notify the ICRC of the presence in the facility of an infant with a diagnosis specified by the lCRC, e.g., Down 's syndrome and spina bifida. (B) In recommending these policies and guidelines, the ICRC will consult with medical and other authorities on issues involving disabled individuals , e.g., neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, county and city agencies which provide services for the disabled, and disability advocacy organizations. It will also consult with appropriate committees of the medical staff, to ensure that the ICRC policies and guidelines build on existing staff by-laws, rules and regulations concerning consultations and staff membership requirements. The TCRC will also inform and educate hospital staff on the policies and guidelines it develops. (ii) Review of specific cases. In addition to regularly scheduled meetings , interim ICRC meetings will take place under specified circumstances to permit review of individual cases. The hospital will, to the extent possible , require in each case that life- sustaining treatment be continued, until the ICRC can review the case and provide advice. (A) Interim ICRC meetings will be convened within 24 hours (or less if indicated) when there is disagreement between the family of an infant and the infant's physician as to the withholding or withdrawal of treatment, when a preliminary decision to withhold or withdraw life- sustaining treatment has been made in certain categories of cases identified by the ICRC, when there is disagreement between members of the hospital's medical and/or nursing staffs, or when otherwise appropriate. Handicapped Requirements Handbook I \\ This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 130 of 290( ( Appendix Ill (B) Such interim ICRC meetings will take place upon the request of any members of the ICRC or hospital staff or parent or guardian of the infant. The ICRC will have procedures to preserve the confidentiality of the identity of persons making such requests, and such persons shall be protected from reprisal. When appropriate, the ICRC or a designated member will inform the requesting individual of the ICRC's recommendation. (C) The ICRC may provide for telephone and other forms of review when the timing and nature of the case , as identified in policies developed by the ICRC, make the convening of an interim meeting impracticable. (D) Interim meetings will be open to the affected parties. The ICRC will ensure that the interests of the parents , the physician , and the child are fully considered; that family members have been fully informed of the patient's condition and prognosis; that they have been provided with a listing which describes the services furnished by parent support groups and public and private agencies in the geographic vicinity to infants with conditions such as that before the ICRC; and that the ICRC will facilitate their access to such services and groups. (E) To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of all options and factors pertinent to the committee's deliberations, the chairperson will designate one member of the ICRC to act, in connection with that specific case, as special advocate for the infant. The special advocate will seek to ensure that all consideratio ns in favor of the provision of life-sustaining treatment are fully evaluated and considered by the ICRC. (F) In cases in which there is disagreement on treatme nt between a physician and an infant ' s fami ly, and the family wishes to continue life-sustaining treatment, the fami ly's wishes will be carried out, for as long as the family wishes, unless such treatment is medically contraindicated. When there is physician/family disagreement and the family refuses consent to life- sustaining treatment , and the ICRC, after due deliberation, agrees with the family, the ICRC will recommend that the treatment be withheld. When there is physician/family disagreement and the family refuses consent , but the ICRC disagrees with the family , the ICRC will recommend to the hospital board or appropriate official that the case be referred immediately to an appropriate court or child protective agency, and every effort shall be made to continue treatment , preserve the status quo, and prevent worsening of the infant's condition until such time as the court or agency renders a decision or takes other appropriate action. The ICRC will also follow this procedure in cases in which the family and physician agree that life- sustaining treatment should be withheld or withdrawn , but the ICRC disagrees . (iii) Retrospectiv e record review. The ICRC, at its regularly -scheduled meeting , HHS Agency Regulations will review all records involving withholding or termination of medical or surgical treatment to infants consistent with hospital policies developed by the ICRC , unless the case was previously before the ICRC pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. If the ICRC finds that a deviation was made from the institutional policies in a given case, it shall conduct a review and report the findings to appropriate hospital personne l for appropriate action. (4) Records. The ICRC will maintain records of all of its deliberations and summary descriptions of specific cases considered and the disposition of those cases. Such records will be kept in accordance with institutional policies on confidentiality of medical information . They will be made avai lable to appropriate government agencies , or upon court order, or as otherwise required by law. \u00a7\u00a784.56-84.60 [Reserved] Subpart G-Procedures \u00a784.61 Procedures . The procedural provisions applicab le to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply to this part. These procedures are found in \u00a7\u00a780.6-80.10 and Part 81 of this Title. \u00a7\u00a784 .62-84 .99 [Reserved] NOTE: Incorporation by reference provisions approved by the Director of the Federal Register, May 27, 1975. Incorporated documents are on file at the Office of the Federal Register. APPENDIX A-ANALYSIS OF FINAL REGULATION SUBPART A - GENERAL PROVISIONS Definitions -1. \"Recipient \" . Section 84.23 contains definitions used throughout the regu lation. Most of the comments concerning \u00a784.3(f), which contains the definition of \"recipient,\" commended the inclusion of recipient whose sole source of Federa l financial assistance is Medicaid. The Secretary believes that such Medicaid providers should be regarded as recipients under the statute and the regu lation and should be held individually responsible for administering services in a nondiscriminatory fashion. Accordingly , \u00a784.3(f) has not been changed. Small Medicaid providers, however , are exempt from some of the regulation's administrative provisions (those that apply to recipients with fifteen or more employees). And such recipients will be permitted to refer patients to accessible facilities in certain limited circumstances under revised \u00a784.22(b). The Secretary recognizes the difficulties involved in federal enforcement of this regulation with respect to thousands of individual Medicaid providers. As in the case of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Office for Civil Rights will concentrate its compliance efforts on the state Medicaid \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:11 agencies and will look primarily to them to ensure compliance by individual providers . One other comment requested that the regulation specify that nonpublic elementary and secondary schools that are not otherwise recipients do not become recipients by virtue of the fact their students participate in certain federally funded programs. The Secretary believes it unnecessary to amend the regulation in this regard, because almost identical language in the Department's regulations implementing title VI and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has consistently been interpreted so as not to render such schools recipients. These schools, however, are indirectly subject to the substantive requirements of this regulation through the application of \u00a784.4(b)(iv), which prohibits recipients from assisting agencies that discriminate on the basis of handicap in providing services to beneficiaries of the recipients ' programs. 2. \"Federal financial assistance\". In \u00a784.3(h), defin ing federal financia l assistance, a clarifying change has been made: procurement contracts are specifica lly excluded. They are covered , however, by the Department of Labor 's regulation under section 503. The Department has never considered such contracts to be contracts of assistance; the explicit exemption has been added only to avoid possible confusion. The proposed regulation's exemption of contracts of insurance or guaranty has been retained. A number of comments argued for its deletion on the ground that section 504, unlike title VI and title IX, contains no statutory exemption for such contracts. There is no indication , however, in the legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or of the amendments to that Act in 1974, that Congress intended section 504 to have a broader application , in terms of federa l financial assistance, than other civil rights statutes. Indeed, Congress directed that section 504 be implemented in the same manner as titles VI and IX. In view of the long established exemption of contracts of insurance or guaranty under title VI, we think it unlikely that Congress intended section 504 to apply to such contracts . In its May 1976 Notice of Intent, the Department suggested that the arrangement under which individual practitioners , hospitals, and other facilities receive reimbursement for providing services to beneficiaries under Part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) constitutes a contract of insurance or guaranty and thus falls within the exemption from the regulation . This explanation oversimplified the Department 's view of whether Medicare Part B constitutes Federal financial assistance. The Department 's position has consistently been that, whether or not Medicare Part B arrangements invo lve a contract of insurance or guaranty, no Federal financial assistance flows from the Department to the doctor or other practitioner under the program, since Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 131 of 290Appendix Ill Medicare B-like other social security programs-is basically a program of payments to direct beneficiaries. 3. \"Handicapped person.\" Section 84.3(j), which defines the class of persons protected under the regulation, has not been substantially changed. The definition of handicapped person in paragraph (j)(I) conforms to the statutory definition of handicapped person that is applicable to section 504, as set forth in section 111 (a) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 , Pub. L. 93-516. The first of the three parts of the statutory and regulatory definition includes any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Paragraph (j)(2)(i) further defines physical or mental impairments. The definition does not set forth a list of specific diseases and conditions that constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list. The term includes, however, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic , visual , speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and, as discussed below, drug addiction and alcoholism. It should be emphasized that a physical or mental impairment does not constitute a handicap for purposes of section 504 unless its severity is such that it results in a substantial limitation of one or more major life activities. Several comments observed the lack of any definition in the proposed regulation of the phrase \"substantially limits.\" The Department does not believe that a definition of this term is possible at this time. A related issue raised by several comments is whether the definition of handicapped person is unreasonably broad. Comments suggested narrowing the definition in various ways. The most common recommendation was that only \"traditional\" handicaps be covered. The Department continues to believe, however, that it has no flexibility within the statutory definition to limit the term to persons who have those severe, permanent, or progressive conditions that are most commonly regarded as handicaps. The Department intends, however, to give particular attention in its enforcement of section 504 to eliminating discrimination against persons with the severe handicaps that were the focus of concern in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The definition of handicapped person also includes specific limitations on what persons are classified as handicapped under the regulation. The first of the three parts of the definition specifies that only physical and mental handicaps are included. Thus, environmental, cultural, and economic disadvantage are not in themselves covered; nor are prison records, age, or HHS Agency Regulations homosexuality. Of course, if a person who has any of these characteristics also has a physical or mental handicap , the person is included within the definition of handicapped person. In paragraph (j)(2)(i) , physical or mental impairment is defined to include, among other impairments, specific learning disabilities. The Department will interpret the term as it is used in section 602 of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended. Paragraph ( 15) of section 602 uses the term \"specific learning disabilities \" to describe such conditions as perceptual handicaps , brain injury , minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. Paragraph (j)(2)(i) has been shortened, but not substantively changed, by the deletion of clause (C), which made explicit the inclusion of any condition which is mental or physical but whose precise nature is not at present known. Clauses (A) and (B) clearly comprehend such conditions. The second part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who has a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Under the definition of \"record\" in paragraph (j)(2)(iii), persons who have a history of a handicapping condition but no longer have the condition, as well as persons who have been incorrectly classified as having such a condition, are protected from discrimination under section 504. Frequently occurring examples of the first group are persons with histories of mental or emotional illness , heart disease, or cancer; of the second group, persons who have been misclassified as mentally retarded. The third part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.It includes many persons who are ordinarily considered to be handicapped but who do not technically fall within the first two parts of the statutory definition, such as persons with a limp. This part of the definition also includes some persons who might not ordinarily be considered handicapped, such as persons with disfiguring scars, as well as persons who have no physical or mental impairment but are treated by a recipient as if they were handicapped. 4. Drug addicts and alcoholics. As was the case during the first comment period , the issue of whether to include drug addicts and alcoholics within the definition of handicapped person was of major concern to many commenters. The arguments presented on each side of the issue were similar during the two comment periods, as was the preference of commenters for exclusion of this group of persons. While some comments reflected misconceptions about the implications of including alcoholics and \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:12 drug addicts within the scope of the regulation , the Secretary understands the concerns that underlie the comments on this question and recognizes that application of section 504 to active alcoholics and drug addicts presents sensitive and difficult questions that must be taken into account in interpretation and enforcement. The Secretary has carefully examined the issue and has obtained a legal opinion from the Attorney General. That opinion concludes that drug addiction and alcoholism are \"physical or mental impairments \" within the meaning of section 7(6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended , and that drug addicts and alcoholics are therefore handicapped for purposes of section 504 if their impairment substantially limits one of their major life activities. The Secretary therefore believes that he is without authority to exclude these conditions from the definition. There is a medical and legal consensus that alcoholism and drug addiction are diseases , although there is disagreement as to whether they are primarily mental or physical. In addition, while Congress did not focus specifically on the problems of drug addiction and alcoholism in enacting section 504, the committees that considered the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were made aware of the Department's long-standing practice of treating addicts and alcoholics as handicapped individuals eligible for rehabilitation services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. \\ The Secretary wishes to reassure recipients that inclusion of addicts and alcoholics within the scope of the regulation will not lead to the consequences feared by many commenters. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the statute and the regulation apply only to discrimination against qualified handicapped persons solely by reason of their handicap. The fact that drug addiction and alcoholism may be handicaps does not mean that these conditions must be ignored in determining whether an individual is qualified for services or employment opportunities . On the contrary, a recipient may hold a drug addict or alcoholic to the same standard of performance and behavior to which it holds others , even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the person 's drug addiction or alcoholism . In other words , while an alcoholic or drug addict may not be denied services or disqualified from employment solely because of his or her condition, the behavioral manifestations of the condition may be taken into account in determining whether he or she is qualified. With respect to the employment of a drug addict or alcoholic , if it can be shown that the addiction or alcoholism prevents successful performance of the job, the person need not be provided the employment opportunity in question . For example , in making employment decisions, a recipient may judge addicts and alcoholics on the Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 132 of 290{ ( Appendix Ill same basis it judges all other applicants and employees.Thus, a recipient may consider - for all applicants including drug addicts and alcoholics -past personnel records, absenteeism, disruptive, abusive, or dangerous behavior, violations of rules and unsati sfactory work performance. Moreover, employers may enforce rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol or drugs in the workplace, provided that such rules are enforced against all employees. With respect to services, there is evidence that drug addicts and alcoholics are often denied treatment at hospitals for conditions unrelated to their addiction or alcoholism. In addition, some addicts and alcoholics have been denied emergency treatment. These practices have been specifically prohibited by section 407 of the Drug Abuse Office and TreatmentActofl972(21 U.S.C.1174)and section 321 of the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4581), as amended. These statutory provisions are also administered by the Department's Office for Civil Rights and are implemented in \u00a784.53 of this regulation. With respect to other services, the implications of coverage of alcoholics and drug addicts are two-fold: first, no person may be excluded from services solely by reason of the presence or history of these conditions; second, to the extent that the manifestations of the condition prevent the person from meeting the basic eligibility requirements of the program or cause substantial interference with the operation of the program , the condition may be taken into consideration. Thus, a college may not exclude an addict or alcoholic as a student, on the basis of addiction or alcoholism, if the person can succe ssfully participate in the education program and complies with the rules of the college and if his or her behavior does not impede the performance of other students. Of great concern to many commenters was the question of what effect the inclusion of drug addicts and alcoholics as handicapped persons would have on school disciplinary rules prohibiting the use or possession of drugs or alcohol by students. Neither such rules nor their application to drug addicts or alcoholics is prohibited by this regulation , provided that the rules are enforced evenly with respect to all student s. 5. \"Qua lified handicapped person.\" Paragraph (k) of \u00a784.3 defines the term \"qualified handicapped person.\" Throughout the regulation, this term is used instead of the statutory term \"otherwise qualified handi capped person.\" The Department believes that the omission of the word \"otherwis e\" is necessary in order to comport with the intent of the statute because , read literally , \"otherwi se\" qualified handicapped persons include persons who are qualified except for their handicap , rather than in spite of their handi cap. Under such a literal reading, a blind person possessing all the HHS Agency Regulations qualifications for driving a bus except sight could be said to be \"otherwise qualified \" for the job of driving. Clearly, such a result was not intended by Congress. In all other respects, the terms \"qualified\" and \"otherwise qualified\" are intended to be interchangeable . Section 84.3(k)( 1) defines a qualified handicapped person with respect to employment as a handicapped person who can, with reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job in question . The term \"essential functions \" does not appear in the corresponding provision of the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation, and a few commenters objected to its inclusion on the ground that a handicapped person should be able to perform all job tasks. However, the Department believes that inclusion of the phrase is useful in emphasizing that handicapped persons should not be disqualified simply because they may have difficulty in performing tasks that bear only a marginal relationship to a particular job. Further, we are convinced that inclusion of the phrase is not inconsistent with the Department of Labor 's application of its definition. Certain commenters urged that the definition of qualified handicapped person be amended so as explicitly to place upon the employer the burden of showing that a particular mental or physical characteristic is essential. Because the same result is achieved by the requirement contained in paragraph (a) of \u00a784.13, which requires an employer to establish that any selection criterion that tends to screen out handicapped persons is job-related, that recommendation has not been followed. Section 84.3(k)(2) (formerly \u00a784.3(k)(3)) defines qualified handicapped person , with respect to preschool, elementary, and secondary programs, in terms of age. Several commenters recommended that eligibility for the services be based upon the standard of substantial benefit, rather than age, because of the need of many handicapped children for early or extended services if they are to have an equal opportunity to benefit from education programs. No change has been made in this provision, again because of the extreme difficulties in administration that would result from the choice of the former standard. Under the remedial action provisions of \u00a784.6(a)(3), however, persons beyond the age limits prescribed in \u00a784.3(k)(2) may in appropriate cases be required to be provided services that they were formerly denied because of a recipient 's violation of section 504. Section 84.3(k)(2) states that a handicapped person is qualified for preschool, elementary, or secondary services if the person is of an age at which nonhandicapped persons are eligible for such services or at which state law mandates the provision of educational services of \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. February 1991 C:13 handicapped persons. In addition, the extended age ranges for which recipients must provide full educational opportunity to all handicapped persons in order to be eligible for assistance under the Education of the Handicapped Act -generally, 3-18 as of September 1978 , and 3-21 as of September 1980 are incorporated by reference in this paragraph. Section 84.3(k)(3) formerly \u00a784.3(k)(2)) defines qualified handicapped person with respect to postsecondary educational programs . As revised , the paragraph means that both academic and technical standards must be met by applicants to these programs . The term \"technical standards\" refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria that are essential to participation in the program in question. 6. General prohibitions against discrimination. Section 84.4 contains general prohibitions against discrimination applicable to all recipients of assistance from this Department. Paragraph (b)( 1 )(i) prohibit~the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from aids, benefits, or services, and paragraph (ii) requires that equal opportunity to participate or benefit be provided . Paragraph (iii) requires that services provided to handicapped persons be as effective as those provided to the nonhandicapped. In paragraph (iv), different or separate services are prohibited except when necessary to provide equally effective benefits. In this context , the term \"equally effective,\" defined in paragraph (b)(2) , is intended to encompass the concept of equivalent, as opposed to identical, services and to acknowledge the fact that in order to meet the individual needs of handicapped persons to the same extent that the corresponding needs of nonhandicapped persons are met, adjustments to regular programs or the provision of different programs may sometimes be necessary . For example, a welfare office that uses the telephone for communicating with its clients must provide alternative modes of communicating with its deaf clients. This standard parallels the one established under title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to the provision of educational services to students whose primary language is not English. See Lau 1>. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 ( 1974) . To be equally effective, however, an aid, benefit , or service need not produce equal results; it merely must afford an equal opportunity to achieve equal results. It must be emphasized that, although separate services must be required in some instances, the provision of unnecessarily separate or different services is discriminatory . The addition to paragraph (b)(2) of the phrase \"in the most integrated setting appropriated to the person's needs\" is intended to reinforce this general concept. A new paragraph (b)(3) has also been added to \u00a784.4, requiring recipients to give qualified handicapped persons the option of Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 133 of 290Appendix Ill participating in regular programs despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs . The requirement has been reiterated in \u00a7\u00a784.38 and 84.47 in connection with physical education and athletics programs . Section 84.4(b)(l)(v) prohibits a recipient from supporting another entity or person that subjects participants or employees in the recipient's program to discrimination on the basis of handicap. This section would, for example, prohibit financial support by a recipient to a community recreational group or to a professional or social organization that discriminates against handicapped persons. Among the criteria to be considered in each case are the substantiality of the relationship between the recipient and the other entity, including financial support by the recipient, and whether the other entity's activities relate so closely to the recipient ' s program or activity that they fairly should be considered activities of the recipient itself. Paragraph (b)(l)(vi) was added in response to comment in order to make explicit the prohibition against denying qualified handicapped persons the opportunity to serve on planning and advisory boards responsible for guiding federally assisted programs or activities. Several comments appeared to interpret \u00a784.4(b)(5), which proscribes discriminatory site selection, to prohibit a recipient that is located on hilly terrain from erecting any new buildings at its present site. That, of course, is not the case. The paragraph is not intended to apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing site. Of course, any such facilities must be made accessible in accordance with the requirements of \u00a784.23. 7. Assurances of compliance. Section 84.5(a) requires a recipient to submit to the Director an assurance that each of its programs and activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financial assistance from this Department will be conducted in compliance with this regulation. To facilitate the submission of assurances by thousands of Medicaid providers, the Department will follow the title VI procedures of accepting, in lieu of assurances, certification on Medicaid vouchers. Many commenters also sought relief from the paperwork requirements imposed by the Department's enforcement of its various civil rights responsibilities by requesting the Department to issue one form incorporating title VI, title IX, and section 504 assurances. The Secretary is sympathetic to this request. While it is not feasible to adopt a single civil rights assurance form at this time , the Office for Civil Rights will work toward that goal. 8. Private rights of action. Several comments urged that the regulation incorporate provision granting beneficiaries a private right of action against recipients under section 504. To confer such a right is beyond the authority of the executive branch HHS Agency Regulations of Government . There is, however , case law holding that such a right exists . Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority , 548 F. 2d 1277 (7th (S.D. W. Jan. F. Supp. 982 (E.D 1976); cf. Lau v. Nichols, supra. 9. Remedial action. Where there has been a finding of discrimination, \u00a784.6 requires a recipient to take remedial action to overcome the effects of the discrimination . Actions that might be required under paragraph (a)(!) include provision of services to persons previously discriminated against, reinstatement of employees and development of a remedial action plan. Should a recipient fail to take required remedial action, the ultimate sanctions of court action or termination of Federal financial assistance may be imposed. Paragraph (a)(2) extends the responsibility for taking remedial action to a recipient that exercises control over a noncomplying recipient.Paragraph (a)(3) also makes clear that handicapped persons who are not in the program at the time that remedial action is required to be taken may also be the subject of such remedial action. This paragraph has been revised in response to comments in order to include persons who would have been in the program if discriminatory practices had not existed. Paragraphs (a) (I), (2), and (3) have also been amended in response to comments to make plain that, in appropriate cases, remedial action might be required to redress clear violations of the statute itself that occurred before the effective date of this regulation. 10. Voluntary action. In \u00a784.6(b), the term \"voluntary action \" has been substituted for the term \"affirmative action\" because the use of the latter term led to some confusion. We believe the term \"voluntary action\" more accurately reflects the purpose of the paragraph. This provision allows action, beyond that required by the regulation, to overcome conditions that led to limited participation by handicapped persons , whether or not the limited participation was caused by any discriminatory actions on the part of the recipient. Several commenters urged that paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to require remedial action to overcome effects of prior discriminatory practices regardless of whether there has been an express finding of discrimination. The self- evaluation requirement in paragraph (c) accomplishes much the same purpose. 11. Self-evaluation. Paragraph (c) requires recipients to conduct a self-evaluation in order to determine whether their policies or practices may discriminate against handicapped persons and to take steps to modify any discriminatory policies and practices and their effects. The Department received many comments approving of the addition to paragraph (c) of a requirement that recipients seek the assistance of handicapped person s in the self-evaluation \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:14 process. This paragraph has been further amended to require consultation with handicapped persons or organizations representing them before recipients undertake the policy modifications and remedial steps prescribed in paragraphs (c)(l )(ii) and (iii). Paragraph (c)(2), which sets forth the recordkeeping requirements concerning self- evaluation , now applies only to recipients with fifteen or more employees. This change was made as part of an effort to reduce unnecessary or counterproductive administrative obligations on small recipients. For those recipients required to keep records, the requirements have been made more specific; records must include a list of persons consulted and a description of areas examined, problems identified, and corrective steps taken. Moreover, the records must be made available for public inspection. 12. Griel'Gn ce procedure. Section 84. 7 (formerly \u00a784.8) requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to designate an individual responsible for coordinating its compliance efforts and to adopt a grievance procedure. Two changes were made in the section in response to comment. A general requirement that appropriate due process procedures be followed has been added. It was decided that the details of such procedures could not at this time be specified because of the varied nature of the persons and entities who must establish the procedures and of the programs to which they apply. A sentence was also added to make clear that grievance procedures are not required to be made available to unsuccessful applicants for employment or to applicants for admission to colleges and universities. The regulation does not require that grievance procedures be exhausted before recourse is sought from the Department. However , the Secretary believes that it is desirable and efficient in many cases for complainants to seek resolution of their complaints and disputes at the local level and therefore encourages them to use available grievance procedures. A number of comments asked whether compliance with this section or the notice requirements of \u00a784.8 could be coordinated with comparable action required by the title IX regulation. The Department encourages such efforts. 13. Norice. Section 84.8 (formerly \u00a784.9) sets forth requirements for dissemination of statements of nondiscrimination policy by recipients. It is important that both handicapped persons and the public at large be aware of the obligations of recipients under section 504. Both the Department and recipients have responsibilities in this regard. Indeed the Department intends to undertake a major public information effort to inform persons of their right s under section 504 and this regulation. In \u00a784.8 the Department has Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 134 of 290( ( Appendix Ill sought to impose a clear obligation on major recipients to notify beneficiaries and employees of the requirements of section 504, without dictating the precise way in which this notice must be given. At the same time, we have avoided imposing requirements on small recipients (those with fewer than fifteen employees) that would create unnecessary and counterproductive paper work burdens on them and unduly stretch the enforcement resources of the Department. Section 84.8(a), as simplified, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to take appropriate steps to notify beneficiaries and employees of the recipient's obligations under section 504. The last sentence of \u00a784.8(a) has been revised to list possible, rather than required , means of notification . Section 84.8(b) requires recipients to include a notification of their policy of nondiscrimination in recruitment and other general information materials. In response to a number of comments, \u00a784,8 has been revised to delete the requirements of publication in local newspapers, which has proved to be both troublesome and ineffective. Several commenters suggested that notification on separate forms be allowed until present stocks of publications and forms are depleted. The final regulation explicitly allows this method of compliance. The separate form should, however, be included with each significant publication or form that is distributed. Former \u00a784.9(b)(2), which prohibited the use of materials that might give the impression that a recipient excludes qualified handicapped persons from its program, has been deleted. The Department is convinced by the comments that this provision is unnecessary and difficult to apply. The Department encourages recipients, however , to include in their recruitment and other general information materials photographs of handic apped persons and ramps and other features of accessible buildings. Under new \u00a784.9 the Director may, under certain circumstances, require recipients with fewer than fifteen employees to comply with one or more of these requirements. Thus , if experience shows a need for imposing notice or other requirements on particular recipients or classes of small recipients, the Department is prepared to expand the coverage of these sections. 14. Inconsistent State laws. Section 84.1 O(a) states that compliance with the regulation is not excused by state or local laws limiting the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receiv e services or to practice an occupation.The provision thus applies only with respect to state or local laws that unjustifiably differentiate on the basis of handicap. Paragraph (b) further points out that the presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular profession does not excuse a recipient from complying with HHS Agency Regulations the regulation. Thus, a law school could not deny admission to a blind applicant because blind lawyers may find it more difficult to find jobs that do nonhandicapped lawyers . Subpart B - Employment Practices Subpart B prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in the employment practices of recipients of Federal financial assistance administered by the Department. This subpart is consistent with the employment provisions of the Department 's regulation implementing title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ( 45 CFR Part 86) and the regulation of the Department of Labor under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires certain Federal contractors to take affirmative action in the employment and advancement of qualified handicapped persons. All recipients subject to title IX are also subject to this regulation. In addition, many recipients subject to this regulation receive Federal procurement contracts in excess of $2,500 and are therefore also subject to section 503. 15. Discriminatory practices. Section 84.11 sets forth general provisions with respect to discrimination in employment. A new paragraph (a)(2) has been added to clarify the employment obligations of recipients that receive Federal funds under Part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended (EHA). Section 606 of the EHA obligates elementary or secondary school systems that receive EHA funds to take positive steps to employ and advance in employment qualified handicapped persons.This obligation is similar to the nondiscrimination requirement of section 504 but requires recipients to take additional steps to hire and promote handicapped persons. In enacting section 606 Congress chose the words \"positive steps\" instead of \"affirmative action\" advisedly and did not intend section 606 to incorporate the types of activities required under Executive Order 11246 (affirmative action on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin) or under sections 50 I and 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Paragraph (b) of \u00a784.11 sets forth the specific aspects of employment covered by the regulation. Paragraph (c) provides that inconsistent provisions of collective bargaining agreements do not excuse noncompliance. 16. Reasonable accommodation. The reasonable accommodation requirement of \u00a784.12 genera ted a substantial number of comments. The Department remains convinced that its approach is both fair and effective. Moreover, the Department of Labor reports that it has experienced little difficulty in administering the requirements of reasonable accommodation. The provision therefore remains basically unchanged from the proposed regulation . Section 84.12 requires a recipient to make reasonable accommodation to the known \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. February 1991 C:15 physical or mental limitations of a handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. Where a handicapped person is not qualified to perfonn a particular job, where reasonable accommodation does not overcome the effects of a person 's handicap, or where reasonable accommodation causes undue hardship to the employer, failure to hire or promote the handicapped person will not be considered discrimination. Section 84. I 2(b) lists some of the actions that constitute reasonable accommodation. The list is neither all-inclusive nor meant to suggest that employers must follow all of the actions listed. Reasonable accommodation includes modification of work schedules, including part-time employment , and job restructuring. Job restructuring may entail shifting nonessential duties to other employees. In other cases, reasonable accommodation may include physical modifications or relocation of particular offices or jobs so that they are in facilities or parts of facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. If such accommodations would cause undue hardship to the emp loyer, they need not be made. Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the factors that the Office for Civil Rights will consider in determining whether an accommodation necessary to enable an applicant or employee to perform the duties of a job would impose an undue hardship.The weight given to each of these factors in making the determination as to whether an accommodation constitutes undue hardship will vary depending on the facts of a particular situation. Thus, a small day-care center might not be required to expend more than a nominal sum, such as that necessary to equip a telephone for use by a secretary with impaired hearing, but a large school district might be required to make available a teacher 's aide to a blind applicant for a teaching job. Further, it might be considered reasonable to require a state welfare agency to accommodate a deaf employee by providing an interpreter, while it would constitute an undue hardship to impose that requirement on a provider of foster home care services. The reasonable accommodation standard in \u00a784.12 is simila r to the obligation imposed upon Federal contractors in the regulation implementing section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 , administered by the Department of Labor. Although the wording of the reasonable accommodation provisions of the two regulations is not identical, the obligation that the two regulations impose is the same, and the Federal Government's policy in implementing the two sections will be uniform. The Department adopted the factors listed in paragraph (c) instead of the \"bus iness necessity\" standard of the Labor regulation because that term seemed Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 135 of 290Appendix Ill inappropriate to the nature of the programs operated by the majority of institutions subject to this regulation, e.g., public school systems, hospitals, colleges and universities, nursing homes, day-care centers, and welfare offices. The factors listed in paragraph ( c) are intended to make the rationale underlying the business necessity standard applicable to and understandable by recipients of HHS funds. 17. Tests and selection criteria. Revised \u00a784. l 3(a) prohibits employers from using test or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out handicapped persons unless the test or criterion is shown to be job-related and alternative tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Director to be available. This paragraph is an application of the principle established under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, 401U .S.424 (1971). Under the proposed section, a statistical showing of adverse impact on handicapped persons was required to trigger an employer's obligation to show that employment criteria and qualifications relating to handicap were necessary. This requirement was changed because the small number of handicapped persons taking tests would make statistical showings of \"disproportionate, adverse effect\" difficult and burdensome. Under the altered, more workable provision, once it is shown that an employment test substantially limits the opportunities of handicapped persons, the employer must show the test to be job- related. A recipient is no longer limited to using predictive validity studies as the method for demonstrating that a test or other selection criterion is in fact job-related. Nor, in all cases, are predictive validity studies sufficient to demonstrate that a test or criterion is job-related. In addition, \u00a784. l 3(a) has been revised to place the burden on the Director, rather than the recipient, to identify alternate tests. Section 84.13(b) requires that a recipient take into account that some tests and criteria depend upon sensory, manual, or speaking skills that may not themselves be necessary to the job in question but that may make the handicapped person unable to pass the test. The recipient must select and administer tests so as best to ensure that the test will measure the handicapped person 's ability to perform on the job rather than the person's ability to see, hear, speak, or perform manual tasks, except, of course, where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure. For example, a person with a speech impediment may be perfectly qualified for jobs that do not or need not, with reasonable accommodation, require ability to speak clearly.Yet, if given an oral test, the person will be unable to perform in a satisfactory manner. The test results will not, therefore, predict job performance but instead will reflect impaired speech. HHS Agency Regulations 18. Preemployment inquiries. Section 84.14, concerning preemployment inquiries, generated a large number of comments. Commenters representing handicapped persons strongly favored a ban on preemployment inquiries on the ground that such inquiries are often used to discriminate against handicapped persons and are not necessary to serve any legitimate interests of employers. Some recipients , on the other hand, argued that preemployment inquiries are necessary to determine qualifications of the applicant, safety hazards caused by a particular handicapping condition , and accommodations that might required. The Secretary has concluded that a general prohibition of preemployment inquiries is appropriate. However, a sentence has been added to paragraph (a) to make clear that an employer may inquire into an applicant's ability to perform job-related tasks but may not ask if the person has a handicap. For example, an employer may not ask on an employment form if an applicant is visually impaired but may ask if the person has a current driver's license (if that is a necessary qualification for the position in question). Similarly, employers may make inquiries about an applicant's ability to perform a job safely. Thus, an employer may not ask if an applicant is an epileptic but may ask whether the person can perform a particular job without endangering other employees. Section 84. l 4(B) allows preemployment inquiries only if they are made in conjunction with required remedial action to correct past discrimination, with voluntary action to overcome past conditions that have limited the participation of handicapped persons, or with obligations under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In these instances, paragraph (b) specifies certain safeguards that must be followed by the employer. Finally, the revised provision allows an employer to condition offers of employment to handicapped persons on the results of medical examinations , so long as the examinations are administered to all employees in a nondiscriminatory manner and the results are treated on a confidential basis. 19. Specific acts of Discrimination. Sections 84.15 (recruitment), 84.16 (compensation), 84.17 (job classification and structure) and 84.18 (fringe benefits) have been deleted from the regulation as unnecessarily duplicative of \u00a784.11 (discrimination prohibited). The deletion of these sections in no way changes the substantive obligations of employers subject to this regulation from those set forth in the July 16 proposed regulation. These deletions bring the regulation closer in form to the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation. Proposed \u00a784.18 , concerning fringe benefits , had allowed for differences in benefits or contributions between handicapped and nonhandicapped persons in \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:16 situations only where such differences could be justified on an actuarial basis. Section 84.1 I simply bars discrimination in providing fringe benefits and does not address the issue of actuarial differences.The Department believes that currently available data and experience do not demonstrate a basis for promulgating a regulation specifically allowing for differences in benefits or contributions. SUBPART C - PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY In general, Subpart C prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from federally assisted programs or activities because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible or unusable. 20. Existing facilities. Section 84.22 maintains the same standard for nondiscrimination in regard to existing facilities as was included in the proposed regulation.The section states that a recipient 's program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, must be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Paragraphs (a) and (b) make clear that a recipient is not required to make each of its existing facilities accessible to handicapped persons if its program as a whole is accessible. Accessibility to the recipient 's program or activity may be achieved by a number of means, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, and making aides available to beneficiaries. In choosing among methods of compliance, recipients are required to give priority consideration to methods that will be consistent with provision of services in the most appropriate integrated setting. Structural changes in existing facilities are required only where there is no other feasible way to make the recipient's program accessible. Under \u00a784.22, a university does not have to make all of its existing classroom buildings accessible to handicapped students if some of its buildings are already accessible and if it is possible to reschedule or relocate enough classes so as to offer all required courses and a reasonable selection of elective courses in accessible facilities. If sufficient relocation of classes is not possible using existing facilities, enough alterations to ensure program accessibility are required. A university may not exclude a handicapped student from a specifically requested course offering because it is not offered in an accessible location, but it need not make every section of that course accessible. Commenters representing several institutions of higher education have suggested that it would be appropriate for one postsecondary institution in a geographical area to be made accessible to handicapped persons and for other colleges and universities in that area to participate in that school's program , thereby developing an educational consortium for the postsecondary education of handicapped Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 136 of 290( ( Appendix Ill students. The Department believes that such a consortium , when developed and applied only to handicapped persons, would not constitute compliance with \u00a784.22, but would discriminate against qualified handicapped person s by restricting their choice in selecting institutions of higher education and would , therefore , be incon sistent with the basic objectives of the statute. Nothing in this regulation, however, should be read as prohibiting institutions from forming consortia for the benefit of all student s. Thus , if three colleges decide that it would be cost-efficient for one college to offer biology, the second physics, and the third chemistry to all students at the three colleges , the arrangement would not violate section 504. On the other hand , it would violate the regulation if the same institutions set up a consortium under which one college undertook to make its biology lab accessible, another its physics lab, and a third its chemistry lab, and under which mobility- impaired handicapped students (but not other students) were required to attend the particular college that is accessible for the desired courses. Similarly, while a public school district need not make each of its buildings completely accessible, it may not make only one facility or part of a facility accessible if the result is to segregate handicapped students in a single setting. All recipients that provide health, welfare, or other social service s may also comply with \u00a784.22 by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or making home visits. Thus , for example , a pharmacist might arrange to make home deliveries of drugs. Under revised \u00a784.22(c) , small provider s of health , welfare , and social services (those with fewer than fifteen employees) may refer a beneficiary to an acces sible provider of the desired service , but only if no means of meeting the program accessibility requirement other than a significant alteration in existing facilitie s is available. The referring recipient has the respon sibility of determining that the other provider is in fact accessible and willing to provide the service. The Secretary believes that \"last resort \" referral provision is appropriate to avoid impo sition of additional costs in the health care area, to encourage providers to remain in the Medicaid program , and to avoid imposing significant costs on small, low-budget providers such as day-care centers or foster homes. *A recent change in the tax law may assist some recipients in meeting their obligations under this section . Under section 2122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 , recipients that *[Editor 's Note: Congress reduced the accessibilit y tax deducti on to$ I 5,000 in the Omnibu s Budget Reconciliation Act of I 990. That law also cr eated an a nnual tax cre dit of up to $5,000 for small businesses that remove barriers to compl y with the Americans w ith Disabiliti es Act.] HHS Agency Regulations pay federal income tax are eligible to claim a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for architectural and transportation modifications made to improve accessibility for handicapped persons . Many physicians and dentists , among others , may be eligible for this tax deduction. See 42 FR 17870 (April 4, 1977), adopting 26 CFR 7.190. Several commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of compliance with the program accessibility standard. The Secretary believes that the standard is flexible enough to permit recipients to devise ways to make their programs accessible short of extremely expensive or impractical physical changes in facilities. Accordingly, the section does not allow for waivers. The Department is ready at all times to provide technical assistance to recipients in meeting their program accessibility responsibilities. For this purpose , the Department is establishing a special technical assistance unit. Recipients are encouraged to call upon the unit staff for advice and guidance both on structural modifications and on other ways of meeting the program accessibility requirement. Paragraph (d) has been amended to require recipients to make all nonstructural adjustments necessary for meeting the program accessibility standard within sixty days. Only where structural changes in facilities are necessary will a recipient be permitted up to three years to accomplish program accessibility.It should be emphasized that the three-year time period is not a waiting period and that all changes must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible . Further, it is the Department's belief , after consultation with experts in the field , that outside ramps to buildings can be constructed quickly and at relatively low cost. Therefore , it will be expected that such structural additions will be made promptly to comply with \u00a784.22(d). The regulation continues to provide , as did the proposed version , that a recipient planning to achieve program accessibility by making structural changes must develop a transition plan for such changes within six months of the effective date of the regulation . A number of commenters suggested extending that period to one year. The secretary believes that such an extension is unnece ssary and unwise . Planning for any necessary structural changes should be undertaken promptly to ensure that they can be completed within the three-year period. The elements of the transition plan as required by the regulation remain virtually unchanged from the proposal but \u00a784.22(d) now includes a requirement that the recipient make the plan available for public inspection. Several commenters expressed concern that the program accessibility standard would result in the segregation of handicapped \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. February 1991 C:17 persons in educational institutions. The regulation will not be applied to permit such a result. See \u00a784.4(c)(2)(iv) , prohibiting unnecessarily separate treatment; \u00a784.35 , requiring that students in elementary and secondary schools be educated in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and new \u00a784.43(d), applying the same standard to postsecondary education. We have received some comments from organizations of handicapped persons on the subject of requiring , over an extended period of time , a barrier-free environment -that is, requiring the removal of all architectural barriers in existing facilities. The Department has considered these comments but has decided to take no further action at this time concerning these suggestions, believing that such action should only be considered in light of experience in implementing the program accessibility standard. 21. New construction. Section 84.23 requires that all new facilities, as well as alterations that could affect access to and use of existing facilities, be designed and constructed in a manner so as to make the facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons . Section 84.23(a) has been amended so that it applies to each newly constructed facility if the construction was commenced after the effective date of the regulation. The words \"if construction has commenced\" will be considered to mean \"if groundbreaking has taken place .\" Thus, a recipient will not be required to alter the design of a facility that has progressed beyond groundbreaking prior to the effective date of the regulation. Paragraph (b) requires certain alterations to conform to the requirement of physical accessibility in paragraph (a). If an alteration is undertaken to a portion of a building the accessibility of which could be improved by the manner in which the alteration is carried out, the alteration must be made in that manner. Thus , if a doorway or wall is being altered, the door or other wall opening must be made wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs. On the other hand , if the alteration consists of altering ceilings, the provisions of this section are not applicable because this alteration cannot be done in a way that affects the accessibility of that portion of the building . The phrase \"to the maximum extent feasible \" has been added to allow for the occasional case in which the nature of an existing facility is such as to make it impractical or prohibitively expensive to renovate the building in a manner that results in its being entirely barrier-free . In all such cases, however , the alteration should provide the maximum amount of physical accessibility feasible. Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 137 of 290Appendix Ill *As proposed, \u00a784.23(c) required compliance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard on building accessibility as the minimum necessary for compliance with the accessibility requirement of \u00a7\u00a784.23 (a) and (b).The reference to the ANSI standard created some ambiguity, since the standard itself provides for waivers where other methods are equally effective in providing accessibility to the facility. Moreover, the Secretary does not wish to discourage innovation in barrier-free construction by requiring absolute adherence to a rigid design standard. Accordingly, \u00a784.23 (c) has been revised to permit departures from particular requirements of the ANSI standard where the recipient can demonstrate that equivalent access to the facility is provided. Section 84.23(d) of the proposed regulation, providing for a limited deferral of action concerning facilities that are subject to section 502 as well as section 504 of the Act, has been deleted.The Secretary believes that the provision is unnecessary and inappropriate to this regulation.The Department will, however, seek to coordinate enforcement activities under this regulation with those of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. SUBPART D - PRESCHOOL, ELEMENTARY, AND SECONDARY EDUCATION Subpart D sets forth requirements for nondiscrimination in preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult education programs and activities, including secondary vocational education programs. In this context, the term \"adult education\" refers only to those educational programs and activities for adults that are operated by elementary and secondary schools. The provisions of Subpart D apply to state and local educational agencies. Although the subpart applies, in general, to both public and private education programs and activities that are federally assisted, \u00a7\u00a784.32 and 84.33 apply only to public programs and \u00a784.39 applies only to private programs; \u00a7\u00a784.35 and 84.36 apply both to public programs and to those private programs that include special services for handicapped students. Subpart B generally confonns to the standards established for the education of handicapped persons in Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children v. Commonwealth of Penns ylvania , 344 F. Supp. 279 1972), and Lebanks v. Spears, 60 *[Editor's Note: On Dec. 19, 1990, (55 F.R. 52142) HHS adopted a common rule amending \u00a784.23(c) to reference the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) as the standards grantees may use to comp ly with section 504. The regulation s contained in the Handbook reflect this change.] HHS Agency Regulations F.R.D. 135 (E.D. La. 1973), as well as in the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended by Public Law 94-142 (the EHA). The basic requirements common to those cases, to the EHA, and to this regulation are ( 1) that handicapped persons, regardless of the nature or severity of their handicap, be provided a free appropriate public education, (2) that handicapped students be educated with nonhandicapped students to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs, (3) that educational agencies undertake to identify and locate all unserved handicapped children, (4) that evaluation procedures be improved in order to avoid the inappropriate education that results from the misclassification of students, and (5) that procedural safeguard be established to enable parents and guardians to influence decisions regarding the evaluation and placement of their children. These requirements are designed to ensure that no handicapped child is excluded from school on the basis of handicap and, if a recipient demonstrates that placement in a regular educational setting cannot be achieved satisfactorily, that the student is provided with adequate alternative services suited to the student's needs without additional cost to the student's parents or guardian. Thus, a recipient that operates a public school system must either educate handicapped children in its regular program or provide such children with an appropriate alternative education at public expense. It is not the intention of the Department, except in extraordinary circumstances, to review the result of individual placement and other educational decisions , so long as the school district complies with the \"process\" requirements of this subpart (concerning identification and location , evaluation, and due process procedures). However, the Department will place a high priority on investigating cases which may involve exclusion of a child from the education system or a pattern or practice of discriminatory placements or education. 22. Location and notification. Section 84.32 requires public schools to take steps annually to identify and locate handicapped children who are not receiving an education and to publicize to handicapped children and their parents the rights and duties established by section 504 and this regulation. This section has been shortened without substantive change. 23. Free appropriate public education. Former \u00a7\u00a784.34 (\"Free education\") and 84.36(a) (\"Suitable education\") have been consolidated and revised in new \u00a784.33. Under \u00a784.34(a), a recipient is responsible for providing a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction . The word \"in\" encompasses the concepts of both domicile and actual residence. If a recipient places a child in a program other than its own, it remain s financially responsible for the child, whether or not the other program is operated by another \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:18 recipient or educational agency. Moreover, a recipient may not place a child in a program that is inappropriate or that otherwise violates the requirements of Subpart D. And in no case may a recipient refuse to provide services to a handicapped child in its jurisdiction because of another person's or entity's failure to assume financial responsibility. Section 84.33(b) concerns the provision of appropriate educational services to handicapped children. To be appropriate, such services must be designed to meet handicapped children's individual educational needs to the same extent that those of nonhandicapped children are met. An appropriate education could consist of education in regular classes, education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services, or special education and related services. Special education may include specially designed instruction in classrooms, at home , or in private or public institutions and may be accompanied by such related services as developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including psychological, counseling, and medical diagnostic services). The placement of the child must however, be consistent with the requirements of \u00a784.34 and be suited to his or her educational needs. The quality of the educational services provided to handicapped students must equal that of the services provided to nonhandicapped students; thus, handicapped student's teachers must be trained in the instruction of persons with the handicap in question and appropriate materials and equipment must be available. The Department is aware that the supply of adequately trained teachers may, at least at the outset of the imposition of this requirement, be insufficient to meet the demand of all recipients. This factor will be considered in determining the appropriateness of the remedy for noncompliance with this section. A new \u00a784.33(b)(2) has been added, which allows this requirement to be met through the full implementation of an individualized education program developed in accordance with the standards of the EHA. Paragraph (c) of \u00a784.33 sets forth the specific financial obligations of a recipient. If a recipient does not itself provide handicapped persons with the requisite services, it must assume the cost of any alternate placement. If, however, a recipient offers adequate services and if alternate placement is chosen by a student's parent or guardian, the recipient need not assume the cost of the outside services. (If the parent or guardian believes that his or her child cannot be suitably educated in the recipient's program, he or she may make use of the procedures established in \u00a784.36.) Under this paragraph, a recipient's obligation extends beyond the provision of tuition payments in the case of placement outside the regular program. Adequate transportation must also Handicapped Requirements Handbook ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 138 of 290( f \\ Appendix Ill be provided.Recipients must also pay for psychological services and those medical services necessary for diagnostic and evaluative purposes. If the recipient places a student, because of his or her handicap , in a program that necessitates his or her being away from home, the payments must also cover room and board and nonmedical care (including custodial and supervisory care). When residential care is necessitated not by the student's handicap but by factors such as the student's home conditions, the recipient is not required to pay the cost of room and board. Two new sentences have been added to paragraph (c)( 1) to make clear that a recipient's financial obligations need not be met solely through its own funds. Recipients may rely on funds from any public or private source including insurers and similar third parties . The EHA requires a free appropriate education to be provided to handicapped children \"no later than September l, 1978, \" but section 504 contains no authority for delaying enforcement. To resolve this problem, a new paragraph (d) has been added to \u00a784.33. Section 84.33(d) requires recipients to achieve full compliance with the free appropriate public education requirements of \u00a784.33 as expeditiously as possible , but in no event later than September 1, 1978. The provision also makes clear that, as of the effective date of this regulat ion, no recipient may exclude a qualified handicapped child from its educational program. This provision against exclusion is consistent with the order of providing services set forth in section 612(3) of the EHA, which places the highest priority on providing services to handicapped children who are not receiving an education. 24. Educational selling. Section 84.34 prescribes standards for educating handicapped persons with nonhandicapped persons to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person in question. A handicapped student may be removed from the regular educational setting only where the recipient can show that the needs of the student would, on balance, be served by placement in another setting. Although under \u00a784.34, the needs of the handicapped person are determinative as to proper placement, it should be stressed that, where a handicapped student is so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other students is significantly impaired, the needs of the handicapped child cannot be met in that environment. Therefore, regular placement would not be appropriate to his or her needs and would not be required by \u00a784.34. Among the factors to be considered in placing a child is the need to place the child as close to home as possible . A new sentence has been added to paragraph (a) requiring recipients to take this factor into account. As pointed out in several comments, the HHS Agency Regulations parents ' right under \u00a784.36 to challenge the placement of their child extends not only to placement in special classes or separate schools but also to placement in a distant school and, in particular , to residential placement. An equally appropriate educational program may exist closer to home; this issue may be raised by the parent or guardian under \u00a784.34 and 84.36. New paragraph (b) specifies that handicapped children must also be provided nonacademic services in as integrated a setting as possible. This requirement is especially important for children whose educational needs necessitate their being solely with other handicapped children during most of each day. To the maximum extent appropriate, children in residential settings are also to be provided opportunities for participation with other children. Section 84.34(c) (formerly \u00a784.38) requires that any facilities that are identifiable as being for handicapped students be comparable in quality to other facilities of the recipient. A number of comments objected to this section on the basis that it encourages the creation and maintenance of such facilities. This is not the intent of the provision. A separate facility violates section 504 unless it is indeed necessary to the provision of an appropriate education to certain handicapped students. In those instances in which such facilities are necessary (as might be the case, for example, for severely retarded persons) , this provision requires that the educational services provided be comparable to those provided in the facilities of the recipient that are not identifiable as being for handicapped persons. 25. Evaluation and placement. Because the failure to provide handicapped persons with an appropriate education is so frequently the result of misclassification or misplacement , section 84.33(b)(l) makes compliance with its provisions contingent upon adherence to certain procedures designed to ensure appropriate classification and placement. These procedures, delineated in \u00a7\u00a784.35 and 84.36, are concerned with testing and other evaluation methods and with procedural due process rights. Section 84.35(a) requires that an individual evaluation be conducted before any action is taken with respect either to the initial placement of a handicapped child in a regular or special education program or to any subsequent significant change in that placement. Thus , a full reevaluation is not required every time an adjustment in placement is made. \"Any action\" includes denials of placement. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of \u00a784.35 establishes procedures designed to ensure that children are not misclassified, unnecessarily labeled as being handicapped , or incorrectly placed because of inappropriate selection, administration, or interpretation of evaluation materials .This problem has been extensively documented in \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. February 1991 C:19 \"Issues in the Classification of Children,\" a report by the Project on Classification of Exceptional Children, in which the HHS Interagency Task Force participated. The provisions of these paragraphs are aimed primarily at abuses in the placement process that result from misuse of, or undue or misplaced reliance on, standardized scholastic aptitude tests. Paragraph (b) has been shortened but not substantive ly changed. The requirement in former subparagraph (I) that recipients provide and administer evaluation materials in the native language of the student has been deleted as unnecessary , since the same requirement already exists under title VI and is more appropriately covered under that statute. Subparagraphs (I) and (2) are, in general, intended to prevent misinterpretation and similar misuse of test scores and, in particular , to avoid undue reliance on general intelligence tests. Subparagraph (3) requires a recipient to administer tests to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in whatever manner is necessary to avoid distortion of the test results by the impairment. Former subparagraph (4) has been deleted as unnecessarily repetitive of the other provisions of this paragraph. Paragraph (c) requires a recipient to draw upon a variety of sources in the evaluation process so that the possibility of error in classification is minimized. In particular, it requires that all significant factors relating to the learning process , including adaptive behavior, be considered. (Adaptive behavior is the effectiveness with which the individual meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of his or her age and cultural group.) lnfonnation from all sources must be documented and considered by a group of persons, and the procedure must ensure that the child is placed in the most integrated setting appropriate. The proposed regulation would have required a complete individual reevaluation of the student each year. The Department has concluded that it is inappropriate in the section 504 regulation to require full reevaluations on such a rigid schedule. Accordingly, \u00a784.35(c) requires periodic reevaluations and specifies that reevaluations in accordance with the EHA will constitute compliance. The propo sed regulation implementing the EHA allows reevaluation at three year intervals except under certain specified circumstances. Under \u00a784.36, a recipient must establish a system of due process procedures to be afforded to parents or guardians before the recipient takes any action regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a person who, because of handicap , needs or is believed to need special education or related services.This section has been revised. Because the due process procedures of the EHA, incorporated by reference in the proposed section 504 Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 139 of 290Appendix Ill regulation , are inappropriate for some recipients not subject to that Act, the section now specifies minimum necessary procedures : notice , a right to inspect records , an impartial hearing with a right to representation by counsel , and a review procedure . The EHA procedures remain one means of meeting the regulation 's due process requirements, however , and are recommended to recipients as a model. 26. Nonacademic services. Section 84.37 requires a recipient to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation. Because these services and activities are part of a recipient 's education program, they must , in accordance with the provisions of \u00a784.34, be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate . Revised paragraph (c)(2) does permit separation or differentiation with respect to the provision of physical education and athletics activities , but only if qualified handicapped students are also allowed the opportunity to compete for regular teams or participate in regular activities. Most handicapped students are able to participate in one or more regular physical education and athletics activities.For example , a student in a wheelchair can participate in regular archery course, as can a deaf student in a wrestling course. Finally , the one-year transition period provided in former \u00a784.37(a)(3) was deleted in response to the almost unanimous objection of commenters to that provision . 27. Pres chool and adult education. Section 84.38 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in preschool and adult education programs. Former paragraph (b), which emphasized that compensatory programs for disadvantaged children are subject to section 504, has been deleted as unnecessary, since it is comprehended by paragraph (a). 28. Privat e education . Section 84.39 sets forth the requirements applicable to recipients that operate private education programs and activities . The obligations of these recipient s have been changed in two significant respects: first, private schools are subject to the evaluation and due process provisions of the subpart only if they operate special education program s; second, under \u00a784.39(b) , they may charge more for providing service s to handicapped students than to nonhandicapped students to the extent that additional charge s can be justified by increased costs. Paragraph (a) of \u00a784.39 is intended to make clear that recipients that operate private education programs and activities are not required to provide an appropriate education to handicapped students with special educational needs if the recipient does not offer pro grams designed to meet those needs. Thus , a private school that has no program for mentally retarded person s is neither requir ed to admit such a person into HHS Agency Regulations its program nor to arrange or pay for the provision of the person's education in another program. A private recipient without a special program for blind students , however, would not be permitted to exclude, on the basis of blindness , a blind applicant who is able to participate in the regular program with minor adjustments in the manner in which the program is normally offered. Subpart E - Postsecondary Education Subpart E prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in recruitment, admission , and treatment of students in postsecondary education programs and activities , including vocational education. 29. Admission and recruitment. In addition to a general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of handicap in \u00a784.42(a) , the regulation delineates , in \u00a784.42(b) , specific prohibitions concerning the establishment of limitations on admission of handicapped students , the use of tests or selection criteria, and preadmission inquiry. Several changes have been made in this provision. Section 84.42(b) provides that postsecondary educational institutions may not use any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons unless it has been validated as a predictor of academic success and alternate tests or criteria with a less disproportionate, adverse effect are shown by the Department to be available. There are two significant changes in this approach from the July 16 proposed regulation. First, many commenters expressed concern that \u00a784.42(b )(2)(ii) could be interpreted to require a \"global search \" for alternate tests that do not have a disproportionate , adverse impact on handicapped persons. This was not the intent of the provision and, therefore , it has been amended to place the burden on the Director of the Office for Civil Rights, rather than on the recipient , to identify alternate tests. Second, a new paragraph (d), concerning validity studies, has been added. Under the proposed regulation, overall success in an education program , not just first-year grades, was the criterion against which admissions tests were to be validated . This approach has been changed to reflect the comment of professional testing services that use of first year grades would be less disruptive of present practice and that periodic validity studies against overall success in the education program would be sufficient check on the reliability of first-year grades. Section 84.42(b )(3) also requires a recipient to assure itself that admissions tests are selected and administered to applicants with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in such manner as is necessary to avoid unfair distortion of test results . Methods have been developed for testing the aptitude and achievement of persons who are not able to take written tests or even to make the \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. February 1991 C:20 marks required for mechanically scored objective tests ; in addition, methods for testing persons with visual or hearing impairments are available. A recipient , under this paragraph, must assure itself that such methods are used with respect to the selection and administration of any admissions tests that it uses. Section 84.42(b)(3)(iii) has been amended to require that admissions tests be administered in facilities that, on the whole , are accessible. In this context, \"on the whole \" means that not all of the facilities need be accessible so long as a sufficient number of facilities are available to handicapped persons . Revised \u00a784.42(b )(4) generally prohibits preadmission inquiries as to whether an applicant has a handicap. The considerations that led to this revision are similar to those underlying the comparable revision of \u00a784.14 on preemployment inquiries . The regulation does, however , allow inquiries to be made, after admission but before enrollment, as to handicaps that may require accommodation. New paragraph (c) parallels the section on preemployment inquiries and allows postsecondary institutions to inquire about applicants' handicaps before admission, subject to certain safeguards, if the purpose of the inquiry is to take remedial action to correct past discrimination or to take voluntary action to overcome the limited participation of handicapped persons in postsecondary educational institutions . Proposed \u00a784.42(c) , which would have allowed different admissions criteria in certain cases for handicapped persons , was widely misinterpreted in comments from both handicapped persons and recipients. We have concluded that the section is unnecessary, and it has been deleted. 30. Treatment of students . Section 84.43 contain s general provisions prohibiting the discriminatory treatment of qualified handicapped applicants. Paragraph (b) requires recipients to ensure that equal opportunities are provided to its handicapped students in education programs and activities that are not operated by the recipient. The recipient must be satisfied that the outside education program or activity as a whole is nondiscriminatory.For example , a college must ensure that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur in connection with teaching assignments of student teachers in elementary or secondary schools not operated by the college . Under the \"as a whole\" wording , the college could continue to use elementary or secondary school systems that discriminate if, and only if, the college 's student teaching program , when viewed in its entirety , offered handicapped student teacher s the same range and quality of choice in student teaching assignments afforded nonhandicapped students. Paragraph (c) of this section prohibit s a recipient from excludin g qualified handicapped students from any cour se, Handicapped Requirements Handbook ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 140 of 290( ( Appendix Ill course of study, or other part of its education program or activity. This paragraph is designed to eliminate the practice of excluding handicapped persons from specific courses and from areas of concentration because of factors such as ambulatory difficulties of the student or assumptions by the recipient that no job would be available in the area in question for a person with that handicap. New paragraph (d) requires postsecondary institutions to operate their programs and activities so that handicapped students are provided services in the most integrated setting appropriate. Thus , if a college had several elementary physics classes and had moved one such class to the first floor of the science building to accommodate students in wheelchairs, it would be a violation of this paragraph for the college to concentrate handicapped students with no mobility impairments in the same class. 31. Academic adjustments. Paragraph (a) of \u00a784.44 requires that a recipient make certain adjustments to academic requirements and practices that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap. This requirement, like its predecessor in the proposed regulation, does not obligate an institution to waive course or other academic requirements. But such institutions must accommodate those requirements to the needs of individual handicapped students. For example, an institution might permit an otherwise qualified handicapped student who is deaf to substitute an art appreciation or music history course for a required course in music appreciation or could modify the manner in which the music appreciation course is conducted for the deaf student. It should be stressed that academic requirements that can be demonstrated by the recipient to be essential to its program of instruction or to particular degrees need not be changed. Paragraph (b) provides that postsecondary institutions may not impose rules that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the education program. Such rules include prohibition of tape recorders or braillers in classrooms and dog guides in campus buildings. Several recipients expressed concern about allowing students to tape record lectures because the professor may later want to copyright the lectures. This problem may be solved by requiring students to sign agreements that they will not release the tape recording or transcription or otherwise hinder the professor 's ability to obtain a copyright. Paragraph (c) of this section, concerning the administration of course examinations to students with impaired sensory, manual , or speak ing skills, parallels the regulation 's provisions on admissions testing (\u00a784.42(b)) and will be similarly interpreted. Under \u00a784.44(d), a recipient must ensure that no handicapped student is subject to HHS Agency Regulations discrimination in the recipient 's program because of the absence of necessary auxiliary educational aids. Colleges and universities expressed concern about the costs of compliance with this provision. The Department emphasizes that recipients can usually meet this obligation by assisting students in using existing resources for auxiliary aids such as state vocational rehabilitation agencies and private charitable organizations. Indeed, the Department anticipates that the bulk of auxiliary aids will be paid for by state and private agencies, not by colleges or universities. In those circumstances where the recipient institution must provide the educational auxiliary aid, the institution has flexibility in choosing the methods by which the aids will be supplied. For example, some universities have used students to work with the institution's handicapped students. Other institutions have used existing private agencies that tape texts for handicapped students free of charge in order to reduce the number of readers needed for visually impaired students. As long as no handicapped person is excluded from a program because of the lack of an appropriate aid, the recipient need not have all such aids on hand at all times. Thus, readers need not be available in the recipient's library at all times so long as the schedule of times when a reader is available is established, is adhered to, and is sufficient. Of course, recipients are not required to maintain a complete braille library. 32. Housing. Section 84.45(a) requires postsecondary institutions to provide housing to handicapped students at the same cost as they provide it to other students and in a convenient, accessible, and comparable manner. Commenters, particularly blind persons, pointed out that some handicapped persons can live in any college housing and need not wait to the end of the transition period in Subpart C to be offered the same variety and scope of housing accommodations given to nonhandicapped persons. The Department concurs with this position and will interpret this section accordingly. A number of colleges and universities reacted negatively to paragraph (b) of this section. It provides that, if a recipient assists in making off-campus housing available to its students, it should develop and implement procedures to assure itself that off-campus housing, as a whole, is available to handicapped students. Since postsecondary institutions are presently required to assure themselves that off-campus housing is provided in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of sex (\u00a786.32 of the title IX regulation), they may use the procedures developed under title IX in order to comply with \u00a784.45(b). It should be emphasized that not every off-campus living accommodation need be made accessible to handicapped persons. \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:21 33. Health and insurance. Section 84.46 of the proposed regulation, providing that recipients may not discriminate on the basis of handicap in the provision of health related services, has been deleted as duplicative of the general provisions of section 84.43. This deletion represents no change in the obligation of recipients to provide nondiscriminatory health and insurance plans. The Department will continue to require that nondiscriminatory health services be provided to handicapped students. Recipients are not required, however, to provide specialized service and aids to handicapped persons in health programs. If, for example, a college infirmary treats only simple disorders such as cuts, bruises, and colds, its obligation to handicapped persons is to treat such disorders for them. 34. Financial assistance. Section 84.46(a) (formerly \u00a784.47), prohibiting discrimination in providing financial assistance, remains substantively the same. It provides that recipients may not provide less assistance to or limit the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons for such assistance, whether the assistance is provided directly by the recipient or by another entity through the recipient's sponsorship. Awards that are made under wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments in a discriminatory manner are permissible , but only if the overall effect of the recipient 's provision of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap. It will not be considered discriminatory to deny, on the basis of handicap, an athletic scholarship to a handicapped person if the handicap renders the person unable to qualify for the award . For example, a student who has a neurological disorder might be denied a varsity football scholarship on the basis of his inability to play football, but a deaf person could not, on the basis of handicap, be denied a scholarship for the school's diving team.The deaf person could, however, be denied a scholarship on the basis of comparative diving ability. Commenters on \u00a784.46(b), which applies to assistance in obtaining outside employment for students, expressed similar concerns to those raised under \u00a784.43(b), concerning cooperative programs.This paragraph has been changed in the same manner as \u00a784.43(b) to include the \"as a whole\" concept and will be interpreted in the same manner as \u00a784.43(b). 35. Nonacademic services. Section 84.47 (formerly \u00a784.48) establishes nondiscrimination standards for physical education and athletics counseling and placement services, and social organizations. This section sets the same standards as does \u00a784.38 of Subpart D, discussed above, and will be interpreted in a similar fashion. Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 141 of 290Appendix 111 Subpart F - Health, Welfare, and Social Services Subpart F applies to recipients that operate health, welfare, and social service programs. The Department received fewer comments on this subpart than on others. Although many commented that Subpart F lacked specificity, these commenters provided neither concrete suggestions nor additions. Nevertheless, some changes have been made, pursuant to comment, to clarify the obligations of recipients in specific areas. In addition, in an effort to reduce duplication in the regulation, the section governing recipients providing health services (proposed \u00a784.52) has been consolidated with the section regulating providers of welfare and social services (proposed \u00a784.53). Since the separate provisions that appeared in the proposed regulation were almost identical, no substantive change should be inferred from their consolidation. Several commenters asked whether Subpart F applies to vocational rehabilitation agencies whose purpose is to assist in the rehabilitation of handicapped persons. To the extent that such agencies receive financial assistance from the Department, they are covered by Subpart F and all other relevant subparts of the regulation. Nothing in this regulation, however, precludes such agencies from servicing only handicapped persons. Indeed, \u00a784.4(c) permits recipients to offer services or benefits that are limited by federal law to handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons. Many comments suggested requiring state health, welfare, and social service agencies to take an active role in the enforcement of section 504 with regard to local health and social service providers. The Department believes that the possibility for federal-state cooperation in the administration and enforcement of section 504 warrants further consideration.Moreover, the Department will rely largely on state Medicaid agencies, as it has under title VI, for monitoring compliance by individual Medicaid providers. A number of comments also discussed whether section 504 should be read to require payment of compensation to institutionalized handicapped patients who perform services for the institution in which they reside. The Department of Labor has recently issued a proposed regulation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that covers the question of compensation for institutionalized persons. 42 FR 15224 (March 18, 1977).This Department will seek information and comment from the Department of Labor concerning that agency's experience administering the FLSA regulation. 36. Health , welfare , and other social service providers. As already noted, \u00a784.53 has been combined with proposed \u00a784.53 into a single section covering health, welfare, and other social services. Section 84.52(a) has been expanded in several respects. The HHS Agency Regulations addition of new paragraph (a)(2) is intended to make clear the basic requirement of equal opportunity to receive benefits or services in the health, welfare, and social service areas. The paragraph parallels \u00a7\u00a784.4(b)(ii) and 84.43(b). New paragraph (a)(3) requires the provision of effective benefits or services, as defined in \u00a784.4(b)(2) (i.e., benefits or services which \"afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result (or) to gain the same benefit* * *\"). Section 84.52(a) also includes provisions concerning the limitation of benefits or services to handicapped persons and the subjection of handicapped persons to different eligibility standards. (These provisions were previously included in the welfare recipient section (\u00a784.53(a)).) One common misconception about the regulation is that it would require specialized hospitals and other health care providers to treat all handicapped persons. The regulation makes no such requirement. Thus, a burn treatment center need not provide other types of medical treatment to handicapped persons unless it provides such medical services to nonhandicapped persons. It could not, however, refuse to treat the burns of a deaf person because of his or her deafness. Commenters had raised the question of whether the prohibition against different standards of eligibility might preclude recipients from providing special services to handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons. The regulation will not be so interpreted, and the specific section in question has been eliminated. Section 84.4(c) makes clear that special programs for handicapped persons are permitted. A new paragraph (a)(5) concerning the provision of different or separate services or benefits has been added. This provision prohibits such treatment unless necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with benefits and services that are as effective as those provided to others. Section 84.52(a)(2) of the proposed regulation has been omitted as duplicative of revised \u00a784.22 (b) and (c) in Subpart C. As discussed above, these sections permit health care providers to arrange to meet patients in accessible facilities and to make referrals in carefully limited circumstances. Section 84.52(a)(3) of the proposed regulation has been redesignated \u00a784.52(b) and has been amended to cover written material concerning waivers of rights or consent to treatment as well as general notices concerning health benefits or services. The section requires the recipient to ensure that qualified handicapped persons are not denied effective notice because of their handicap. For example, recipients could use several different types of notice in order to reach persons with impaired vision or hearing, such as brailled messages, radio spots, and tactile devices on cards or envelopes to inform blind persons of the need to call the recipient for further information. \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:22 Sections 84.52(a)(4), 84.52(a)(5), and 84.52(b) have been omitted from the regulation as unnecessary. They are clearly comprehended by the more general sections banning discrimination. Section 84.52(c) is a new section requiring recipient hospitals to establish a procedure for effective communication with persons with impaired hearing for the purpose of providing emergency health care. Although it would be appropriate for a hospital to fulfill its responsibilities under this section by having a full-time interpreter for the deaf on staff, there may be other means of accomplishing the desired result of assuring that some means of communication is immediately available for deaf persons needing emergency treatment. Section 84.52(d), also a new provision, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to provide appropriate auxiliary aids for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills. Further, the Director may require a small provider to furnish auxiliary aids where the provision of aids would not adversely affect the ability of the recipient to provide its health benefits or service. Thus, although a small nonprofit neighborhood clinic might not be obligated to have available an interpreter for deaf persons, the Director may require provision of such aids as may be reasonably available to ensure that qualified handicapped persons are not denied appropriate benefits or services because of their handicaps. 37. Treatment of Drug Addicts and Alcoholics. Section 84.53 is a new section that prohibits discrimination in the treatment and admission of drug and alcohol addicts to hospitals and outpatient facilities. This section is included pursuant to section 407, Public Law 92-255, the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (21 U.S.C. 1174), as amended, and section 321, Public Law 91-616, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4581), as amended, and section 321, Public Law 93-282. Section 504 itself also prohibits such discriminatory treatment and, in addition, prohibits similar discriminatory treatment by other types of health providers. Section 84.53 prohibits discrimination against drug abusers by operators of outpatient facilities, despite the fact that section 407 pertains only to hospitals, because of the broader application of section 504. This provision does not mean that all hospitals and outpatient facilities must treat drug addiction and alcoholism. It simply means, for example, that a cancer clinic may not refuse to treat cancer patients simply because they are also alcoholics. 38. Education of institutionali:ed persons. The regulation retains \u00a784.54 of the proposed regulation that requires that an appropriate education be provided to qualified handicapped persons who are confined to residential institutions or day care centers. Handicapped Requirements Handbook ( \\ This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 142 of 290( ( Appendix Ill Subpart G - Procedures In \u00a784.61 , the Secretary has adopted the title VI complaint and enforcement procedures for use in implementing section 504 until such time as they are superseded by the issuance of a consolidated procedural regulation applicable to all of the civil rights statutes and executive orders administered by the Department. APPENDIX 8-ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES *Sections 80.6-80. IO and Part 81 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations are reprinted here without change for the convenience of the reader. APPENDIX C-GUIDELINES RELATING TO HEAL TH CARE FOR HANDICAPPED INFANTS (a) Interpretative guidelines relating to the applicability of this part to health care for handicapped infants. The following are interpretative guidelines of the Department set forth here to assist recipients and the public in understanding the Department's interpretation of section 504 and the regulations contained in this part as applied to matters concerning health care for handicapped infants. These interpretative guidelines are illustrative; they do not independently establish rules of conduct. (1) With respect to programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance, health care providers may not, solely on the basis of present or anticipated physical or mental impairments of an infant, withhold treatment or nourishment from the infant who, in spite of such impairments, will medically benefit from the treatment or nourishment. (2) Futile treatment or treatment that will do no more than temporarily prolong the act of dying of a terminally ill infant is not considered treatment that will medically benefit the infant. (3) In determining whether certain possible treatments will be medically beneficial to an infant, reasonable medical judgments in selecting among alternative courses of treatment will be respected. (4) Section 504 and the provisions of this part are not applicable to parents (who are not recipients of Federal financial assistance). However, each recipient health care provider must in all aspects of its health care programs receiving Federal financial assista nce provide health care and related services in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 504 and this part. Such aspects includes decisions on whether to report, as required by State law or otherwise, to the appropriate child protective services agency a suspected instance of medical neglect of a child, or to take other action to seek review or parental decisions to withhold consent for medically indicated treatment. Whenever parents make a decision to withhold consent for medically beneficial treatment or nourishment, such *See page C:25. HHS Agency Regulations recipient providers may not, solely on the basis of the infant's present or anticipated future mental or physical impairments, fail to follow applicable procedures on reporting such incidents to the child protective services agency or to seek judicial review. (5) The following are examples of applying these interpretative guidelines. These examples are stated in the context of decisions made by recipient health care providers. Were these decisions made by parents, the guideline stated in section (a)(4) would apply. These examples assume no facts or complications other than those stated. Because every case must be examined on its individual facts, these are merely illustrative examples to assist in understanding the framework for applying the nondiscrimination requirements of section 504 and this part. (i) Withholding of medica lly beneficial surgery to correct an intestinal obstruction in an infant with Down's Syndrome when the withholding is based upon the anticipated future mental retardation of the infant and there are no medical contraindications to the surgery that would otherwise justify with holding the surgery would constitute a discriminatory act, violative of section 504. (ii) Withholding of treatment for medically correctab le physical anomalies in children born with spina bifida when such denial is based on anticipated mental impairment paralysis or incontinence of the infant, rather than on reasonable medical judgments that treatment would be futile, too unlikely of success given complications in the particular case, or otherwise not of medical benefit to the infant, would constitute a discriminatory act, violative of section 504. (iii) Withholding of medical treatment for an infant born with anencephaly, who will inevitably die within a short period of time, would not constitute a discriminatory act because the treatment would be futile and do no more than temporarily prolong the act of dying. (iv) Withholding of certain potential treatments from a severely premature and low birth weight infant on the grounds of reasonable medical judgments concerning the improbability of success or risks of potentia l harm to the infant would not violate section 504. (b) Guidelines for HHS investigations relating to health care for handicapped infants. The following are guidelines of the Department in conducting investigations relating to health care for handicapped infants. They are set forth here to assist recipients and the public in understanding applicable investigative procedures. These guidelines do not establish rules of conduct , create or affect legally enforceable rights of any person, or modify existing rights , authorities or responsibilities pursuant to this part. These guidelines reflect the Department's recognition of the special circumstances presented in connection with \u00a9 Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 C:23 complaints of suspected life-threatening noncompliance with this part involving health care for handicapped infants. These guide lines do not apply to other investigations pursuant to this part, or other civil rights statutes and rules. Deviations from these guidelines may occur when, in the judgment of the responsible Department official , other action is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped infant. (I) Unless impracticable, whenever the Department receives a complaint of suspected life-threatening noncompliance with this part in connection with health care for a handicapped infant in a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, HHS will immediately conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter by initiating telephone contact with the recipient hospital to obtain information relating to the condition and treatment of the infant who is the subject of the comp laint. The preliminary inquiry, which may include additional contact with the complainant and a requirement that pertinent records be provided to the Department, will genera lly be completed within 24 hours (or sooner if indicated) after receipt of the comp laint. (2) Unless impracticable, whenever a recipient hospital has an Infant Care Review Committee, estab lished and operated substantially in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 84.55(f), the Department will, as part of its preliminary inquiry, solicit the information availab le to, and the analysis and recommendations of, the ICRC. Unless, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, other action is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped infant , prior to initiating an on- site investigation , the Department will await receipt of this information from the ICRS for 24 hours (or less if indicated) after receipt of the complaint. The Department may require a subsequent written report of the ICRC's findings, accompanied by pertinent records and documentation. (3) On the basis of the information obtained during preliminary inquiry, including information provided by the hospital (including the hospital's ICRC, if any) , information provided by the complainant , and all other information obtained, the Department will determine whether there is a need for an on-site investigation of the complaint. Whenever the Department determines that doubt remains that the recipient hospital or some other recipient is in compliance with this part or additional documentation is desired to substantiate a conclusion, the Department will initiate an on-site investigation or take some other appropriate action. Unless impracticable, prior to initiating an on-site investigation, the Department's medical consultant (referred to in paragraph 6) will contact the hospital 's ICRC or appropriate medical personnel of the recipient hospital. (4) In conducting on-site investigations , when a recipient hospital has an TCRC Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 143 of 290Appendix Ill established and operated substantially in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 84.55(f), the investigation will begin with, or include at the earliest practicable time, a meeting with the ICRC or its designees. In all on-site investigations, the Department will make every effort to minimize any potential inconvenience or disruption, accommodate the schedules of health care professionals and avoid making medical records unavailable . The Department will also seek to coordinate its investigation with any related investigations by the state child protective services agency so as to minimize potential disruption. (5) It is the policy of the Department to make no comment to the public or media regarding the substance of a pending preliminary inquiry or investigation. (6) The Department will obtain the assistance of a qualified medical consultant to evaluate the medical information (including medical records) obtained in the course of a preliminary inquiry or investigation. The name, title and telephone number of the Department ' s medical consultant will be made available to the recipient hospital. The Department's medical consultant will, if appropriate, contact medical personnel of the recipient hospital in connection with the preliminary inquiry, investigation or medical consultant's evaluation. To the extent practicable, the medical consultant will be a spec ialist with respect to the condition of the infant who is the subject of the preliminary inquiry or investigation. The medical consultant may be an employee of the Department or another person who has agreed to serve, with or without compensation, in that capacity. (7) The Department will advise the recipient hospital of its conclusions as soon as possible following the completion of a preliminary inquiry or investigation. Whenever final administrative findings following an investigation of a compliant of suspected life-threatening noncompliance cannot be made promptly, the Department will seek to notify the recipient and the complainant of the Department's decision on whether the matter will be immediately referred to the Department of Justice pursuant to 45 CFR 80.8. (8) Except as necessary to determine or effect compliance, the Department will (i) in conducting preliminary inquiries and investigations, permit information provided by the recipient hospital to the Department to be furnished without names or other identifying information relating to the infant and the infant 's family ; and (ii) to the extent permitted by law, safeguard the confidentiality of information obtained.

An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and \u00a780.8(c) of this regulation and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record. (b) Time and place of hearing.

Brief opening statements, which shall be limited to statement of the party's position and what he intends to prove, may be made at hearings. (b) Hearings for the reception of evidence will be held only in cases where issues of fact must be resolved in order to determine whether the respondent has failed to comply with one or more applicable requirements of Part 80 of this title.

An affidavit is not inadmissible as such. Unless the presiding officer fixes other time periods affidavits shall be filed and served on the parties not later than 15 days prior to the hearing; and not less than 7 days prior to hearing a party may file and serve written objection to any affidavit on the ground that he believes it necessary to test the truth of assertions therein at hearing. In such event the assertions objected to will not be received in evidence unless the affiant is made available for cross-examination , or the presiding officer determines that cross- examination is not necessary for the full and true disclosure of facts referred to in such assertions. Notwithstanding any objection, however, affidavits may be considered in the case of any respondent who waives a hearing. \u00a781. 76 Depositions. Upon such terms as may be just, for the convenience of the parties or of the Department , the presiding officer may authorize or direct the testimony of any witness to be taken by deposition . \u00a781.77 Admissions as to facts and documents.

Upon the filing of such exceptions, the reviewing authority shall review the decision and issue its own decision thereon . \u00a781.104 Final decisions. (a) Where the hearing is cond ucted by a hearing examiner who makes an initial decision, if no exceptions thereto are filed within the 20-day period specified in \u00a781.103 , such decision shall become the final decision of the Department , and shall constitute \"final agency action\" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 (formerly section lO(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to the provisions of \u00a781.106. (b) Where the hearing is conducted by a hearing examiner who makes a recommended decision, or upon the filing of exceptions to a hearing examiner's initial decision , the reviewing authority shall review the recommended or initial decision and shall issue its own decision thereon, which shall become the final decisio n of the Department , and shall constitute \"final agency action\" within the meaning of 5 Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 150 of 290( ( Appendix Ill U.S.C. 704 (formerly section lO(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to the provisions of \u00a781.106.

The notice will set forth the order of presentation, the amount of time allotted, and the time and place for argument. The names of persons who will argue should be filed with the Department hearing clerk not later than 7 days before the date set for oral regument. (b) The purpose of oral argument is to emphasize and clarify the written argument in the briefs. Reading at length from the brief or other texts is not favored. Participants should confine their arguments to points of controlling importance and to points upon which exceptions have been filed. Consolidations of appearances at oral argument by parties taking the same side will permit the parties' inter ests to be presented more effectively in the time allotted. (c) Pamphlets, charts, and\u00b7other written material may be presented at oral argument only if such material is limited to facts already in the record and is served on all parties and filed with the Department hearing clerk at least 7 days before the argument. \u00a781.106 Review by the Secretary. Within 20 days after an initial decision becomes a final decision pursuant to \u00a78 I. l04(a) or within 20 days of the mailing of a final decision referred to in \u00a781.104(b ), as the case may be, a party may request the Secretary to review the final decision.

If the responsible Department official denies such request the applicant or recipient shall be given an expeditious hearing if it so requests in writing and specifies why it believes the responsible Department official to have been in error. The request for such a hearing shall be addressed to the responsible Department official and shall be made within 30 days after the applicant or recipient is informed Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 151 of 290Appendix Ill that the responsible Department official has refused to authorize payment or permit resumption of Federal financial assistance.

The court examined the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) inter- pretation of this issue in Ignacio v. United States Postal Ser- vice. The EEOC took the position that the \"position in ques- tion\" is not limited to the position held by the complainant, but includes any position the complainant could have held with reasonable accommodation. The court disagreed with this view, instructing that the inquiry should focus on the spe- cific position the plaintiff was denied as a result of the ad- verse determination, and whether he could perform the posi- tion with reasonable accommodation. Finding there to be a genuine issue of material fact remaining, the court denied both motions for summary judgment. Thus the issue at trial will be whether Dancy's position at the time of his discharge was that of FPO or the \"light duty\" clerical job to which he was assigned. 358 Dexter v. Carlin, 660 F. Supp 1418 (D. Conn. 1986) Rehabilitation Act does not require Postal Service to consider rejected applicants for positions for which he did not apply since this would not constitute accommo- dation to his handicap The plaintiff in this case suffers from achrondroplastic dwarfism, a growth disorder, that results in various physical limitations. He applied for employment as a clerk with the U.S. Postal Service in 1981 but was rejected because the postmaster determined he could not make reasonable accom- modation for the plaintiff's physical limitations. This suit was brought under sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act), alleging that the Postal Service engaged in \"surmountable barrier\" and \"disparate impact\" discrimination. ]The Postal Service moved for partial summary judgment on three issues: ( 1) the Act does not require the Postal Serv- ice to accommodate the plaintiff by considering him for posi- tions for which he did not and could not apply; (2) the Act does not require accommodation that would ignore collective bargaining agreements; and (3) the plaintiff cannot ask the court to abrogate terms of a collective bargaining agreement without joining the union as a party to the suit. The defendant did not submit any factual basis for this motion, however, and the court refused to grant the motion in a \"factual vacuum.\" \"On a basic level,\" wrote the court, \"there is a dispute as to the existence or non-existence of the facts that would link these legal issues to the case.\" As the court pointed out, the defendant asked the court to rule that the Act does not require the Postal Service to ac- commodate Dexler by ignoring obligations imposed by a col- lective bargaining agreement. Yet there was no evidence pre- sented that the Postal Service has any collective bargaining obligations, or, if it does, whether accommodating Dexler would conflict with these obligations, or what union should be joined as a party if there is an affected agreement. In considering the plaintiff's claim that the Postal Service was required to consider him for other positions as a means of reasonable accommodation, the court provided a lengthy analy- sis of a federal employer's obligation to make reasonable ac- commodations. Focusing on the need to consider the demands of the specific \"position in question\" and the applicant's abil- ity to meet those specific demands at virtually every step, however, the court found it is necessary first to know what \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 PAGE 183 physical standards are at issue for each job. Since these will vary from job to job, the court concluded : The requirement that an employer make reasonable ac- commodation to the known handicaps of job applicants does not mandate that an employer consider handi- capped applicants for jobs for which they have not ap- plied , assuming that the employer does not do so for applicants who are not handicapped and that the appli- cant's failure or inability to apply for other position s was not a function of his handicap. At trial Dexler will be limited in his claim to showing that the Postal Service failed to make reasonable accommodations in the position for which he applied. 359 DeVargas v. Mason & Hangar, 40 F.E.P. Cases 1803 (D. N.M. 1986); No. 89-2061 (10th Cir. 1990) Cert. denied 1990 Procurement contract with federal government is not \"federal financial assistance\" under section 504 Plaintiff cannot sue under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 to extent suit is based upon section 504 Appeals court rules Civil Rights Restoration Act is ret- roactive This civil rights action arose from the alleged refusal of Mason & Hangar-Silas Mason Co., Inc. (the defendant) to hire the plaintiff as a security officer at the Los Alamos Na- tional Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. The defendant employs individuals as security guards under a contract with LANL, which is engaged in weapons and atomic energy re- search under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the University of California. The plaintiff, who has only one eye , applied for employ- ment with defendant in 1981 and again in 1983. He com- plained that the defendant's refusal to consider his application violated section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. He also claimed he was discriminated against on the basis of an- cestry, handicap and/or exercise of his First Amendment right of free association, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that these actions violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Fi- nally, he alleged that a DOE regulation, Interim Management Directive No. 6102, is unconstitutional and violated section 504. The court first examined the plaintiff's claim under section 504 and concluded that the defendant is not a \"recipient of federal financial assistance\" for purposes of that statute. DOE's purpose in procuring privately hired security personnel to guard the LANL facility was to realize cost savings, not to provide assistance to a private company. Further, DOE's an- tidiscrimination regulations explicitly do not apply to procure- ment contracts. Consequently the court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on this claim. The court also ruled that the plaintiff could not sue under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 to the extent that the claim is based on section 504 for the reasons outlined above, stating, \"plaintiff cannot circumvent the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act by pleading the same cause of action under 1983. \" The court also ruled that the plaintiff may sue under both 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 1983 (so long as it is based on a statute other than section 504) and directly under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, even though the only difference between the two claims is that the constitutional challenge character- izes the parties as being agents of the United States govern- Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 153 of 290PAGE 184 ment. According to the court, there is no evidence that Con- gress intended \u00a7 1983 to be an exclusive remedy. Section 504 is also inapplicable to DOE regulations govern- ing medical standards for personnel in procurements contracts, according to the court. Since thfflefendant is paid by a procure- ment contract with LANL, not through federal financial assis- tance, DOE's I.M.R. No. 6102 that sets medical standards for security personnel is not affected by section 504. Conse- quently that part of the plaintiff's claim was also dismissed. Finally, the court disposed of several other motions con- cerning sovereign and qualified immunity of the various de- fendants. On appeal- The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's decision that procurement contracts do not constitute federal assistance for purposes of section 504. The District Court had also ruled that section 504 did not apply to LANL because the law was program specific and the lab's particular programs were not discriminatory. This was consistent with the Supreme Court's 1984 ruling in Grove City College v. Bell that certain federal civil rights laws applied only to the programs or activities receiving federal funds. Subsequently, however, Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which requires institution-wide coverage of four federal statutes, including section 504. De Vargas petitioned the appeals court to overturn the District Court's ruling on the grounds that the act retroactively broadened section 504's scope. On this issue, the appeals court again rejected De Vargas' argument. The court said it found, \"a congressional purpose to overturn Grove City College, but no clear expression of intent regarding retroactive application of the act's amendments.\" It acknowledged that a Senate report discussed restoring section 504 to its pre-Grove City application, but said the reference was ambiguous and did not \"amount to the clear intent required to invoke retroactivity.\" At least three courts have held that the act does apply retroac- tively (Leake v. Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Appendix IV:485.) The 10th Circuit noted the Leake decision and the decision in (Ayers v. Allain 898 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir. 1990), but found their analyses to be \"unpersuasive.\" In Leake, the 2nd Circuit acknowledged that the Restoration Act itself does not indicate retroactivity. However, that court cited a statement by the law's sponsor, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., that the \"bill applies to all pending cases.\" It also noted that statute contains the words \"restore\" and \"clarify,\" which, in the Handicapped Children's Protection Act, were meant by Congress to apply retroactively. The 10th Circuit disagreed with the Leake decision for two reasons. First, it objected to the use of terms from one act and applying them to another. \"We reject the notion that congressional intent for the Restoration Act can be discerned by analogy to a different statute enacted by a different Congress,\" the court said. Second, it said floor statements of lawmakers were insufficient to resolve the issue. \"We refuse to rely on such a slender thread to fashion out of whole cloth a cloak of retroactivity for the Restoration Act,\" the court said. In Ayers (which involved race discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act), the 5th Circuit held that \"retroactive application is appropriate when Congress enacts a statute to clarify the Supreme Court's interpretation of previous legislation thereby returning the law to its previous posture.\" But the 10th Circuit disagreed, saying the Ayers court resolved the issue based on \"congressional intent implied from the circumstances motivating Congress to act rather than from the directly relevant statements of Congress in the statute's language or authoritative legislative history.\" Congressional intent, the court said, requires \"articulated and clear\" statements, not \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 Appendix IV inferences drawn from the general purpose of the legislation. The court held that the Ayers court incorrectly drew the lines of power separating judicial and legislative branches. According to the 10th Circuit, Congress makes the law, but the Supreme Court interprets it. It acknowledged that Congress may change a law to clarify its legislative intent, but said any amendment enacted \"cannot undo the Supreme Court's authoritative construc- tion of the original statute.\" In cases (such as the Civil Rights Restoration Act) where one Congress reacts to a Supreme Court interpretation of a law passed by previous lawmakers, the \"restoration\" effort is a newly created law, the court said. And as with any new law, \"Congress must state clearly its intentions with regard to retroactivity,\" it concluded. Seeking guidance in the absence of clear congressional intent, the appellate court cited the Supreme Court's decision in Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital ( 109 S. Ct. 468 ( 1988)). In this case, the Court struck down cost-limit rules issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that had required hospitals to return Medicare payments retroactively. The High Court held: \"[R]etroactivity is not favored in the law. Thus, congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\" Based on this, the 10th Circuit held that the Restoration Act should not be applied retroactively and dismissed De Vargas' claim on this issue. 360 Neihaus v. Kansas Bar Association, 41 F.E.P. Cases 13 (10th Cir. 1986) Kansas Bar Association not a federal grant recipient for purposes of section 504, nor can it be considered a branch of state government to trigger coverage of 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, First and Fourteenth Amendments The appellants in this case were employed as a secretary- receptionist and a bookkeeper by the Kansas Bar Association until they were terminated in November and December 1982. Appellant Neumann suffers a slight handicap in her right hand, while appellant Niehaus is apparently not handicapped.' As a result of their terminations, appellants commenced sepa- rate employment discrimination actions in January 1984 and they were later consolidated for trial. They alleged violations of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1988, as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In 1985 the district court granted summary judgment against the appellants section 504 claim because the Kansas Bar Association is not a federal grant recipient. The court granted summary judgment on the remaining claims also, finding that the terminations were not the result of state ac- tion. The appellants argued on appeal that the district court erred in these rulings and also that an earlier magistrate's de- cision denying their motion to compel discovery was clearly erroneous. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's de- cision in all respects. In upholding the summary judgment on the section 504 claim, the appeals court relied on numerous precedents hold- ing that \"section 504, by its ter~. prohibits discrimination only by a 'program or activity receiving Federal financial as- sistance,' \" quoting from Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone (Appendix IV:95). In this case the court found that the Kansas Bar Association did not receive any direct federal assistance after 1977, and received none at the time appel- lants were terminated. The court also ruled that federal funds received by two semi-related not-for-profit organizations were too remote from the Bar Association to be considered as fed- ' The court noted thatNeihaus may lackstanding to sue under section 504, but it was not necessary to reach this question since it found the district court correctly resolved the issue of federal funding.

City of League City, 920 F.2d 311 (5th Cir. 1991) Constru ction inspector who has Parkinson's disease not othe1wise qualified to pe1form essential functions of the job A city did not violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act when it fired a construction inspector who would lose his balance and thus was unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. Antonio Chiari, an engineer who has Parkinson's disease, was a construction inspector for League City, Texas. Inspectors are responsible for approving construction plans and verifying that the work was properly completed. Nearly half of the job is spent at construction sites visually inspecting contractors' work , which requires considerable walking and climbing. In early 1987 , Chiari began to have trouble walking; he was seen stumbling in the city hall and falling while at a construction site. At the request of his supervisor, Chiari was examined separately by two neurosurgeons, who found he had an unsteady \"shuffling gait and body rigidity .\" They both said his loss of balance rendered him unable to continue his job as a construction inspector and that he would be a danger to himself and others if he continued to work. Chiari 's personal physician also examined him, and saw \"no particular limitation of [Chiari 's] work, as long as he [did] not climb.\" City officials tried unsuccessfully to restructure the job to accommodate Chiari's condition. First , they assigned another inspector to do on-site work while Chiari remained at his desk to review the plans . That arrangement did not work because to do the job properly, an inspector must review plans before visiting the site. They tried to create a new position, but could not due to budgetary constraints, and the city had no open positions for a transfer. After these attempts failed, the city fired Chiari in April 1987. He sued, charging that the dismissal violated section 504 and the Texas Human Rights Act. He said he had never fallen on or injured a co-worker, and that the risk of personal injury was not a factor under section 504. Chiari also argued that the city could have provided him with part-time work as an accommodation. The city said Chiari was not protected by section 504 because he could not perform the essential functions of the job, namely walking and climbing around construction sites safely. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled in favor of the city. That ruling was upheld by the 5th Circuit, which agreed that Chiari was no longer qualified to be a construction inspector. Citing Arline (see Appendix JY:329) and other section 504 cases, the appeals court said a \"handicapped person cannot perform the essential functions of a job if his handicap poses a significant safety risk to those around him. \" To support its judgment, the court cited the neurosurgeons ' diagnose s that Chiari 's balance problem would prevent him from working safely. Chiari 's doctor concluded similarly when he was read the job description during the case. The appeals court disagreed with Chiari that the risk of personal injury was immaterial. It cited section 501 regulations that include \"health and safety of the individual\" in the definition of qualified handicapped person. The existence of a personal safety rule in section 50 l creates a simi lar rule under section 504, the court said. Finally, the court ruled that city officials \"went beyond their statutory duty in an effort to accommodate Chiari 's disease\" and that they were not required to create a new part-time position as an accommodation. \"All the city must do is demonstrate that a part-time schedule would not accommodate Ch iari 's performance on that job that he \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. February 1991 PAGE 257 is currently doing,\" it said. \"Even if Chiari worked fewer hours, he still would not be able to climb buildings or climb into ditches , [which are] 'essential functions ' of a construction inspector 's job.\" For the same reasons cited under section 504, the court found no violations of the Texas discrimination law.

Exemptions and grace periods given to small business owners are not extended to state and local governments in their capacity as operators of a public facility. However, exemptions provided to small employers do apply to state and local governments as employers (see ~~303 and 370). The ADA makes some significant changes regarding federal non-discrimination requirements on state and local governments. The law imposes its non-discrimination mandate on all programs and activities of all governments, whether or not they receive federal funds. State and local governments that receive federal grants are required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to make their programs and facilities accessible to the disabled. During the revenue-sharing era of the 1970s and early 1980s, most local governments were subject to section 504 because they received federal funds under the Revenue Sharing Act. After the act was repealed, many small towns, which did not receive any other federal aid, lost their federal nexus and thus were no longer subject to section 504' s requirements. No immunity against suit States may not claim an 11th Amendment immunity against lawsuits filed under the ADA. The law provides the same remedies for actions brought against private entities in suits filed against states (see ~620). Finally, the ADA does not limit or invalidate any state or local disability rights law that pro- vides greater protection for disabled people. The ADA applies to situations in which the state or local law has less stringent requirements. (See ~700 for a discussion of state disability discrimina- tion laws.)

Although people with communicable diseases, especially debilitating, life-threatening ones such as AIDS or hepatitis, seem clearly disabled, the civil rights of such people must be bal- anced against a need to protect the public safety. Unfortunately, unfounded public fears exacer- bate the problem, leaving the person with a communicable disease in particular need of civil rights protection. The ADA treats people with contagious or communicable diseases that threaten one or more major life functions as disabled, but does not require actions that would pose a threat to the health or safety of others (see ~232) . Substance abuse, on the other hand, raises continual controversies. Although medical experts tend to agree that substance abuse is an illness, the specter of having to hire or keep drug ad- dicts on the payroll has caused many people to shy away from considering substance abuse a \"disability.\" The ADA sets out very specific situations in which substance abusers are to be considered disabled for purposes of the act (see ~ 231). ~241 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Under the ADA, employers are permitted to hold drug and alcohol abusers to the same performance and behavior standards as other employees, even if it is their addiction to the drugs or alcohol that causes their unsatisfactory performance. In fact, Section 104(a) of the ADA specifically excludes current illegal drug users from its definition of qualified individuals with a disability. An individual who is otherwise disabled is not to be excluded from the protections of the ADA just because he or she also uses or is addicted to drugs, as long as such use does not affect his or her work (H. Rpt. 101-485, Part 2, p. 77). For example, a woman with a satisfactory work record who uses a wheelchair requests a reasonable modification of her work environment to make it more accessible. The employer cannot refuse to provide the accommodation because he knows or believes that the employee uses drugs. Just because an employee has a condition that is specifically not protected by the ADA, such as current drug use, doesn't mean the em- ployer can refuse to accommodate a different, protected disability, such as using a wheelchair. Alcoholism is not considered a protected disability under the ADA if it interferes with a person's ability to work or poses a threat to the property or safety of others (\u00a7104(c)(4)) . For example, action taken against an employee who is failing to perform required job responsibilities \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. April 1991 Tab 200 Page 61 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 160 of 290~241 Applicability of the ADA would not be a violation of the ADA, even if the failure of the employee is a result of alcohol addiction. In dealing with drug or alcohol abusers, employers are specifically permitted by Section 104(c) of the ADA to: prohibit the use of alcohol or illegal drugs at the work place by all employees; prohibit employees from being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs at the work place; require employees to follow the requirements of the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988; require employees to meet the job-related requirements established by the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Defense and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with respect to drugs and alcohol; and hold a drug user or alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior to which it holds other individuals, even if any unsatisfactory perfor- mance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism of such individual. Former drug abusers Section 104(b) of the act makes it clear that illegal drug users who have successfully com- pleted rehabilitation treatment are not excluded by section 104(a). Section 104(b) specifically includes the following in the definition of \"individual with a disability\": someone who has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and who is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer using drugs; someone who is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer using drugs; and someone who is not using drugs but is erroneously regarded as engaging in illegal drug use. Drug tests Drug testing is specifically addressed in a number of ways by the ADA. First of all, the ADA neither requires nor prohibits drug testing by employers. Section 104(d)(2) of the act states: \"Nothing in this title shall be construed to encourage, prohibit or authorize the conducting of drug testing for the illegal use of drugs by job applicants or employees or making employment decisions based on such test results.\" Second, a drug test is not to be considered a \"medical examination\" for purposes of Title I of the ADA (\u00a7104(d)(l)). The ADA sets out very narrow circumstances under which employers are permitted to offer or require medical examinations (see ~324 ).

The act applies to all employers, employment agencies, labor organizations and joint labor- management committees (\u00a7 101(2)). The term \"employer\" is defined as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year and any agent of such person\" (\u00a7101(5)(A)). (Between July 26, 1992, and July 26, 1994, there is an exemption for employers with 15-24 employers -see ~301.) The act (\u00a7101(5)(B)) specifically excepts from the definition of employer the following entities: the U.S. government; corporations wholly owned by the U.S. government, Indian tribes, and private membership clubs (other than labor organizations) that are tax-exempt under \u00a7501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. *~303 Effective Dates ADA's mandate for equal employment opportunity is to be phased in over four years.

Two years later, on July 26, 1994, all employers with 15 or more employees will be covered. Employers with fewer than 15 employees are exempt. The ADA applies even if a covered entity has a collective bargaining agreement with provisions that con- flict with ADA. Figure 303-A Effective Dates of Title I Employment Provisions Types of Employer Private and public Private and public Minimum # of Employees 25 15 Effective Date July 26, 1992 July 26, 1994 On Feb. 28, 1991, the Justice Department proposed regulations to implement Title II of the ADA (28 C.F.R. Part 35; 56 Fed. Reg. 8538-8557). In the rule (\u00a735.140), the department indi- cated that public employers, such as state and local governments, would be covered by the small- employer exemption that applies to private employers under title I of the act. Therefore, the employment provisions of the ADA would become effective for public employers with 25 or f \\ more employees on July 26, 1992, and for those with 15 or more employees on July 26, 1994. ( *1[304 Implementation and Enforcement of the Employment Provisions of the ADA The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is the lead federal agency for regulation and enforcement of the employment provisions of the ADA. Congress has required the EEOC to issue final rules to implement the employment provisions of ADA no later than July 26, 1991, one year after the ADA was signed into law. Proposed rules were issued on Feb. 28, 1991, to permit public comment. EEOC is currently responsible for enforcing similar civil rights mandates as they apply to employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, pregnancy and age, and the agency proposed rules that reflect its experience in those areas as well as sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which cover non-discrimi- nation in employment by the federal government and recipients of federal aid. The ADA draws on the experience of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, an earlier federal law that applies only to federal grantees and contractors (see ~ 122). Many of the stan- dards, concepts and definitions related to employment discrimination in the section 504 regula- tions are included in the ADA. The ADA also incorporates by reference the enforcement provi- sions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (see ~ 142), which allow for injunctive relief, reinstatement, restraining from further discriminatory conduct, and back pay. See Tab 600 for more information on the enforcement provisions of the ADA. *Indicates new or revised material.

Title I includes governments in its definition of \"employer\" (\u00a7101(5)(B)). After the ADA was enacted, there was some discussion over whether title II of the act, which prohibits discrimination in services, programs or activities of state and local governments (\u00a7202), applied to employ- ment. Title II applies to all state and local governments, regardless of size. Some officials initially sug- gested that employment would be considered a public service within the meaning of title IL However, on Feb. 28, 1991, the Justice Department proposed regulations covering title II of the act (28 C.F.R. Part 25; Fed. Reg. 8538-8557). The department indicated that state and local governments, in their capacity as employers, would be covered by the definitions, requirements and procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its regulations to implement title I. ~371 Exemptions for Small Employers Title I of the ADA contains an exemption for small employers. Beginning in 1992, when the provisions become effective, employers with fewer than 25 employees are exempt; when the employment provisions become fully effective two years later in 1994, only employer with fewer than 15 employees will be exempt. The Justice Department, when it issued its proposed regulations, said exemptions extended to small private employers would apply to small public employers, as well. ~372 Effective Dates Title I of the ADA provides two effective dates for employers, based on their size. The act becomes effective July 26, 1992, for employers with 25 or more employees. For employers with between 15 and 24 workers, the act takes effect July 26, 1994. Employers with fewer than 15 employees are exempt entirely. According to the Justice Department, the title I effective dates will apply to state and local govern- ments in their capacity as employers. Therefore, the employment provisions of the ADA would become effective for public employers with 25 or more employees on July 26, 1992, and for those with between 15 and 24 employees on July 26, 1994. These smaller entities do not have the same resources as larger govern- ments and are more likely to encounter situations that would be an undue hardship (see ~250). It is important to note, however, that all governments are subject to the provisions of title II (regarding programs, activities and services) as soon as they are effective. *Indicates new or revised material. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

Many state and local governments, as recipients of federal assistance, are also subject to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. As a result of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988, an entire governmental entity (not merely the particular federally funded program) is subject to the non-discrimination mandate. Also, state and local government buildings financed with federal funds must be de- signed, constructed and altered so as to be accessible to, and usable in compliance with, the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended. (See ~ 121 for a discussion of these and other federal disability statutes that may affect state and local governments.)

These are the same factors to consider in determining whether a reasonable accommodation required in title I imposes an undue hardship on the employer (see ~251), although the \"readily achievable\" standard is a significantly lesser or lower standard than the \"undue hardship\" stan- dard. Simply stated, if the covered entity can demonstrate that barrier removal cannot be readily achieved, then it is not required, even though it would not result in an undue burden. *What the \"readily achievable\" standard will mean for any particular public accommodation depends on all the circumstances. For example, a small facility might have to place a ramp over one or two steps, add a grab bar, or install a paper cup dispenser to make a water fountain more accessible, but might not be required to make major modifications such as long ramps or com- pletely remodeled rest rooms, if those changes could not be easily accomplishable without much expense. This requirement is deliberately designed to be flexible, depending on the size of the busi- ness. What is easily accomplishable for a large business might be impossible or tremendously costly for a small one. The ADA explicitly mandates that the size and the nature of the business be taken into account in determining what is readily achievable. Figure 530-A lists examples of barrier removals that are often considered to be readily achievable. *Indicates new or revised material. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

For example, assigning an employee to a job that has as an essential function operating a machine (for which the individual is not qualified) would be dangerous and unreasonable. Likewise, an employer is not required to eliminate an essential job function just because an employee is unable to operate that equipment safely. It would be unreasonable for a recovering alcoholic to insist on attending counseling during the critical part of the work day if similar sessions were available in non-duty hours. The ADA also does not require an employer to make an accommodation simply because the technology exists. Purchasing a mechanical desk to assist an employee who had problems open- ing desk drawers would be unreasonable if other devices such as levers or even string were equally effective. *Similarly, an employer is not required to make its entire existing facility barrier-free to accommodate employees who can be provided an accessible work environment in the part of the facility where they perform their duties. ~335 Structural Accessibility in the Work Place The ADA requires employment activities to take place in an integrated setting (\u00a7102(b)(l)). Employees with disabilities may not be segregated into particular areas. This means that architec- tural barriers might have to be removed or altered to provide structural accessibility to the work place. However, employers are not required to make structural modifications that are unreason- able and would impose an undue hardship (see ~330). In existing structures, structural modifications are necessary only to the extent that they constitute reasonable accommodations that will allow the disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job. This applies to work stations, as well as normal support facilities such as bathrooms, water fountains and lunch rooms. Non-structural accommodations are allowed if they accomplish the same result. This could mean moving a meeting to an accessible part of an office, installing a cup dispenser by a water fountain within reach of someone in a wheelchair, or holding a conference at an accessible hotel or restaurant. If a lunch room is located on the second floor of an existing building, an employer should provide comparable amenities on the ground floor for employees who use wheelchairs (such as coffee pots, microwave ovens, lunch tables, vending machines, etc.). Title III of the ADA, which covers places of public accommodations (including places of employment), requires that new construction and major alterations be free of architectural and communications barriers.

This requirement also applies to the construction of a new station for use in intercity or commuter rail transportation. For purposes of this section, a facility or station is \"new\" if its construction begins (i.e., issuance of notice to proceed) after January 26, 1992, or, in the case of intercity or commuter rail stations, after the effective date of this section. (b)(l) When a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of an existing facility used in providing designated public transportation services in a way that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility, the entity shall make the alterations (or ensure that the alterations are made) in such a manner, to the maximum extent feasible, that the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, upon the completion of such alterations. This\u00b7 paragraph applies to any alteration which begins after January 26, 1992. (2) When a public entity undertakes an alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or acceSB to an area of a facility containing a primary function, the entity shall make the alteration in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the bathrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, upon completion of the alterations; Provided, That alterations to the path of travel, drinking App. Ill Page 223 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 180 of 290Transportation (Proposed) fountains, telephones, and bathrooms are not required to be made readily accessible to and usable bv individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, if the cost and scope of doing so would be disproportionate. (3) The requirements of this paragraph also apply to the alteration of existing intercity or commuter rail stations by the responsible person for, owner of, or person in control of the station. (4) The requirements of this paragraph apply to any alteration made after January 26, 1992, or, in the case of intercity and commuter rail stations, after the effective date of this section. (c) As used in this section, the phrase \"to the maximum extent feasible\" applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. Any altered feature of the facility or portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility to certain individuals with disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to individuals with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or walkers, persons with vision or hearing impairments). ( d) As used in this section, a \"primary function\" is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas of transit facilities that involve primary functions include, but are not necessarily limited to, ticket purchase and collection areas, train or bus platforms, baggage checking and return areas, and employment areas. (e) As used in this section, a \"path of travel\" includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, parking areas, and streets), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. The term also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area. An accessible path of travel may include walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps, clear floor paths through corridors, waiting areas, concourses, and other improved areas, parking access aisles, elevators and lifts, bridges, tunnels, or other passageways Page 224 App. Ill Appendix Ill between platforms, or a combination of these and other elements. (f) The costs of providing an accessible path to an altered area are \"disproportionate\" to the costs of the overall alteration if the cost exceeds (10 or 20 or 30) percent of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area. Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: (1) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area (e.g., widening doorways and installing ramps); (2) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible (e.g, grab bars, enlarged toilet stalls, accessible faucet controls); (3) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones (e.g., relocation of phones to an accessible height, installation of amplification devices or TDDs); (4) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain. (g) (1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make a path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall extension, then such areas shall be made accessible to the maximum extent that does not result in disproportionate costs; (2) In this situation, the public entity shall give priority to accessible elements in the following order: (i) An accessible entrance; (ii) An accessible route to the altered area; (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; (iv) Accessible telephone11; (v) Accessible drinking fountains; (vi) When possible, other accessible elements (e.g., parking, storage, alarms). (h) If a public entity performs a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel rather than as making the alterations as part of a single undertaking, it shall nonetheless be responsible for providing an accessible path of travel. (i) (1) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alteration to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year May 1991 49 C.F.R. \u00a737 period shall be considered in ( determining whether the cost of making that path of travel is disproportionate: (2) For the first three years after January 26, 1992, only alterations undertaken between that date and the date of the alteration at issue shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing accessible features is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alteration. (j) Elevators and other accessibility features of facilities shall be maintained in proper working order and shall be repaired promptly if they are damaged or out of order. When an accessibility feature is out of order, the entity shall take reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities who would otherwise use the feature. \u00a7 37.23 Conatructlon and alteratlon of transportation facllltlea by private entitles.

(a) When more than one person owns or provides service to an intercity or commuter rail station, the parties may designate one or more responsible persons, for purposes of this part, and allocate the proportion of responsibility of each party, by contract or other written agreement among themselves. (b) In the absence of such a contract or other written agreement, the following rules determine who the responsible person(s) are for the station: (1) In the case of a station more than fifty percent of which is owned by a public entity, the public entity is the responsible party. (2) In the case of a station more than fifty percent of which is owned by a private party, the persons providing commuter or intercity rail service to the station are the responsible parties, in a App. Ill Page 225 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 182 of 290Transportation (Proposed) proportion equal to the percentage of all passenger boardings at the station attributable to the service of each during the immediately past calendar year. (3) In the case of a station where no party owns more than fifty percent, the owners of the station (other than private party owners) and persons providing intercity or commuter rail service to the station are the responsible persons. Each non-private party owner of the station which does not provide intercity or commuter rail service to the station is a responsible person in the ratio of its ownership interest in the station to the portion of station ownership which is not in the hands of private parties. If there is only one person providing commuter or intercity rail service to the station, that person is the responsible person for the remaining percentage of the station. If more than one person provides commuter or intercity or intercity rail service to the station, these persons divide the remaining percentage of the station in a proportion equal to the percentage of all passenger boardings at the station attributable to the service of each during the immediately past calendar year.

A private entity not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people which operates a demand responsiv_e system shall ensure that its system, when viewed in its entirety, provides equivalent service to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, as it does to individuals without disabilities. For purposes of this paragraph, a demand responsive system, when viewed in its entirety, shall be deemed to provide equivalent service if the service available to individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair users, is provided in the most intergrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual and is equivalent to the service provided other individuals with respect to the following service characteristics: (a) Response time; (b) Fares; (c) Geographic area of service; (d) Hours and days of service; ( e) Restrictions based on trip purpose; (f) Availability of information and reservations capability; and (g) Any constraints on capacity or service availability. \u00a7 37.133 Provlalon of urvlce. (a) This sections sets forth requirements for the provision of service by public and private entities operating fixed route or demand responsive systems. (b) Vehicles or other conveyances used for transportation of individuals with disabilities, and lifts, securement devices. and other equipment used to accommodate such individuals, shall be maintained in proper operating condition. The lift on each vehicle shall be tested before the vehicle goes into service each day. If the lift does not work properly, the vehicle shall not go into service until repairs or maintenance is performed that cause the lift to work properly; Provided, That a public entity listed in \u00a7 37.113(c)(2) (i) or (ii) may continue to use the vehicle on an inaccessible route if keeping the vehicle out of service for repairs would reduce service to the general public. Such use of a vehicle with a nonworking lift may not Page 234 App. Ill Appendix Ill continue for more than five working days. (c) All wheelchairs and other mobility devices, including three-wheeled mobility devices, which, with their users, can be accommodated within the size and weight limits set forth in the standards of appendix A to this part, shall be transported on the entity's vehicles or other conveyances. The entity is not required to permit wheelchairs or mobility devices to ride in places other than designated securement locations in the vehicle. (d) The entity may require that a mobility device be secured, to the extent practicable, given the characteristics of the device and the vehicle's securement system. The entity may not deny transportation to the device or its user on the ground that the device cannot be secured by the securement system. If the entity is unable to secure the device in accordance with the provisions of appendix A. it shall provide a means of ensuring that the mobility device remains within\u00b7 the securement area. ( e) Except as provided in this paragraph, the entity may not require that an individual transfer from his or her mobility device to a vehicle seat. The entity may require such a transfer only in a vehicle with a capacity of 16 seats or less, including the driver, and only under the following conditions: (1) All persons riding in the vehicle are required to be secured; (2) The individual can be secured adequately in the vehicle seat; and (3) The entity determines; after consulting with the individual, that the risk of injury to the individual is greater from remaining in his or her own mobility device than the risk of injury to the individual from transferring. (g) Operators of vehicles or other conveyances, or other personnel of the entity, shall assist passengers, where necessary or requested by the passenger, in the use of the lift and securement devices, leaving their seats to provide such assistance as needed. (f) Where . vehicles or other conveyances for more than one route serve the same stop, the entity shall provide a means by which a person with a visual impairment or mental disability can identify the proper vehicle to enter or be identified to the operator as a person seeking to ride on a particular route. (g) Adequate assistance and information concerning transportation services shall be made available to individuals wi~ disabilities, including May 1991 49 C.F.R. \u00a737 those with vision and hearing ( impairments.

In the State Courts ...... .......... Developments ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Congress extends Rehabilitation Act programs for one year Congress has sent to President Bush legisla- tion (H.R. 2127) that would renew federal pro- grams under the Rehabilitation Act for one year. The bill doesn't include an overall fiscal year 1992 authorization amount, although it would provide $1.87 billion for state voca- tional rehabilitation programs. The bill would also support a host of other programs, includ- ing independent living centers, research and training, and rehabilitation facility construction. The bill includes a waiver for states that cannot afford to create early intervention pro- grams for disabled toddlers; a 1986 law re- quired states to develop such programs and provide services within five years. Congress appropriated $1. 9 billion overall in fiscal year 1991 for Rehabilitation Act programs. Rehabilitation Act programs usually are reauthorized for five years; the current authoriza- tion expires in fiscal year 1991. The one-year ex- tension will give legislator s, the administration and disability groups more time to craft a more extensive reauthorization of the 1973 statute to incorporate provisions of the Ameri- cans with Disabilities Act. Work on a revised act is expected to begin next year. In the meantime, advocates and fed- eral agencies (notably the National Council on Disability) have held hearings across the \u00b7 country to glean public input into how the law should be changed. More disabled children served by special education programs, Education Dept. finds Over the past 15 years, the number of stu- dents with disabilities receiving special educa- tion services has increased steadily, according to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Approximately 4.7 million students were served in the 1989-1990 school year, a 2.2 percent increase over the 1988-1989 term. These and other findings were announced in the department's 13th annual report to Con- gress on the Individuals with Disabilities Edu- cation Act (IDEA, formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act). The report describes the progress in providing a \"free and appropriate Federal Programs Advisory Service Thompson Publishing Group 1725 K Street, N.W.

It means the states are addressing the challenge of the first national education goal: all children will start school ready to learn.\" The vast majority (86 percent) of students served by special education are between the ages of 6 and 17. However, ED found that the number of children ages 3-5 enrolled in special educa- tion increased by an average of 8.2 percent annu- ally since 1986-1987. Leaming disabilities are the most common disabling condition found in special education students ( 49 percent), followed by speech or language impairments (23 percent), mental re- tardation (13 percent) and serious emotional disturbances (9 percent). The proportion of school children with learning disabilities served has increased in the past 15 years, go- ing from 25 percent in 1976-1977 to 50 per- cent in 1989-1990, ED found. With the increase in special education en- rollments has come a shortage of special edu- cation teachers. Although the number of teachers increased by 1.2 percent between 1987-1988 and 1988-1989, ED said, states re- ported that they need nearly 28,000 more teachers to fill vacancies and replace uncertified staff. Mainstreamed, graduating Most students served by IDEA programs take classes with their non-disabled peers. Ac- cording to ED, 93 percent of students ages 3-21 were served in regular school settings; the re- maining 7 percent were served in separate schools or facilities. A majority of the students with disabilities exiting school graduated with a diploma ( 44 percent) or certificate (10 percent). Twenty- seven percent of those leaving school dropped out, and 2 percent reached the legal age limit set in their states for special education services. ADA services office created at EEOC A new office devoted to disability issues has been created within the Equal Employ- ment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC announced last month that it will add Americans with Disabilities Act Ser- vices to its Office of Legal Counsel. Full-time staff will develop policy and provide technical assistance for the commission and the public on the Americans with Disabilities Act. The EEOC will enforce the employment provi- sions (title I) of the act. According to the commission, ADA Ser- vices will have two divisions: ADA Policy and ADA Technical Assistance. The policy branch will develop regulations under both the ADA and sections 501 and 504 of the Reha- bilitation Act. The EEOC proposed ADA regulations in February (see Supplement No. 148, March 1991).

Kansas amends state civil rights law to parallel ADA, Fair Housing Act Kansas Gov. Joan Finney signed legislation last month that makes the Kansas Act Against Discrimination parallel to the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amend- ments Act. 3 In some areas, the Kansas law goes beyond federal law. For example, Kansas employers with four or more employees are covered by the state's non-discrimination requirements; the ADA will eventually apply to businesses with 15 or more workers. The law was also amended to prohibit cer- tain private membership clubs (such as coun- try clubs) from discriminating in their mem- bership practices. Organizations that have 100 or more members, serve food on a regular ba- sis to non-members and collect dues are sub- ject to the act. Fraternities, sororities and reli- gious organizations are not covered. States and cities are not required to amend existing anti-discrimination statutes to con- form with the ADA. The ADA doesn't invali- date or limit any state or local law that pro- vides equal or greater protection to disabled people. But where a state or local law has less stringent requirements, the ADA applies. ~~~~~\"\"\"\"\" In the State Courts \"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'~ Suspending HIV-infected doctor's surgery privileges did not violate state discrimination law, New Jersey court rules A hospital did not violate New Jersey's anti-discrimination law when it suspended the surgery privileges of a doctor who had AIDS, the New Jersey Superior Court for Mercer County ruled (Behringer v. Medical Center at Princeton, NJ SuperCT L88-2550, 4/25/91). The doctor, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was a patient at the hospital where he worked. During his stay, he tested positive for HIV and was diagnosed with AIDS. Several hospital officials knew the doctor's test result, which also was noted on his medical chart. Soon af- ter his discharge, the doctor received calls from well-wishers who spoke of his having AIDS. A few weeks after his diagnosis, the hospi- tal suspended the doctor's surgical privileges. Hospital policy restricts health care providers from participating in any activity, including surgery, that would pose a risk of transmitting HIV to patients. The hospital also required the June 1991 doctor's patients to sign informed consent forms noting his HIV status. After his death, the doctor's estate sued the hospital for violating the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, charging the suspension discriminated against the doctor based on dis- ability. The estate also sued the hospital for breaching its duty of confidentiality to the doctor as its patient. The state court agreed that New Jersey's law protects the doctor as a disabled person. The law prohibits \"any unlawful discrimination against any person because such person is or has been at any time handicapped or any unlawful employ- ment practice against such person.\" However, the court ruled that the hospital does not violate the state law in requiring HIV-positive doctors to inform their patients and limiting their medical activities. Patients must be included in the decision-making pro- cess, it said, and disclosing potential, even re- mote, risks is material to that process. \"The risk of transmission is not the sole risk involved,\" the court said. \"The risk of a surgi- cal accident, no matter how small, performed by an HIV-positive surgeon may subject a previously uninfected patient to months or even years of continual HIV testing.\" Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 195 of 2904 A doctor's right to perform invasive proce- dures fails when weighed against New Jersey's \"strong policy\" supporting patient rights, the court added. \"Where the ultimate harm is death, even the low risk of transmission justi- fies the adoption of a policy that precludes invasive procedures where there is 'any' risk of transmission,\" it concluded. The court did award damages to the doctor's estate for breach of confidentiality regarding his stay there as a patient, ruling that the hospital's procedures do not provide adequate protection to the patient. 'Vicarious disability' argument fails in Iowa court The Supreme Court of Iowa has rejected a law- suit brought by a man who claimed that he was a victim of \"vicarious disability discrimination\" (Monson v. Commission, 467 N.W. 2d 230). Ron Monson was fired from his job after missing extended periods of work to care for his terminally ill daughter. The girl, who was completely disabled by a brain tumor, required around-the-clock attention. Monson's wife had ~~~~~~Profiles John Wodatch: the ADA \"point man\" at the Justice Department John Wodatch has been a busy man lately. Across from his desk sit 16 loose-leaf note- books filled with 2,500 comments -more than 15,000 pages -that were submitted in response to the Justice Department's proposed rules on titles Il and ID of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). And as the department's point man on the ADA, it's his job to read them. \"We are going through them, we are read- ing every single one, analyzing them all,\" Wodatch said \"They're very good- they're very helpful. Surprisingly, we didn't get a lot of 'we're shocked and appalled that you're do- ing this.' Certainly there were disagreements with choices we have made. There were a lot of suggestions.\" Wodatch heads the Office on the Americans with Disabilities Act, the division at Justice re- sponsible for getting out the rules and technical advice to the estimated 3.8 million businesses Handicapped Requirements Handbook died, and he could not afford to hire a full- time attendant. His employer gave him unpaid leave, but after time fired him for excessive absenteeism. Monson claimed that the amount he needed to tend to his daughter rendered him disabled, and that his firing was \"vicarious disability discrimination.\" An Iowa district court ruled that Monson failed to state a viable claim under state civil rights law. The state Supreme Court upheld that decision, ruling that Monson was not part of a protected class under Iowa law. Expressing sym- pathy for his argument, the court nevertheless said it discerned \"no legislative intent, express or implied, that would extend the benefits of [Iowa's anti-discrimination statute] to employees with disabled family members. The extension of the law which Monson suggests must come from the legislature, not this court.\" Further, the court rejected Monson's claim that he was a victim of discrimination by asso- ciation. \"Monson was not terminated because of his association with a disabled person,\" it held. \"He was terminated because of extended absence from work.\" that will be affected by the public accommoda- tions provision of the act. His office will also is- sue regulations for state and local governments. For Wodatch and his colleagues at Justice, the comment process (what he calls \"our real- ity check\") is the second stage in the long and involved process of codifying the ADA. The department issued draft rules for both public accommodations and public services in Febru- ary (see Supplement No. 148, March 1991). Final versions are due July 26, 1991. \"Our goal in the regulation is to keep the same balance as there is in the statute, which is between providing access for persons with disabilities while still recognizing that there's a price tag that comes along with this for busi- ness,\" he said. \"There's a certain tension between giving flexibility to the entities covered by the ADA and at the same time giving them enough guid- ance so they know what's expected of them. We're trying to find the right mix of that in the regulations, and it's a daunting task.\" Supplement No. 151 ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 196 of 290( The section 504 experience Wodatch is no stranger to disability issues. A veteran government lawyer, he's been in- volved with federal disability law for more than 15 years. He was director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1977 when HEW is- sued the first regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Wodatch believes the section 504 experi- ence should ease the transition to ADA com- pliance for both the federal government and entities covered by the new law. Many of the terms and concepts in the ADA, such as rea- sonable accommodation, undue hardship and otherwise qualified, come directly from the section 504 rules. \"It was very important to have section 504 be the basis for the ADA because we did have the track record, we knew what it meant, and it would not only ease compliance, it would let people know what was expected of them,\" he noted. State and local governments The section 504 experience should be par- ticularly helpful to state and local govern- ments in their efforts to comply with the ADA. Because they receive federal funds, many jurisdictions have been subject to sec- tion 504 and have had to make their services accessible to disabled people. Title II of the ADA, which applies to public services, ex- tends the Rehabilitation Act requirements to all programs of all public agencies, whether or not they are grantees. As a result of this connection, title II hasn't gotten the attention paid to the private sector parts of the act. \"[Title II] is not as ground- breaking as titles I or III, so it doesn't have the potential for major impact,\" Wodatch said. \"But in those areas where there will be changes, the impact will be great.\" Examples of key issues? He said there have been many complaints about the lack of acces- sibility in municipal halls, most of which aren't covered by section 504. Also, towns will have to make their \"911\" emergency ser- vices accessible to hearing-impaired people. Other issues he mentioned include police de- partments arrest procedures for disabled people whose conditions may appear to be disorderly conduct (i.e., epilepsy, cerebral palsy), accessi- bility of state courts, and accommodations in June 1991 state and local licensing procedure s (i.e., hunt- ing, professional licenses). Myths and misconceptions 5 Wodatch said that while there is a \"great deal of knowledge\" that the ADA has been en- acted, \"there's a great deal of misinformation about what it is.\" A common misconception among business is that altering one part of a building means that the entire building must be made acces- sible, Wodatch said. Under the ADA and the proposed title III rules, if part of a building is renovated, the altered part must be accessible, but not the whole building. From the disabled community, Wodatch senses an \"unawareness\" with some of the limitations in the ADA. Some advocates por- tray the ADA as a \"new day\" for disabled people, he noted. And while that's true to a large extent, he said, \"the ADA is a very limited piece of legislation in terms of what's required.\" As an example, Wodatch pointed out that while businesses must provide auxiliary aids, they can choose which auxiliary aid to provide and they don't have to do it if it's an undue burden. \"I don't think people have an appre- ciation of the checks and balances in the ADA,\" he said. Issues to address W odatch has identified a number of trends in the title III comments. One concerns people with hearing impairments, who feel that the proposed rule pays too much attention to mo- bility impairments and not enough to commu- nications barriers. Title III of the ADA requires businesses to remove communication barriers that are struc- tural in nature, if it's readily achievable to do so. \"We don't have a lot about that in the rule and we will correct that,\" Wodatch said. Wodatch said the main complaint from the business community stemmed from the Archi- tectural and Transportation Barriers Compli- ance Board's proposed ADA guidelines (see Supplement No. 147, February 1991). Many disagreements with the specifics of the guide- lines were based on misunderstanding of what the guidelines meant, he said, but some were valid and will be addressed in the final stan- dards. Justice expects to reference the access board's guidelines in its final title III rules.

Un- der NIDRR's plan, grants would be awarded for establishing national peer training, devel- oping training materials and resources (on ac- cessibility /public accommodations, employ- ment and communications/telecommunica- tions), and setting up regional disability and business accommodation centers. Both the Senate and House reports that ac- companied the fiscal year 1991 appropriation bill for the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education called on NIDRR to provide technical assistance for the new disability civil law. The House specifi- cally recommended that 10 new regional cen- ters on disability be established. For more information on NIDRR's pro- posal, contact David Esquith (202) 732-5081. (May 21 Federal Register, Pages 23336- 23342.) ED proposes special education, technology assistance rules The Education Department (ED) has pro- posed regulatory changes to two of its disabil- ity-related programs. The department intends to amend its rules for the Services for Chil- dren with Deaf-Blindness program (34 C.F.R. Part 307) to incorporate changes mandated by Congress when it reauthorized the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Among other issues, the proposed rule de- fines deaf-blindness, expands the age of youth who can benefit from the program and adds the authority to create a national clearinghouse for children with deaf-blindness. For more in- formation on the proposed rule, contact Charles Freeman at ED, (202) 732-1165. In addition, the department has proposed regulations to implement the Training and Handicapped Requirements Handbook Public Awareness Projects authorized under the Technology-Related Assistance for Indi- viduals with Disabilities Act. The rule would describe the purpose of the program, the types of activities that could be supported and selec- tion criteria for funding priorities and award- ing grants. For more information, contact Carol Cohen, (202) 732-5607. Both proposed rules were published in the May 21 Federal Register, Pages 23344-23358. Applicants sought for Education Dept. research, training grants Approximately $450,000 is available from the Education Department to fund three awards for advanced disability rehabilitation training and research. The application dead- line is Sept. 30. For more information, contact Sean Sweeney (202) 732-1202 (May 14 Fed- eral Register, Page 22282). Funding is also available from the Office of Special Education Programs at ED. Grants will be awarded for projects to encourage people to enter special education teaching, re- tain special education teachers and examine high school curricula for students with dis- abilities.

An estimated 2,000 people, many in wheel- chairs, with guide dogs or using sign lan- guage, gathered on the South Lawn of the White House to witness the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the most sweeping anti-discrimination law en- acted since the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A Note to subscribers -The ADA (P.L. 101-336) bars discrimina- tion against qualified disabled people in employment, public services, transportation, public accommodations and telecommunica- tions. When fully effective, it will apply to employers with 15 or more workers and almost every commercial establishment open to the public. A strong supporter of the law, Bush com- pared passage of the ADA to the collapse of the Berlin Wall. He said the act \"takes a sledgehammer to another wall, one which has, for too many generations, separated Ameri- cans with disabilities from the freedom they could glimpse, but not grasp. In September, subscribers to the Handicapped Requirements Handbook will be sent a new chap- ter on the recently enacted Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The chapter will cover all aspects of the ADA, including coverage, requirements and enforcement. In addition, certain sec- tions of the Handbook will be revised to reflect changes in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act made by the ADA. Handbook subscribers should remember that the ADA supplements -but does not replace -section 504. Federal grantees must still comply with the non-discrimination require- ments of section 504.

Federal civil rights protection for the disabled Bush' s signature culminate s a two-year effort by disability advocates and lawmaker s to bring people with disabilitie s under the umbrella of federal civil rights protection. First introduced in Congre ss in April 1988 , ADA was approved by the House 377-28 on July 12, 1990, and by the Senate 91-6 the next day. Under the ADA, employers will have to provide disabled employees with \"reasonable accommodations\" to help them perform their jobs. Public buses and train s will be equipped with lifts for passenger s in wheelchairs. Store owner s and other busine sses will be required to remove architectural barriers and modify policies to make their establishments acces- sible to disabled customer s. (See article s throughout this newsletter for detailed discus- sions of the various provisions of the law.) The law uses broad criteria to define \"dis- abled .\" Rather than using a list of condition s, the act consider s a person disabled if he or she has an impairment which limit s a \"major life activity ,\" such as walking , seeing , hearing or working . Within that definition are condition s such as paraplegia , sight and hearings impair- ment s, learning disabilities and AIDS. The ADA also protects people who have been disabled in the past, but are now recov- ered. Rehabilitated drug users and people with cured cancer are example s. Finally, the statute prohibits discrimination against people who are regarded as being disabled , but do not necessarily have a disabling condition -such as bum victims or people with a limp. The legislative forerunners to the ADA include the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. The definition of disability and many key terms come from section 504, which require s federal grantees to make their program s accessible to disabled people. ADA supple- ments, but does not supplant, section 504. Praise and criticism Disability advocates hailed the ADA as a milestone. Sandra Parrino, chairman of the National Council on Disability , told the Washington Post that the ADA \"herald s a new day\" for disabled Americans. But not everyone shared the day's opti- mism. John Sloan , president of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) , a small-business lobby group, claimed the ADA leaves many legal questions unanswered and exposes small businesses to lawsuits. \"Small-busine ss owners will have no way of knowing whether they are complying with this law or not,\" said Sloan , whose organiza- tion has been a vocal critic of the ADA. \"There was never even an attempt to list the disabilities involved . Congre ss has clearly abdicated its responsibility to the court s.\" Bush dismi ssed charges that the law is onerous or costly. \"We've all been determined to ensure that it gives flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetable or implementation and we've been committed to containing the costs that may be incurred ,\" he said.

Many of our fellow citizens with disabilities are unemployed, they want to work and they can work. \"When given the opportunity to be inde- pendent, they will move proudly into the economic mainstream of American life, and that's what this legislation is all about.\" \"11th-hour\" compromises settle controversies Although the ADA was on a legislative fast track, final approval wasn't certain until sponsors could overcome two last-minute hurdles that threatened to delay or even derail any White House ceremony. The first issue involved coverage of food- industry workers with contagious diseases. The House-Senate conference committee on the bill had dropped a controversial amend- ment passed by the House that would have allowed employers to transfer workers with any. ~ontagious diseases out of food-handling pos1t10ns. (The ADA protects people with infectious diseases, provided they don't pose a health or safety risk to others.) Sponsors of the amendment said it was needed to protect restaurants from public fears about the spread of diseases; they were out- Employment The doors to equal employment opportuni- ties opened considerably wider last month, when President Bush signed legislation that requires businesses to eliminate any employ- ment practices that discriminate against disabled people. Enacted July 26, the Americans with Dis- abilities Act (ADA) prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified job applicants and employees who are or become disabled. All aspects of employment are covered, including the application process and hiring, on-the-job training, advancement and wages, benefits and employer-sponsored social activities. August 1990 3 raged at the conferees' move and threatened to filibuster or even send the bill back through the legislative process. Opponents criticized the amendment as pandering to unfounded fears about AIDS. In a compromise, negotiators inserted language that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to publish annu- ally a list of diseases that can be transmitted through food-handling. Employers are permit- ted to transfer employees with diseases on the list out of food-handling positions. . The other contentious issue surrounding fmal passage dealt with with the ADA's coverage of the Senate. A cadre of senators pushed for an amendment offered by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, that would have given their employees the right to sue under the ADA in federal court. This prompted an outcry from other senators, who charged that allowing the judicial branch to judge members of Congress would violate the separation of powers. Ultimately, lawmakers agreed that the Senate Select Committee on Ethics will handle ADA-related complaints by employ- ees. House and other congressional employees (including the Library of Congress, Office of Technology Assessment and General Ac- counting Office) will file complaints with the House Office of Fair Employment Practices. ADA becomes effective for businesses with 25 or more employees on July 26, 1992. Employers with 15 or more workers must comply beginning July 26, 1994. Exempted are businesses with fewer than 15 employees, th~ federal government (but not Congress) and pnvate membership clubs. Additionally, the law allows secular organizations to give hiring preference to people of a certain religion or require employees to practice that religion. For many private employers, the ADA means learning -and implementing - a vocabulary that federal grantees and contrac- tors have spoken for more than 15 years. The act incorporates terms such as \"reasonable - accommodation,\" \"undue hardship\" and Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 205 of 2904 \"otherwise qualified\" from Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. ADA supplements, but does not replace, section 504. Accommodating disabled workers In a nutshell, the ADA protects otherwise qualified disabled people from job discrimina- tion. To be considered otherwise qualified, a job applicant or employee must be able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodations. Employers must accommodate an employee's known mental or physical disabilities, unless that would impose an \"undue hardship.\" The first step an employer should take is determine the essential functions of a job - tasks that are integral and constant, not mar- ginal and occasional. The ADA recognizes an employer's judgment regarding essential job functions. Written job descriptions prepared before a position is advertised are considered evidence of essential job functions. Employers cannot ask questions about disabilities on applications or during inter- views, or use selection criteria that screen out disabled people, unless those questions or tests are job-related. Employers must provide disabled employ- ees with reasonable accommodations that are needed to perform the essential (and non- essential) duties of the job. Accommodations can be any of myriad adjustments to the workplace or job responsibilities, such as modifying work schedules, reassigning job duties, removing architectural barriers and offering auxiliary aids (e.g., interpreters or taped texts). However, the employer is not obligated to accommodate a disability if that would impose an \"undue hardship.\" To determine undue hardship, the ADA allows employers to consider the cost and nature of an accommo- dation, budget, staff size, and type and loca- tion of the facility. For example, a wheelchair user applies to be a secretary at downtown consulting firm. The essential functions of the job are typing, shorthand and delivering mail. The applicant scores the highest on the skills tests, but steps in the suite would prevent him from distribut- ing mail to some offices. In this case, the firm could accommodate his disability by either installing a ramp or asking another employee Handicapped Requirements Handbook to bring mail to the inaccessible offices (in exchange for the secretary picking up one of his colleague's duties). The ADA does not require employers to change or eliminate essential job prerequisites or functions to accommodate a disabled person. A law firm that only hires law school graduates as attorneys need not hire someone whose disability prevented her from earning a law degree. The consulting firm in the situ- ation described above would not have to hire the applicant if he didn't know shorthand. The responsibility not to discriminate under the ADA goes beyond an employer's own office. Employers may not enter into contracts or relationships with labor unions, employ- ment agencies or other outside organizations that would indirectly cause discrimination against disabled employees. Training semi- nars, conferences and meetings must also be accessible. Also, an employer can't discriminate against a non-disabled applicant or employee just because he or she is related to or associ- ated with someone who is disabled. For example, an employer would violate the ADA if it did not hire a woman for fear that she would be absent often to care for her disabled husband. Likewise, an employer could not fire an employee because his partner is infected with the HIV virus (which causes AIDS). Restrictions on medical exams Generally, the ADA prohibits employers from requiring pre-employment medical exams or inquiring about a disability, but there are limited exceptions. Employers may ask about disabling condi- tions if they are job-related (e.g., asking potential bus drivers if they have any visual impairments). Employers may offer a job and condition the offer on the results of a medical exam, but only if all entering employees in that position are given pre-employment exams and employee medical records are confiden- tial. Optional, employer-sponsored health activities, such as \"wellness programs,\" exercise classes or cholesterol testing, are allowed under the ADA, as long as they are voluntary and any information obtained is kept confidential. Supplement No. 141 ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 206 of 290( Amendment supporters argued that it would protect restaurants from falling victim to public fears about contagious diseases, namely AIDS. Critics charged that it pandered to unfounded fears about the disease. There is no medical evidence that AIDS can be transmit- ted through handling food. The House-Senate conference committee that reconciled the two bills decided to drop the amendment. The conferees inserted alter- native language requiring the U.S. secretary of health and human services to publish and distribute a list of communicable diseases that can be transmitted by handling food and the methods by which such diseases are transmit- ted. Employers may transfer employees with diseases on that list to non-foodhandling positions, if any are available. Substance abuse The definition of disability in the ADA specifically excludes current illegal drug users. The law does, however, protect alcohol- ics and past drug users who have successfully completed rehabilitation treatment. Employee drug testing is legal under the ADA. Employers may bar workers from using drugs or alcohol on the job, and they are allowed to hold drug abusers and alcoholics to the same job standards as other employees, even if their addiction causes unsatisfactory performance. Alcoholics are not afforded ADA's protec- tion if their condition interferes with their work or poses a threat to the property or safety or others. Remedies for discrimination The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will enforce the employment section of the ADA, with regulations due in one year. The commission already oversees compliance with federal laws that protect employees from discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, age and national origin. As with other forms of discrimination, victims of disability-related job bias may seek \"equitable relief' -back pay, reinstatement and injunctions. These are the same remedies currently available under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which the ADA references as its enforcement scheme. August 1990 5 This could soon change, however. Legisla- tion passed by the Senate last month (S. 2104) and the House Aug. 3 (the Civil Rights Act of 1990 -H.R. 4000) would make compensa- tory and punitive damages available to victims of sex, religious and ethnic discrimination under title VII. (Black employees can seek money damages under another federal civil statute.) Because the ADA incorporates title VII by reference, the bill would make com- pensatory and punitive damages available to employees who are victims of disability discrimination. The president has threatened to veto the bill. Administration critics claim the damages provision would expose employers to big- money lawsuits, as well as force them to adopt hiring quotas. EEOC seeks comments on ADA regulations The U.S. Equal Employment Opportu- nity Commission (EEOC) is seeking public comments on regulations to implement the employment section (title I) of the Ameri- cans with Disabilities Act. The commission published an \"advanced notice of proposed rulemaking\" in the Aug. 1 Federal Register (Page 31192), requesting \"any ideas, com- ments or concerns which should be consid- ered in the course of framing these regula- tions.\" The EEOC, which will enforce compli- ance with the ADA's employment require- ments, must issue regulations within a year of enactment (by July 26, 1991). Comments on the proposed regulations should be sent no later than Aug. 31 to Frances M. Hart, Executive Officer, Execu- tive Secretariat, EEOC, 1801 L St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20507. Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 207 of 2906 Public Accommodations The newly enacted Americans with Dis- abilities Act (ADA), signed by President Bush July 26, gives disabled people an unprece- dented opportunity to enter the mainstream of society. The law requires that disabled people have equal access to places of public accommoda- tion, including shops, offices and recreational spots. Its intent is to prevent incidents of exclusion and discrimination -recounted s~veral times during congressional hearings by disabled people -from recurring. Some business groups fear that vague provisions and costly requirements will force many \"mom and pop\" operations into bank- ruptcy. Soon after the ADA passed Congress, the National Federation of Independent Busi- ness denounced it as going \"far beyond the reasonable bounds of common sense.\" Supporters counter that the act strikes a balance between civil rights and economic livelihood. While businesses are required to modify their policies and structures to accom- modate disabled customers, they need not do anything that would impose excessive costs or burdens. It's a point the president emphasized when he signed the legislation. \"We've all been determined to ensure that [the act] gives flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetable of implementation,\" Bush said. \"We've been particularly committed to containing the costs that may be incurred.\" Policies and practices Title III of the act prohibits facilities open to the public from discriminating against disabled people. In the statute is a long (but not exhaustive) list of covered establishments ranging from restaurants, hotels and theaters ' to professional offices, libraries and health clubs. The law applies to those who own, lease or operate covered facilities. Only churches and private clubs are exempt. The law requires a business to offer its goods and services in the most integrated setting appropriate, make \"reasonable modifi- cations\" to its policies and, if needed, provide auxiliary aids to allow disabled customers an equal opportunity to use its services. However, businesses are not required to make such changes if they would impose undue financial, staff or operating constraints. Handicapped Requirements Handbook An establishment is not required to provide an accommodation or change its policies if either would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the business or impose an \"undue burden.\" In a restaurant, for example, modifications could include altering a no-pets policy to allow guide dogs, having waiters read menus to blind patrons, or permitting customers in wheelchairs to order drinks at a table without ordering a meal (even though its policy is to only serve food at tables). A small grocery store would not have to lower all its shelves and widen all its aisles if a sales clerk were willing to help a customer in a wheelchair reach items. A drug rehabilita- tion clinic could refuse to treat a person with AIDS because that would alter the nature of its business (but it could not refuse to treat that person if he were a drug abuser and had AIDS). Courses that prepare people to take exams for licenses or other professional credentials (such as the bar) must be accessible, as must be the exam itself. The ADA's mandate extends to able-bodied people who are related to or associated with a disabled person. A business may not discrimi- ( nate against someone whose spouse, room- mate or friend is disabled. 'Readily Achievable' Public places must be physically accessible to disabled people. The ADA requires busi- nesses to remove architectural and communi- cation barriers where \"readily achievable,\" defined as \"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.\" A business can consider its overall size and budget, number of employees, and the type of facility to determine if barrier removal is readily achievable. Site-specific factors may be considered wh~n an individual business is part of a larger cham. These factors include the amount of financial, staff and other support a business receives from its parent company. I~ barrier removal poses an undue burden, a business must offer its goods or services through alternative methods that are readily achievable. New construction and renovations of facilities are also covered by the ADA. Start- \\. ing 30 months after enactment (Jan. 26, 1993), Supplement No. 141 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 208 of 290( all newly built commercial facilities must be accessible to disabled people. Elevators are not required in facilities with fewer than three stories or less than 3,000 square feet, unless the building is a shopping center, mall or professional medical center. Renovations must be made accessible, and if a business alters areas that affect \"primary functions,\" the path of travel to the areas and rest rooms, telephones and water fountains in or near those areas must also be accessible. Examples of primary function areas include a dining room at a restaurant, exhibit areas in a museum and reading rooms in libraries. Small business extension In response to concerns that the ADA would wreak financial and administrative havoc on small businesses, Congress provided small-business owners a grace period from lawsuits brought under the public accommo- dations title. Businesses employing fewer than 25 people and grossing less than $1 million a year are exempt from lawsuits filed for six months after the effective date, or until July 26, 1992. Companies with 10 or fewer em- ployees and annual earnings of less than $500,000 are immune from suits until Jan. 26, 1993. The conference report (H. Rpt. 101-596) that accompanied the ADA makes it clear, however, that these small businesses are expected to make a \"good faith effort\" toward compliance with the law. Private bus companies Public transportation offered by private companies must be accessible to disabled riders. This includes over-the-road bus compa- nies such as Greyhound, charter bus routes and shuttle services. Because it is addressed by the Air Carrier Access Act, air transporta- tion is not covered the ADA. Large bus companies have six years to comply with the ADA; small companies have seven years. The law directs the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment (OT A) to conduct a 3-year survey on the accessibility needs of inter-city buses. The U.S. Department of Transportation will base its regulations on the results of OT A's study. Companies that operate \"fixed-route\" and \"demand- responsive\" transit must ensure that newly bought vehicles that seat at least 16 August1990 must accommodate disabled riders. This applies to companies that offer transportation services, but are not primarily transit opera- tors, for example, shuttle services offered at airports by hotels or car rental companies. Remedies 7 The U.S. Justice Department will enforce compliance with the public accommodations provisions of the ADA; regulations are due by July 26, 1991. The attorney general has the authority to seek \"pattern and practice\" civil penalties -$50,000 for the first offense and $100,000 for subsequent violations. Punitive damages are not available. In addition, the ADA gives private indi- viduals the right to file suit against public establishments for violations of the law, including suits for \"anticipatory discrimina- tion\" in new construction or renovations. This would apply if a disabled person discovered that plans for a new building did not feature an accessible design. Courts may award injunctive relief and order facilities to make accommodations, change policies or provide auxiliary aids. Public Tansportation Wheelchair lifts on buses, subway stations with elevators and accessible train cars will soon be common sights for commuters. That's because the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires public transportation systems to be accessible to disabled riders. Signed by President Bush on July 26, the ADA covers most forms of public transporta- tion, including buses, trains and paratransit. Private services, such as Greyhound and hotel shuttle vans, are covered by the public accom- modations section of the act. Because air travel is addressed by the Air Carrier Access Act, airlines are not covered the ADA. But the law does apply to public services offered at airports, such as ground transportation between terminals and to parking lots. School bus transportation is also exempted from the ADA. Lifts for buses The most immediate impact of the ADA on transportation will be seen on public buses. Starting Aug. 26, (30 days after the enactment date), public transportation authorities can Handicapped Requirements Handbook This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 209 of 2908 only purchase new buses that are accessible to people in wheelchairs. Generally, this means that the bus will come equipped with a wheel- chair lift. If buying uses vehicles, agencies must make a \"good faith\" effort to shop for accessible buses. The law does not require retrofitting of older buses, although existing buses that undergo major overhauls must be made accessible. All new and renovated transit facilities, such as bus terminals, must be accessible. Alterations to \"primary function areas\" in existing facilities (e.g., waiting rooms, ticket stands and rest rooms) must also be acces- sible. Along with accessible fixed-route bus service, transit authorities are obligated to provide paratransit service for disabled people unable to ride the regular bus and to non- disabled passengers accompanying a disabled rider. Paratransit usually involves accessible vans that transport disabled people to and from their homes, most often by reservation. Paratransit provided must be comparable more often to regular bus service. Local transit authorities will have to submit plans to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) outlining their paratransit proposals. The ADA allows exceptions to mandatory paratransit. A locality may be exempt if providing the service imposes an undue financial burden. Also, a transit authority need not offer paratransit if it only operates com- muter buses (direct, non-stop routes). In addition, the law does not require a transit authority to offer paratransit in areas where other providers operate a similar service. Ending lawsuits Several cities, such as Denver and Seattle, have made or are in the process of making their bus fleets lift-equipped. Other cities, however, have been in dispute with disability groups over how to make that same commit- ment. At issue was whether existing federal laws, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (which mandates non-discrimination in federally funded programs) and the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as amended (which provides federal transit funding) require localities to provide lift- equipped buses. Disability groups sued DOT Handicapped Requirements Handbook in 1987, disputing its regulation that gives localities the option of how they make public transportation accessible. Last year, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that section 504 requires acces- sible transportation, and it ordered the depart- ment to examine its policies. The court did not prescribe lifts. In response to that decision and in anticipa- tion of the ADA, DOT announced in March that it would scrap the so-called \"local option\" and require federally funded transit authorities to buy accessible vehicles. Final regulations are expected to be released in September. (The ADA effectively overrides DOT's action.) Access to rail systems Enactment of the ADA lends a more com- prehensive meaning to the conductor's call of \"all aboard!\". The law requires accessibility to train transportation, which includes city subways, light and commuter rail systems, and Amtrak. As with buses, all newly bought subway and light and commuter rail cars must be accessible. These rail systems must have at least one accessible car per train by 1995. All new stations must be accessible. In addition, \"key\" stations in subway and light rail systems must be made accessible within three years of enactment (by July 26, 1993); the law gives transit authorities an additional 30 years if compliance will produce extraordinarily expensive changes. Commuter rail lines also have three years to make key stations accessible, although the extension granted for expensive changes is 20 years. The statute does not define key station, but the Senate committee report accompanying the ADA notes that such stations that have high riderships, are located in business dis- tricts or cultural, educational and recreational centers, or are transfer points to other trains or buses could be considered key stations. Phila- delphia and New York City have used the key-station concept to determine which stops in their subway systems should be made accessible. Amtrak is also subject to the ADA. The law requires the railroad to purchase only acces- sible new cars starting Aug. 26, 1990 and to have at least one accessible car per train within five years. Features of accessible cars must include a place to store wheelchairs, a Supplement No. 141 ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 210 of 290( place to secure a wheelchair as a seat, and an accessible rest room. Food services must also be accessible. New Amtrak stations must be accessible, and all existing stations must be made acces- sible within 20 years of enactment. DOT, which will enforce public transporta- tion systems' compliance with the ADA, must issue regulations by July 26, 1991. Telecommunications Enactment last month of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) means that people with hearing and speech impairments will soon be able to take advantage of one item that most Americans can't live without -the telephone. Title IV of the law requires telephone companies to provide continuous telecommu- nications relay services by 1993. When fully in place, the relay system will enable hearing- and speech-impaired people to communicate nationwide over the phone. State-of-the-art technology allows hearing- impaired people to communicate over the phone. Telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDDs) send messages from one person to another through a typewriter-style device with a video screen or printer. But this system only works when both parties have TDDs; many deaf and most hearing people don't have the machines. The relay system envisioned by the ADA will bridge the gap between people and busi- nesses with and without TDDs. It will require intra- and interstate phone systems to have Interior, OPM reference UFAS in section 504 regulations The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) have made cross-references to the Uni- form Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) in their regulations implementing section 504 in federally assisted programs and activities. The agencies' action is part of a govern- ment-wide effort to make UFAS the common accessibility standard for federal grantees to August 1990 third-party operators available who will relay messages from a TDD user to a non-user, and vice versa. A handful of states already have such a system in place. 9 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will oversee compliance with title IV and issue regulations to set minimum stan- dards, practices and service criteria. Mostly, the commission will be concerned with inter- state relay services. States with relay systems that meet federal standards and are certified by the FCC will monitor intrastate compliance. The law bars phone companies from impos- ing fixed monthly charges on residential customers to recover the costs of interstate relay services. Further, it prohibits companies from charging relay users higher rates than voice users for standard factors such as length of call, distance, and time when the call is made. States are given the discretion for determin- ing how providers will recover costs in intra- state relay services.

In their regulations, DOI and OPM had required that construction or alterations follow the Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design (MORAD). UFAS replaces the MORAD in the regulations, but neither agency will consider UF AS as the only means of compliance. Both agencies will allow scoping or technical departures from UFAS, provided that equal or greater access to the building is achieved.

Education sets funding priorities for NIDRR; other programs The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has announced several final and proposed funding priorities in fiscal years 1990-91. Final priorities include: funding of a research and training center on improved rehabilitation for low-function- ing deaf individuals (July 3 Federal Register, Page 27594-27595); funding to provide educational and reha- bilitation services to low-functioning deaf adults. (July 6 Federal Register, Pages 27936- 27937); and funding to develop compensatory educa- tional technology for disabled students (July 6 Federal Register, Page 27940). The department has also proposed funding priorities for the National Institute on Disabil- ity and Rehabilitation Research. These include projects to involve people who have psychiat- ric disabilities as consumer advocates in voca- tional rehabilitation; conduct national studies on job coaches and transition of people with severe disabilities leaving school; start a research rehabilitation center for visually impaired people; and develop technology for older people with disabilities. (July 5 Federal Register, Pages ~7786-27793.) ED seeks applications for disability- related funding Funding is available from the Education Department for several disability-related projects. Approximately $8 million in grants will be awarded to develop statewide demon- stration projects for supported employment services. Applications are due Sept. 14. For more information, contact RoseAnn Godfrey , Handicapped Requirements Handbook Rehabilitation Services Administration, Room 3225, 400 Maryland Ave. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202. (July 3 Federal Register, Page 27489.) Additionally, the department will award the following grants to train special education teachers: parent training and information centers ($1.5 million, application deadline Oct. 9); preparation of leadership personnel ($2 million, application deadline Oct. 9); special projects ($1.25 million , application deadline Oct. 9); and grants to state education agencies and institutions of higher education ($7 .1 million, application deadline March 12, 1991). For more information on these grants, contact Angele Thomas, Office of Special Education Programs, Room 3517, 400 Mary- land Ave. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202. (July 13 Federal Register, Pages 28874- 28875.) Legislative update On July 23 the House passed by voice vote the Disability Prevention Act, a bill (H.R. 4039) that would make permanent a national Centers for Disease Control program aimed at preventing disabilities. The bill would authorize $10 million for the program in fiscal year 1991, and $15 million annually in fiscal years 1992-93. By a 65-34 margin, the Senate approved on July 18 the Civil Rights Act of 1990 (S. 2104), a bill that would overturn six recent Supreme Court decisions involving employ- ment discrimination. The bill, which President Bush has threatened to veto, would also expand remedies for job discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include compensatory and punitive damages . Passage of S. 2104 would expand job bias remedies available to disabled people under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which references title VII. The companion bill (H.R. 4000) was passed by the House on Aug. 3. Supplement No. 141 ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 212 of 290( Appeals courts uphold decisions involving interpreters for deaf parents . remedies for military personnel ' i:~o federal appeals courts recently upheld dec1~10ns by U.S. District Courts involving Sect10n 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In Rothschild v. Grottenthaler (Appendix IV:474), the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Ap- peals ruled that deaf parents of hearing stu- dents are otherwise qualified under section 504 and thus entitled to interpreters at school- sponsored conferences. The Rothschilds had sued the Ramapo (New York) Central School District because it would not provide interpreters for parent- teacher conferences about their two children. The parents claimed they were denied an equal opportunity to participate in school activities, in violation of section 504. Scho~l officials contended that they were not reqmred to provide an interpreter because section 504 applies not to the parents but to their children. They said the parents did not come within the definition of \"otherwise qualified.\" '!'he District Court held for the parents, ruhng that the parents were covered by section 504 to the extent that they would participate in school-sponsored events. The appellate court agreed, citing a U.S. Department of Education regulation (34 CFR 104.3(k)) that interprets \"otherwise qualified\" to include a disabled pers~n \"who meets the reqmrements for the receipt\" of \"other serv- ices.\" . Other services, the appeals court said, includes parent-teachers conferences. \"While the school district is subject to section 504 in providing educational services, that is not the only area in which it must refrain from dis- crimination on the basis of handicap,\" the court ruled. . Th_us, the court said, the school must pro- vide interpreters for academic and disciplinary conferences it initiates. But if the parents want to participate in voluntary extracurricular acti- vities, they must do so at their own expense. August 1990 No private right for armed forces The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a District Court's decision that uni- formed service members may not sue the federal government for violations of the Rehabilitation Act. 11 The plaintiff in this case (Doe v. Garrett, Appendix IV:477) was a naval reserve officer who tested positive for the HIV virus (which causes AIDS), but did not show any symp- toms of AIDS. He was released from active duty. The reservist sued, arguing that his release discriminated against his disability. AIDS and infection with the HIV virus are considered disabil~ties ~nder the Rehabilitation Act. Navy regulations in effect at that time stated that asymptomatic HIV-positive reserve personnel should be \"retained in service.\" (Subsequently, the Navy's Board for Cor- rec~ion ~f Naval Records ruled that the Navy's action v10lated those regulations and it recom- mended that the plaintiff be given back pay and have his record corrected. The Navy's regulation now states that HIV-positive reserve personnel are ineligible for active duty for periods exceeding 30 days.) T?e District Court held that federal employ- ees in general must exhaust administrative procedures under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act before filing discrimination claims under the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, the court ruled, uniformed military personnel do not have any remedies under the Rehabilitation Act. The appellate court cited the decision in Prewitt v. Postal Service (Appendix IV: 146) that federal employees must exhaust title VII administrative procedures before bringing suit under the Rehabilitation Act, and noted that it and other courts have adopted a \"military exception\" for title VII suits. It would be \"incongruous\" to give military personnel a private right against the government under the Rehabilitation Act, when other discrimination claims under title VII are prohibited, the court said.

(See ~510 for a discussion of what constitutes \"public accommodations.\") The legislation and U.S. Department of Justice regulations (28 C.F.R. Part 36 -see Appen- dix III) are very specific about the scope and meaning of these terms and make it clear that this section is to have wide impact (see Figure 500-A). It is not intended to apply to employment practices because these are covered in Title I of the ADA (see Tab 300). The terms \"full and equal enjoyment\" mean that disabled people must be given an equal opportunity to obtain the same results as non-disabled people, be it dining at a restaurant, going to the theater, shopping for groceries, or taking a licensing examination. This does not necessar- ily require disabled people to achieve the identical result or level of achievement of non-disabled persons. Rather, it is the equal opportunity to achieve or receive the benefit that is protected. For example, a health club could not exclude a person in a wheelchair from an exercise class because he or she could not derive the same result from the class as a non-disabled person. In ensuring that disabled people have the opportunity to make use of the goods or services provided by a public accommodation or in a commercial facility, the covered entity might have to make structural alterations to the building (see ~530), or it might be required only to make minor alterations in its policies or procedures (see ~570). Title III does require that all new public buildings be constructed so that they are accessible to disabled people (see ~540). By its specific terms (\u00a7304 ), title III of the act applies to public transportation services provided by private entities (except for air transportation, which is covered by the Air Carriers Access Act). The provisions of title III concerning transportation services (such as charter bus companies or hotel-to-airport vans) are discussed in Tab 400. Exemptions and Exclusions Only three kinds of entities are specifically excluded from the definition of public accommo- dation in Title III of the ADA (\u00a7307). Religious entities, including places of worship, are ex- empt, as are public entities (such as state and local government agencies, which are covered under title II). Similarly, private membership clubs that are exempt under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are also exempt, except when they lease space to a public accommodation (\u00a736.102(e)). \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc.

Reg. 35544-35604). These regulations, which add a new part 36 to Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, consist of six parts: Part A - General Part B - General Requirements Part C - Specific Requirements Part D - New Construction and Alterations Part E - Enforcement Part F - Certification of State Laws or Local Building Codes Included as an appendix to the regulations are the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessi- bility Guidelines (ADAAG) developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compli- ance Board (A&TBCB). The title III rules (\u00a736.406) reference the ADAAG as the accessibility standards for covered entities to follow in barrier removal, alterations and new construction (see ~560). The U.S. Secretary of Transportation is responsible for issuing regulations to implement the transit provisions of title III (see Tab 400). Standards for architectural accessibility The ADA requires new construction and substantial alterations to existing buildings to be accessible to disabled people (see ~540 and ~550). On July 26, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 35408- 35542), the A&TBCB issued the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), which the Justice Department adopted in its regulations (\u00a736.406) as the standards for new construction and alter- ations under title III. The ADAAG are reprinted in Appendix IV. In developing the ADAAG, the access board attempted to be consistent with existing stan- dards, including its own Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design and the American National Standards Institute's ANSI A117.1, the accessibility standards most commonly used in private construction. ADAAG consists of nine main sections and an appendix, and fol- lows the format and numbering system of the ANSI standards. Justice included a chart in \u00a736.406 of the regulations to assist entities in determining the require- ments for particular facilities. A more detailed discussion of the accessibility standards is in ~ 560. ~502 Effective Dates For the most part, Title III of the ADA becomes effective Jan. 26, 1992, 18 months after the act was signed (\u00a73 lO(a)).

Provisions affecting alterations apply to work that begins after Jan. 26, 1992. (See Figure 502-A for a list title III implementation dates.) Section 36.508(c) of DOJ's title III rules clarifies that vehicles newly purchased or leased by public accommodations not primarily engaged in transportation (such as shuttle buses operated by hotels) must be accessible if the solicitation for purchase or lease was made on or after Aug. 25, 1990. The Jan. 26, 1992, effective date applies for the remaining transportation provisions. Special exemption for small places of public accommodation The ADA includes a special provision for small businesses regarding when suits can be brought under the act. While the act is effective for all covered entities (see ~510), including small businesses, civil suits to enforce the provisions of the ADA cannot be filed against small businesses for six months or one year after Jan. 26, 1992, depending on the size of the business (\u00a736.508(b) of the DOJ regulations). If a business has fewer than 10 employees and less than $500,000 in gross receipts, then no civil action may be brought for any act or omission prohibited under the act during the first year after the effective date, or until Jan. 26, 1993. If a business has fewer than 25 employees and gross receipts of less than $1 million, then the ban on civil suits extends for six months after the effective date (or until July 26, 1992). This provision was inserted into the law after small businesses expressed concerns in House committee hearings. Amounts collected for sales taxes are not included in determining what constitutes gross receipts under this section. This provision should not be interpreted as a blanket waiver of applicability of the law during the period when suits are banned. It is clear from the conference report that accompanied the final version of the ADA (H. Rpt. 101-596, p. 81) that small businesses are expected to make \"good faith efforts to comply with the act during this additional phase-in period.\" The exemption from lawsuits does not apply to new construction or alterations of small businesses (\u00a736.508(b)). 1[503 Structural Accessibility in Public Accommodations Section 302(b )(l)(A)(i) of the ADA requires that disabled people be given the \"opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accom- modations\" of all public accommodations (see ~510). This means that the goods, services, facili- ties, privileges, advantages or accommodations must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. The ADA specifically addresses the accessibility of commercial facilities and buildings open to the public (see Figure 503-A). It requires that: new structures be constructed so as to be accessible (\u00a7303(a)(l); see ~540); \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc.

This would include hotel and motel airport shuttle services, customer shuttle bus services operated by private companies and shopping centers, student transportation, and shuttle operations of recreational facilities, such as stadiums, zoos, amusement parks and ski resorts. This list is only intended to provide examples of the types of services covered and is not exhaustive. This section does not apply to private entities that are primarily engaged in the business of transporting people, such as charter bus companies, or to over-the-road buses (see Tab 400). Over-the-road buses are characterized by an elevated passenger deck located over a baggage compartment, according to section 301(5), and all such buses are subject to the requirements of sections 304 and 306 of the ADA. Section 36.310 of the title III regulations requires public accommodations that offer transpor- tation services to remove transportation barriers in existing vehicles to the extent it is \"readily achievable\" to do so (see ~530 for a discussion of readily achievable). This section applies regardless of whether the transportation service offered is \"fixed-route\" (i.e., operates according to a schedule along a set route) or \"demand-responsive\" (does not run on a fixed schedule, but instead is dispatched when a passenger requests service). The installation of hydraulic or other lifts is not required. Also, this section does not cover vehicles provided for employees only (such as employee van pools), although it would apply if employees and customers or clients are served by the same transportation system. New vehicles Public accommodations that provide transportation services are obligated under the ADA to ensure that new vehicles are accessible to disabled people, including people who use wheelchairs . Under the act (\u00a7302(b)(2)(B)(i)), it discriminatory for entities that offer fixed-route transportation to purchase or lease an inaccessible new vehicle that seats more than 16 people after Aug. 25, 1990. This requirement also applies to vehicles that carry 16 or fewer passengers. However, an entity may purchase inaccessible vehicles if it can demonstrate that, when viewed in its entirety , \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc.

Essentially, this means that a covered entity can purchase an inaccessible vehicle seating fewer than 16 people as long as there are enough accessible vehicles in its fleet to provide equivalent service to disabled patrons. For example, a hotel near an airport that provides a fixed- route shuttle service to the airport need not purchase new vehicles that are accessible, as long as it makes alternative equivalent arrangements for transporting people with disabilities who cannot board the inaccessible vehicles. The hotel could choose to own an accessible vehicle or contract with another hotel that has an accessible vehicle to meet the requirements of this section. (H. Rpt. 101-485, Part 1, p. 40.) Demand-responsive systems Section 302(b)(2)(C) of the act includes provisions for private entities that operate demand- responsive systems and that are not in the principal business of transporting people, and that are not subject to the provisions of section 304. The requirements for demand-responsive systems are the same as for fixed-route systems, except that the entity need not ensure that all its new ve- hicles that carry more than 16 passengers are accessible. It must, however, demonstrate that the system, when viewed in its entirety, provides a level of service to individuals with disabilities ( that is equivalent to that provided the general public. The Department of Transportation has issued regulations concerning accessibility of privately operated transportation services. A full discussion is found in Tab 400. ~505 Accessibility of Examinations and Courses Section 309 of the ADA and \u00a736.309 of DOJ's regulations require that certain examinations and courses be conducted in a place and manner accessible to disabled people. This includes any examinations or courses related to \"applications, licensing, certification or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional or trade purposes.\" It is permissible to offer \"alternative accessible arrangements\" for disabled people (subject to the integrated setting re- quirement of \u00a736.203), except where to do so would cause an \"undue burden\" or would funda- mentally alter the nature of the goods or services being offered. This provision complements the title II requirements on licensing and credentialing activities of state and local governments and the Rehabilitation Act (section 504) requirements on licensing and credentialing programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance . It also closes a gap in coverage by requiring all providers of testing or credentialing to comply with the ADA's requirements. The Justice Department noted in the preamble to the Page 10 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 233 of 290( ( ~ Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~505 regulations that Congress included this provision so that disabled people are not \"foreclosed from educational, professional or trade opportunities because an examination or course is conducted in an inaccessible site or without needed modifications.\" Section 36.309(b)(l)(i) of the title III rules requires a private entity to assure that the results of its examination \"accurately reflect an individual's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the examination purports to measure, rather than reflecting the individual's impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills\" (except when that is the purpose of the test). Examinations specially designed for disabled people must be offered as often and in as timely a manner and in locations that are as convenient as other examinations (\u00a736.309(b)(l)(ii)). Entities offering examinations may be required to provide auxiliary aids for people with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills (\u00a736.309(b)(3)). Auxiliary aids include taped exams, braille or large print examinations and answer sheets, readers or interpreters. Entities are not required to offer auxiliary aids that would fundamentally alter \"the measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is intended to test or would result in an undue burden.\" Testing must be offered at an accessible site if possible. If necessary, a private entity offer- ing such examinations must provide alternative comparable testing arrangements, such as testing at home with a proctor, administering the exams orally, or changing in the length of time permit- ted to complete the exam (\u00a736.309(b)(4)). In the preamble to its regulations, Justice notes that entities administering examinations can require disabled people to provide advance notice and appropriate documentation of their disabili- ties and any modifications they may need. Application deadlines, however, must be the same for both disabled and non-disabled people. Testing organizations cannot refuse to accommodate disabled people on the grounds that they are unable to perform the essential functions of the profession for which the exam is given. Section 36.309(c) of the rules requires modifications to ensure that the place and manner in which courses are given are accessible. Possible modifications that might be required to accom- modate disabled students include extending the time for completing the course, permitting oral rather than written delivery of assignments, providing cassettes of class handouts or prepared notes, etc. As with exams, entities that offer courses covered by this section are not required to incur undue administrative burdens or fundamentally alter the nature of the course. Any alternative arrangements made for disabled people in exams or courses must provide compa- rable conditions to those provided to others, including lighting and room temperature . For example, an exam cannot be offered to a disabled person in a cold, poorly lit basement if non-disabled people take the test in a warm, bright classroom.

For purposes of the ADA, a public accommodation is generally a privately owned establish- ment that makes its services, programs or goods available to the public. The scope of title III is purposely broad to include a wide range of private individuals and businesses that may operate, own, or lease to or from any public accommodation. The Justice Department title III regulations actually address three types of establishments, with differing requirements based on the nature of the establishment. The first important term is \"place of public accommodation,\" which is an adaptation of the statutory term \"public accommo- dation\" (Section 301(7) of the ADA). Under the title III rules (\u00a736.104 ), a place of public accommodation is \"a facility, operated by a private entity, whose operations affect commerce and fall within at least one of 12 categories. The term \"commerce\" means travel, trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication - (A) among the several states; (B) between any foreign country or any territory or possession and any state; or (C) between points in the same state but through another state or foreign territory. The regulations adopt from the statute a list of 12 categories of establishments that constitute places of public accommodation: (A) an inn, hotel, motel or similar place of lodging (except where there are no more than five rooms for rent and the proprietor lives there); (B) a restaurant, bar or other establishment serving food or drink; (C) a motion picture house, theater, concert hall, stadium or other place of exhibition or entertainment; (D) an auditorium, convention center, lecture hall or other place of public gathering; (E) a bakery, grocery store, clothing store, hardware store, shopping center or other sales or rental establishment; (F) a laundromat, dry cleaner, bank, barber shop, beauty shop, travel service, shoe repair service, funeral parlor, gas station, office of an accountant or lawyer, pharmacy, insurance office, professional office of a health care provider, hospital or other service establishment; (G) a terminal, depot or other station used for specified public transportation; (H) a museum, library, gallery or other place of public display or collection; (I) a park, zoo, amusement park or other place of recreation; (J) a nursery, elementary, secondary, undergraduate or postgraduate private school, or other place of education; \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

Congress intended this list to provide examples of establishments that are \"public accommo- dations\" and specified that these categories should be interpreted \"liberally, consistent with the intent of the legislation that people with disabilities should have equal access to the array of establishments that are available to others who do not currently have disabilities\" (Sen. Rpt. 101- 116, p. 59). Thus tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, campgrounds, fishing and boating facilities, and the like would be included in the statutory definition, along with bookstores, computer stores and pet stores, even though they are not specifically mentioned (see also ~211). A \"public accommodation\" is a private entity that \"owns, leases (or leases to) or operates a place of public accommodation.\" It is the public accommodation -the store owner, the hotel company, the restaurant franchisee -that is responsible for complying with the general and specific non-discrimination requirements of the title III rules (Subparts B and C - see ~520 and ~530). Public accommodations must also meet the accessibility requirements in subpart D of the rules if they build or alter a place of public accommodation (see ~540 and ~550). Finally, the title III rules address commercial facilities, defined as facilities \"(1) whose operations will affect commerce; (2) that are intended for nonresidential use by a private entity;\" and are not aircraft , certain railroad rolling stock or facilities expressly exempt from the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (\u00a736.104). Generally, this term covers warehouses, office buildings and other facilities used by employees of a business, but not otherwise open to the public. Commercial facilities must comply with the regulatory provisions for new construction and alterations, and to the extent that they are also public accommodations, the non-discrimination requirements. Limited coverage as public accommodations While a private home is not included within any of these 12 categories, it would be considered a public accommodation if part of the home is open to the public for business. For example, the professional office of a doctor, lawyer or accountant located in a home is considered a place of public accommodation. The rules (\u00a736.207) point out that that office, together with the areas that provide access to it, are subject to the ADA's accessibility requirements, even though it may also be used as a private residence. The rest of the home would not be covered by title III, however. Similarly, public tours of commercial facilities that are not otherwise considered public accommodations, such as factory or movie production set tours, must be operated in accordance with the ADA. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 21 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 237 of 290~510 Accessibility and Public Accommodations In the preamble to its title III regulations, Justice specifies that wholesale establishments are ( considered public accommodations except in cases where they sell exclusively to businesses and not individuals. For example, a company that grows food produce and sells exclusively to food processing plants would not be considered a public accommodation. However, if that farm also operates a roadside stand, the roadside stand would be a sales establishment subject to the ADA. The stand would have to be accessible to disabled patrons and would have to remove access barriers to the extent that is readily achievable to do so, or provide alternative methods of mak- ing its produce available to disabled customers (such as delivering produce to a person's car). Certain entities that are not normally considered public accommodations may become subject to the ADA if they lease space to hold public events. For example, Justice notes, trade associa- tions or performing artists may become public accommodations if they lease space for a conven- tion or performance in a hotel, convention center or stadium. They then would be responsible for providing auxiliary aids (e.g., interpreters or braille programs) for conference attendees or con- cert-goers. Accepting donated space does not, however, constitute leasing under the rules. A Boy Scout troop, for example, does not become a public accommodation by accepting donated space in a convention center. ~511 Exclusions Certain facilities and programs are excluded from the title III provisions of the ADA because they are already covered under other non-discrimination laws and regulations. Excluded from the definition of public accommodations are establishments operated by federal, state and local governments, since they are not privately operated. The federal government is covered by provi- sions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. State and local governments are covered by Title II of the ADA. Similarly, only non-residential entities, or portions of such establishments are covered by this title, because residential facilities are covered by the Fair Housing Act, as amended. For ex- ample, the private apartment wing of a large hotel would not be covered by this title (but would be covered by the Fair Housing Act). Further, according to the Senate committee report (Sen. Rpt. 101-116, p. 59), homeless shelters are covered by the ADA only to the extent they are not already covered by the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. In the preamble to the title III rules, however, Justice notes that a homeless shelter that permits short-term stays and provides social services to its residents would be covered under the ADA either as a \"place of lodging\" or as a \"social service center establishment,\" or as both. Page 22 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 238 of 290( ( Accessibility and Public Accommodations ~511 The last distinction made in title III is in the coverage of private schools, including elemen- tary and secondary schools. The legislative history of the ADA (Sen. Rpt. 101-116, p. 49) and the title III preamble make it clear that such schools are not expected to provide a \"free appro- priate education\" or to develop individualized education programs (IEPs) for students as required by the regulations implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (formerly the Education for All Handicapped Children Act), unless they are subject to that statute. See ~ 120 for a discussion of other federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. ~512 Scope of Application of ADA As noted in ~510, the title III regulations apply to \"public accommodations,\" broadly defined to include private entities that own, lease, lease to or operate places of public accommodation. Section 36.102(b)(2) clarifies that the non-discrimination requirements (subparts B and C of the rules) only extend to the operations of a place of public accommodation, not to the parts of an entity's operations that are not public accommodations. For example, an employee-only cafeteria at a hotel is not subject to title III. Public accommodations must comply with the new construction and alterations requirements (see ~540 and ~550) only with respect to facilities used or built as places of public accommoda- tions or commercial facilities (\u00a736.102(b)(3)). A nursery, for example, must ensure that a new greenhouse is accessible, but not the new storage shed next to it. All commercial facilities are subject to the new construction requirements, whether or not they are owned or operated by a public accommodation (\u00a736.102(c)). Private clubs are generally exempt from this section, but they become subject to the ADA requirements if they make their facilities available to customers or patrons other than their own members (\u00a736.102(e)). For example, a private club that rents space to a day care center that is open to the public incurs the same obligations as any other landlord of a public accommodation with respect to the day care center. Religious organizations and entities are also exempt from the ADA. Groups that rent space from churches, however, are covered by the act if they operate public accommodations. For example, the requirements apply to a community group that leases a local church hall to run a day care center. The Justice Department notes in the title III preamble that public accommodations that operate in mobile facilities , such as cruise ships, floating restaurants or mobile health units, are covered by subparts B and C of the rules. Consequently, they are subject to the same non- discrimination requirements as are stationary businesses (see ~520 and ~530). \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 23 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 239 of 290~512 Accessibility and Public Accommodations Standards for new construction and alteration of mobile facilities were not included in the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (see ~560). Therefore, the provisions of subpart D will not be applied to such facilities until specific requirements are developed. ~513 Landlords and Tenants Under Title III Section 36.201(b) of the title III regulations clarifies that both a landlord that owns a build- ing that houses a place of public accommodation and the tenant that owns or operates the public accommodation are subject to the ADA's requirements. Allocating responsibility for complying with the various provisions of the act will depend on the terms of the lease or other contractual relationship between the two parties. Determining who is responsible for ADA compliance -the landlord or tenant -proved to be one of the more difficult issues in developing the regulation. Justice had proposed that land- lords be responsible for common areas, and that tenants be responsible for the space they lease. Many commenters to the proposed rule objected to that approach, contending that lease terms are often too complicated to allow such a simple division of responsibility. As noted above, the final rule leaves all decisions regarding ADA compliance to the lease- negotiation process. If appropriate, however, the common space/leased space arrangement can be a viable approach. Therefore, a landlord would generally be responsible for making readily ( achievable changes and modifying policies and practices in common areas (e.g., entrances and concourses in shopping malls), while the tenant would be obligated to remove barriers and accommodate customers within its space. Landlords, Justice notes in the preamble, should not be held responsible for the business practices of a tenant. For example, a restaurant tenant that refuses to seat a disabled patron would be liable for an ADA violation, not the landlord . But if the tenant refused to allow a person with a service dog into the restaurant because the landlord mandates a \"no pets\" policy, both the tenant and the landlord would be liable for discrimination.

Essentially, \u00a736.202 of the Justice Department regulations provides that individuals with disabilities cannot be denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from public accommodations; the opportunity offered disabled people must be equal to that offered non-disabled people; and the participation or benefit cannot be offered separately, unless that is the only effective way that a d,isabled person can participate in the program. Putting this basic concept of non-discrimination into practice, the Department of Justice title III rules require the following in regard to public accommodations: People with disabilities must be served by or admitted to public accommodations (\u00a736.201). A person cannot be denied the services or goods of an establishment because he or she has an association or a relationship with a disabled person (\u00a736.205 -see ~523). If the policies, practices or procedures of an establishment have the effect of excluding disabled people, reasonable modifications to those policies, practices or procedures must be made unless they would fundamentally alter the nature of the business (\u00a736.302 -see ~571). Auxiliary aids and services must be provided to enable a person with a disability to use and enjoy the goods or services of an establishment as long as the provision of the auxiliary aids does not pose an undue burden or is not disruptive to business (\u00a736.303 -see ~572). Barriers to accessibility in existing buildings must be removed if the removal is readily achievable (\u00a736.304 -see ~530). If a building is inaccessible to disabled people and removal of the barriers is not readily achievable, alternative methods must be used to serve disabled people if such methods would not impose an undue burden (\u00a736.305 -see ~532). Examinations and courses for professional or educational applications, testing, licensing, credentialing or certification purposes must be accessible to disabled people (\u00a736.309 -see ~505). New buildings must be constructed so that they are accessible to and usable by disabled people (\u00a736.401 -see ~540). In buildings undergoing renovations, the renovated areas, and under some circumstances the path of travel and certain related facilities, must be accessible to disabled people (\u00a736.402 and \u00a736.403 -see ~550). \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 27 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 241 of 2901[520 Accessibility in Public Accommodations Transportation companies ( Privately operated entities that are primarily engaged in the business of transporting people (except by air), such as charter bus services, are prohibited from denying to individuals with disabilities the full and equal enjoyment of their services. This includes using criteria that tend to screen out individuals with disabilities or failing to make reasonable modifications, provide auxiliary aids or services , or remove barriers. These entities are also prohibited from purchasing or leasing new buses to provide public transportation services that are not accessible, unless they can prove they provide an equal level of service to disabled individuals . The requirements of title III concerning transportation companies are discussed more fully in Tab 400. Equal opportunity vs. equal treatment The ADA (\u00a7302(b)(l)(C)) requires that equal opportunity be provided, not merely equal treatment, to eliminate discrimination. In fact, identical treatment may itself constitute discrimina- tion in some cases, because it would not provide disabled people the adjustments or accommoda- tions they need to achieve equal opportunity. Different or separate treatment is permitted only where it is necessary to ensure equal opportunity and truly effective benefits and services. For example, a blind attorney could not take the same bar examination that non-disabled people take because it is written; the test must be provided in an alternative manner (perhaps orally or on audio tape) for the individual to have the same opportunity provided to non-disabled individuals. ~521 \"Most Integrated Setting\" Required Section 36.203(a) of the title III rules requires \"goods, services, privileges, advantages, accom- modations, and services\" to be afforded to an individual with a disability in the \"most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual.\" Even though separate or different programs or activities may exist that comply with this section, individuals with disabilities may not be precluded from participating in programs or activities that are not different (\u00a736.203(b)). The purpose of this requirement is to allow individuals to participate in existing programs and activities (i.e., those in which non-disabled people are participating) to the extent that a person is capable and desires to do so, and not restrict their participation to separate programs. Accommodations or adjustments that are made for one disabled person may not be necessary or desirable for another who has a similar disability. Similarly, separate programs or activities that may be required to ensure equal opportunity for one disabled person may not be appropriate for another person with a similar disability. Also, individuals should be free to participate in programs or activities with only slight ( modifications or adjustments, even in cases where major modifications are made for other people . ( Page 28 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 242 of 290~522 Accessibility in Public Accommodations example, a sidewalk curb is not constructed with the intention of keeping people who use wheel- chairs off the sidewalk, but unless appropriate curb cuts are included, it has the effect of discriminat- ing against such disabled people. Section 36.204 of the regulations specifies that: an individual or entity shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize standards or criteria or methods of administration- (i) that have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability; or (ii) that perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control. This section prohibits discrimination against disabled people through contracts or other arrangements that might attempt to relieve the covered entity from responsibility under the ADA. Basically, it prevents entities from indirectly doing anything that they may not do directly under the terms of the law. So, for example, an entity may not permit a subcontractor or insurance carrier to use standards that would have the effect of discriminating against disabled individuals. This \"disparate impact\" standard was incorporated to ensure that the legislative mandate to end discrimination does not \"ring hollow,\" and is consistent with the Supreme Court's interpreta- tion of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (see ~ 122) in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985) (see Appendix V:5). In Choate, disabled Medicaid recipients in Tennessee charged that the state's limitation on days of hospitalization covered in its Medicaid program violated section 504. The Court con- cluded that at least some unintentional discrimination caused by the disparate impact of an administrative standard can support a court challenge by those who were discriminated against. However, it ruled that such discrimination alone does not automatically mean that the discrimina- tion is prohibited. Title I of the ADA, which governs employment discrimination, contains paral- lel provisions (see ~335). The disparate impact test is limited, however, by subpart C of the regulations in cases of necessity (\u00a736.301(a) standard (\u00a736.304(a) -see ~531); and where the modification would cause undue burden (\u00a736.303(a) -see ~573). ,-i523 Discrimination Based on Relationships With Disabled People The ADA extends its protection to able-bodied individuals or entities who are discriminated against because they have a relationship with a disabled person. Section 36.205 of the title III rules states: A public accommodation shall not exclude or otherwise deny equal goods, services, facilities, ( ( privileges, advantages, accommodations or other opportunities to an individual or entity because of ( Page 30 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 243 of 290Accessibility in Public Accommodations 1f 523 ( the known disability of an individual with whom the individual or entity is known to have a relation- ship or association. ( This section covers, for example, situations where an individual is denied access to a public accommodation because a companion is known to have a communicable disease, or where services are denied to a family because a child is disabled. Similarly, a day care center cannot refuse admis- sion to a child because her brother is infected with the HIV virus. A health care provider who serves disabled patients is protected from discrimination because of his professional association with those disabled patients. This is similar to the employment provision in Section 102(b)(4) of the ADA (see ~310), which would prohibit an employer from refusing to hire an applicant solely because his wife is disabled and he might be required to miss work to care for her. The Attorney General has made it clear that the protection of this section is not limited to family members of a disabled person. Therefore, if a restaurant refuses to seat a person with cerebral palsy and his or her companions, the companions have an independent right of action under the ADA (\u00a736.205). 1[524 Criteria That Tend to Screen out Disabled People The ADA prohibits any eligibility criteria that would tend to screen out disabled people, unless those criteria are necessary. According to section 36.301 of the rules, a public accommo- dation is prohibited from imposing or applying: eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services , facili- ties, privileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be neces- sary for the provision of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered. Thus, it is discriminatory for an entity to impose requirements on disabled people that tend to burden them or limit their participation . Examples might include a restaurant that seats indi- viduals with Down syndrome only at the counter, not in the dining room, a theater that requires a person who uses a wheelchair to have an adult attendant at all times, or a golf course that bars deaf persons from playing golf. The title III regulations further prohibit policies or criteria that diminish a disabled person's chances to participate, even though they do not directly bar them. For example, consider the drugstore that refuses to accept checks to pay for prescriptions unless the purchaser presents a driver's license; no other form of identification is accepted. While this is not a criterion that mentions or identifies disability, it tends to screen out many disabled individuals because they are not eligible for and do not have licenses due to their visual impairments or other disabilities. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 31 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 244 of 290~524 Accessibility in Public Accommodations Consequently, it denies them access to the service available to other customers, and, therefore violates this \u00a736.301(c). Public accommodations are prohibited from unnecessarily identifying disabilities. For ex- ample, a department store could not ask on a credit application if a person has epilepsy or mental illness. A public accommodation, however, can impose neutral criteria necessary to safely operate its program even if those criteria do tend to screen out individuals with disabilities (\u00a736.30l(b)). Height restrictions for amusement park rides and a swimming proficiency require- ment for boating or rafting trips are examples of permissible criteria, as long as such require- ments are based on actual risks, not on speculation or stereotypes about people with disabilities. While a public accommodation may not impose burdens on a disabled person that it does not require of others, such as requiring the company of an attendant (\u00a736.301), it is not required to provide assistance in feeding, toileting or dressing a disabled patron or to furnish personal de- vices, such as eyeglasses or a wheelchair (\u00a736.306). Finally, public accommodations cannot charge disabled patrons for the costs they incur in barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, reasonable modifications, or the provision of auxiliary aids to make their premises accessible and usable (\u00a736.301(c)). Refundable deposits for the use of specialized equipment (such as a deposit on assistive headphones in a theater) would not be considered surcharges and are allowed under this section. ( Charging disabled customers for home delivery of goods is allowed, as long as the service is not provided as an alternative to barrier removal. If the store provides other alternatives, such as free curb, sidewalk or carry-out service, then it can charge for home delivery in accordance with its delivery pricing policies. ~525 Reasonable Modifications and Undue Burden Section 302(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the ADA requires entities to make \"reasonable modifications\" to their policies, practices or procedures to enable disabled people to enjoy all the goods, services and other opportunities they provide unless to do so would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of those goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations or would pose an undue burden. These concepts are discussed fully in ~570. ~526 Accessibility Sections 302(b)(2)(A)(iv) and 302(b)(2)(A)(v) of the ADA require covered entities to remove structural, architectural, communications and transportation barriers that would keep disabled people from using the goods or services of the entity, as long as the removal of the barriers is \"readily achievable.\" If the removal of the barriers is not readily achievable, the entity must Page 32 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 245 of 290( Accessibility in Public Accommodations 1[526 provide alternative methods of making goods and services available. Any alterations or renova- tions must provide for access and use by disabled people. Barrier-removal provisions of the ADA are discussed more fully in ~530. 1[527 \"Direct Threat\" to Health or Safety Section 36.208 of the title III rules specifically states that public accommodations are not required to provide services to individuals who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The term \"direct threat\" means a \"significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.\" This standard is a codification of the test applied by the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) (see Appendix V:2). In that case, a teacher with tuberculosis was dismissed from her job after a relapse of the disease. The Court held that an individual with a contagious disease is an \"individual with handicaps\" under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (see ~122) and is entitled to a determination whether the disease poses a direct threat to the safety or health of others. As the title III rules stress, this determination may not be based on generalizations or stereo- types. Instead, public accommodations are required to (\u00a736.208(c)): make an individualized assess- ment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best avail- able objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications or policies, prac- tices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. (See also ~242). This provision establishes a strict standard that must be met before a person with a disability can be denied or before that person can be excluded from participation. However, under this standard, a person who uses a threatening or violent manner can be denied service in a public establishment - even if the behavior is the result of a disability -after making the requisite individual assessment. For a discussion of a similar provision that applies to employment situations, see ~310. Justice points out in the preamble to the regulations that the direct threat provision does not apply to people with short-term conditions, such as colds or the flu. These conditions are not disabilities under the ADA and, therefore, people suffering from them are not entitled to the act's protection. 1[528 Illegal Drug Use Section 36.209 of the title III rules does not prohibit discrimination against people who currently use illegal drugs, although the standard for judging whether usage is \"current\" is not \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group , Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 33 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 246 of 290~528 Accessibility in Public Accommodations clearly defined by those regulations. The conference report on the ADA (H.Rpt. 101-596) looked ( to whether the illegal use of drugs occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current, or that continuing use is a real and on-going problem. Addiction to drugs is considered a disability under the ADA, and public accommodations may not discriminate against people who do not currently use illegal drugs and who: have successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program; are participating in a supervised drug rehabilitation program; or are erroneously regarded as engaging in drug use. (\u00a736.209(a)(2)). Further, health care providers and drug rehabilitation services cannot deny their services to an individual on the basis of current illegal drug use if that person is otherwise entitled to their services (\u00a736.209(b)(l)). However, such programs can deny treatment to people who use illegal drugs while participating in their programs (\u00a736.209(b)(2)). Many drug rehabilitation programs make non-use of drugs a condition of treatment. This section does not prohibit a public accommodation from administering reasonable drug testing procedures to ensure that a former user is not currently using illegal drugs (\u00a736.209(c)(l)). ~529 Insurance Sections 36.212(a) and 36.212(b) of the title III rules provide that the ADA does not restrict insurance companies and employers from underwriting, classifying or administering risks in insurance practices, as long as they do not evade the non-discriminatory purposes of the ADA. Public accommodations, however, cannot refuse to serve people with disabilities because of limits on their insurance coverage or rates (\u00a736.212(c)). While these sections specifically permit exclusions from coverage based upon legitimate safety concerns and classification of risks, it is also clear that any exclusion on the basis of disability must be based on permissible criteria, not on the terms of an insurance contract. For example, a person who is blind cannot be denied insurance coverage based on his blindness independent of actuarial risk classification. Similarly, insurance policies can be offered that limit coverage for certain procedures or treatments, but cannot entirely deny coverage to a person with a disability. These provisions apply to unjustified discrimination in all types of insurance provided by public accommodations, including automobile, life and health insurance.

This includes communications barriers that are an integral part of the physical structure of a facility, such as barriers posed by permanent signage or alarm systems, the failure to provide adequate sound buffers, or the presence of physical partitions that hamper the passage of sound waves. It does not include the obligation to provide communications equipment and devices that are more appropriately included as auxiliary aids and services (~572). ~531 \"Readily Achievable\" Barrier Removal The term \"readily achievable\" is defined in \u00a736.104 of the title III rules as \"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.\" Factors to con- sider in determining whether an alteration is readily achievable include: ( 1) the nature and cost of the action needed; (2) the overall financial resources of the site(s) involved in the action; the number of persons employed at the site, the effect on expenses and resources, legitimate safety requirements neces- sary for safe operation, including crime prevention measures, or the impact of such action on the operation of the site; (3) the geographic separateness and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site(s) in question to the parent corporation or entity; ( 4) if applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity, the number of employees of the parent corporation or entity, and the number, type and location of its facilities; and (5) if applicable, the type of operation(s) of the parent corporation or entity, including the composition, structure and functions of the workforce of the parent corporation or entity. These factors are also considered in determining whether a reasonable accommodation re- quired in title I imposes an undue hardship on an employer (see ~251), or whether providing an auxiliary aid or service causes an \"undue burden\" (see ~573) on a public accommodation. How- ever, the \"readily achievable\" standard requires less of a public accommodation than undue burden. If a public accommodation can demonstrate that barrier removal cannot be readily achieved, then it is not required, even if it might not result in an undue burden . The obligation to remove readily achievable barriers does not extend to areas of a facility that are used by employees only. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

The rules provide no numerical formula or cost threshold to distinguish between what is and is not readily achievable. Instead, such decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. For example, a small facility might have to place a ramp over one or two steps, add a grab bar, or install a paper cup dispenser to make a water fountain more accessible, but might not be required to make major modifications such as long ramps or completely remodeled rest rooms, if those changes could not be easily accomplished without much expense. This requirement is deliberately designed to be flexible, depending on the size of the busi- ness. What can be easily accomplished by a large business might be impossible or tremendously costly for a small one. The ADA explicitly mandates that the size and the nature of the business be taken into account in determining what is readily achievable. Figure 531-A, taken from \u00a736.304(b) of the title III rules, is a partial list of barrier removals that can be considered readily achievable (Figure 531-B provides other examples not included in the DOJ rules). The ADA refines the concept of readily achievable to explicitly take into account the resources of a small, local facility (i.e. site-specific factors), as well as the resources of any parent company, and includes a provision that courts must consider the effect on the \"expenses and resources\" of the operation of a local facility in determining whether an action is readily achievable (\u00a7301(9)(b) of the ( ( act; H.Rpt. 101-485, Part 2, p. 109). ( Page 42 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 251 of 290( \\ ( Accessibility and Public Accommodations 1[531 In the preamble to the title III regulations, however, the Justice Department makes clear that factors concerning parent-entity relationships must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Standards for barrier removal in existing facilities differ from those in new construction, given the costs of making facilities accessible to disabled people. Renovating existing facilities to provide access could prove very costly, so a lesser degree of access is required than in the case of new construction or alterations, where accessibility can be economically incorporated in the initial stages of design and construction (\u00a736.401-\u00a7406 of the regulations). For example, to permit access to people who use wheelchairs, a restaurant could rearrange tables and chairs, or a department store might adjust its layout of display racks and shelves or widen aisles, as long as these actions could be carried out without much difficulty or expense and would not result in a significant loss of selling or serving space (\u00a736.304(f)). But a place of public accommodation would not be required to provide extensive ramping or an elevator to provide access around a flight of steps. In small restaurants or stores, readily achievable changes might involve installing small ramps or grab bars in rest rooms. It might be readily achievable for a bank with existing automatic teller machines (ATMs) to provide a small ramp to avoid a few steps, but raising or lowering the ATMs might be too difficult or expensive On the other hand, an A TM at a newly constructed bank would have to be \"readily acces- sible to and usable by\" people with disabilities, since the costs of providing that access could be economically included in the design and construction of the bank. (See ~540 for a discussion of new construction requirements.) The Justice Department makes it clear that public accommodations have an ongoing obligation to remove architectural barriers and should recognize that what is not initially readily achievable may later be required because of changed circumstances. While not required, the department urged public accommodations to develop a procedure to assess ongoing compliance with barrier removal require- ments, including consulting with individuals with disabilities or disability organizations, to diminish the threat of litigation and identify the most efficient means of providing access. Justice recommends (but does not require) that public accommodations develop an implemen- tation plan to achieve compliance before Jan. 26, 1992. If appropriately designed and carried out, such plans could be evidence of a good-faith effort to comply with the readily achievable provi- sion, the department said. Public accommodations must maintain facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible to people with disabilities (\u00a736.211). Such maintenance is obviously important to providing access, but it may be even more critical where safety equipment is concerned. This does not mean that isolated or temporary breakdowns are prohibited, but such conditions cannot \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 43 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 252 of 290~531 Accessibility and Public Accommodations linger. For example, it would be prohibited under the rules to keep an elevator that provides essential access for people in wheelchairs out of service for two months. Priorities for barrier removal Recognizing that adequate resources may not be available to remove all barriers at one time, the Justice Department sets out priorities for barrier removal in the title III regulations (\u00a736.304(c)) to determine which types of barriers should be addressed first. According to the department, \"the purpose of these priorities is to facilitate long-term business planning and to maximize, in light of limited resources, the degree of effective access that will result from any given level of expenditure.\" ( 1) Physical access to a facility is listed as the first priority. \"Getting through the door\" from public sidewalks, public transportation and parking areas is preferable to any other barrier removals that might be made. (2) The next priority, once patrons have gained access to the facility, is to provide access to areas where the goods and services are made available to the public. Thus, customers with disabilities should be given access to the customer service areas and the retail display areas in a store. (3) The third priority is to make rest room facilities accessible when they are offered on \"more than an incidental basis.\" For example, in restaurants and shopping centers where patrons generally use restrooms, it is important for people with disabilities to be able to use the facilities equally. In some types of facilities (including dry cleaners, convenience stores, video stores, etc.) patrons infrequently have access to rest rooms, if at all. In those cases the priority to make rest rooms accessible would not apply. ( 4) The fourth priority mandates public accommodations to take any other measures neces- sary to remove any other remaining barriers. Generally, alterations or other measures taken by a public accommodation to comply with the barrier removal requirements must also comply with the requirements for alterations in \u00a736.404-\u00a736.406. However the \"path of travel\" requirements (see ~550) will not be triggered by measures taken solely to remove barriers. Section 36.304(d)(2) of the rules provides some flexibility to public accommodations where the measures needed to remove a barrier would not be readily achievable. In such cases, the public accommodation may take other steps that do not fully comply with the accessibility requirement. For example, a public accommodation could install a ramp with a steeper slope or widen a doorway that does not quite meet the alterations requirements. However, \"no measure shall be taken ... that poses a significant risk to the health or safety of individuals with dis- abilities or others.\" Page 44 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 253 of 290( ( Accessibility and Public Accommodations 1[531 Portable ramps may be used where installation of a permanent ramp is not readily achiev- able. Section 36.304(e) of the rules requires that portable ramps include safety features such as nonslip surfaces, railings, anchoring and strength of materials. Section 36.304(g) specifies that the degree of barrier removal required of public accommoda- tions may be less than, and need not exceed, the standards for alterations under the ADA Acces- sibility Guidelines (ADAAG -see ~560 and Appendix IV). The barrier removal standard is intended to be substantially less rigorous than that for new construction or alterations. Conse- quently, a hotel would not be required to remove access barriers in a higher percentage of guest rooms than is mandated by the ADAAG. 1[532 Alternative Services If barrier removal is not \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7302(b)(2)(A)(v) of the ADA specifies that the public accommodation must \"make such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations available through alternative methods, if such methods are readily achievable.\" The title III rules (\u00a736.305) list examples of alternative methods of providing services, including providing curb service or home delivery, retrieving merchandise from inaccessible shelves or racks, and relocating activities to accessible locations. Alternative methods could also include: having a clerk meet a disabled patron at the door to pick up or drop off dry cleaning; allowing a disabled patron to be served beverages without dinner at a table, even though non-disabled people who order only drinks are served only at an inaccessible bar; providing assistance to retrieve items from an inaccessible location, such as a store clerk helping a disabled patron reach merchandise on high shelves; delivering prescription and non-prescription pharmacy orders; rotating movies in a multi-theater building between an accessible first-floor screening room and an inaccessible second-floor theater, with advance public notice of the movie's location in advertisements; or filling a gas tank at inaccessible self-service gas stations. Public accommodations cannot charge customers or clients with disabilities for these addi- tional services that are used as an alternative to barrier removal. Section 36.306 states that public accommodations are not obligated to provide \"personal devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; or services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, toileting or dressing.\" \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 45 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 254 of 2901[533 Accessibility and Public Accommodations 1[533 Communications Barriers Individuals who are blind or deaf face communications barriers in addition to the physical barriers that challenge many individuals with mobility impairments. Section 302(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the act requires the removal of communications barriers if the removal is \"readily achievable\" (see ~530). If the removal of the barriers is not readily achievable, a public accommodation is required to provide the good or service through \"alternative methods\" if they are available (\u00a7302(b)(2)(A)(v)). Removing many communications barriers requires only sensitivity and a logical approach to problem solving to meet the needs of each individual. Grocery stores that routinely place tempo- rary advertising displays in the aisles should consider that a vision-impaired person could be injured by such an obstacle. Similarly, doors that may lead to stairs, fire escapes, janitorial closets, stages, catwalks, etc., should be clearly marked, and made tactilely different, if possible, to alert a blind person of potential danger if entered. Doorways in office buildings should be clearly marked on either side with raised-letter or braille numbers or letters to designate room numbers and office names. Such tactile signs should be mounted low enough to be \"read\" by individuals in wheelchairs. Some of the barriers faced by individuals who are blind or deaf, however, can be life- threatening. For example, fire alarms that ring in a hotel go unheard by deaf people. For that reason, warning alarms in public buildings should include both visible and audible signals. (The visual alarms must be set so that they do not trigger seizures in people with epilepsy.) In addi- tion, hotel facilities should make an effort to individually notify disabled individuals of emer- gency situations and help them exit the facility if required. Another significant communication barrier that disabled people face involves information exchange, says the House and Senate committee reports on the ADA. One of the cornerstones of our free society, and of equal opportunity and access, is access to time-sensitive print information and news. With the tremendous changes in information technology, federal agencies charged with implementing the ADA will take a special interest in information dissemination and technical assistance programs. 1[534 Who Bears the Cost? The general prohibitions restricting public accommodations from discriminating against people with disabilities apply to any private entity that owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation. This broad language, as noted in section 36.201(a) of the title III rules, covers sublessors and management companies, as well as the landlords and tenants of buildings that house public accommodations. Page 46 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 255 of 290( ( Accessibility and Public Accommodations ~534 Recognizing that both parties may have some measure of legal responsibility to share these burdens, the rules (\u00a736.201(b)) state that landlords and tenants can determine the responsibility for removing readily achievable barriers by lease or other contract. The parties are free to allocate these responsibilities as they choose. One suggested approach is to allocate responsibilities according to the type of space in- volved. For example, a landlord would generally be responsible for making readily achievable changes and providing auxiliary aids and services in common areas and for altering policies, practices or procedures that apply to all tenants. Tenants, on the other hand, would generally be responsible for removing any readily achievable barriers within their premises, as well as provid- ing auxiliary aids or services and modifying policies, as permitted by the landlord, and paying for those changes. For example, in a medical office building, the tenant that operates a doctor's office logically would be responsible for removing furniture or temporary walls within the office, if readily achievable, to permit access. The landlord would be responsible for making readily achievable modifications to the entrance of the building and the common areas, such as installing a ramp or making curb cuts, adding raised or braille lettering to elevator buttons, providing signs with large letters, or lowering lobby telephones. However, if a landlord withholds permission to make architectural changes, then the responsi- bility to remove barriers would fall back on the landlord. While the final rule leaves allocation of responsibilities to lease negotiations, Justice notes that landlords should not be held accountable for discriminatory acts by a tenant. For example, if a restaurant refuses to seat a patron, the restaurant should be held accountable for the discrimina- tory policy, not the landlord. Similarly, the tenant and the landlord share responsibility to modify a \"no pets\" rule to allow service animals to enter the restaurant with a disabled patron. ~535 Tax Credits for Barrier Removal As part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Congress created a new tax credit to assist certain small businesses in complying with the ADA . During the debate over the act, small business groups sought expanded tax credits as a fair exchange for not being exempted from the public accommodations provisions. OBRA '90 gives small business owners an annual tax credit to cover expenses incurred from making their facilities and programs accessible to disabled people. Eligible businesses may claim a tax credit equal to 50 percent of the \"access expenditures\" between $250 and $10,250 they incur to comply with the ADA. Only businesses earning less than $1 million during the taxable year and employing 30 or fewer full-time workers are eligible for the credit. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 47 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 256 of 2901[535 Accessibility and Public Accommodations Specifically, the law allows a business to recover one-half the costs of: removing architectural, communication, physical or transportation barriers that make a business inaccessible; providing qualified interpreters or other effective methods to make aural materials available to hearing-impaired people; acquiring or modifying equipment and devices for disabled individuals; and providing \"other similar services, modifications, materials or equipment.\" The access credit is limited to the taxable year, and unused portions from one year cannot be carried over to the next. It does not apply to costs incurred from new construction. Existing tax deduction reduced OBRA '90 reduced from $35,000 to $15,000 an existing tax deduction which all businesses can take to cover the costs of removing architectural barriers from their facilities (Internal Rev- enue Code \u00a7190(c)). This includes changes made to buildings, equipment, walkways, roads and parking lots, and also applies to businesses that make their public transportation vehicles acces- sible to disabled riders. For an expense to be deductible, it must meet standards established by the Internal Revenue Service. In general, the expense must be incurred for removing barriers that: pose a substantial barrier to disabled people; affect at least one major class of disabled people (such as blind, deaf or wheelchair-using people); and are removed without creating new barriers. In addition, for the expense to be deductible, the removal of barriers must conform to de- tailed qualification standards to ensure accessibility. Deductions must be claimed in the year that alterations are made and cannot be claimed for new construction or complete renovation.

Subpart D of the Justice Department's title III regulations (\u00a736.401(a)) addresses new construc- tion and alterations. It requires public accommodations and commercial facilities that will be ready for first occupancy after Jan. 26, 1993, to be designed and constructed so that they are \"readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities\" (see ~541), unless an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to do so. Section 36.406 cites the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG -see ~560 and Appendix IV) developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board as standards that should be followed for accessible new construction. \"Commercial facilities\" are defined in \u00a736.104 as facilities that are intended for non-residen- tial use and whose operations will affect commerce. Commercial facilities would include ware- houses and office buildings used only by employees, as opposed to public accommodations, which are open to the public. Structures subject to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended, aircraft and certain railroad cars and locomotives are specifically excluded from the definition. This part of the law is purposefully broad to ensure that all new facilities built are accessible to all individuals. For example, office buildings, factories and other places where employees will work come within the scope of this section. Over time, accessibility will become the rule, not the exception. A new facility is subject to subpart D if the last application for a building permit or permit extension is certified to be complete (or received) by a state or local government after Jan. 26, 1992, and if the certification for first occupancy is issued after Jan. 26, 1993 (\u00a736.401 (a)(2)(i-ii) ). Anticipatory discrimination The ADA provides remedies to a disabled person who has \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that he or she is about to be subjected to discrimination in new construction (\u00a7308(a)(l)) . This would apply if a disabled person discovered that the plans for a new covered facility (e.g., a medical complex) did not include any accessible features (e.g., elevators, ramps to entrances, visual fire alarms). See \u00a736.50l(a) of the title III rules, which includes the provisions for preven- tive relief in cases of anticipatory discrimination, and Tab 600, which discusses in general the ADA's enforcement and penalties provisions. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 55 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 258 of 2901[541 Accessibility and Public Accommodations ~541 \"Readily Accessible to and Usable by Individuals with Disabilities\" The phrase \"readily accessible to and usable by\" has been applied in the Architectural Barri- ers Act of 1968, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. It is also included in the standards used by federal agen- cies and private industry: the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for buildings and facilities. Essentially, the Justice Department notes in the preamble to the title III regulations, the term means that patrons and employees of public accommodations and commercial facilities must be able to approach, enter and use the facility easily and conveniently. It does not necessarily require every part of every area of a facility to be accessible, but it does require a high degree of accessibility, including access to a primary entrance, parking areas, accessible routes into and from the facility, usable bathrooms and water fountains, and access to the goods, services and programs of the facility. For a store, this means that patrons can reach the store, enter it, and reach the areas where goods are sold. For employees, the same degree of access is required to allow a path of travel around the work area and adequate space to use office furniture and equipment. A facility that is constructed to meet the ADAAG standards will be considered to comply with the rule. However, a private entity, through its policies or practices, could render an other- wise \"accessible\" building inaccessible and thus violate section 302 of the ADA. For example, if the only accessible entrance were open only during limited hours, or if a wheelchair user were required to get a special key to operate a lift, people needing those services would be restricted in violation of the ADA . Similarly, it would violate the ADA to limit a person in his or her choice of a range of hotel or restaurant accommodations. The ADA does not require all bathroom stalls or parking spaces to be accessible, but it does require that a reasonable number of such facilities be accessible, depending on factors such as their use, location and number. For example , ADAAG requires that a certain percentage of check-out lanes in a supermarket be wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs. (Examples of ADAAG scoping requirements for specific situations are provided in Figure 541-A.) However, the House and Senate committee reports that accompanied the ADA (Sen. Rpt. 101-116, p. 69; H. Rpt. 101-485, Part 2, p. 118) point out that when the facilities involved do not serve identical functions, then each facility must be made accessible. Individual workstations need not be constructed to be accessible or be outfitted with fixtures to make them accessible . Modifications such as this would be required as a form of reasonable accommodation to the needs of a specific individual with a disability who applies for a specific job, and would be governed by the undue hardship standard (see ~251). Page 56 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 259 of 290~541 Accessibility and Public Accommodations However, the ADAAG standards require all employee work areas to be constructed so that individuals with disabilities can approach, enter and exit the area. Further, employee lounges, cafeterias and other common areas must meet the accessibility requirements. For instance, in building a hotel, the act requires full access to the public and common-use areas. All doors and doorways must allow passage into and within all hotel public rooms and public bathrooms for individuals in wheelchairs. Similarly, a percentage of each class of rooms must be accessible, and should include grab bars in baths and at toilets, as well as accessible counters. Hotels must also install audio loops in meeting areas, emergency flashing lights and alarms, braille or raised letter words and numbers in elevators, and handrails on stairs or ramps (Sen. Rpt. 101-116, p. 70; H. Rpt. 101-485, Part 2, p. 118). The act does not mandate that unusual spaces such as catwalks and furnace rooms be made accessible. Because it is always less expensive to make a new building accessible than to modify it later, public accommodations are urged to give consideration in new construction to placing fixtures and equipment at a convenient height for accessibility if it would not affect the usability or enjoyment by the public. Congress recognized the ease with which accessibility can be accomplished in the design and construction stages and did not limit the accessible new construction provisions to commercial facilities of any specific size or with any specific number of employees. The rationale for this is that small businesses can grow into large ones, or property might later be leased or sold to a larger covered entity. Commercial facilities in private residences Section 36.401 (b) of the regulations applies to commercial facilities that are located in private residences. Just as public accommodations located in private residences are subject to the new construction and alterations requirements, newly constructed areas for use exclusively as a commercial facility, or for use as both a commercial facility and a private residence, are also required to be accessible. This includes areas used to enter the commercial facility, such as the front sidewalk and doorway, hallways, bathrooms, and any other areas used by employees or visitors (\u00a736.40l(b)(2)). ~542 Exceptions Section 36.104 of the rules exempts the following types of structures and facilities from the definition of \"commercial facilities\": residential structures subject to the Fair Housing Act of ( ( 1968 (42 U.S.C. \u00a73601-\u00a73631), aircraft or railroad rolling stock covered in Section 242 of the ( Page 58 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 260 of 290( Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~542 ADA, and railroad rights of way. Also, Section 304(c) of the Act specifically exempts historical or antiquated rail cars or stations. The ADA' s provisions affecting rail cars and stations are discussed more fully in Tab 400. Structural impracticability Section 36.401(c) provides an exemption from the new construction requirements to entities that can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to make a new building fully accessible. Congress intended this narrow exception to apply only in those rare circumstances where the terrain poses unique building problems, such as a building constructed on stilts. This is consistent with the provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, which has a similar narrow exemption for special site considerations. In the preamble to the title III regulations, the Justice Department specifically excludes hilly terrain or areas with steep grades from this section. However, if a new facility cannot be made entirely accessible, the portions that can be made accessible must comply (\u00a736.401(c)(2)). Thus, a building on stilts (due to marshland terrain), while unable to be ramped or at grade level for people with mobility impairments, could still be accessible to vision- or hearing-impaired people (\u00a736.401(c)(3)). ( Elevators Elevators do not need to be installed in buildings that have fewer than three stories or have less than 3,000 square feet per story (\u00a736.410(d)). Thus a two-story office building is not re- quired to install an elevator even if it has 5,000 square feet per floor. Similarly, a five-story office building with 2,800 square feet on each floor qualifies for the exemption. Shopping centers, shopping malls and professional offices of a health care provider are not entitled to the elevator exemption, even if they fall within the space requirements. Shopping centers and malls are defined in the rules (\u00a736.40l(d)(ii)) as a building with five or more sales or rental establishments or a series of buildings on a common site with five or more sales or rental establishments. Additionally, public transportation stations and airport passenger terminals must have eleva- tors (\u00a736.401(d)(2)(ii)). All common areas in these terminals or stations that are open to the public must be located on an accessible route from an accessible entrance. Although certain facilities are specifically exempt from the elevator requirement, this exemption does not limit their obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements under the ADA (\u00a736.401(d)(3)). And if an entity installs an elevator, the elevator must meet accessibility standards. [The next page is Tab 500, Page 65.] \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

(Section 36.402(a)(2) of the Justice Department's title III rules specifies that physical alterations which begin after that date will trigger the requirement). The provision does not require alterations; it applies only when \"a facility is altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of an establishment\" (\u00a7303(a)(2) of the act). The title III rules (\u00a736.402(b)) define this as \"a change to a public accommodation or commercial facility that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or any part thereof.\" This includes \"remodel- ing, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions\" (\u00a736.402(b)(l)) . Alterations such as installing new floors, relocating electri- cal outlets or plumbing controls, replacing heating systems that requires other changes, and relocating or replacing door and other hardware would trigger the requirement if they affect the usability of the facility. Minor remodeling or redecorating changes such as painting or papering walls, replacing ceiling tiles, re-roofing, normal maintenance, asbestos removal, changes to mechanical systems, and other similar modifications that do not affect the usability of the facility do not trigger the access requirements (\u00a736.402(b)(l)). This view is consistent with requirements under the Reha- bilitation Act and Architectural Barriers Act (see ~ 121 ). Each element or area that is altered must comply with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG -see ~560 and Appendix IV). If full compliance with this part is impossible, the facility must provide the maximum feasible accessibility (\u00a736.403(c)). Any altered parts or features of the facility that can be made accessible must be made so. For example, it may be impossible to make alterations accessible to people who use wheelchairs, but not for people with visual impairments. \"Anticipatory\" discrimination The ADA provides remedies to a disabled person who has \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that he or she is about to be discriminated against regarding renovations of existing public accommodations or commercial facilities. This would apply if a disabled person discovered that a \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

The title III rules (\u00a736.403(b)) define primary function as \"a major activity for which the facility is intended.\" Areas covered by this include customer service lobbies, dining areas, meet- ing rooms and viewing galleries, as well as other offices and work areas where the activities of the public accommodation or entity are carried out. The concept is similar to the Uniform Fed- eral Accessibility Standards (section 3.5) provision addressing \"the rooms or spaces in a building or facility that house the major activities\" (Appendix IV). Alterations that affect the usability of a primary function include remodeling a merchandise display or employee work areas in a department store, replacing inaccessible flooring in the customer service or employee work areas of a bank, redesigning the assembly line area of a factory, or installing a computer center in an accounting firm (\u00a736.403(c)(l)). Path of travel If these types of alterations are made to a primary function area, the \"path of travel\" require- ments are triggered. For example, if a shoe store located in a shopping center completely remodels its display and customer service area, it would have to make the path of travel leading to the area accessible. However, a tenant's alterations do not trigger path of travel obligations for a landlord - the requirement would not extend to the rest of the mall (unless that, too, was being altered). Section 36.403(e) of the rules defines path of travel as: a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which an altered area may be approached, entered, used, and exited; and which connects an altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. This may include walks and sidewalks, pedestrian ramps (including curb ramps) clear floor paths through lobbies, halls, rooms, and other areas, parking access aisles, elevators, or a combi- nation of these items. It is analogous to the \"accessible route\" and \"circulation path\" concepts in UFAS (section 3.5). For purposes of the ADA, \"path of travel\" also includes rest rooms, tele- phones and drinking fountains that serve altered areas (\u00a736.403(e)(3)). As an example of how the primary function standard might apply, it would violate the ADA to alter a bank lobby by installing automated teller machines (ATMs) and fail to make them Page 66 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 263 of 290( ( Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~551 readily accessible to and usable by disabled people. Even though a person with a disability could conduct business inside the bank, the ATMs provide an additional primary function that must be accessible. Areas that do not contain a primary function might include mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, janitorial closets, employee lounges and locker rooms, entrances and rest rooms. However, a rest room at a roadside rest stop could be considered a primary function of the facility and would have to be accessible (\u00a736.403(b)). ~552 Disproportionate Costs Congress recognized that conforming path-of-travel alterations to accessibility guidelines could produce substantial additional costs, and that in comparison with the total alteration under- taken, the costs could render the requirement unreasonable. Consequently, the ADA (\u00a7303(a)(2)) does not require alterations to the path of travel or the bathrooms, telephones and drinking fountains serving the altered area if they would be \"disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope.\" The Justice Department regulations (\u00a736.403(f)) specify that alteration costs will be consid- ered disproportionate if they exceed 20 percent of the total cost of the alteration. The following can be included in calculating the cost of providing an accessible path of travel: costs of making an entrance and route accessible (ramping, doorway widening); costs of making rest rooms accessible (installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, installing accessible faucet controls); costs of providing accessible telephones; and costs of relocating inaccessible drinking fountains. Even if the cost of meeting the access requirements is disproportionate to the total alteration cost, the commercial facility or public accommodation must still provide whatever accessible features are not disproportionate. The goal is to provide as many of the accessible features as possible without exceeding the \"disproportionate\" limit. Where choices must be made, alterations that provide the greatest use of the facility should be selected (\u00a736.403(g)(2)). For example, an accessible bathroom would have greater priority than an accessible drinking fountain; an accessible entrance is the most important of the path of travel features. Even if the path of travel cannot be made accessible, rest rooms, drinking foun- tains and telephones should be made accessible for individuals with disabilities who can negotiate steps but who may need other features to use the facilities, such as grab bars. Commercial facilities and public accommodations cannot perform a series of small alterations to avoid the access requirements if those alterations could have been performed at the same time. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 67 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 264 of 2901[552 Accessibility in Public Accommodations In that situation, the total cost of the alterations made during the past three years can be consid- ( ered in determining whether the cost of providing an accessible path of travel, restrooms, etc., is disproportionate (\u00a736.403(h)(2)). Only alterations undertaken after Jan. 26, 1992, can be consid- ered in determining whether the cost of providing an accessible path is disproportionate. As with new construction, elevators generally are not required in alterations of facilities with fewer than three stories or less than 3,000 square feet per story, or where the cost to install the elevator would be disproportionate in cost and scope to the cost of the total project (\u00a736.404)). Elevators are required, however, if the building is a shopping center or mall, the professional offices of a health care provider, a terminal, depot or other public transportation station or an airport passenger terminal, unless the cost of installing an elevator is disproportionate to the total cost of the project. 1[553 Who Bears Responsibility for Alterations? Many public accommodations today are operated from leased or rented spaces . Congress considered which of the parties involved in a particular public accommodation should be respon- sible for providing access when alterations are made, recognizing that either the landlord or the tenant may have the legal obligation to ensure accessibility, depending on the contract or other agreement between them (see ~534). For example, under some rental agreements, the tenant may be permitted to make certain alterations to the premises without approval of the landlord. Other contracts might prohibit the tenant from making alterations . In most cases, the landlord has full control over the public and common areas of the facility and is obligated to make those areas accessible. Consequently, the contract or lease usually spells out who has the legal authority for making alterations of rented or leased premises readily accessible. Section 36.403(d) of the rules clarifies that if alterations are made by a tenant to leased premises that would trigger the path of travel requirements, only the entity that is undertaking the renovations or alteration is subject to the accessibility requirements. The example in ~552 of a shoe store that makes alterations to leased premises in a shopping mall applies here as well. The landlord will not be responsible for modifying the path of travel in other areas of the mall unless renovations are also being made to the common areas of the mall. 1[554 Historic Preservation Section 36.405 of the regulations specifies that when alterations are made to properties eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or are designated as historic under state or local law, priority must be given to providing physical access to people with disabilities Page 68 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 265 of 290Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~554 ( by complying with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG -see ~560 and Appendix IV). However, where it is impossible to make a historic property fully accessible without threatening or destroying its historic features, those facilities must still incorporate as many accessible fea- tures into the alterations as possible (\u00a736.405(b)).

The Justice Department incorporated as an appendix the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG), which were developed and issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (A&TBCB). Thus, the ADAAG serve as the standards for accessible design under title III. (The Justice Department's regulations are reprinted in Appendix III of the ADA Compliance Guide, and the ADAAG are reprinted in Appendix IV.) ~561 History of the Accessibility Standards The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 required that any facility designed, constructed, leased or altered by the federal government or with the use of federal funds be accessible to physically disabled people. It authorized the administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration to prescribe standards for the design, construction and alteration of buildings to ensure whenever possible that physically disabled people have ready access to, and use of, such buildings. Under the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1978, the A&TBCB was authorized to issue accessibility guidelines and requirements under the Architectural Barriers Act. These minimum guidelines, known as the Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design (MGRAD), were published Aug. 11, 1982. The MGRAD served as the basis for uniform accessibility standards that were issued in August 1984 by four federal agencies with extensive construction responsibilities -the Depart- ments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development, the General Services Administration and the U.S. Postal Service. These Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) specify the technical design and construction requirements to ensure accessibility in federal and federally supported construction, and are now the accepted standards under the Architectural Barriers Act (see Appendix IV). The UFAS standards meet or exceed the requirements in the A&TBCB 's minimum guidelines and also include features from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for buildings and facilities. The ANSI standard had been the acceptable standard for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally assisted pro- grams and activities. UFAS has, for all practical purposes, replaced ANSI as the section 504 standard. \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

Sections 1-3 contain general provisions and definitions. Section 4 contains the scoping provisions and technical specifications applicable to all covered buildings and facilities, and incorporates most of the illustrations and text of the ANSI standard A 117 .1. Sections 5-:--9 contain special requirements for restaurants, medical facilities, businesses, libraries and lodgings. The ADAAG should be used in conjunction with subpart D of the regulations. A chart is included in \u00a736.406 of the regulations (and reprinted as figure 561-A) to assist users in determining the requirements for a particular facility. ~562 Historic Properties Section 504(c) of the ADA addresses historic properties and adopts by reference Section 4.1. 7 of the UFAS in regard to alterations that will threaten or destroy the historic significance of qualified historic buildings and facilities. The ADAAG follows this section as well. A qualified historic building or facility is defined as a building or facility eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, or deemed as historic under state or local law. For purposes of the ADA, the accessibility provisions of Part 4 of the ADAAG apply to qualified historic buildings or facilities. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation will determine if compliance with the require- ments of ADAAG part 4 (for accessible exterior and interior routes, ramps, entrances, toilets, parking, and displays and sign age) would threaten or destroy the historic nature or significance of a particular building (\u00a74.1.7(1)(b)). This is done on a case-by-case basis. The \"special application provisions\" of ADAAG Section 4.1. 7 (2) can be followed to make accessible alterations if the advisory council makes a written determination that alterations re- quired by part 4 would threaten or destroy a particular historic property. Alterations to buildings on state or local historic registers (but not on the national register) must comply with the minimum requirements in ADAAG Section 4.1.7(2). ~563 Certification of State and Local Building Codes Entities should also consult state barrier-free laws and local building codes when renovating or constructing new facilities. If state standards are more strict than those prescribed by the federal standard, the state standards apply. Information concerning a state's accessibility require- ments can be found by contacting state offices such as the state architect, division of vocational rehabilitation or governor's commission or council on the disabled. (See Tab 700 for a discussion of state disability laws.) \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 77 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 269 of 2901[563 Accessibility in Public Accommodations Under the ADA (\u00a7308(b)(l)(a)(ii)), the U.S. attorney general (after public hearing and con- sultation with the A&TBCB) can certify that state and local building codes meet the accessibility and usability requirements in title III of the act. If a code is certified, compliance with the ADA can be assured simply by meeting the certified code. Certification process Subpart F of the Justice Department's title III regulations spells out in some detail the process states and localities must follow to have their building codes certified as meeting the ADA's accessibility requirements. Under \u00a736.602 of the regulations, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Justice Department has the authority to certify that a state or local building code meets or exceeds the ADA's minimum accessibility requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities. The department will not accept requests for certification until after Jan. 26, 1992. Before filing for certification, a \"submitting official\" (defined in \u00a736.601 as the state or local official responsible for administering a building code and filing a request for certification) must take several initial steps. As outlined in \u00a736.603(b), the official must: (1) provide adequate public notice that the jurisdiction intends to file for certification; (2) make copies of the proposed request available to the public; and (3) hold a hearing locally (on the record, with transcripts, and although not stipulated in the regulations, presumably at an accessible site) to obtain input from the public about the request. Once these steps are taken, the official can submit an application, in duplicate, to the Justice Department. Under \u00a736.603(c), the application must include: the text of the jurisdiction's code, the law creating and empowering the submitting agency, any manuals or technical materials explaining the code, and any formal opinions of the state attorney general or chief local legal official pertaining to the code; any model code or statute on which the local code is based, including an explanation of any differences between the two; a transcript of the public hearing; and any additional information the submitting officer wishes to include. The Justice Department may request additional information as well. Preliminary determinations After receiving an application for code certification from a state or local government, the Justice Department (in consultation with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board) can take either of two initial steps - a preliminary determination of equivalency or a preliminary determination to deny certification. Page 78 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 270 of 290( ( Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~563 If the department decides to give a preliminary certification, it must publish a notice in the Federal Register, giving the public 60 days to provide comments on whether a final certification should be issued (\u00a736.305(a)). The department will then hold a hearing in Washington, D.C., to give people the opportunity to express their opinions on the proposed certification. After all of this information is processed, the department (in consultation with the A&TBCB) will make a final determination on whether or not to approve the application and publish its decision in the Federal Register. The Justice Department can also make a preliminary determination to deny certification (in the notice of denial, the department may offer ways in which the code could be amended to qualify for certification). A jurisdiction denied certification will have 15 days to submit data, views or arguments to support its application. Justice is not required to take further action if the jurisdiction fails to submit any materials, but will review any information that is submitted and make another determination. Effect of certification Certifications are only effective for those features or elements that are both (1) covered by the certified code and (2) addressed by the standards against which equivalency is measured (\u00a736.607). This means, for example, that if children's facilities are not addressed in the ADA standards, and the building in question is a private elementary school, certification will not be effective for parts of the building used by children. And if the ADA regulations address equipment but the local code does not, the building's equipment would not be covered by the certification. Code certification applies only to the edition of the code that is submitted (\u00a736.607(b)). Any subsequent changes made to the code will not be covered by the certification, but the jurisdiction can apply to have the amended portions certified (\u00a736.607(c)). Certifications will not cover instances in which a state or local building official in a jurisdic- tion with a certified code waives a particular accessibility requirement for a new facility. Accord- ing to Justice, \"certification of a code is effective only with respect to the standards in the code; it is not to be interpreted to apply to a state or local government's application of the code.\" Model codes Finally, the regulations (\u00a736.608) address model building codes. Model codes are nationally recognized documents, produced by private entities, that state or local governments use in devel- oping their building codes. States and municipalities typically incorporate model codes, with or without amendments, as their particular standards. Organizations that develop model codes in- clude the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Building Officials and Code Administra- tors International (BOCA) and the Board for the Coordination of Model Codes (BCMC). \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

Because many state and local governments rely on model codes, such guidance will help state and local building officials determine the extent to which their codes meet the ADA's standards.

While this involves the removal of structural barriers (see ~530) so that disabled people have physical access to goods and services, the law goes far beyond that to require that the policies and procedures of places of public accommodations be free of discrimination. Section 36.302 of the Justice Department's title III regulations requires public accommodations to make reasonable modifi- cations in policies, practices or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations. Modifications are not considered reasonable and do not have to be made if they would alter the fundamental nature of the goods or services being provided or if making them would place an undue burden on the public accommodation (see ~573). Taken together, the requirement to modify policies and procedures (see ~ 571) and a require- ment in \u00a736.303 to provide \"auxiliary aids and services\" to remove communication barriers (see ~572) embody the same concept as \"reasonable accommodation\" in the employment setting (see ~250 and ~330) . ~571 Modifications to Policies and Practices The ADA requires places of public accommodation to make \"reasonable modifications\" to their policies, practices and procedures to enable disabled people to have access to all the goods, services and other opportunities they provide, unless those modifications would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the goods or services being provided. Many of these modifications entail simple policy changes, such as: permitting (but not requiring) a mobility-impaired patron of a restaurant or lounge to be served only beverages at a table, even though the facility's policy is to serve customers who are not ordering food only at the inaccessible bar; allowing patrons to produce alternate proof of identity or age, rather than requiring a driver's license, when writing personal checks or purchasing alcoholic beverages; modifying a department store policy to allow a disabled person to be accompanied into a dressing room for assistance; \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.

In addition to these suggested methods, the regulations (\u00a736.302(d)) specifically require stores with check-out aisles to ensure that an adequate number of accessible aisles is kept open during store hours. If this is not possible, the store must change its policies in other ways to provide a comparable level of service for its disabled customers. One possibility would be to allow people in wheelchairs to use the one accessible aisle, normally reserved for express ser- vice, to make all their purchases. Public accommodations are expected to examine their policies, procedures and practices and eliminate barriers to equal program access. They are not, however, required to make modifications to policies that would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the goods and services or that would cause an \"undue burden\" (see ~573). For example, the Justice Department explains in the preamble, a museum would not be required to modify its policy of not allowing patrons to touch delicate works of art for a person who is blind if the touching would threaten the integrity of the work. Nor are public accommodations required to alter inventory to stock special or accessible items that they do not normally carry (\u00a736.307). A bookstore would not be required to stock or order books in braille if it does not do so in the normal course of its business. But it would have to order a braille book if it normally makes special orders for unstocked goods, and if the braille book could be obtained through its normal supplier. A public accommodation is allowed to refer disabled people to other businesses if the cus- tomer is seeking a service it does not normally provide or specialize in (\u00a736.302(b)). For ex- ample, a physician could refer a disabled person to another physician if she would normally refer other, non-disabled patients with the same condition to another physician or if the patient's disability itself raises complications requiring the expertise of a different practitioner (\u00a736.302(b)(2)). Similarly, a drug rehabilitation clinic could refuse to treat a person who was not a drug addict, although it could not refuse to treat a person who is a drug addict simply because the patient tests positive for the HIV virus. Section 36.302(c) of the title III rules requires public accommodations to permit disabled people to be accompanied by a service animal unless to do so would fundamentally alter the Page 86 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 274 of 290( ( Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~571 nature of the goods and services provided or would jeopardize operational safety. This includes guide dogs, signal dogs or any other animals specially trained to guide a person with disabilities. The facility need not, however, make provisions for the supervision or care of the animal, even if the owner and dog are separated. ~572 Auxiliary Aids and Services A public accommodation must provide auxiliary aids and services to disabled people if necessary for the disabled person to use the entity's goods or services (\u00a736.303). However, the auxiliary aids and services would not be required if they would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the goods or services, or if they would result in an undue burden (see ~573). As defined in section \u00a736.303(b) of the regulations, \"auxiliary aids and services\" include: (1) qualified interpreters, notetakers, computer-aided transcription services, written materials, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening devices and systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, closed caption decoders, open and closed captioning, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDDs), videotext displays, or other effective methods of making aurally deliv- ered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments; (2) qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, brailled materials, large print materials or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments; (3) acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; and ( 4) other similar services and actions. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, but provides general guidance on the responsibilities public accommodations face under this section. Entities should consult with the disabled indi- vidual before providing a particular aid or service, because he or she may only require a simple adjustment or aid. The fundamental consideration implicit in this section is a public accommodation's duty to effectively communicate with all its customers, clients, patients or participants who have impaired hearing, vision or speech. In \u00a736.303(c) of the title III regulations, Justice incorporates language from the section 504 regulations that requires appropriate auxiliary aids be furnished where needed to ensure effective communication. The most advanced, expensive technology is not required, as long as effective communication is ensured. For example, providing materials in braille or large print is an option under the ADA. How- ever, a restaurant need not provide braille menus for blind patrons if a waiter or other person could be available to read the menu. Similarly, stores need not make all price tags or books in braille, or lower all shelves so that an individual who uses a wheelchair can reach all the items, \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc. September 1991 Tab 500 Page 87 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 275 of 290~572 Accessibility in Public Accommodations as long as a salesclerk can assist a customer by reading prices and titles or retrieving unreach- able items. In another example, an establishment need not automatically assume that a deaf person needs an interpreter. The deaf person may not know sign language or may prefer the greater privacy afforded by note writing, as opposed to having an interpreter present. Interpreter services involve a cost, whereas note writing does not. Thus, some costs may be avoided by checking with the disabled person. If an interpreter is provided, the interpreter must be qualified to provide interpretive services. This means the interpreter \"is able to interpret effectively, accurately and impartially both recep- tively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary\" (\u00a736.104). It is important to determine whether the communication is effective. For example, note writing may not be effective in a doctor's office, where major issues such as decisions about surgery are discussed, or in a wide range of other areas involving complicated health, legal or financial matters. Yet even in such cases, it is possible that a computer terminal where messages can be exchanged may be an effective means of communication. Not every blind person can read braille. Therefore, audio recordings might be necessary to ' I effectively communicate visually delivered materials. Some equipment or devices may require modifi- ( cation to make them effective for visually impaired persons. For example, a museum that provides audio cassettes and tape players for guided tours of the museum may have to add braille or raised- letter labels to the buttons on some of their tape players so a blind person could operate them. In the preamble to the title III regulations, the Justice Department strongly encourages con- sultation with disabled people to determine what specific auxiliary aids or services they might require. It also emphasized that public accommodations are obligated to secure aids and services that are effective and appropriate where necessary. Public accommodations are not permitted to apply surcharges to people with disabilities to cover the costs of providing these auxiliary aids or services. However, they are allowed to im- pose refundable deposits on items. Auxiliary aids for people with hearing impairments Qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials avail- able to individuals with hearing impairments must be provided under title III. \"Other effective methods\" could include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones that are compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDDs), closed or open captions and decoders (see Figure 572-A). The extent to which public accommodations must provide these auxiliary aids depends on the nature and type of services offered.

Section 36.303(d) of the regulations mandates that such establishments \"make avail- able, upon request, a TDD for the use of an individual who has impaired hearing or a communi- cation disorder.\" Similarly, where entry into a place of public accommodation requires use of a security entrance telephone, a TDD or other effective aid must be provided. Thus hospitals, hotels and other similar establishments must provide TDDs upon request because they offer the opportunity to non-disabled patrons to make outgoing calls on a regular basis. This does not mean, however, that individual retail stores, doctors' offices, or restaurants (or other similar establishments that do not rely as much on telephone contact) must provide TDDs. Hearing-impaired individuals will be able to make inquiries, appointments or reservations at these types of establishments through the relay system to be established under Title IV of the ADA (see ~270). While open-captioning of feature films shown in movie theaters is not required by the ADA, film makers are encouraged to produce and distribute open-captioned versions of films. Theaters are also encouraged to show captioned versions of films on a pre-announced basis. However, Justice points out in the preamble that public accommodations must make information imparted ( through films and slide shows available to people with disabilities. This would include historical ( presentations at museums, places of historical interest, tourist information centers and the like. Captioning is one means of making information accessible to people with disabilities . The regulations (\u00a736.303(b)(3)) contemplate the acquisition and modification of equipment or devices to provide auxiliary aids or services. A hotel conference center may need to provide portable or permanent assistive listening systems. Museums may have to attach brailled adhesive labels to buttons on tape players used for audio-guided tours. The regulations also require hotels, hospitals and other places of lodging that provide televisions in more than five guest rooms to also provide, on request, a means of decoding captions for hearing impaired clients or patients (\u00a736.303(e)). ~573 Undue Burden Auxiliary aids and services must be provided by public accommodations unless it would result in a \"fundamental alteration\" in the nature of the goods and services offered (see ~570) or would create an \"undue burden\" (\u00a736.303(f)). The term \"undue burden\" is similar to the term \"undue hardship\" which is used in the employment-related provisions of Title I of the ADA; this concept is taken from the regulations governing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and is generally defined in the regulations as \"significant difficulty or expense\" (\u00a736.303(a) and \u00a736.303(f)). (See ~251 for a more detailed discussion of these concepts.) Page 90 Tab 500 September 1991 ADA Compliance Guide ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 278 of 290Accessibility in Public Accommodations ~573 ( Essentially, the question of whether providing auxiliary aids or services imposes an \"undue ( burden\" is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Some factors to be considered include (\u00a736.104): ( 1) the nature and cost of the action needed; (2) the overall financial resources of the site(s) involved in the action; the number of persons employed at the site; the effect on expenses and resources, legitimate safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation, including crime prevention, or the impact of the action on the operation of the site; (3) the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site(s) in question to any parent corporation or entity; ( 4) if applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity; the number of employees of the parent corporation or entity; and the number, type, and location of its facilities; and (5) if applicable, the type of operation(s) of any parent corporation or entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of the parent corporation or entity. Even though provision of a particular auxiliary service or aid would be unduly burdensome for the entity, it may still be required to furnish an alternative auxiliary aid, if available, that would not result in such a burden (\u00a736.303(f)). Public accommodations are not required, how- ever, to provide \"customers, clients or participants with individually prescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids, or with services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, toileting or dressing\" (\u00a736.306). As technological advances enhance the options available to individuals with disabilities in the future, public accommodations will be expected to provide auxiliary aids and services that would no longer pose an undue burden.

Local govern- ment officials, particularly those from small cities and towns, face a fast-approaching, federally imposed mandate to make all their programs, facilities and activities-including employment -accessible to dis- abled people. The problem, according to local government interest groups and leaders, is that many small-town officials aren't even aware that the requirement exists. All programs are covered Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act requires public ser- vices to be accessible to disabled people. The law, which becomes effective Jan. 26, 1992, applies to all state and local governments, agencies and departments regard- less of size, and to all programs they offer. Included in this coverage is em- ployment. When the U.S. Justice Department issued its regulations to implement title II last July (see August 1991 Monthly Bulletin), it made clear that state and local IN THIS ISSUE governments cannot discriminate against their disabled employees and job applicants. This means that pub- lic agencies must make all employ- ment practices -from hiring to wages and benefits -accessible to disabled people. They must also pro- vide reasonable accommodations to disabled workers and applicants, unless that would impose an undue financial or administrative hardship. That employment practices would be covered by the ADA was fairly well known among state and local officials when the law was enacted. But what has caught some off-guard is the fact that all govern- ments must comply with the act's employment provisions. Phased-in compliance and exemptions that are available under the act to small pri- vate employers were not extended to small public employers. Non-discrimination in employment Municipal interest groups say local leaders have been surprised, at best, to learn that they would not be entitled to the same considerations given to their small-staffed col- leagues in the private sector. 1 Technical assistance grants announced 2 Self-evaluation revived for public agencies 3 Local governments react to ADA rules THOMPSON PUBLISHING GROUP 1725 K ST. N.W., SUITE 200 The confusion stems in part from a change in how the federal govern- ment decided to treat public sector employment. The ADA (title I) re- quires private employers with 25 or more employees to make their em- ployment practices accessible to disabled people as of July 26, 1992. The effective date for businesses with 15 to 24 employees is July 26, 1994. Businesses with staffs offewer than 15 are exempt. See States, Page 7 Justice announces ADA technical assistance grants winners Fifteen organizations were awarded grants totaling more than $2.6 million to provide technical assistance on the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Justice Depart- ment announced last month. The grantees, representing in- dustry, research and advocacy groups, are charged with develop- ing information to help businesses comply with the ADA, as well as to help disabled people understand their new rights. The projects will 4 See Justice , Page 2 Consumers speak on banking issues WASHINGTON, D.C. 20006 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 280 of 290Justice --------- Continuedfrom Page 1 target certain priority areas, such as lodging, restaurants, health care, day care, law enforcement, and state and local courts. Telephone hotlines, manuals, pamphlets, training courses and videos are among the products to be developed with the money. \"Providing high quality techni- cal assistance in the ADA's early months is critical if we are to achieve our goal of making the ADA's promise of equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities a real- ity while keeping costly litigation at a minimum,\" said Assistant At- torney General John R. Dunne. Grants were awarded to the fol- lowing business groups: the Na- tional Restaurant Association, the Council of Better Business Bureaus Foundation, the Food Marketing Institute, the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Ameri- can Hotel and Motel Association and the Police Executive Research Forum. Disability-related groups to re- ceive grants are: the Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund, the Association for Retarded Citizens, the American Foundation for the Blind/Gallaudet University (National Center for Law and the Deaf), the National Federation for the Blind, the Association of Handi- capped Student Service Programs in Postsecondary Education and the National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems. Eastern Washington University , the Institute for Law and Policy Planning, and the Foundation on Employment and Disability round out the list of grantees. 0 2 ADA revives the self-evaluation for state and local governments One of the first issues state and local governments have to contend with under the ADA is conducting self-evaluations of their programs and policies. A throwback to the general rev- enue sharing days, the self-evalua- tion is intended to help public agen- cies figure out which, if any, of their programs and policies violate the non-discrimination require- ments of the ADA, and then deter- mine ways to correct that. Federal grantees, including revenue shar- ing recipients, were required to con- duct self-evaluations when Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act was being implemented in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Only public entities are required to conduct self-evaluations under the ADA. They must be completed by Jan. 26, 1993. All public entities must do a self-evaluation, although only those with 50 or more em- ployees are required to keep it on file (for three years). Technically, public entities need only assess programs that weren't covered by section 504 or included in original self-evalua- tions. But while not required, pub- lic officials may find it just as prac- tical and easy to take a comprehen- sive approach. \"The department expects that a great many public entities will be re-examining all of their policies and programs,\" the U.S. Depart- ment of Justice says. \"Programs and functions may have changed, and actions that were supposed to have been taken to comply with section 504 may not have been fully implemented or may no longer be effective.\" Conducting a self-evaluation For many communities, conduct- ing the ADA self-evaluation will mean dusting off the old forms from the section 504 days. Other towns and agencies, however, may be new See Self-evaluation, Page 3 Americans with Disabilities Act ADA Compliance Guide The Americans with Disabilities Act ADA Compliance Guide is published monthly by Thompson Publishing Group , 1725 K St. N.W ., Suite 200, Washington, D.C. 20006-1499, (202) 872-4000.

Program Accessibility What'sthe nature of the program (its participants, purpose, general activities)? How do you recruit for or advertise the program? What are the eligibility requirements for the pro- gram? Are any tests required? If so, do they (or could they) discriminate on the basis of disability? Are alternative criteria/methods available that would not have an adverse effect on disabled people? Are accommodations available for any required interview or application form? Program participants What services are available to program partici- pants (i.e., orientations, transportation, housing, coun- seling services, social activities)? Are there any barriers that do or could render these services inaccessible to disabled participants? Are accommodations or auxiliary aids available to help disabled participants overcome barriers? Are program staff aware of non-discrimination policies? If so, how is this communicated? Are program participants aware of non-discrimina- tion policies? If so, how is this communicated? Facilities What facilities are used for activities or programs? Based on the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards or ADA Accessibility Guidelines (both reprinted in Appendix IV), what features limit pro- gram accessibility? Is future construction planned, and if so, will accessible design be incorporated into the buildings/ facilities? Are there non-structural means to make programs accessible to overcome inaccessible spaces, provided that equal services are offered in the most integrated setting possible? Are structural changes required to achieve program accessibility? Employment What safeguards are taken to ensure employment decisions are made without discrimination on the basis of disability? Considering every phase of the employment pro- cess and all employment practices, what steps are taken to ensure that disability discrimination does not (or will not) exist? What are the essential functions of a job? What are the marginal functions of a job? What reasonable accommodations have been or can be made in a particular position to ensure that a qualified disabled person can perform the essential functions? Are medical exams required for entering employ- ees? (Under the ADA, pre-employment exams may be given only on a post-offer, conditional basis, and must be given to all incoming employees in that position -see ~324.) D Local government officials discuss readiness for ADA compliance Beginning Jan. 26, 1991, all state and local gov- ernments must make all of their programs and ser- vices accessible to disabled people. Many of these jurisdictions are at least aware of the basic changes which will need to be made come January. But many others -especially the smaller communities - weren't subject to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or have not had to comply for several years. For them, the new ADA mandates may presage trouble. Officials from three governments of small cities agreed that, for the most part, small-town America might not yet be ready to comply with the ADA. Warner Robins, Ga. Roy T. Bankston, program coordinator for Warner Robins, Ga., said ADA compliance for his city, which has a population of 70,000 should prove to be no problem. He plans to be part of a committee that will perform the ADA self-evaluation. \"Since we've done them once already [under sec- tion 504], there should be no problem going over them again, I hope,\" he said. \"There are a few things which will be different, such as needing a TDD phone system, and taking a look at swimming pools.\" See Small town, Page 4 November 1991 ADA Compliance Guide 3 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 282 of 290Small town Continued from Page 3 Bankston said that Warner Robins is well prepared for the administrative changes mandated by title II, but cautioned that he believes not all cities are in the same state of readiness, due to a lack of awareness of the new law's scope. \"We try to stay on top of things as they happen,\" he said. \"Most of our changes, since section 504, are planned, programmed, in the works, or done. I'm sure ifl were a smaller city, I'd be ticked off.\" Schaumburg Township, Ill. Gerry Bartnicke, the director of disabled services for Schaumburg Township, Ill., agreed that many cities are not ready to implement title II simply because they are unaware that the law will affect them. Bartnicke started a disabled advocacy division of the Township Officials of Illinois in 1984, which gives yearly seminars on various aspects of disability policy administration. Notably, she said, attendance at a recent seminar on how to comply with ADA was low. \"When we try to tell them how cheap and easy it is to implement an advisory council, for example, atten- dance is low,\" Bartnicke said. \"What their priorities are, I don't know. \"I think a great deal of the very small governments take an attitude of 'We take care of our own, so don't worry about it,\"' she said. \"I don't see any progressive thinking toward people with disabilities, or any promo- tion of accessible housing or employment.\" In addition, a dearth of state and local funds will hamper local efforts to comply with title II, she said. Springville City, Utah A lack of governmental knowledge about the scope of the new law is \"frightening,\" said Richard Manning, city recorder for Springville City, Utah. \"Not many people talk about it, because they are unaware of the law. They won't realize anything is amiss until there's a lawsuit, and then there will be a great deal of catching up\" on the part of local government, he said. Manning said that the city has complied with section 504, and is gearing up for ADA compliance. Manning believes that the most difficult facet of ADA compliance for small government will be attitu- dinal change. \"If they hire a secretary who uses a wheelchair, and they have six-foot high filing cabinets, then they're going to need to step back and be creative,\" he said. \"The biggest hardship is going to be the mental hurdles that will need to be crossed.\" D A consumers' perspective: Accessing services of a bank In an effort to help readers prepare for the upcoming Jan. 26, 1992 , ADA compliance deadline, we have initiated a series of articles on making certain types of public accommodations accessible-from a consumer ' s perspective. Much of the information in these articles was gathered from a series of \"focus groups\" Thompson Publishing Group held last summer, in which individuals with disabilities discussed their experiences accessing the services of various businesses. Each focus group pulled together a group of consumers with a related type of disability: individuals who are hearing-impaired; individuals who are vision-impaired ; individuals who have mobility impairments; individuals with hidden disabilities; and individuals who have mental impairments . What difficulties do disabled individuals encounter at banks -and what special services, if any, do they need to overcome them? Disabled people encounter barriers in banks at a number of different points -filling out loan applica- tions, cashing checks, working with tellers, using the ubiquitous automated teller machines. But, as our focus group participants pointed out, removing these barriers need not involve expensive, structural changes. Often a simple, open-minded attitude is all it takes for someone to do what he or she needs done. The list below is in large part a product of the focus group. It is not exhaustive, nor does it explain what must be done under the ADA. Rather, these are some readily identifiable problems and possible service-oriented solutions that were proffered during the group discus- sions -from a consumer 's perspective . Access to the Building Problem : Front entrance doors are too heavy and difficult to open for people with mobility or dexterity impairments. Possible solution : Have someone available to help individuals who have difficulty opening the door. If this See Perspective, Page 5 4 ADA Compliance Guide November 1991 ( ( ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 283 of 290( ( Perspective Continued from Page 4 approach is taken, be sure that someone is always on hand to assist customers. Installation of appropriate hardware may also be a possible solution. Problem : Lack of a cleared pathway from the front door to teller and service desks. Possible Solution : Ensure an accessible, obstruc- tion-free path between the bank's entrance and the teller windows, customer service representatives , and other routine services (e.g., safe deposit boxes). Problem: High curbs leading to the bank from the parking area. Possible solution: An informal survey of the \"site,\" including the area around and leading to the entrance to the bank, could be done. Surveys could review all of the ways an individual gets to the bank, e.g., from the street, parking lot, etc. Surveys can help identify if removing any structural barriers is readily achievable and the responsi- bility of the bank. If not, alternative-delivery steps may have to be investigated. Teller Operations Problem: Teller windows are too high for individu- als in wheelchairs to use. Possible solution: Allow individuals who cannot get to or conduct business at a teller counter/window to conduct business at a customer service desk, or in some unobtrusive (fairly private) area of the lobby. Instruct bank personnel to suggest to people who have difficulty conducting business at a teller window that a customer service representative or manager can help them in a different, perhaps more accessible part of the bank. Problem: Glass front and height of teller windows impede communication between people with a variety of speech or hearing impairments and tellers. Possible solution: The same approach used for people with mobility impairments (e.g., conduct busi- ness in a different part of the bank) may be effective for people with speech and hearing impairments. Problem: Blind and visually impaired individuals may not see the light flashing indicating when there is an available teller. Possible solution : Instruct tellers to verbally an- nounce when they are available to help an individual who may not be responding to the flashing light. Problem: Individuals with certain visual impair- ments are unsure about the money that is returned to them after they have completed a transaction. Possible solution: Tellers could be instructed to be precise about counting money back to a customer who is blind or visually impaired. Indicating denominations as bills are being handed to the customer may be helpful. Check Cashing Problem: Requiring proper I.D. to cash checks or open an account. Certain individuals with disabilities, such as people with visual impairments or epilepsy , cannot obtain drivers' licenses. Possible solution: Banks could be flexible in their check cashing procedures or policies. For example, if you accept only a driver's license as proper I.D. for check cashing, you may consider modifying that policy to also accept non-driver 's I.D.s (such as age of major- ity cards) that are often provided by local jurisdictions. Problem: Acceptance of only cursive writing signa- tures for check-cashing purposes. Some people have disabilities -sometimes physical, sometimes mental -that affect their ability to write. Printing is often easier for these individuals. Possible solution: Again, flexibility is key. Under certain circumstances, the bank could accept a printed signature as adequate for check-cashing purposes. Problem: Unavailability of braille checking. Possible solution: Offering braille checking is an individual decision for banks. Remember, however, that not all individuals who are blind or visually im- paired read braille. Therefore, making braille checking available may not relieve you of the responsibility to accommodate individuals who need special services because of visual impairments. Banking by Phone Problem: Inability of a deaf person to bank by phone or to make telephone inquiries regarding account information. Possible solution: The bank may consider purchas- ing a telecommunication device for the deaf (TDD). If you take this route, be sure to publicize your TDD number, and be sure that the TDD is operated by knowledgable staff. As an interim measure, a deaf or hearing-impaired customer could access your service using a telephone relay service. However, because of the nature of bank business , there might be some secu- rity concerns with using a third-party to conduct such business. Also, relay services frequently are slow and not yet available in all states. Problem: Banking by phone was found to be a popular method of banking by persons with visual impairments, but it is not available at all banks. See Banking, Page 6 November 1991 ADA Complian ce Guide 5 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 284 of 290Banking Continued from Page 5 Possible solution: Banks may wish to consider offer- ing some or more services to customers via the telephone. Transaction Forms and Other Printed Material Problem: Inability of persons with visual or manual impairments to complete transaction forms. Possible solution: Availability of a customer assis- tance representative to help individuals complete the necessary forms (e.g., deposit/withdrawal slips, etc.) as necessary. Problem: Lack of accessible material for visually impaired people that explains the array of services offered by the bank. Possible solution : Banks could consider making information on the bank's services available on tape. If taped text is provided, be sure to advertise it. Also, telephone representatives could be instructed to inform callers who identify themselves as being unable to read the printed material about the availability of taped services. ATMs Problem: Although many individuals who are blind and visually impaired can and do use A TMs, some expressed an interest in having a bank representative take the time to show them the first time how to use the machine and explain to them the series of procedures, questions asked, and default settings on its ATMs. Possible solution: By request, the bank could con- duct training sessions on using its A TMs for individuals with special needs. Be sure to advertise the availability of such sessions. Perhaps this could be done when an individual opens a new account and receives a first A TM card with the bank. Another approach is to make instruc- tions on using the ATM available on tape or in braille. Problem: Certain individuals with mental disabili- ties cannot easily remember an assigned PIN number. Possible solution: Banks could adopt a policy that would allow some individuals to choose their own PIN number. In this way, individuals who may otherwise have difficulty remembering such a number could choose a combination of numbers that would be more easy for them to remember. Privacy/Confidentiality Problems: Because of the nature of the business being transacted, certain hearing-impaired participants expressed concern about fully understanding all that is involved with a complicated transaction, such as obtaining a mortgage. Possible solution : Lending officers could be in- structed to take the time to communicate effectively with deaf and hearing-impaired individuals. To many non-bankers, the terminology and procedures used in certain banking transactions are unfamiliar. For this reason, it is usually important for the customer to understand precisely what is taking place during meet- ings with the loan officer. Paper and pencil would likely not be an effective means of communicating with such individuals. Ascertain if interpreter services are needed. If the customer is a hp reader, be sure to position yourself directly in front of the person when you are speaking. The bank may also wish to try to have as much information as possible about the transaction available in writing ahead of time and allow the individual to take the information home for review prior to an important meeting. Attitudinal Training Perhaps the overarching concern -and suggestion -that emerged from the focus groups was that of \"sensitizing\" employees who deal with customers about the possible special needs of disabled people. A cus- tomer service representative -or any bank personnel -could be trained to approach disabled individuals and ask if special help is needed. Tellers, for example, could be instructed to assist customers with special needs as appropriate, and when the necessary assistance is beyond their abilities, to politely refer the person to a customer service representative who can better satisfy his or her needs at the time. Banks should remember that disabled people may not need any special assistance, and thus such assis- tance should not be forced on anyone by bank staff. What sort of special assistance is used by one individual may not be needed, or indeed appropriate, for another individual. Such things must be approached on a case- by-case basis. Instituting some customer service training on the ADA could also serve to smooth over some attitudinal barriers that may exist toward people with disabilities. This is especially true for people with hidden disabili- ties, or whose disability is not readily apparent, but who may need some special services to conduct his or her banking. Contacting individuals with disabilities from the community to assist in this effort could be one approach to take.

November 1991 xiii This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 289 of 290( ( Introduction and Overview ~150 ~150 State and Local Governments *The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) affects all state and local governments, regardless of size. Exemptions and grace periods given to small business owners are not extended to state and local governments in their capacity as operators of a public facility. In addition, U.S. Justice Department regulations implementing title II of the act (28 C.F.R. Part 35) provide that exemptions for small private employers do not apply to state and local governments as employers (see ~~303 and 370). The ADA makes some significant changes regarding federal non-discrimination requirements on state and local governments. The law imposes its non-discrimination mandate on all programs and activities of all governments, whether or not they receive federal funds. State and local governments that receive federal grants are required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to make their programs and facilities accessible to the disabled. During the revenue-sharing era of the 1970s and early 1980s, most local governments were subject to section 504 because they received federal funds under the Revenue Sharing Act. After the act was repealed, many small towns, which did not receive any other federal aid, lost their federal nexus and thus were no longer subject to section 504' s requirements. No immunity against suit States may not claim an 11th Amendment immunity against lawsuits filed under the ADA. The law provides the same remedies for actions brought against private entities in suits filed against states (see ~620). Finally, the ADA does not limit or invalidate any state or local disability rights law that pro- vides greater protection for disabled people. The ADA applies to situations in which the state or local law has less stringent requirements. (See ~700 for a discussion of state disability discrimina- tion laws.) *Indicates new or revised material. [The next page is Tab 100, Page 75.] \u00a9Thompson Publishing Group, Inc.
