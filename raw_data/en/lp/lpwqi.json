O-5 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection vi What's New in the Guidelines Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) has reviewed the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection and revised the text and references where indicated . Key updates are summarized below. April 11, 2022 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved long -acting injectable cabotegravir and ril pivirine (Cabenuva) for use in children and adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg. This change has been incorporated in the Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine drug sections; other sections have not been updated yet. The Panel has not made revisions to address the recent FDA approval of the dispersible table f ormulation of ( Triumeq PD ) for use in children weighing 1 0 kg to 25 kg; this will be addressed in a future update. Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection Some updates were made for clarification and to align content in bulleted recommendations, text, and Table 5. Sample Schedu le for Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Children Before and After Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy. Some experts would consider monitoring HgbA1C in children at risk for prediabetes/diabetes , rather than routine blood glucose. The Panel added a st atement to point out that periodic measurements of body weight \u2014important for dose modification in the rapidly growing infant and to monitor for excessive weight gain as a possible adverse effect of some antiretroviral (ARV) drugs \u2014are not possible with tele medicine visits. The Panel also noted that children with HIV who are relocating from outside the United States may benefit from thyroid function studies and additional evaluations , such as screening for tuberculosis, gastrointestinal parasites, hepatitis infection, and lead level. What to Start: Regimens Recommended for Initial Therapy of Antiretroviral- Naive Children The Panel has updat ed its recommendations for several drugs following recent FDA approvals of new pediatric dosing strength formulations for disoproxil fumarate (DOR/FTC/TDF, Delstrigo) for pediatric use. o The Panel now recommends BIC/FTC/TAF as a Preferred integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI )-based regimen for child ren aged 2 years and weighing 14 kg (AI*) . Previously, this regimen was limited to use in children aged 6 years and weighing 25 kg. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection vii o DOR plus a two -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone is now recommended as an Alternative non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- based regimen for children and adolescents weighing 35 kg (BI*). The Panel 's recommendation is supported by data from studies that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of this drug in adults, as well as early findings from pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) st udies. DOR is also available in a FDC tablet as DOR/FTC/TDF (Delstrigo). o FTC/TAF (Descovy) is recommended as a Preferred dual -NRTI combination in children and adolescents weighing 14 kg when used with an INSTI or NNRTI. Use of Descovy with an INSTI or NNRTI was previously limited to children weighing 25 kg. The Panel recommen ds abacavir (AB C) plus lamivudine (3TC) or F TC as a Preferred dual -NRTI combination in children aged 3 months (AI) and now recommends it from birth in full -term infants aged <3 months (BIII) . A negative test for the HLA -B5701 allele should be obtained before start ing ABC, regardless of age . Previously, the Panel recommended ABC for infants aged 1 month. The Panel changed its recommendation based on PK modeling of neonatal ABC dosing to target adult plasma ABC exposures and on observational data supporting safety of ABC in full -term neonates aged <1 month. A n ABC dosing recommendation based on PK simulation models has been endorsed by the World Health Organization using weight -band dosing for full -term infants from birth to 1 month of age. The FDA has approved ABC for use in children aged 3 months. What Not to Start: Regimens Not Recommended for Use in Antiretroviral-Naive Children The section text an d Table 9. Antiretroviral Regimens or Components That Are Not Recommended for Initial Treatment of HIV Infection in Children and Adolescents have been updated to inc lude two-drug ARV regimens , as well as three drugs that are not FDA approved for use in ARV -naive children or a dults: ca botegravir, fostemsavir, and ibalizumab. Any ARV regimen containing both TDF and TAF has been added to Table 10. Antiretroviral Regimens or Components That Are Never Recommended for Treating HIV in Children and Adolescents . Special Considerations for Antiretroviral Therapy Use in Adolescents with HIV This section has been updated t o include additional content about substance use concerns in adolescents . Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV This section has been revised to provide recent data about the following adherence interventions: smartphone -based reminders , peer support interventions , modified directly administered ARV therapy, and a multicomponent intervention\u2014 including remote coaching, electronic dose monitoring, and tailored outreach. Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance The Tables for Antiretroviral Therapy-Associated Adverse Effects and Management have been updated. Recommendations have been reviewed with updates regarding associated ARVs, onset Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection viii and clinical manifestations, estimated frequency, risk factors, prevention and monitoring, and management where indicated. o Table 15a.

Ras h and Hypersensitivity Reactions Man agement of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy The sections on Modifying Antiretroviral Regi mens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy and Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure have been updated to incorpora te the most recent ARV options based on recent FDA approvals of drugs for pediatric use and changes to Panel recommendations for the use of ARV drugs . This information is summarized under the headings for What to Start: Regimens Recommended for Initial Therapy of Antiretroviral -Naive Children A: Pediatric Antire troviral Drug Information . Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information Drug sections and FDC Table 1 and Table 2 in this appendix were reviewed and updated to include recent pediatric data and dosing and safet y information, plus FDA approval s of new formulations and FDCs. Significant changes are summarized below: Although ABC is not approved by the FDA for use in infants aged <3 months, the Abacavir section has been updated to include a dosing recommendation for full -term infants aged <1 month. The Panel's recommendation is based on data from PK modeling of neonatal ABC dosing to target adult plasma ABC exposures and on observational data supporting safety of ABC in full -term neonates aged <1 month. The Panel has also revised its previous dosing recommendation for full -term infants aged 1 month to <3 months based on modeling data provided by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) P1106 study and two observational cohorts. The Bictegravir , Emtricitabine , and Tenofovir Alafenamide sections have been updated to incorporate FD A approval of a new pediatric dosing strength for Biktarvy (BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg) for use in children aged 2 years and weighing 14 kg to <25 kg. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection ix The Emtricit abine and Tenofovir Alafenamide sections have been updated to incorporate FDA approval of a new pediatric dosing strength for Descovy (FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg) for use in children weighing 14 kg to <25 kg. The Doravirine , Lamivudine , and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate sections have been updated following the FDA approval of DOR and the FDC tablet DOR/3TC/TDF (Delstrigo) for use in children and adol escents weighing 35 kg who are ARV -naive or have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to DOR or to the individual components of Delstrigo. The Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine sections have been revised to incorporate the FDA approval of the long -acting injectable regimen, Cabenuva (co-packaged cabotegravir [CAB] and rilpivirine [RPV] suspensions), for treatment of HIV in children and adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg with HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL on a stable ARV regimen, no history of treatment failure, and no known or suspected resistance to CAB or RPV. The FDA has also approved the oral formulation of CAB (Vocabria) for this group of children and adolescents. Oral lead-in dosing of CAB and RPV is now an option, rather than a requirement, when starting Cabenuva; patients may proceed to Cabenuva directly from their current ARV regimen. In the Efavirenz (EFV) section, t he Panel has added a recommend ation to measure vitamin D in children receiving EFV and to prescribe vitamin D supplementation for those with vitamin D deficiency (see Table 15j. Osteopenia and Osteoporosis for additional information). This recommendation is based on studies in adults showing that use of EFV is associated with low vitamin D levels , as well as studies that have found an association between EFV use and low bone mineral density. Some text was removed from the Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) section to clarify that the Panel does not endorse use of LPV/r in neonates before a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days due to the risk of metabolic and cardiac toxicity. The Panel has revised the Nevirapine (NVP) section to include dosing recommendations for preterm infants at a gestational age of 32 weeks to <34 weeks based on review of PK modeling and simulation data. This dosing strategy has not been evaluated in clinical trials and is not approved by the FDA. Previously, the Panel 's dosing recommendations for preterm inf ants were limited to a gestational age of 34 weeks to <3 7 weeks.

Note that the guidelines developed by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents are suitable for the care and management of adolescents in late puberty (SMR s 4-5) . The Pediatric Guidelines also include recommendations for managing adverse events that are associated with the use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in children and a detailed review of information about the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of ARV agents in children. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) , a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC), reviews new data on an ongoing basis and regularly updates the guidelines. The guidelines are available on the Clinical Info website. The Clinical Info website also provide s separate guidelines for the following: The prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) in children who were exposed to HIV and childre n with HIV infection1; The use of ARV drugs in adolescents and adults with HIV2; The use of a ntiretroviral d rugs during pregnancy and i nterventions to r educe p erinatal HIV transmission in the United States3; The prevention and treatment of OIs in adolescents and adults with HIV4; and Other federally approved medical practice guidelines for HIV/AIDS are available , including HIV Counseling, Testing, and Referral; Hormonal Contraception; Laboratory Testing; Prevention and Caring for Persons with HIV in Disaster Areas. In 2020, G uidance for COVID -19 and Persons with HIV was added. These guidelines are developed for the United States and may not be applicable in other countries. The World Health O rganization provides guidelines for resource -limited settings . The Pediatric G uidelines and the Perinatal Guidelines contain some closely related content that can overlap. To ensure that information is consistent across the guidelines and that users can easily find the information they need, the Panels that publish these two sets of guidelines have developed a process to jointly produce sections for shared content areas. Th e development of th ese sections is led by a group composed of members from both Panels ; the sections are discussed separately and voted on by each full Panel. J ointly produced sections include \u2014 Maternal HIV Testing and Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-2 Since the guidelines were first developed in 1993 (with the support of the Fran\u00e7ois -Xavier Bagnoud Center, Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey), a dvances in medical management have dramatically reduced both the number of new pediatric HIV infections and the morbidity and mortality in children with HIV in the United States. The widespread use of ARV drugs in pe ople with HIV during pregnancy and the use of ARV prophylaxis in infants who have been exposed to HIV have reduced the annual rate of perinatally acquired HIV infection5,6 from a peak of 43.1 per 100,000 births in 1992 to 0.8 per 100,000 births in 2019. Racial and ethnic disparities are evident in annual rates of new perinatal infection; in 2019, perinata l infections occurred in Black or African American infants (2.9 per 100,000 births) at annual rates of 5 and 10 times that of Hispanic /Latin x (0.6 per 100,000 births ) and White infants (0.3 per 100,000 births ), respectively .5 Since the introduction of ART, m ortality in children with perinatal HIV infection has decreased by about 90%, and the incidence of OIs and other infections in these children has significantly declined.7,8 Children with HIV are less likely to develop AIDS because of routine and early in itiation of effective ART.9-11 ARV drug-resistance testing has made it easier for clinicians to choose effective initial and subsequent regimens. T reatment strategies focus on timely initiation of AR V regimens th at are capable of maximally suppressing viral replication, which can prevent disease progression, preserve or restore immunologic function, and prevent the development of drug resistance. In addition, the availability of new drugs and drug formulations has led to more potent regimens with lower toxicity, lower pill burden, and less frequent medication administration\u2014 all factors that can improve adherence and outcomes. However, delays in the development and testing of pediatric formulations continue to limit the availability of optimal AR V regimens for children, especially infants.12 Children with HIV in the U nited S tates are increasingly born outside the United States13; they may be members of immigrant families or they may have been adopted by U .S. residents . These children may have non- B subtypes of HIV , incomplete medical and treatment histories, an increased risk of tuberculosis and other infections that are endemic in their countries of origin, and legal and psychosocial needs related to immigration. Finally, as children with HIV grow older, new challenges arise related to adherence, drug resistance, reproductive health planning, transition to adult medical care, and the potential for long-term complications from HIV and its treatments.11,14,15 The pathogenesis of HIV infection and the virologic and immunologic principles underlying the use of ART are generally similar for all individuals with HIV. However, unique considerations exist for infants, children, and adolescents with HIV, including\u2014 Acquisition of infection through perinatal exposure for most children with HIV; In utero and neonatal exposure to ARV drugs in most children with perinatal HIV infection16; The n eed to us e HIV virologic tests to diagnose perinatal HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months; Age-specific interpretations of CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts; Higher plasma viral loads in infants with perinatal HIV infection than in adolescents and adults with nonperinatal HIV infection; Age-related changes in PK parameters that are caused by the continuing development and maturation of organ systems involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance17; Differences in the clinical manifestations and treatment of HIV in growing, immunologically immature individuals; and Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-3 Special considerations associated with adherence to ARV treatment in infants, children, and adolescents. The care of children with HIV is complex and evolv es rapidly as results of new research are reported, new ARV drugs are approved, and new approaches to treatment are recommended. As new drugs become availabl e, a critical need exists for clinical trials that define appropriate drug doses and identify possible toxicities in infants, children, and adolescents. As additional ARV drugs are approved and optimal strategies for the use of these drugs in children become better understood, the Panel will modify these guidelines. The recommendations in these guidelines are based on the current state of knowledge regarding the use of ARV drugs in children. Evidence is drawn primarily from published data regarding the treatment of HIV in infants, children, adolescents, and adults; however, when no such data are available, unpublished data and the clinical expertise of the Panel members are also considered. These guidelines are only a starting point for medical decision- maki ng and are not meant to supersede the judgment of clinicians who are experienced in the care of children with HIV. Because of the complexity of caring for children with HIV , health care providers with limited experience in the care of these patients should consult a pediatric HIV specialist. The HIV/AIDS Management Clinician Consultation Center is an excellent resource for telephone consultation. The Center can be contacted at 1-800-933 -3413, 9 a .m. to 8 p. m. ET, Monday through Friday . Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development Process Topic Comment Goal of the Guidelines The guidelines p rovide guidance to HIV care practitioners in the United States on the optimal use of antiretroviral ( ARV) agents when treating infants, children, and adolescents in early to mid-puberty (sexual maturity rating [SMR] 1 -3) with HIV. Panel Members The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) is composed of approximately 3 4 voting members who have expertise in the management of HIV infection in infants, children, and adolescents. Members include representatives from the Committee on Pediatric AIDS of the American Academy of Pediatrics and community representatives with knowledge of pediatric HIV infection (e.g., parents and caregivers of children and youth with HIV) . The Panel also includes at least one representative from each of the following Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) agencies: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A representative from the Canadian P aediatric and Perinatal HIV/AIDS Research Group and a representative from the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine participate as nonvoting, ex o fficio member s of the Panel. The U .S. government representatives are appointed by their respective agencies; nongovernmental members are selected after an open announcement to call for nominations. Each member serves on the Panel for a 3- year term with an option for reappointment. A list of current members can be found in the panel roster . Financial Disclosure All members of the Panel submit a n annual financial disclosure statement in writing, reporting any association with manufacturers of ARV drugs or diagnostics used to manage HIV infections. A list of the latest disclosures is available on the Clinical Info website. Users of the Guidelines Providers of care to infants, children, and adolescents with HIV in the United States Developer Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV\u2014a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC ) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-4 Topic Comment Funding Source Office of AIDS Research, NIH , and HRSA Evidence Collection A standardized review of recent , relevant literature related to each section of the guidelines is performed by a technical assistance consultant (through funding from HRSA) and provided to individual Panel working groups. The recommendations generally are based on studies published in peer -reviewed journals. The Panel may occasionally use unpublished data to revise the guidelines, particularly when the new information relates to dosing or patient safety. These data come from presentations at major conferences or from the FDA and/or drug m anufacturers. Recommendation Grading Described in Table 2 Method of Synthesizing Data Each section of the guidelines is assigned to a small group of Panel members with expertise in the area of interest. The members synthesize the available data and propose recommendations to the Panel. The Panel discusses all proposals during monthly teleconferences. Proposals are modified based on Panel discussion and then distributed with ballots to all Panel members for concurrence and additional comments. If there are substantive comments or votes against approval, the recommended changes and areas of disagreement are brought back to the full Panel (by email or teleconference) for additional review, discussion, and further modification to reach a final version that is acceptable to all Panel members. The recommendations in these final versions represent endorsement from a consensus of members and are included in the guidelines as official Panel recommendations. Other Guidelines These guidelines focus on infants, childr en, and adolescents in early -to-mid-puberty (SMR 1-3) with HIV. Guid elines for the treatment of adolescents in late puberty (SMR 4-5) are provided by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents. Separate guidelines outline the use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) in people who are pregnant or are trying to conceive (including maternal and infant in terventions to prevent perinatal transmission) , ART for nonpregnant adults and postpubertal adolescents with HIV , and ARV prophylaxis for those who experience occupational or nonoccupational exposure to HIV. These and other HIV guidelines are also available on the Clinical Info website. Update Plan The full Panel meets monthly by teleconference to review data that may warrant modification of the guidelines. Smaller working groups of Panel members hold additional teleconferences to review individual drug sections or other specific topics (e.g., What to Start ). Updates may be prompted by new drug approvals (or new indications, formulations, or frequency of dosing), new safety or efficacy data, or other information that may have a significant impact on the clinical care of patients. In the event of significant new data that may affect patient safety, the Panel may issue a warning announcement and post accompanying recommendations on the Clinical Info website until the guidelines can be updated with appropriate changes. All sections of the guidelines ar e reviewed at least once a year, with updates as appropriate. Public Comments A 2-week public comment period follows the release of the updated guidelines on the Clinical Info website. The Panel reviews these comments to determine whether additional revisions to the guidelines are indicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time at Contact Us Basis for Recommendations Recommendations in these guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. Each recommendation includes a letter (A , B, or C ) that represents the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral (I , II, or III) that represents the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-5 When approving drugs for use in children, the FDA often extrapolates efficacy data from adult trials, in additi on to using safety and PK data from studies in children. Because of this, recommendations for use of ARV drugs in children often rely, in part, on data from clinical trials or studies in adults. Because the course of HIV disease and the effects of ARV drugs in pediatric and adult populations are expected to be similar enough to permit extrapolation of adult efficacy data to pediatric patients, it is appropriate to base approval of ARV drugs for children on evidence from adequate and well - controlled investigations in adults if\u2014 Supplemental data exist on the PKs of the drug in children, indicating that systemic exposure in adults and children is similar; and Studies are provided that support the safety of using the drug in pediatric patients.18-20 If a concern exists that concentration-response relationships might be di fferent in children than in adults, then pediatric drug approval should include evidence from studies that relate drug activity to drug levels (pharmacodynamic data) in children . In many cases, the evidence from studies on the use of ARV drugs in adults (e specially from randomized clinical trials) is much more substantial and higher in quality than the available evidence from studies in children. Therefore, for pediatric recommendations, the following rationale has been used when the evidence from studies in children is limited or of lower quality: Quality of Evidence Rating I Randomized Clinical Trial Data Quality of Evidence Rating I will be used if there are data from large randomized trials in children with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints. Quality of Evidence Rating I* will be used if there are high-quality randomized clinical trial data in adults with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints and pediatric data from well - designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with clinical outcomes that are consistent with the adult studies. A rating of I* may be used for quality of evidence if, for example, a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in adults demonstrates that a drug is effective in ARV-naive patients and data from a nonrandomized pediatric trial demonstrate adequate and consistent safety and PK data in the pediatric population. Quality of Evidence Rating II Nonrandomized Clinical Trials or Observational Cohort Data Quality of Evidence Rating II will be used if there a re data from well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohorts in children. Quality of Evidence Rating II* will be used if there are well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with supporting and consistent information from smaller, nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data in children. A rating of II* may be used for quality of evidence if, for example, a large observational study in adults demonstrates a clinical benefit to initiating treatment at a certain CD4 cell count , and data from smaller observational studies in children indicate that treatment initiation at a similar CD4 cell count i s associated with clinical benefit. Quality of Evidence Rating III Expert Opinion The criteria do not differ for adults and children. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-6 In an effort to improve the quality of evidence available to guide the management of HIV infection in children, clinicians are encouraged to discuss participation in trials with children and their caregivers. Information about clinical trials for adults and children with HIV can be obtained from the Clinical Info website or by tel ephone at 1-800-448-0440. Table 2.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-1 Maternal HIV Testing and Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure Updated: Dec.30, 202 1 Reviewed : Dec.30, 202 1 Panel 's Recommendations HIV testing is recommended as a standard of care for all sexually active people and should be a routine component of prepregnancy care (AII) . All pregnant people should be tested as early as possible during each pregna ncy (see Laboratory T esting fo r the Diagnosis of HIV Infection: U pdated R ecommendations and Recommended Laboratory HIV Testing Algorithm for Serum or Plasma Specimens from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) (AII) . Partners of all pregnant people should be referred for HIV testing when their status is unknown (AIII) . Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for pregnant people with negative initial HIV tests who are at increased risk of acquiring HIV, including those receiving care in facilities that have an HIV incidence of 1 case per 1,000 pregnant women per year, those who reside in jurisdi ctions with elevated HIV incidence (see Revised Recommendations for HIV Testing of Adults, Adolescents, and Pregnant Women in Health -Care Settings from CDC) , or those who reside in states or territories that require third- trimester testing (AII) . Repeat HIV testing is recommended for pregnant people with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or with signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection , or ongoing exposure to HIV , as well as referral for initiation of pre -exposure prophylaxis if HIV testing is negative (AIII) . (PrEP) to Prevent HIV During Periconception, Antepartum, and Postpartum Periods for more information. Expedited HIV testing should be performed during labor or delivery for people with undocumented HIV status and for those who tested negative early in pregnancy but are at increased risk of HIV infection and were not retested in the third trimester (AII) . Testing should be available 24 hours a day, an d results should be available within 1 hour . If results are positive, intrapartum antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis should be initiated immediately (AI). Pregnant people who were not tested for HIV before or during labor should undergo expedited HIV antibody testing during the immediate postpartum period (or their newborns should undergo expedited HIV antibody testing ) (AII) . When a pregnant person has a positive HIV test result durin g labor and delivery or postpartum, or when a newborn' s expedited antibody test is positive, an appropriate infant ARV drug regimen should be initiated immediately, and the infant should not be breastfed while awaiting the results of supplemental HIV testing (AII) . See Antiretroviral Management of Newborn s with Perinatal HIV Exposure or Perinatal HIV for guidance. Results of maternal HIV testing should be documented in the newborn 's medical record and communicated to the newborn' s primary care provider (AIII) . HIV testing is recommended for infants and children in foster care and adoptees for whom maternal HIV status is unknown to identify perinatal HIV exposure and possible HIV infection (AIII) (see Diagnosis of HIV Infections in Infants and Children ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-2 Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observ ational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studi es in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents, but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents HIV Testing in Pregnancy HIV infection should be identified before pregnancy (see Prepregnancy Counseling and Care for Persons of Childbearing Age with HIV ) or as early as possible in pregnancy. In the United States, approximately 20% to 34% of infants with perinatal HIV exposure were born to people whose HIV diagnosis was not known before pregnancy.1 Early diagnosis provides the best opportunity to improve maternal health and pregnancy outcomes to prevent infant acquisition of HIV, to identify HIV infection, and to start therapy as soon as possible in infants who acquire HIV. Universal voluntary HIV testing is recommended as the standard of care for all pregnant people in the United States by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV and the Panel on Treatment of HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission (the Panel s), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gyneco logists, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.2-6 All HIV testing s hould be performed in a manner that is consistent with state and local regulations . CDC recommends t he \"opt-out\" approach, which is allowed in many jurisdictions and involves notifying a pregnant person that HIV testing will be performed as part of routine care unless they choose not to be tested.3 The \"opt-in\" approach involves obtaining specific consent before testing , and this approach has been associated with lower testing rates.7,8 Despite the guidelines for universal HIV screening of pregnant people , recent studies indicate that fewer than 80% of women report having been tested for HIV during pregnancy.9,10 The mandatory newborn HIV testing approach, which has been adopted by several states, involves testing newborns with or without maternal consent . In some areas, this applies to all newborns ; in others, it applies only to the infants of mother s who have declined prenatal or intrapartum testing. Partners of pregnant people should be referred for HIV testing when their status is unknown, consistent with the 2006 CDC recommendations for HIV testing of all individuals in the United States . Testing will facilitate linkage to care if a partner is di agnosed with HIV infection. Because women are more susceptible to HIV acquisition during pregnancy and the postpartum period,11 clinicians also can initiate a discussion about preventive interventions , including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) , for a pregnant person without HIV who is at risk for acquiring HIV . See Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to Prevent HIV During Periconception, Antepartum, and Postpartum Periods for more information. Clinicians should assess a pregnant person's risk of acute HIV infection , particularly late in pregnancy, because people may receive a negative result for expedited or rapid HIV testing when they are in the window period (the window period lasts up to 15 days post -infection when using the combined antigen/antibody i mmunoassay and up to 28 days when using other assays) . However, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-3 during thi s period, the person with acute HIV will be viremic ,12 with a high risk of perinatal transmi ssion to the newborn. The HIV RNA assay can detect the presence of HIV as early as 10 days post-infection, so this test should be used when acute HIV infection is suspected. S ee Acute HIV Infection for more information. Providers should be aware that gaps in maternal HIV testing do occur and can contribute to missed opportunities for preventi ng perinatal HIV transmission .13-16 Maternal HIV testing should be performed as early as possible during pregnancy, wherever a per son seeks care (including emergency departments and prenatal clinics) , to avoid missed opportunities to identify pregnant people with HIV. R epeat HIV testing should be performed in the third trimester for people who are at increased risk of acquiring HIV or w ho are living in areas of high HIV incidence , at the time of a diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection (STI ), or when they show symptoms and signs of possible acute HIV infection. Pregnant people with unknown or undocumented HIV status who present to care in labor should be tested during delivery or as soon as possible after delivery.13-16 Determin ing antenatal maternal HIV status e nables \u2014 People with HIV to receive appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections ; Initiation of treatment in the identified people to maintain and improve their health and to decrease risk of HIV transmission to the ir fetus or infant and their partners ;3,17,18 Referral of partners for testing, which allows them to initiate either treatment if the results are positive or preventive interventions , including PrEP, if the results are negative if warranted (see Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to Prevent HIV During Periconception, Antepartum, and Postpartum Periods ); Provi sion of ART during pregnancy and labor and provision of an appropriate antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimen to the newborn to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission ; Counseling of pregnant people with HIV about recommended modes of delivery based on individualized risks of perinatal transmission of HIV;19-21 Counseling of pregnant people with HIV about the risks of HIV transmission through breast milk (in the United States, breastfeeding is not recommended for women with HIV [see Counseling and Managing Individuals with HIV in the United States Who Desire to Breastfeed ]);22 and Early diagnostic evaluation of infants exposed to HIV (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children ), as well as testing of other children, to permit prompt initiation of ART and any indicated prophylaxis measures.2,23-25 New technology has made it possible to detect HIV earlier and has reduced the performance time for laboratory-based assays , which now can be completed in < 1 hour. Accordingly, the Panel s now base their recommendations for HIV testing on CDC 's 2014 Laboratory Testing for the Diagnosis of HIV Infection: Updated Recommendations .26 The guidelines recommend that clinicians initiate HIV testing with a n immunoassay that is capable of detecting HIV -1 antibodies, HIV -2 antibodies , and HIV-1 p24 antigen (referred to as an antigen/antibody combination immuno assay). Individuals with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immuno assay should be tested further with an HIV -1/HIV -2 antibody differentiation assay (referred to as supplemental testing). Individuals with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immuno assay and a nonreactive differentiation test should be tested with a F ood and Drug A dministration -approved plasma HIV RNA assay to establish a diagnosis of Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-4 acute HIV infection (see CDC 's Recommended Laboratory HIV Testing Algorithm for Serum or Plasma Specimens ). Discordant HIV testing results can be seen, requiring careful evaluation and often repeat tests. Early in HIV infection, before HIV seroconversion, the antigen- antibody screen will be negative and the HIV RNA assay will be positive. This is seen in acute infection because the HIV RNA assay is positive before the antigen/antibody screen. The test combination of a positive antigen-a ntibody screen, negative antibody differentiation assay, and positive HIV RNA assay also can be seen early in HIV infection because the IgG -based antibody differentiation assay is positive later in infection than the antigen capture or the IgM result in the antigen -antibody screen. Clinicians should be aware that as more individuals undergo repeat HIV testing, the number of false - positive screens will increase. The combination of a positive antigen -antibody screen with a negative antibody differentiation as say and a negative HIV RNA assay is seen in people without HIV who have a false -positive antigen-antibody screen. These examples should make it clear that for any positive HIV 1/2 antigen-antibody screen, an HIV RNA assay should be done because the HIV RNA assay is needed to resolve questions raised by discordant results on the antigen -antibody screen and the antibody differentiation assay. The antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is the test of choice and can be done quickly (referred to as an expedite d test ), but it requires trained laboratory staff and, therefore , may not be available in some hospitals 24 hours a day. When this test is unavailable, initial testing should be performed by the most sensitive expedited or rapid test available. Every delivery unit needs to have access to an HIV test that can be done rapidly (i.e., in <1 hour) 24 hours a day. If the test result is positive, the test to confirm HIV infection should be performed as soon as possible (as with all initial assays with p ositive results ). Older antibody tests have lower sensitivity in the context of recent acquisition of HIV than antigen/antibody combination immunoassays. Therefore, testing that follows the 2014 CDC algorithm should be considered if HIV risk cannot be rule d out. Results of maternal HIV testing should be documented in the newborn's medical record and communicated to the newborn's primary care provider. Repeat HIV Testing in the Third Trimester Repeat HIV testing during the third trimester, before 36 weeks ge station, is recommended (see Acute HIV Infection )27 for pregnant people with negative results on their initial HIV antibody tests who \u2014 Are at high risk of acquiring HIV (e.g., those who inject drugs or have sex with people who inject drugs, those who exchange sex for money or drugs, those who are sex partners of individuals with HIV, those who have had a new sex partner or more than one sex partner during the current pregnancy,3 or those who have a suspected or di agnosed STI during pregnancy);28 or Are receiving health care in facilities where prenatal screening identifies one or more pregnant wom en with HIV per 1,000 women screened, or reside in a jurisdiction that has a high incidence Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-5 of HIV or AIDS in women between the ages of 15 and 45 years (see the 2006 CDC recommendationsa);3,28 Reside in states or territories with statutes or regulations that require third -trimester testing (Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia );29 or Have signs or symptoms of acute HIV (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, headaches, oral ulcers, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia , elevat ed transaminase levels ).3,28,30-32 In addition, third- trimester testing should be offered to pregnant pe ople who perceive themselves as being at increased risk for HIV infect ion (regardless of whether or not they fit any of the above criteria). Pregnant people who decline testing earlier in pregnancy should be offered testing again during the third trimester. An antigen/antibody combination immunoassay should be used because these tests have a higher sensitivity in the setting of acute HIV infection than older antibody test s.26,33 When acute HIV infection is suspected during pregnancy, during the intrapartum period, or while breastfeeding, a plasma HIV RNA test result should be performed in conjunction with an antigen/antibody combination i mmunoassay . See Acute and Recent (Early ) HIV Infection in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for more information. Providers should be proactive in assessing a pregnant person's HIV acquisition risk and implementing third-trimester HIV retesting when indicated. A study in Balti more found that only 28% of women were retested for HIV despite the high incidence of HIV in Maryland and a high frequency of clinical risk factors.16 A study of data from 2007 to 2014 on children in Florida with perinatal HIV exposure found that perinatal HIV transmission was associated with poor or late prenatal care, diagnosis of maternal HIV during labor and delivery or after birth, and, in some cases , acute maternal infection (as indicated by negative results for initial tests) .34 In a more recent study from a high -prevalence area in Florida, 91.7% of women had first - or second -trimester screening and, although only 82.2% had a third -trimester test, 89.3% of those without third- trimester screening had rapid testing upon admission.35 Repeat HIV testing at other times during pregnancy also should be considered when clinically indicated. F or example, repeat testing should be performed when a pregnant person present s with symptoms that are suggestive of an STI , a confirmed STI diagnosis , or symptoms or signs that are consistent with acute HIV infection. HIV Testing During Labor in People with Unknown HIV Status People in labor whose HIV status is undocumented and those who tested negative early in pregnancy but are at increased risk of HIV infection and were not retested in the third trimester s hould undergo expedited HIV testing to identify HIV infection in the mothers and HIV exposure in their infants. HIV testin g during labor has been found to be feasible, accurate, timely, and useful both in ensuring prompt initiation of intrapartum maternal ARV for fetal/infant prophylaxis (see Intrapartum Care for a In 2004, these jurisdictions included Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carol ina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Since that time, advances in HIV screening, prevention, and treatment have affected HIV diagnoses among reproductive- aged women, and some of these jurisdictions m ay no longer meet this incidence criterion. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-6 People with HIV ) and in developing an appropriate ARV regimen for infants who are at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission ( see Table 11).2-4,23,31,36,37 Policies and procedures must be in place to ensure that staff are prepared to provide patient education and expedited HIV testing, that appropriate ARV drugs are available whenever needed, and that follow -up procedures are in place for people who receive an HIV diagnos is and for their infants. Testing should be available 24 hours a day and, whenever possible, results should be available within 1 hour. If the antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is not available, initial testing should be performed by the most sensitive expedited test available. A positive expedited HIV test result must be followed by a supplemental test.26 Immediate initiation of maternal intravenous intrapartum zidovudine is recommended to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV pending the supplemental result (see Intrapartum Care for People with HIV).2-4,6,23,31 Pending results of supplemental maternal testing, infants should receive an ARV regimen that is appropriate for infants who are at high risk of perinatal HIV transmis sion as soon as possible (see Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or Perinatal HIV or contact the National Clinician Consultation Center Perinatal HIV Hotline ). No further testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive (negative) on the initial immunoassay , unless acute HIV infection is suspected (see Acute HIV Infection).26 HIV Testing During the Post partum Period People who have not been tested for HIV before or during labor should be offered expedited testing during the immediate postpartum period. Maternal testing should be done using the antigen/antibody combination immunoassay to screen for established and acute HIV; results should be obtained in <1 hour. If acute HIV infection is a possibility, then a plasma HIV RNA test should be sent , as well. When mothers are unavailable for testing, their newborns should undergo expedited HIV testing .2,23,31 Postnatal ARV drugs need to be initiated as soon as possible \u2014ideally 6 hours after birth\u2014 to be effective in preventi ng perinatal transmission. When an initial HIV test is positive in mothers or infant s, it is strongly recommended that clinicians initiate an ARV regimen that is appropriate for infants who are at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission and counsel the mother s against breastfeeding pending the results of supplemental testing, which should include a plasma HIV RNA test . Breast milk can be expressed while HIV diagnostic testing is being completed, but it should not be given to the infant until testing confirms that the mother is HIV negative (see Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or Perinatal HIV ). If supplemental test result s are negative and acute HIV is excluded, infant ARV drugs can be discontinued. In the absence of ongoing maternal HIV exposure, breastfeeding can be initiated. Consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist is strongly recommended if questions remain about the potential for acute maternal infection or ongoing maternal HIV exposure . Infant HIV Testing When Maternal HIV Test Results Are Unavailable When maternal HIV test results are unavailable (e.g., the mother has declined testing during pregnancy or for infants and children who are in fos ter care) or their accuracy cannot be evaluated (e.g., for infants and children who were adopted from countries where results are not reported in English), HIV testing of these infants or children is indicated to identify HIV exposure and possible infection.2 The choice of test will vary based on the age of the child (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-7 in Infants and Children ). Mech anisms should be developed to facilitate prompt HIV screening for infants who have been abandoned and who are in the custody of the state. Acute Maternal HIV Infection During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding Women are more susceptible to HIV infection during pre gnancy and the early postpartum period.38 Risk of HIV exposure should be assessed in all people who are considering becoming pregnant , as well as in all pregnant and postpartum people who previously tested negative for HIV, inc luding those who are breastfeeding. People with risk factors for HIV acquisition before, during, and after pregnancy should receive prevention counseling and appropriate interventions, including PrEP if indicated.38,39 (See Pre pregnancy Counseling and Care for Persons of Childbearing Age with HIV and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to Prevent HIV During Periconception, Antepartum, and Postpartum Periods for more information. People who have acute HIV during pregnancy or lactation have an increased risk of perinatal transmission and secondary sexual transmission of HIV (see Acute HIV Infection).27,40-43 The antige n/antibody combination immunoassay will detect acute HIV infection earlier than other immunoassays \u2014within approximately 15 days of acquisition. When acute HIV infection is suspected, a plasma HIV RNA test should be sent as well because virologic tests can detect the presence of HIV approximately 5 days earlier than the antigen/antibody combination immunoassay . People with possible acute HIV infection who are breastfeeding should cease breastfeeding immediately until HIV infection is confirmed or excluded.22 Breast milk can be express ed while HIV diagnostic testing is com pleted. Breastfeeding can resume if HIV infection is excluded and there is no ongoing risk. Care of pregnant or breastfeeding people with acute or early HIV, and their infants , should follow the recom mendations in the Perinatal Guidelines (see Acute HIV Infection and Guidance for Counseling and Managing Individuals with HIV in the United States Who Desire to Breastfeed ). Other Issues Clinicians should be aware of public health surveillance systems and regulations that may exist in their jurisdictions for reporting infants who have been exposed to HIV ; this is in addition to mandatory reporting of pe ople with HIV, including infants. Reporting infants who have been exposed to HIV allows the appropriate public health functions to be accompli shed.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-1 Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children Updated: Dec.30, 202 1 Reviewed : Dec.30, 202 1 Panel's Recommendations Virologic assays (i.e., HIV RNA or HIV DNA nucleic acid tests [NAT s]) that directly detect HIV must be used to diagnose HIV in infants and children aged < 18 months with perinatal and postnatal HIV exposure; HIV antibody and HIV antigen/antibody tests should not be used (AII) . Plasma HIV RNA or cell -associated HIV DNA NATs are generally equally recommended (AII ). However, the results of plasma HIV RNA NAT or plasma HIV RNA/DNA NAT can be affected by antiretroviral therapy (ART ), or by antiretroviral (ARV) drugs administered to the infant as prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy. An assay that detects HIV non -B subtype viruses or Group O infections (e.g., an HIV RNA NAT or a dual -target total DNA/RNA test) is recommended for use in infants and children who were born to mothers with known or suspected non -B subtype virus or Group O infections (AII) . If a mother of an infant acquired HIV outside of the United S tates and has had repeated un detectable HIV RNA by standard testing, consultation with a clinical virologist on more sensitive HIV nuclei c acid testing may be indicat ed. Virologic diagnostic testing (see Table A below ) is recommended for all infants with perinatal HIV exposure at the following ages: o 14 to 21 days (AII) o 1 to 2 months (AII) o 4 to 6 months (AII) For infants who are at high risk of perinatal HIV infect ion, virologic diagnostic testing is recommended at birth (AII) and at 2 to 6 weeks after ARV drugs are discontinued (BII) . A positive virologic test should be confirmed as soon as possible by a repeat virologic test (AI I). Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in non -breastfed infants is based on two or more negative virologic tests conducted after infants have completed ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy , with one negative test obtained at age 1 month and one at age 4 months, or two negative HIV antibody tests from separate specimens that were obtained at age 6 months (AII) . No additional HIV testing of any kind ( e.g., HIV RNA or HIV DNA NAT, HIV antibody, HIV antigen/antibody) is needed routi nely for non -breastfed infants who meet the criteria for definitive exclusion of HIV and who have had no known or suspected HIV exposure after birth. Infants with potential HIV exposure after birth ( e.g., from breastfeeding, premasticated feeding, sexual a buse, contaminated blood products, percutaneous exposure) who are aged <18 months require additional testing using HIV RNA/DNA NAT assays to establish their HIV status . Infants age d 18 months who have these potential exposures require HIV antigen /antibody testing . Age-appropriate HIV testing also is recommended for infants and children with signs and/or symptoms of HIV , even in the absence of documented or suspected HIV exposure. HIV antibody (or HIV antigen /antibody ) tests are recommended for diagnostic testing in children with non - perinatal exposure only or in children with perinatal exposure aged >24 months (AII) . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-2 When acute HIV infection is suspected, additional testing with an HIV NAT may be necessary to diagnose HIV infection (AII) . Note : The National Clinician Consultation Center provides consultations on issues related to the management of perinatal HIV infection (1- 888-448-8765; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Diagnosis of HIV in Infants and Children HIV c an be diagnosed definitively by virologic testing in most non-breastfed infants with perinatal HIV exposure by age 1 to 2 months and in almost all infants with HIV by age 4 to 6 months. Antibody tests, including the antigen /antibody combination immunoassays (sometimes referred to as fourth - and fifth -generation tests) , do not establish the presence of HIV in inf ants because of transplacental transfer of maternal HIV antibodies; therefore, a virologic test must be used.1,2 Positive virologic tests (i.e., nucleic acid tests [NAT s]\u2014a class of tests that includes HIV RNA and HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assays and related RNA qualitative or quantitative assays) indicate likely HIV infection. Plasma HIV RNA or cell -associated HIV DNA NATs are generally equally recommended. However, both tests can be affected by maternal antiretroviral therapy through transplacental transfer of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs from the pregnant person to fetus or by ARV drugs administered to the infant as prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy. In contrast, qualitative HIV proviral DNA PCR assays from whole blood detect ing cell-associated virus often are less affected by ARVs. A positive HIV test result should be confirmed as soon as possible by repeat virologic test ing, because false -positive results can occur with both RNA and DNA assays.3 For additional information on the diagnosis of Group M non-s ubtype B, Group O HIV -1 infections , and HIV -2 infections, see the relevant section s below and the HIV Sequence Database . Newer real-time HIV RNA PCR assays and the qualitative diagnostic RNA assay are better at detecting non-subtype B HIV infection and Group O strains than older RNA assays . 4-9 (See Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection .) One example is the COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan -HIV-1 qualitative test (a dual-target DNA/RNA, sometimes called total nucleic acid or TNA test ), which also can identify non-subtype B and Group O infections.10,11 Antigen/antibody combination immunoassays that detect HIV -1/2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen are not recommended for diagnosis of HIV infection in infants . In the first months of life, the antigen component of antigen/antibody tests is less sensitive than an HIV NAT , and antibody tests should not be used for HIV diagnosis in infants and children < 18 months of age .12-14 Children with perinatal HIV exposure who are aged 18 to 24 months occasionally have residual maternal HIV antibodies; definitive confirmation of HIV infection in children in th is age group who remain HIV antibody-positive should be based on a NAT (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations below ). Diagnosis in children aged >24 months relies primarily on Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-3 HIV antibody and antigen/antibody tests (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non -Perinatal HIV Exposure or Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure Aged >24 Months below ).1 An infant who has a positive HIV antibody test but whose mother's HIV status is unknown (see Maternal HIV Testing and Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure ) should be assumed to have been exposed to HIV . The infant should undergo HIV diagnostic testing, as described in Timing of Diagnostic Testing in Infants with Perinatal HIV Exposure below ,15 and receive ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy as soon as possible. For ARV management of newborns who have been exposed to HIV and newborns with HIV infection (including those who do not yet have confirmed infection), see Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or Perinatal HIV. Timing of Diagnostic Testing in Infants with Perinatal HIV Exposure Confirmation of HIV infection is based on the results of positive virologic tests from two separate blood samples in infants and children younger than 18 months. Table A below summarize s the timing of recommended virologic diagnostic testing for infants based on HIV transmission risk. Infants at high risk on presumptive HIV therapy may require testing at additional time points compared to infants at low risk of transmission. The r isk of t ransmission is determined based on whether a mother is receiving ART and virally suppressed. HIV infection can be presumptively excluded in non-breastfed infants with two or more negative virologic tests (one at age 2 weeks and one at age 4 weeks) or one negative virologic test (i.e., negative NAT [RNA or DNA]) at age 8 weeks, or one negative HIV antibody test at age 6 months.1,15 Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in a non -breastfed infant is based on two or more negative virologic tests (i.e., negative NATs [RNA or DNA]), one at age 1 month and one at age 4 months, or two negative HIV antibody tests from separate specimens ob tained at age 6 months. For both presumptive and definitive exclusion of HIV infection, a child must have no other laboratory evidence (i.e., no positive virologic test results or low CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count/percent) or clinical evidence of HIV infection and must not be breastfeeding. No additional HIV testing of any kind (e.g., NAT, antibody, antigen/antibody) is needed routinely for non-breastfed infants who meet the criteria for definitive exclusion of HIV and who have had no known or suspecte d HIV exposure after birth. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for infants with indeterminate HIV infection status starting at age 4 to 6 weeks until they are determined to be definit ively or presumptively without HIV . 16 Thus, PCP prophylaxis can be avoided or discontinued if HIV infection is presumptively excluded (see Initial Postnatal Management of the Neonate Exposed to HIV and Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in the Pediatric Opportunistic Infection Guidelines ). Virologic Testing at Birth for Newborns at High Risk of Perinatal HIV Transmission Virologic testing at birth should be considered for newborns who are at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission,17-22 such as infants born to women with HIV who \u2014 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-4 Did not receive prenatal care ; Received no antepartum ARVs or only intrapartum ARV drugs ; Initiated ART late in pregnancy (during the late second or third trimester); Received a diagnosis of acute HIV infection during pregnancy or in labor; and/or Had detectable HIV viral loads ( 50 copies/mL) close to the time of delivery, including those who received ART and did not have sustained viral suppression. All infants at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission should have specimens obtained for HIV testing at birth before initiating an ARV drug regimen ; however, presumptive HIV therapy should not be delayed . Blood samples from the umbilical cord should not be used for diagnostic evaluation because of the potential for contamination with maternal blood. Virologic testing at birth is critical for early HIV diagnosis (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral -Naive Children in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Infants who have a positive virologic test result at or before age 48 hours are considered to have early (intrauterine) infect ion, whereas non-breastfed infants who have a negative virologic test result during the first week of life and subsequently have positive test results are considered to have late (intrapartum) infection . 17,18,23 Testing at birth also might be considered in instances w hen there are concerns that a newborn at low risk of perinatal HIV transmission may be lost to follow -up without testing. Virologic Testing at Age 14 to 21 Days The diagnostic sensitivity of virologic testing increases rapidly by age 2 weeks ,15 and early identification of infection permit s transition from presumptive HIV therapy to treatment doses of ART (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral -Naive Children in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Virologic Testing at Age 1 to 3 Months Testing performed at age 1 to 3 months is intended to maximize the likelihood of detect ing HIV infection in infants . In the HIV Prevention Trials Network 040 study, 93 of 140 infants with HIV (66.4%) were identified at birth. Infants w ho received negative test results in the first 7 days of life received an HIV diagnos is when the next diagnostic test was performed at 3 months of age .24 For infants at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission, t he Panel on Trea tment of HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission suggests performing an additional virologic test 2 to 6 weeks after ARV drugs are discontinued (i.e., at age 8-12 weeks) , given the increased risk of infection and concern that ARV prophylaxis, particularly combination ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy, may reduce the sensitivity of diagnostic testing.24,25 In these situations, many experts recommend one test at age 4 to 6 weeks to allow prompt diagnosis of HIV in infants with an additional test at 8 to 12 weeks of life (i.e., 2 -6 weeks after cessation of prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy) to capture additional cases (see Table A below ). For infants at low risk of HIV transmission, a single test obtained at 1 to 2 months of age may be timed to occur 2 to 4 weeks after cessatio n of ARV prophylaxis . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-5 An infant with two negative virologic test result s (one at age 14 days and the other at age 4 weeks) , or one negative test result at age 8 weeks at least 2 weeks after discontinuing ARV prophylaxis/presumptive therapy, can be viewed as presumptively HIV uninfect ed, assuming the child has not had a positive prior virologic test result or clinical evidence indicative of HIV infection, and is not breastfed. Virologic Testing at Age 4 to 6 Months Infants with HIV exposure who have had negative virologic assays at age 14 to 21 days and at age 1 to 2 months , who have no clinical evidence of HIV infection, and who are not breastfed should be retested at age 4 to 6 months for definitive exclusion of HIV infection.

For information about HIV testing time points for infants born to women with HIV who opt to breastfeed after comprehensive counseling see the Breastf eeding subsection of this chapter below and Counseling and Managing Individuals with HIV in the United States Who Desire to Breastfeed . b For high- risk infants, virologic diagnostic testing is recommended at birth. For infants treated with multiple ARVs in the first 2 to 4 weeks of life, additional virologic testing is recommended 2 to 6 weeks after ARV drugs are discontinued (i.e., at 8- 12 weeks of life). c For low -risk infants, test may be timed to occur at least 2 weeks after cessation of ARV prophylaxis. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-6 Key: ART = antiretroviral therapy; ARV = antiretroviral; NAT = nucleic acid test Antibody Testing at Age 6 M onths and Older Two or more negative results of HIV antibody test s that were performed in non-breastfed infants at age 6 months also can be used to exclude HIV infection definitively in children with no clinical or virologic laboratory-documented evidence of HIV infection.26,27 Antibody Testing at Age 18 to 24 Months to Document Seroreversion In general, no additional HIV testing of any kind (e.g., NAT, antibody, antigen/antibody) is needed routinely for non-breastfed infants who meet the criteria for definitive exclusion of HIV and who have had no known or suspected HIV exposure after birth. However, i nfants with potential HIV exposure after birth (e.g., breastfeeding, premasticated feeding, sexual abuse, contaminated blood products, percutaneous exposure) who are aged <18 months require additional testing using HIV RNA/DNA NAT assays to establish their HIV status . Infants age d 18 months of age who have these potential exposures require HIV antigen/ antibody testing . In a study from 2012, the median age at seroreversion was 13.9 months.28 Although the majority of infants who do not have HIV will serorevert by age 15 months to 18 months, late seroreversion after 18 months has been r eported (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations below). Factors that might influence the time to seroreversion include maternal disease stage and assay sensitivity.28-31 Diagnostic Testing i n Children w ith Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations Late Seroreversion ( Aged 24 Months) Non-breastfed children with perinatal HIV exposure , no other HIV transmission risk fa ctor, and no clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection may have residual HIV antibodies up to age 24 months . These children are called late seroreverters.28-31 In one study, 14% of children with HIV exposure did not have HIV seroreverted after age 18 months.28 More recent data from Thailand associated late seroreversion with the antenatal use of protease inhibitors in pregnant women with HIV. In this study, late seroreversion also was associated with the use of fourth -generation combination antigen/antibody immunoassays .32 These children may have had positive immunoassay results , but supplemental antibody test results indicated indeterminate HIV status . In such cases, repeat antibody testing at a later date confirmed seroreversion. Due to the possibility of residual HIV antibodies, virologic testing (i .e., with a NAT) is necessary to exclude definitively or confirm HIV infection in children with perinatal HIV exposure who have a positive HIV antibody (or antigen/antibody) test at age 18 months to 24 months. Virologic testing will distinguish late - serore verting children who do not have HIV but have residual antibodies from children who have antibodies due to underlying HIV infection. Age -appropriate HIV testing also is recommended for infants and children with signs and/or symptoms of HIV , even in the abs ence of documented or suspected HIV exposure. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-7 Postnatal HIV Infection in Children with P erinatal HIV E xposure and Prior Negative Virologic Test Result s for Whom There Are Additional HIV Transmission Risks In contrast to late seroreverters, in rare situations , postnatal HIV infections have been reported in children with HIV exposure who had prior negative HIV virologic test result s. This occurs in children who acquire HIV through an additional risk factor after completion of testing (see Diagnostic T esting in Children with N on-Perinatal HIV Exposure or Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure Aged >24 Months below ). Suspicion of HIV -2 or Non -Subtype B HIV -1 Infections with False -Negative Virologic Test Results Children with non-subtype B HIV -1 and childre n with HIV -2 may have false -negative virologic tests but persistent positive immunoassay results.33-35 The diagnostic approach in these situations is discussed below in Virologic Assays to Diagnos e Group M Non-Subtype B and Group O HIV -1 Infections and in Virologic Assays to Diagnos e HIV-2 Infections. Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non -Perinatal HIV Exposure or Children w ith Perinatal H IV Exposure Age d >24 Months Breastfeeding People with HIV s hould be encouraged to avoid breastfeeding.36 Monitoring of infants born to people with HIV who opt to breastfeed after comprehensive counseling should include immediate HIV diagnostic virologic testing with a NAT at the following time points : birth, 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months (see Table A above ).37 Many experts then recommend testing every 3 months throughout breastfeeding, followed by monitoring at 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after cessation of breastfeeding. Clinicians caring for a person with HIV who is c onsidering breastfeeding should consult with an expert and, if necessary, the Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765). For more information, s ee Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection and Counseling and Managing Individuals with HIV in the United States Who Desire to Breastfeed . Premastication Receipt of solid food that has been premasticated or prewarmed (in the mouth) by a caregiver with HIV is associated with risk of HIV transmission.38-43 If this occurs in children with perinatal HIV exposure aged 24 months with prior negative virologic tests, it will be necessary for such children to undergo virologic diagnostic testing because they may have residual maternal HIV antibodies (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations above ). Additional Routes of HIV Tra nsmission Additional routes of HIV transmission in children include sexual abuse , receipt of contaminated blood products , and needlestick with contaminated needles . teIt may be difficult to obtain a history of HIV exposure. Therefore, age -appropriate HIV t esting is recommended for infants and children with signs and/or symptoms of HIV infection, even in the absence of documented or suspected perinatal Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-8 or non-perinatal HIV exposure. Acquisition of HIV in older children is possible through accidental needlestick injurie s, sexual transmission, or injection drug use. Medical procedures performed in settings with inadequate infection control practices may pose a potential risk; although tattooing or body piercing presents a potential risk of HIV transmission, no reported cases of HIV transmission from these activities have been documented.45 Diagnostic Testing Diagnosis of HIV -1 infection in infants and children with non-perinatal HIV exposure only or in children with perinatal HIV exposure who are aged >24 months relies primarily on HIV antibody and antigen/antibody tests.1,46 Food and Drug Administration (FDA )-approved diagnostic tests include \u2014 Antigen/antibody combination immunoassays , which detect HIV -1/2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen . These tests a re recommended for initial testing to screen for established infection with HIV-1 or HIV -2 and for acute HIV -1 infection. However, p24 antigen from HIV -1 non-B strains, HIV-1 non-M strains, and HIV-2 strains may not be detected.47 Recent data suggest that the use of immunoassays and rapid diagnostic test combination algorithms that have limited HIV antigen breadth may not be adequate for diagnosis of HIV infection in children following early treatment with ART.48 HIV-1/HIV -2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, which differentiates HIV -1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies . This immunoassay is recommended for supplemental testing. HIV-1 NAT . A NAT always is indicated as an additional test to diagnose acute HIV infection. The d iagnosis of HIV -2 in children with non-perina tal exposure only or in children with perinatal exposure aged >24 months relies on the 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC )/Association of Public Health Laboratories laboratory testing guidelines . These guidelines recommend using an HIV -1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay that di stinguishe s between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies for supplemental testing. When used as a supplemental test, the results of the HIV -1 Western blot are more ambiguous than those of the HIV -1/HIV -2 antibody differentiation immunoassay; > 60% of individuals with HIV -2 are misclassified as having HIV -1 by the HIV -1 Western blot.1,49 All HIV-2 cases should be reported to the HIV surveillance program of the state or local health department; additional HIV -2 DNA PCR testing can be arranged by a local public health laboratory or by CDC if an HIV -1/HIV -2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is inconclusive . HIV-2 DNA PCR testing may be necessary for definitive diagnosis , although this assay is not commercially available.50,51 Virologic Assays to Diagnose HIV in Infants Younger Than 18 Months with Perinatal HIV-1 Exposure HIV RNA Assays HIV quantitative RNA assays detect extracellular viral RNA in plasma. Their specificity has been shown to be 100% at birth and at age s 1 month, 3 months , and 6 months and is comparable to the specificity of HIV DNA PCR.25 Testing at birth will detect HIV RNA in infants who acquire HIV in utero and not in those who acquire HIV from exposure during delivery or immediately before delivery (i.e., during the intrapartum period). Studies have shown that HIV RNA assays identify 25% to 58% of infants with HIV infection from birth through the first week of life, 89% at age 1 month, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-9 and 90% to 100% by age 2 months to 3 months . These results are similar to the results of HIV DNA PCR for early diagnosis of HIV.3,25,52 The sensitivity of HIV RNA assays is affected by maternal antenatal ART or ARV drugs administered to the infant as prophylaxis or presumptive therapy.53 In one study, the sensitivity of HIV RNA assays was not associated with the type of maternal ART or infant ARV prophylaxis, but HIV RNA levels at 1 month were significantly lower in infants with HIV who were receiving multidrug prophylaxis. In contrast, the median HIV RNA levels were high by age 3 months in both groups after stopping prophylaxis.25 Between 2010 and 2016, a significant decline in baseline viremia was noted in South Africa's Early Infant Diagnosis program, with loss of detectability documented among some infants with HIV. This decline may have reflected the administration of various prophylactic ARV regimens during those years.54 Further studies are necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of HIV RNA assays during receipt of multidrug ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy in infants whose mothers also received antenatal ART . An HIV quantitative RNA assay can be used as a confirmatory test for infants who have an initial positive HIV DNA PCR test result . In addition to providing virologic confirmation of infection status, an HIV RNA measurement assesses baseline viral load. A n HIV genotype can be performed on the same sample to guide initial ARV treatment in an infant with HIV . HIV RNA assays may be more s ensitive than HIV DNA PCR for detecting non-subtype B HIV (see Virologic Assays to Diagnose Group M Non-Subtype B and Group O HIV -1 Infections below ). The HIV qualitative RNA assay (APTIMA HIV -1 RNA Qualitative Assay) is an alternative diagnostic test that can be used for infant testing. It is the only qualitative RNA test that is approved by the FDA.23,55 -58 HIV DNA PCR a nd Related Assays HIV DNA PCR is a sensitive technique that is used to detect intracellular HIV viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The specificity of the HIV DNA PCR is 99.8% at birth and 100% at ages 1 month, 3 months , and 6 months. Studies have shown that HIV DNA PCR assays identify 20% to 55% of infants with HIV infection from birth through the first week of life, with the same caveat as for RNA testing \u2014testing at birth de tects only in utero HIV infection and not infection in those infants who acquire HIV during the intrapartum period. This percentage increases to >90% by age 2 weeks to 4 weeks and to 100% at ages 3 months and 6 months.23,25,52 Two studies provided data on diagnostic testing at different time points in infants with confirmed HIV infection, including those who had negative test results at birth. One study noted that among 47 infants with HIV infection who had negative DNA PCR test result s at birth, 68% were identified during the period of neonatal ARV prophylaxis at 4 to 6 weeks; by 3 months, all 47 infants were identified. 24 Another study from Cape Town evaluated the sensitivity of HIV DNA assays within 8 days of life, during and after initiati ng ART in infants with HIV. The infants had been exposed to a combination of maternal ART in utero and ARV drugs for prophylaxis and treatment. In seven infants who achieved virologic suppression (defined as a continuous downward trend in plasma HIV RNA, with <100 copies/m L after 6 months), total HIV DNA continued to decay over 12 months. The authors noted that one infant had undetectable HIV DNA after 6 days on treatment, another had undetectable HIV DNA after 3 months, and a third had undetectable HIV DNA after 4 months , suggest ing that rapid decline of HIV -1 RNA an d DNA may complicate definitive diagnosis.59 More recent studies from the same auth ors suggest that ART initiation within the first week of life reduces Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-10 persistence of long- lived infected cells and that delaying ART initiation is associated with slower decay of infected cells.60 A data set of 38,043 infants from the Western Cape province of South Africa who were tested at a median age of 45 days of life showed that infants who received the World H ealth O rganization Option B+ ARV regimen had fewer indeterminate DNA PCR results than infants who were receiving older ARV regimens.61 Another group of South African investigators reported similar findings in a study of a cohort of 5, 743 neonates from Johannesburg who were exposed to HIV .62 The AMPLICOR\u00ae HIV-1 DNA test has been used widely for diagnosis of HIV in infants born to mothers with HIV -1 infec tion since it was introduced in 1992. However, it is no longer commercially available in the United States. The sensitivity and specificity of noncommercial HIV -1 DNA tests that us e individual laboratory reagents may differ from the sensitivity and specifi city of an FDA - approved commercial test. The COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HIV- 1 version 2.0 qualitative test (which detects both HIV -1 RNA and proviral DNA in plasma, whole blood, and dried blood spots ) may be used for HIV diagnosis in infants , but it is not approved by the FDA .10,11,62 These considerations underscore the importance of testing with HIV NAT s at 4 months \u2014well after neonatal ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy has stopped. Other Issues Virologic Assays to Diagnose Group M Non -Subtype B and Group O HIV -1 Infections Although HIV -1 Group M subtype B is the predominant viral subtype found in the United States, multiple subtypes and recombinant forms also are found in the United States.63 Data from the CDC National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) showed that the number of non-U.S. -born children with HIV ha s exceeded the number of U .S.-born children with HIV since 2011, with 65.5% of non-U.S. - born children with HIV born in sub-Saharan Africa and 14.3% in Eastern Europe .64 In an evaluation of infants who received a perinatal HIV infection diagnos is in New Yo rk State in 2001 and 2002, 16.7% of infants had acquired a non-subtype B strain of HIV , compared with 4.4% of infants born in 1998 and 1999.65 Among a group of 40 children who visited a pediatric HIV clinic in Rhode Island between 1991 and 2012, 14 (35%) acquir ed HIV with non-B HIV -1 subtypes. All 14 children were either born outside the United States or their parents were of foreign origin.66 In an analysis of 1,277 unique sequences coll ected in Rhode Island from 2004 to 2011, 8.3% were non-B subtypes (including recombinant forms). Twenty -two percent of participants with non-B subtypes formed transmission clusters, including individuals with perinatally acquired infection .67 In an analysis of 3,895 HIV -1 sequences that were collected between July 2011 and June 2012 in the United States, 5.3% were determined to be non-B subtypes (including recombinant forms). Evolving immigration patterns may be contributing to local and regional increases in HIV -1 subtype diversity. Non-subtype B viruses predominate in other parts of the world, such as subtype C in regions of Africa and India and subtype CRF01 in much of Southeast Asia. Group O HIV strains are seen in West -Central Africa.68 Non -subtype B and Group O strains may be seen in countries with links to these geographical regions.69-73 The g eographical distribution of HIV groups is available at the HIV Sequence Database . Real-time HIV RNA PCR assays and the qualitative diagnostic RNA assay are better at detecting non-subtype B HIV infection and the less -common Group O strains than older RNA assays4-9 (see Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). An example includes the COBAS\u00ae Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-11 AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HIV-1 qualitative test (a dual -target DNA/RNA test), which also can identify non-subtype B and Group O infections.10,11 Thus, a real -time PCR assay , , or a dual -target total DNA/RNA test should be used for infant testing instead of a DNA PCR assay when evaluating an infant born to a mother whose HIV infection is linked to an area that is endemic for non-subtype B HIV or Group O strains, such as Africa or Southeast Asia. Another indication is when initial tes ting is negative using a n HIV DNA PCR test and non-subtype B or Group O perinatal exposure is suspected. Two negative HIV antibody test result s obtained at age 6 months provide further evidence to rule out HIV infection definitively . Clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection; state or local public health departments or CDC may be able to assist in obtaining referrals for diagnostic HIV testing. Chimeric Antigen Receptor T -Cell and Lentiviral-Based Gene Therapy May Give Rise to Fal se-Positive HIV NAT Resul ts Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell immunotherapy is a major advancement in cancer therapeutics , including for pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Reprogramming of T cells is achieved by using gammaretroviral or lentiviral vectors. Recent reports indicate that these vectors may interfere with long terminal repeat genomes in HIV NAT result s and, thus, produce false -positive results. As CAR T -cell therapy becomes more widely available for multiple indications, it will be important for clinicians to recognize that routine HIV -1 NAT resul ts may give rise to false results. In addition, lentiviral vector -based gene therapy as treatment for severe combined immunodeficiency can give rise to false -positive HIV NAT resul ts. Laboratories should, therefore , have appropriate alternate HIV -1 NAT resul ting platforms made available for this emerging patient population. 74-78 Virologic Assays to Diagnose HIV -2 Infections HIV-2 infection is endemic in Angola; Mozambique; West African countries , incl uding Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea -Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo; and parts of India.79-81 HIV-2 i nfection also is well documented in France and Portugal, which have large numbers of immigrants from these regions .82,83 HIV-1 and HIV -2 coinfection may occur, but this rarely is described outside areas where HIV -2 is e ndemic. HIV -2 is rare in the United States. Although accurately diagnosi ng HIV -2 can be difficult, it is clinically important because HIV -2 strains are resistant to several ARV drugs that were developed to suppress HIV -1.84-86 (See HIV-2 Infection and Pregnancy .) A mother should be suspected of having HIV-2 if her infe ction is linked to an area that is endemic for HIV-2 infection or if her HIV test results are suggestive of HIV -2 infection (i.e., the mother has a positive initial HIV 1/2 immunoassay test result and HIV -1 RNA viral loads that are at or below the limit of detection ). The current recommendation is to use an HIV -1/HIV -2 antibody differentiation immunoassay for supplemental testing.1 Between 2010 and 2017, an increase in the number of HIV-1/HIV -2 differentiation test results was reported to the CDC's NHSS. More than 99.9% of all HIV infections identified in the United States were categorized as HIV -1, and the number of HIV -2 diagnoses (mono-infection or dual -infection) remained extremely low (<0.03% of all HIV infections).87 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-12 Infant testing with HIV -2-specific DNA PCR tests should be performed at time points similar to those used for HIV -1 testing when evaluating an infant born to a mother with known or suspected HIV-2 infection. HIV-2 DNA PCR testing can be arranged by the HIV surveillance program of the state or local health department through their public health laboratory, or the CDC, because this assay is not commercially available.50,51 Clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection when caring for infants with suspected or known exposure to HIV -2.79,88 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-13 References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-1 Clinical and Laborat ory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel's Recommendations Absolute CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and plasma HIV RNA (viral load) should be measured at the time of HIV diagnosis and , if a child is not started on antiretroviral therapy ( ART) after diagnosis, this monitoring should be repeated at least every 3 to 4 months thereafter (AIII). Absolute CD4 count is recommended for monitoring immune status in children with HIV of all ages, with CD4 percentage as an alternative for children aged <5 years (AII) . Antiretroviral (ARV) drug -resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV diagnosis , before initiation of therapy in all ART-naive patients , and before switching regimens in patients with treatment failure (AII) . Genotypic resistance testing is preferred for this purpose (AIII) . After initiation of ART or after a change in AR V regimen , children should be evaluated for clinical adverse effects and should receive support for treatment adherence within 1 week to 2 weeks ; laboratory testing for toxicity and viral load response is recommended at 2 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation or change in ARV regimen (AIII). Children on ART should be monitored for therapy adherence, effectiveness, and toxicities routinely ( every 3-4 months) (AII*) . See the sections on Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV and Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance . Additional CD4 count and plasma viral load monitoring should be performed to evaluat e children with suspected clinical, immunologic, or virologic deterioration or to confirm an abnormal value (AIII) . CD4 count can be monitored less frequently (every 6 -12 months) in children and adolescents who are adherent to therapy , who have sustained virologic suppression and CD4 count value s that are well a bove the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, and who have stable clinical status (AII) . Viral load measurement every 3 to 4 months is generally recommended to monitor ART adherence (AIII) . Phenotypic resistance testing should be considered (usually in addition to genotypic resistance testing) for patients with known or suspected complex drug resistance mutation patterns, which generally arise after a patient has experienced virologic failure on multiple ARV regimens ( CIII). Review the history of all previously used ARVs and available resistance test results when making decisions about choice of new ARVs, because mutations may not be detected once the prior drug s have been discontinued (AII) . Viral co -receptor tropism assays are recommended whenever a CCR5 antagonist is being considered for treatment (AI*) . The use of t ropism assays also should be considered for patients who demonstrate virologic failure while receiving therapy that contains a CCR5 antagonist (AI*) . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-2 Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or mor e well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long -term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long- term outcomes; II* = One or more well -design ed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long -term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents , but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescents Laboratory monitoring of children living with HIV poses unique and challenging issues. In particular, the normal ranges of CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) counts and plasma HIV RNA concentrations (viral loads) can vary significantly by age. The CD4 counts and viral load values that predict the risk of disease progression also change as a child ages. This section will address immunologic, virologic, general laboratory, and clinical monitoring of children with HIV, with information that is relevant to both those who have recently received an HIV diagnosis and those who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART ). Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Children with HIV Initial Evaluation of Children Who Recent ly Received an HIV Diagnosis, or Entering or Transferring to a New Care Setting Children who have recently received an HIV diagnosis should have their CD4 counts and plasma viral loads measured, their growth and development should be evaluated for signs of HIV -associated abnormalities , and a complete physical examination should be performed to identify physical findings of HIV disease (e.g., lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hyper reflexia , ankle clonus ). Testing also should be performed to assess for HIV -associated conditions, including ). In addition, children with HIV should have a complete , age -appropriate medical history and physical examination (see Table 5 below ). Opportunistic infection (OI) monitoring should follow the guidelines that are appropriate for the child's exposure history and clinical setting (see the Pediatric Opportunistic Infection Guidelines ). Children with HIV who are relocating from outside the U nited S tates may benefit from additional evaluations \u2014such as screening for tuberculosis , gastrointestinal parasites, hepatitis infection, lead level \u2014and t hyroid function studies. Laboratory confirmation of HIV infection should be obtained when available documentation is incomplete (see Diagn osis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children ). Genotypic resistance testing should be performed, even if ART is not initiated immediately. In addition, a full antiretroviral (ARV) drug history should be obtained; this history should include any exposure to ARV drugs for the prevention of perinatal HIV transmission (see Drug -Resistance Testing in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). If abacavir (ABC) is being considered as a component of the regimen, HLA -B*5701 testing should be conducted prior to initiati ng ABC , and an alt ernative ARV drug should be used if the HLA-B*5701 test result is positive1 (see the Abacavir section in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Before initiating therapy or making changes to a patient's ARV regimen, a clinician and multidisciplinary team members (where available) should assess potential barriers to adherence and Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-3 discuss the importance of adherence with the patient and/or their caregiver (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV ). If a child does not initiate ART after rece iving an HIV diagnosis, the child's CD4 count and plasma viral load should be monitored at least every 3 to 4 months. Evaluation at Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy At the time of ART initiation, a physical examination should be performed, including assessment of weight and height, and baseline labs for CD4 count and plasma viral load should be obtained to monitor ART response (see Table 5 below ). To set the baseline for monitoring ART toxicity (see Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ), a complete blood count, urinalysis, and serum chemistry panel (including levels of electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, and hepatic transaminases) should be performed (see Table 5 below ). The levels of serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) also should be measured. For information about the adverse effects (AEs) associated with a specific ARV drug, see Tables 15a -15k in Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance and Appendix A : Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for complete information on each drug. Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring After Initiati ng or Changing an Antiretroviral Regimen Children who start ART or who change to a new regimen should be monitored to assess the effectiveness, tolerability, and AEs of the regimen and to evaluate medication adherence. Clinicians and multidisciplinary teams should schedule frequent clinic al in-person and /or telemedici ne visits to monitor patients closely during the first few months after initiating a new ARV regimen. Telemedicine visits and telehealth communication platforms are particularly relevant to the care of adolescent patients based on their technology access a nd habits .2 Additional check-ins via telephone and/or telehealth (emails, text messaging, app-based communications) may support adherence and early identification of medication side effects. The continuity of patient and caregiver interactions is an opportunity for clinicians and the multidisciplinary team to provide support and discuss adherence with pa tients and their caregivers. A recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials from the last 10 years that used a telemedicine approach as a study intervention or assessed telemedicine as a subspecialty of pediatric care found that telemedicine se rvices for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in- person se rvices.3 Use of telemedicine as a remote , technology-based access to clinical services in HIV care is growing and has been shown to achieve similar outcomes as those associated with in -person care. People with HIV on ART achieve similar clinical responses to therapy, adherence to treatment, quality-of-life scores, and psychological and emotional status , whether treated through telemedicine or in person. 4-6 When selecting the format for clinical follow -up, it is important to recognize differences and similarities between in-person and telemedicine visits (see Table 4 below ). The benefits of telemedicine visits include patient and caregiver convenience, lack of travel, flexibility , and ability to visualize ART handling/swallowing and conduct directly observed therapy in the home setting. Telemedicine visits, however, require technological acce ss/capacity and limit the provider's ability to conduct physical examinations and obtain laboratory testing on site.4,5 Periodic measurements of body weight , which are important for dose modification in rapidly growing infant s and to monitor for excessive weight gain as a possible AE of some ARVs , are not possible with telemedicine visits. Additionally, providers need to arrange and coordinate access to the laboratory testing and be familiar with state and local requirements for carrying out, documenting, and billing telemedicine visits. Although both in-person and telemedicine visits involve considerations for stigma, privacy, and confidentiality, these considerations differ betwe en Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-4 health care and home/community -based settings. For example, the caregiver who has not disclosed the HIV and ART status of the child at home might prefer in-person visit s at the clinic or specific hours and/or alternative locations for a telemedicine vis it. Table 4. Characteristics and Requirements for In -Person Clinic Visits vs. Telemedicine Visits In-Person Visits Telemedicine Visits Patient/caregiver convenience Flexibility (time and locations) of appointments Confidentiality concerns Directly observed therapy in home settings Physical assessment (e.g., skin rashes) Physical exam , including weight and height Adherence support and counseling Mental health assessment and counseling Multidisciplinary support ( assessment and coordination of nutritional and social services) Laboratory testing on site Travel to clinic Technology requirements (internet access, equipment, skills) Legal and administrative guidelines for visit documentation and billing The first few weeks of ART can be particularly difficult for children and their caregivers; they must adjust their schedules to allow consistent and routine administration of medication doses. Children also may experience the AEs of medications, and both children and their caregivers need assistance to determine whether the effects are temporary and tolerable or whether they are more serious or long term and require a clinical visit. It is critical that providers communicate with caregivers and children in a supportive, nonjudgmental manner and us e plain language . This approach promotes interactive reporting and ensures that providers can have a productive dialogue with both children and their caregivers, particularly in situations where medication adherence is reported to be inconsistent. Within 1 Week to 2 Weeks of Initiati ng Antiretroviral Therapy Within 1 week to 2 weeks of initiating ARV therapy, children should be evaluated either in person, through telemedicine , or by tele phone . During this evaluation , clinicians should identify clinical AE s and provid e support for adherence. Many clinicians plan additional contacts (in person, through telemedicine, by telephone, or via email /texts /apps ) with children and caregivers to support adherence during the first few weeks of therapy. 2 to 4 Weeks A fter Initiati ng Antiretroviral Therapy Most experts recommend performing laboratory testing at 2 to 4 weeks (but no later than 8 weeks) after initiating ART to assess virologic response and laboratory toxicity, al though this recommendation is based on limited data . The laboratory chemistry tests that a patient requires will Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-5 depend on the ARV regimen that the patient is receiving (see Table 5 below ). Plasma vi ral load monitoring is important as a marker of response to ART , because a decline in viral load suggests that the patient is adherent to the regimen, that the appropriate doses are being administered , and that the virus is susceptible to the drugs in the regimen . Some experts favor measuring viral load at 2 weeks to ensure that viral load is declining. A significant decrease in viral load should be observed 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of ART . Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring for Children Who Are Stable on Long- Term Antiretroviral Therapy After the initial phase of ART initiation (1 -3 months), clinicians should assess a patient's adherence to the regimen and the regimen's effectiveness (as measured by CD4 count and plasma viral load) every 3 to 4 months. Additionally, clinicians should review a patient's history of drug toxicities and evaluate each patient for any new AEs using physical examinations and the relevant laboratory tests. If laboratory evidence of toxicity is identified, testing should be performed more frequently until the toxicity resolves. Table 5 below provides one proposed general monitoring schedule, which should be adjusted based on the specific AR V regimen that a child is receiving. A patient's baseline CD4 count affects how rapidly CD4 count improves after ART initiation; children with very low CD4 counts may take longer than 1 year to achieve their highest values after viral load suppression. 7 Studies that have critically evaluated the frequency of laboratory monitoring in both adults and children, particularly CD4 count and plasma viral load, support less frequent monitoring in stable patients who have been consistently viro logically suppress ed for 1 year.8-14 The Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines currently support performing plasma viral load testing every 6 months for individuals who have both \u2014 Consistent virologic suppression 2 years ; and CD4 count s that are consistently >300 cells/mm3. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV finds value in continuing to perform viral load testing every 3 to 4 mont hs to provide enhanced monitoring of adherence or disease progression among children and adolescents . Some experts monitor CD4 count less frequently (e.g., every 6-12 months) in children and adolescents who are adherent to therapy, who have CD4 count value s well above the threshold for OI risk, and who have had sustained virologic suppression and stable clinical status for > 2 to 3 years . 15 Some clinicians find value in scheduling visits every 3 months , even when laboratory testing is not performed, in order to review adherence and update drug dos es for interim growth. Follow -up clinical and laboratory monitoring can be conducted through in-person and/or telemedicine visits. Additional arrangements, coordination, and follow -up of the laboratory testing (e.g., using local laboratory or primary care provider's office) may be required for telemedicine visits . Testing at the Time of Switching Antiretroviral Regimens When a patient switches regimens to simplify ART, clinicians should obtain the appropriate laboratory test results at baseline for the toxicity profile of the new regimen. F ollow -up should includ e a measurem ent of plasma viral load at 4 weeks (and not > 8 weeks) after the switch to ensure Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-6 that the new regimen is effective. If the regimen is switched because the regimen is failing (see Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ), resistance testing should be performed while a patient is still rec eiving the failing regimen. This optimize s the chance of identifying resistance mutations , because resistant strains may revert to wild type within a few weeks of stopping ARV drugs (see Drug-Resistance Testing in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Clinicians should consider performing phenotypic resistance testing, including co-receptor tropism testing, in addition to genotypic viral resistance testing in children who have experienced prolonged or repeated periods of viral nonsuppression on multiple ARV regimens . 16 Immunologic Monitoring in Children: General Considerations When interpreting CD4 count s and percentage s in children, clinicians must consider age as a factor. CD4 count and percentage values in healthy infants without HIV are considerably higher than values observed in adults without HIV ; these infant values slowly decline to adult values by age 5 years . An analysis from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers (HPPM) Collaborative S tudy found that CD4 percentage provided little or no additional prognostic value compared with CD4 count regarding short -term disease progression in children aged <5 years; similar results were reported in a study of older children.17 The current pediatric HIV disease classification is based on absolute CD4 count , which is the preferred assay for monitoring and estimating the risk for disease progression and OI s18 (see Table A . HIV Infection Stage Based on Age -Specific CD4 Count or Percentage in Appendix C: CDC P ediatric HIV CD4 Cell Count/Percentage and HIV -Related Diseases Categorization ). In children with HIV, as in adults with HIV, CD4 count and percentage decline as HIV infection progresses; patients with lower CD4 count s or percentage values have a poorer prognosis than patients with higher values (see Tables A -C in Appendix D : Supplemental Information). Medical practice guidelines now recommend that all people with HIV receive ART, regardless of their CD4 count and clinical stage. However, CD4 counts are used to determine risk profiles that affect the urgency of recommendations for when to initiate therapy in a n ART -naive child with H IV infection and when to ini tiate OI prophylaxis (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral -Naive Children ). A meta -analysis f rom the HPPM Collaborative Study generated plots that can be used to estimate the short -term risk of progression to AIDS or death in the absence of effective ART , according to age and the most recent CD4 percentage/absolute CD4 count or HIV RNA viral load measurement.19 CD4 count s and percentages can show considerable intrapatient variation.20 Mild intercurrent illness, the receipt of vaccinations, or exercise can produce a transient decrease in CD4 count and percentage; thus, CD4 count and percentage are best measured when patients are clinically stable. Clinical decisions, especially those regarding therapy changes, should be made in response to confirmed changes in CD4 count or percentage in conjunction with a confirmed viral load determination. The CD4 count or percentage and viral load measurement should be confirmed by performing these tests a second time , at least 1 week after the first tests . HIV RNA Monitoring in Children: General Considerations Quantitative HIV RNA assays measure the plasma concentration of HIV RNA as copies/mL . Without therapy, plasma viral load initially rises to peak level during the period of primary infection in adults and adolescents, and then declines by as much as 2 to 3 log 10 copies to reach a stable lower level (the virologic set point) approximately 6 to 12 months after acute infection .21,22 In adults with HIV, the virologic set point correlates with the subsequent risk of disease progression or death in the absence of therapy.23 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-7 The pattern of change in plasma viral load in untreated infants with perinatal HIV differs from that in adults and adolescents with HIV. High plasma viral load s persist in untreated children for prolonged periods .24,25 In one prospective study of infant s with perinatal infection who wer e born prior to ARV drug availability for children , plasma viral loads generally were low at birth (i.e., <10,000 copies/mL), increased to high values by age 2 months (most infants had values >100,000 copies/mL, ranging from undetectable to nearly 10 million copies/mL), and then decreased slowly with a mean plasma viral load of 185,000 copies/mL during the first year of life .26 After the first year of life, plasma v iral load slowly declined during the next few years .26-29 Viral load during the first 12 to 24 months after birth showed an average decline of approximately 0.6 log 10 copies/mL per year, followed by an average decline of 0.3 log 10 copies/mL per year until age 4 to 5 years . This pattern probably reflects the lower efficiency of a developing immune system in containing viral replication and, possibly, the rapid expansion of HIV -susceptible cells that occurs with somatic growth. 30 Despite the established association between high plasma viral load and disease progression, a specific HIV RNA concentration has only moderate predictive value for disease progression and death in an individual child.28 Plasma viral load may be difficult to interpret during the first year of life, because values are high and are less predictive of disease progression risk than those in older children.25 In both children and adults with HIV, CD4 count or percentage and plasma viral load are independent predictors of disease progression and mortality risk, and us ing the two markers together more accurately define prognosis .28,29,31,32 Methodological Considerations When Interpreting and Compar ing HIV RNA Assays Based on accumulated experience with currently a vailable assays, the current definition of virologic suppression is a plasma viral load that is below the quantification limit of the assay used (generally <20 copies/mL to 75 copies/mL). This definition of suppression has been much more thoroughly investi gated in adults with HIV than in children with HIV (see the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Temporary viral load elevations ( \"blips \") that are between the level of detection and 200 copies/mL to 500 copies/mL are often detected in adults33 and children who are on ART34; these temporary elevations do not represent virologic failure as long as the values have return ed to below the level of detection when testing is repeated . For definitions and management of virologic treatment failure, see Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure . These definitions of virologic suppression and virologic failure are recommended for clinical use. Research protocols or surveillance programs may use different definitions. Several different methods can be used for quantitating HIV RNA, each of which has a different level of sensitivity (see Table 6 below). Although the results of the assays are corre lated, the absolute HIV RNA copy number obtained from a single specimen tested by two different assays can differ by 0.3 log 10 copies/mL (a two fold difference) or more .35-37 Because different assays use different methods to measure HIV RNA, and because the tests have different levels of sensitivity, clinicians should consistently use a single HIV RNA assay method to monitor an indi vidual patient when possible . 38-40 The predominant HIV-1 subtype in the United States is subtype B, and early assay s were designed to detect this subtype . Current kit configurations for all companies have been designed to detect and quantitate essentially all viral subtypes (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children ). This ability is important in many regions of the world where non-B subtypes are predominant , as well as in the United States where a small subset of individuals contract non-B viral subtypes .38,41-45 It is Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-8 particularly relevant for immigrant and adopted children who are born outside the United States or to non-U .S.-born parents. Biologic variation in plasma viral load within one person is well documented. In adults, repeated measurement s of plasma viral load using the same assay can produce results that vary by as much as 0.5 log 10 copies/mL (a three fold difference) in either direction during the course of a day or on different days .31,36 This biologic variation may be greater in infants and young children with HIV. This inherent biologic variability must be considered when interpreting changes in plasma viral load in children. Thus, after repeated testing , only differences >0.7 log 10 copi es/mL (a five fold difference) in infants aged < 2 years and differences >0.5 log 10 copies/mL (a threefold difference) in children aged 2 years should be considered reflective of plasma viral load changes that are biologically and clinically s ignificant . Generally, no change in ARV treatment should be made as a result of a change in plasma viral load , unless the change is confirmed by a second measurement. Because of the complexities of HIV RNA testing and the age -related changes in plasma viral load in children, c linicians should consult an expert in pediatric HIV infection when making clinical decisions based on plasma viral loads. Genetic Testing for Management of HIV Modern disease intervention strategies often employ genetic testing to evaluate the g enes of humans and pathogens. This approach to treatment is an important component in the rise of precision medicine. Clinicians who manage HIV have routinely probed HIV genetic sequences for mutations that are associated with HIV drug resistance. Some ARV drugs are metabolized differently based on specific human genotypes. For example, studies have shown that certain genotypes can affect efavirenz exposure in young children.46,47 In addition, some human genetic polymorphisms are associated with drug toxicity or AEs (e.g., using HLA -B*5701 testing to predict ABC hypersensitivity)48; for more information, see the Abacavir section in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . Future clinical practice will likely feature broader applications of multiple forms of genetic testing to guide management of health and disease. Table 5.

Genotype resistance testing is recommended if it has not already been performed ( see Drug - Resistance Testing in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Send tests that are appropriate for the toxicit y profile, which is associated with the patient's ARV regimen and the patient's medical history . c If ART is initiated within 30 to 90 days of a pre- therapy laboratory result, repeat testing may not be necessary. d CD4 count , CBC , and chemistries can be monitored less frequently (every 6- 12 months) in children and youth who are adherent to therapy , who have CD4 count values that are well above the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, and who have had sustained vir ologic suppression and stable clinical status for more than 2 to 3 years . Viral load testing every 3 to 4 months is generally recommended to monitor ARV adherence. e If lipid levels have been abnormal in the past, more frequent monitoring m ay be needed. For patients treated with TDF , more frequent urinalysis should be considered. f Pay special attention to changes in weight that might occur after altering an ARV regimen. Weight gain or weight loss may occur when using some ARV drugs (see Table 15h. Lipodystrophies and Weight Gain ). g Virtual visits may be appropriate at some time points, particularl y for adherence assessments and for visits for established patients, see Table 4 above. h Chemistries refer to a comprehensive metabolic panel.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-1 When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral -Naive Children Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel's Recommendations Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in all infants and children with HIV infection (AI for children aged <3 months , AI* for older children) . o Rapid ART initiation (defined as initiating ART immediately or within days of HIV diagnosis) , accompanied by a discussion of the importance of adherence and provision of subsequent adherence support , is recommended for all children with HIV. If a child with HIV has not initiated ART, health care providers should closely monitor the virologic, immu nologic, and clinical status at least every 3 to 4 months (AIII) .

Multiple studies have shown a benefit to early antiretroviral therapy (ART ) initiation ,1-3 and that ART initiation with in the first year of life is associated with reduce d size of viral reservoir s.4-8 Ongoing viral replication may be associated with persistent inflammation and the development of cardiovascular, kidney, and liver disease and malignancy; studies in adults suggest that early control of viral replication may reduce the risk of these non-AIDS complications.9-13 In addition to the health benefits of rapid treatment initiation , which is defined as therapy that is initiated immediately or within days of HIV diagnosis, treatment initiation in young infants with HIV during the early stages of infection may control viral replication before HIV can evolve into di verse and potentially more pathogenic quasi -species.14 Initiation of therapy at higher CD4 counts has been associated with the presence of fewer drug- resistan t mutations at virologic failure in adults.15 Early therapy also preserves immune function and prevent s clinical disease progression.16-18 Survival and Health Benefits Associated with Early Initiation of ART The Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER ) trial was a randomized clinical trial in South Africa that initiated triple -drug ART in asymptomatic infants aged 6 to 12 weeks with perinatally acquired HIV and normal CD4 percentages (>25%). Immed iate initiation of ART resulted in a 75% reduction in early mortality among these infants, compared with delaying treatment until the infants met clinical or immune criteria . 2 Consistent with the CHER trial, data from a number of Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-2 observational studies in the United States , Europe , and South Africa demonstrate d that infants who receive d early treatment were less likely to progress to AIDS or death, and they also ha d improved grow th compared with those who start ed treatment later.19-22 In general, studies that evaluat e later initiation of ART in children have a selection bias , because children with perinatal infection and rapidly progressing disease may have died prior to receiving an HIV diagnosis or ART , and children who present later for ART initiation may be slower progressors with a better prognosis. However , a general trend toward lower mortality and better growth with earlier ART initiation was reported in an evaluation of observational data from 20,756 ART -naive children aged 1 year to 16 years at enrollment from 19 cohorts in Europe, Southern Africa, and West Africa.1 Children aged <10 years at enrollment had lower mortality and higher mean height -for-age z score after 5 years of follow -up among participants who initiated ART immediately than those who delayed treatment until their CD4 counts decreased to <350 cells/mm3. The multicenter, open-label Pediatric Randomised Early versus Deferred Initiation in Cambodia and Thailand (PREDICT) trial randomized 300 children with HIV aged 1 year to 12 years at enrollment (median age 6.4 years) to immediately initiate ART or to defer treatment until their CD4 percentage was <15%; the study reported better height gain among children who started ART immediately.23 Similarly, other studies have reported an association between younger age at initiation of ART and more rapid growth reconstitution.20,24-26 Studies conducted in and outside the United States have reported an association between delayed ART initiation and delay of pubertal development and menarche.27-29 In a study of Zimbabwean children (median age 11 years), earlier ART initiation and improved nutrit ion were positively associated with improved lung function.30 Finally, among 32 youths with perinatally acquired HIV from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS), DNA methylation evaluat ing epigenetic aging was compared to chronologic aging over time. Higher viral load and lower CD4 count w ere associated with epigenetic aging that exceeded chronologic aging, highlight ing the value of achieving early viral suppression and maintaining or reconstituting immune func tion as close to an HIV diagnosis as possible .31 Neurodevelopmental Benefits Associated with Early Initiation of ART A CHER trial substudy found that infants who initiated ART early had significantly better gross motor and neurodevelopmental profiles than those whose therapy was deferred.32 In a cohort from Thailand , the prevalence of global developmental impairment was 22% (95% confide nce interval [CI], 11% to 27%) among children with HIV who initiated ART within 3 months of birth, compared with 44% (95% CI, 23% to 66%) amon g children who initiated ART from 3 to 12 months.33 A study of South African infants with perinatal HIV infection who initiated ART within 21 days of life (median 6 days) found that neurodevelopmental scores at 11 months of age for these infants were within the normal range.34 Immune Benefits Associated with Early Initiatio n of ART In the CHER study, infants who were treated early had decreased immune activation, greater recovery of CD4 cells , expanded CD4-na ive T cells, and retention of innate effector frequencies, resulting in greater immune reconstitution than that achieved in infants who received deferred ART .18 In a small study in Botswana , infants who initiat ed ART within the first 7 days of life were found to have decreased immune activation, a more polyfunctional HIV -1-specific CD8 cell response, and a markedly reduced HIV latent reservoir, compared with infants who initiat ed ART later in the first year of life .7 Among two cohorts of South African infants with HIV, those who initiated ART at ages <6 months had better sustained viral control after achieving suppression than infants who start ed ART between 6 and 24 months.3 Available data suggest that both children and adults who initiate Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-3 treatment with a higher CD4 percentage or CD4 count have better immune recovery than patient s who initiate treatment with lower CD4 percentages or CD4 counts.25,35-37 Among 1,236 children with perinatally acquired HIV in the United States, only 36% of those who started ART with CD4 percentages <15% achieved CD4 percentages >25% after 5 years of therapy, compared with 59% of children who started with CD4 percentages of 15% to 24%.38 Finally, earlier age at ART initiation results in higher rates of CD4:CD8 ratio normaliz ation and improved immunogenicity of childhood vaccines .39-41 Early initiation of suppressive ART (i.e., in infants aged <6 months) results in a significant proportion of infants with HIV who fail to produce their own HIV -specific antibodies. These infants appear to be HIV -seronegative when tested; however, viral reservoirs remain, and viral rebound occurs if AR T is stopped. 42-46 Viral Suppression and Viral Reservoir s with Early Initiation of ART Early initiation of ART within the first 7 days of life , compared with initiation between 8 and 28 days of life, resulted in a fourfold faster time to viral suppression among infants in a multinational study.47 Similarly, in a European and Thai cohort of infants w ith perinatal HIV acquisition and treatment initiation <6 months of age, multivariable analysis showed that younger age at ART initiation (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78-0.91 ] per month older) was found to be a predictor of faster virological suppression.48 Other studies have reported that early treatment of infants with perinatal ly acqui red HIV is also associated with reduc ed size of viral reservoirs.49 For example, several s tudies that compared the si ze of viral reservoirs in children who i nitiated ART before age 12 weeks with those in chi ldren who initiated ART at 12 weeks to 2 years of age found that viral reser voir size (as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cell [PBMC ] HIV DNA levels) after 1 year and 4 years of ART significantly correlated with the age at ART initiation and the age at viral control. 50-52 Among children in the Early -treated Perinatally HIV -infected indi viduals : Novel Immunotherapeutic Strategie s (EPIICAL ) Consortium who initiated ART at a median of 2.3 (interquartile range [IQR ] 1.2-4.1) months of age, earlier initiation was associated with lower viral reservoir size, with a 1 -month delay in ART initiation associated with a 13% increase in HIV -1 DNA.5 In addition, 27 children ( also in the EPIICAL cohort ) who initiated ART before 2 years of age and maintained a viral load <50 copies/mL for more than 5 years had reduced total HIV -1 DNA levels measured at a median of 12 years after treatment initiation (IQR 7.3-15.4), with younger age and viral load at the t ime of ART initiation each associated with lower reservoir level s.53 Finally, am ong 11 infants in the CHER tri al who initiated ART between 2.0 and 11.1 months of age and maintained sustained viral suppression, proviral ampli fication and sequencing of DNA from PBMCs obtained 6 and 9 years after treatment initiation detected only seven (1%) proviral replication competent sequences among three children who initiated treatment after 2.3 months of age, whereas no replication competent proviral sequences were detecte d in four children who initiated treatment prior to 2.3 months of age.54 A study of 145 early -treated infants from South Africa4 found that the risk of viral rebound to >50 copies/mL was twofold higher (P = 0.0006) in the first 36 months after treatment initiation for infants with baseline HIV DNA reservoir levels >55 copies/106 cells than for infants with HIV DNA reservoir levels 55 copies/106 cells. These findings may indicate that initiating ART soon after an infant acquires HIV can limit the size of the HIV viral reservoir, and that smaller reservoirs provide some level of protection against viral rebound in the setting of treatment nonadherence \u2014a frequent event for infants with HIV who are destined for lifelong treatment. Furthermore, near-complete control of viral replication has been reported in infants who initiated ART early and who had sustained control of plasma viremia .42,55 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-4 The report of a prolonged remission in a child wi th perinatally acquired HIV in Mississippi generated discussion about early initiation of ART as presumptive treatment in newborns at high risk of HIV acquisition . This newborn, born to a n ART -naive mother, was treated with a three -drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimen at age 30 hours , which was continued following diagnostic testing that confirm ed HIV infection. ART was given through age 18 months when the parent discontinued the child's treatment . Intensive follow -up virologic evaluations were negative until 27 months after ART discontinuation\u2014when the plasma viral load rebounded to 16,750 copies /mL\u2014confirmed with repeat testing. ART was restarted with rapid achievement of viral suppression .56,57 A second child from the C HER study with HIV -1 viral load of >750,000 copies/mL at 3 9 days of life was randomized to ART initiation at 61 days of age for 40 weeks. As of 2019, at the age of 9.5 years, the child remains off ART and HIV-1 is detectable only at very low levels (plasma RNA 6.6 copies/mL), and no replication competent virus is detectable .58 These experiences have prompted increasing support for initiating treatment as soon as the diagnosis is made , and if possible, during the first weeks of life to limit reservoir formation and possibly facilitate ART -free remission . Although a limited number of case reports describe lengthy remissions in children with perinatally acquired HIV who have undergone treatment interruption, current ARV regimens have not been shown to eradicate HIV infection, because HIV persists in CD4 cells and other long-lived cells.58-61 For these reasons, the Panel does not recommend empiric treatment interruption outside of a clinical trial setting . Managing treatment in neonates with HIV is complex from a medical and social perspe ctive. Because of limited safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data for ARV drugs in full -term infants aged <2 weeks and preterm infants aged 4 weeks , drug and dose selection in this age group is challenging62,63 (see What to Start and Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection ). Hepatic and renal function are immature in newborns who are undergoing rapid maturational changes during the first few months of life , which can result in substantial differences in ARV dose requirements between young infants and older children.64,65 When drug concentrations are subtherapeutic \u2014either because of inadequate dosing, poor absorption, or incomplete adherence \u2014ARV drug resistance can develop rapidly, particularly in young infants who experience high levels of viral replication. Frequent follow -up for dose optimization during periods of rapid growth is especially important when treating young infants. Furthermore, clinicians should continually assess a patient's adherence and address potential barriers to adherence during this time (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents Living with HIV ). Summary Multiple studies have reported that early ART initiation is associated with immune, growth, and neurodevelopmental benefits. In addition, early ART initiation may limit the formation of the viral reservoir. The Panel recommends rapid initiation of ART (defined as initiating ART immediately or within days of HIV diagnosis) for all children who receive an HIV diagnosis. The urgency of rapid ART initiation is especially critical for children aged < 1 year who carry the highest risk of rapid disease pro gression and mortality. However, it is worth noting that treatment of full -term infants aged 2 weeks and preterm infants is complex due to limited PK data and appropriate dosing of ARV drugs in this age group; this is an area of active investigation (see Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection ).63 In ART -naive children and adolescents with tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis, the Panel recommends initiation of treatment for the opportunistic infection first , ahead of ART initiation, with ART initiated within 2 to 8 weeks thereafter. However, appropriate timing of ART initiation in these cases should be discussed with a pediatric HIV specialist. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-5 While ART is being initiated, it is important to assess and discuss issues associated with adherence with caregivers and, when developmentally appropriate , with children. Intensive follow -up during the first few weeks to months after ART initiation is also recommend ed to support the child and caregiver. Medication adherence is the core requirement for successful virologic control. The Panel recognizes that achieving consistent adherence in children is often challenging.66,67 Incomplete adherence leads to loss of viral control and the selection of drug-resistant m utations, but forcibly administrating ARV drugs to younger children may result in treatment aversion , which often persists into adulthood. T he need for lifelong therapy also can lead to treatment fatigue, which occurs during adolescence among many children with perinatally acquired HIV .68 The Panel believes the benefits of early ART initiation outweigh the potential risks and recommends rapid initiat ion of ART in all children with HIV, regardless of clinical, immunologic, or virologic status . However, individual clinical and/or psychosocial factors may lead patients, caregivers, and providers to make a collaborative decision to defer ART . When making the decision to defer ART , medical factors \u2014such as the opportunity to limit seeding of the viral reservoir in newborns, the child's HIV disease stage ,69 and the presence of HIV -related signs and symptoms70\u2014need to be balanced against any potential barriers to rapid ART initiation. If ART is deferred, the health care provider should continue to educate and work with the family to overcome barriers to treatment , as well as closely monitor the child's virologic, immunologic, and clinical status at least every 3 to 4 months (AIII) (see Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). Clinicians should initiate ART in children with HIV in whom treatment has been deferred when \u2014 HIV RNA levels increase , CD4 count or percentage values decline (e.g., approaching Centers for D isease Control and Prevention Stage 2 or 3),69 The child develops new HIV -related clinical symptoms ,70 or The ability of a caregiver and child to adhere to the prescribed regimen improves .

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-1 What to Start: Regimens Recommended for Initial Therapy of Antiretroviral -Naive Children Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel's Recommendations The selection of an initial antiretroviral (ARV) regimen should be individualized based on several factors, including the characteristics of the proposed regimen, the patient's characteristics, drug efficacy, potential adverse effects, patient and family preferences, and the results of viral resistance t esting (AIII) . For treatment -naive children, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) recommends initiating antiretroviral therapy with three drugs: a dual -nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptas e inhibitor inhibitor (AI*) . Table 7 below provides a list of Panel -recommended ARV regimens that are designated as Preferred or Alternative; recommendations vary by a patient's age, weight, and sexual maturity rating. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or mor e well- designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Criteria Used for Recommendations In general, the recommendations of the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) are based on reviews of pediatric and adult clinical trial data published in peer-reviewed journals, data prepared by manufacturers for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review, and data presented in abstract format at major scientific meeti ngs. Few randomized, Phase 3 clinical trials of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pediatric patients have directly compared different treatment regimens. Most pediatric drug data come from Phase 1/2 safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) trials and nonrandomized, open-label studies. In general, even in studies of adults, assessment of drug efficacy and potency is primarily based on surrogate marker endpoints, such as CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and viral load . The Panel continually modifies recommendations on optimal initial therapy for children as new data become available, as new therapies or drug formulations are developed, and as additional toxicities are recognized. When developing recommendations for specific drugs or regimens, the Panel considers the fol lowing information: Data demonstrating durable viral suppression, immunologic improvement, and clinical improvement (when available) with the drug or regimen, preferably in children, as well as adults; The extent of pediatric experience with a specific drug or regimen; Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-2 The incidence and types of short -term and long- term drug toxicity in people who are taking the drug or regimen, focusing on toxicities that are reported in children; The availability and acceptability of formulations that are appropriate for pediatric use, including palatability, ease of preparation (e.g., syrups vs. powders), pill size, and the number of pills or volume of oral solution needed for an appropriate dose; Dosing frequency, and food and fluid requirements; and The potential for drug interactions with other medications. The Panel classifies recommended drugs or drug combinations into one of two categories: Preferred: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as Preferred for use in treatment -naive children when clini cal trial data in children or, more often, in adults have demonstrated optimal and durable efficacy with acceptable toxicity and ease of use , and when pediatric studies using surrogate markers have demonstrated safety and appropriate drug exposure. Additional considerations are listed above. Alternative: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as Alternative for initial therapy when clinical trial data in children or adults show efficacy, but the drugs or drug combinations have disadvantages when compared with Preferred regimens. Drugs or drug combinations may be classified as Alternative for use in treatment -naive children if they are less effective or durable than a Preferred regimen in adults or children; if specific concerns exist about toxicity, dosing, formulation, administration, or interaction; or if experience with the use of these drugs or drug combinations in children is limited . Factors to Consider When Selecting an Initial Regimen An antiretroviral (ARV) regimen for children should generally consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an active drug from one of the following classes: an integrase a boosted protease inhibitor (PI). Choice of a regimen should be individualized based on several factors, including the characteristics of the proposed regimen; the patient's age, weight, sexual maturity rating (SMR), a nd other characteristics; and the results of drug- resistance testing. Drug recommendations often include both age and weight limitations. Although age can be used as a rough guide, body weight (when available) is the preferred determinant for selecting a s pecific drug. An exception to this is infants aged < 14 days. Many drugs that are recommended for use in very young infants do not have dosing recommendations for premature infants. Additional information regarding dosing recommendations in this population can be found in Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection . The adva ntages and disadvantages of each regimen are described in detail in the sections that follow and in Table 8 below . Additional information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of specific drug combinations can be found in the What to Start section of the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines . Specific information about the clinical efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and dosing recommendations for each drug can be found in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . In addition, clinicians should consider potential barriers to adherence. These barriers may include complex dosing schedules, food requirements, palatabili ty problems , and the need to use multiple formulations to achieve an appropriate dose. Counseling patients and caregivers about adherence to therapy is essential for successful ART. The Panel recommends rapid initiation of ART (defined as initiating ART immediately or within days of diagnosis ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-3 (TAF) antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and should be considered for use in chi ldren with HBV/HIV coinfection. For a comprehensive review , see the Hepatitis B Virus ,, Hepatitis C Virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) sections of the Pediatric Opportunistic Infection Guidelines . Choosing an Initial Antiretroviral Regimen for Children with HIV Preferred regimens for initial AR V therapy include INSTI -based, NNRTI-based, or boosted PI-based regimens. A regimen shoul d be chosen after considering the patient's individual characteristics (especially age), the results of drug-resistance testing, potential AEs, pill size, and dosing frequency. Adherence to a prescribed regimen is necessary; therefore, the preferences of t he patient and caregivers also should be considered when choosing a regimen. Clinical trial data in children provide some guidance for choosing between an NNRTI-based regimen and a PI-based regimen for initial therapy. Three pediatric studies have compared an NNRTI -based regimen to a PI-based regimen, and results varied based on the age of the population studied and the specific drug used within the class. The IMPACT (International Maternal Pediatric adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials) P1060 study demonstrated the superiority of a lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based regimen over a nevirapine (NVP) -based regimen in infants and children aged 2 months to 35 months, regardless of maternal or infant expos ure to peripartum, single -dose NVP prophylaxis. In children with prior NVP exposure, 21.7% of children receiving the LPV/r -based regimen experienced death, virologic failure, or toxicity by Week 24 compared with 39.6% of children receiving the NVP -based regimen. For children with no prior NVP exposure, death, virologic failure, and toxicity occurred in 18.4% of children receiving the LPV/r-based regimen and in 40.1% of children receiving the NVP -based regimen.1 Those in the NVP group demonstra ted greater, but not statistically significant, improvements in CD4 counts and growth parameters. However, improvements in CD4 counts were maintained only up to 1 year after initiation of ART. 2 Similar improved immune and growth paramete rs were reported in the Nevirapine Resistance (NEVEREST ) study, where these parameters were compared in children who were switched to a n NVP -containing regimen and those who were continued on a n LPV/r -containing regimen after achieving virologic suppression.3 Improvements in metabolic parameters also have been seen in children who were switched from LPV/r to efavirenz (EFV) at or after 3 years of age. 4 PENPACT -1 (PENTA 9/PACTG 390) compared a PI -based regimen and a n NNRTI -based regime n in treatment-naive children aged 30 days to <18 years (the study did not dictate the use of specific NNRTI s or PIs ). In the PI-based regimen group, 49% of children received LPV/r and 48% received nelfinavir; in the NNRTI-based regimen group, 61% of children received EFV and 38% received NVP. After 4 years of follow -up, 73% of children who were randomized to receive PI-based therapy and 70% who were randomized to receive NNRTI-based therapy remained on their initial ARV regimen. In both groups, 5 82% of children had viral loads <400 copies/mL. The PROMOTE pediatrics trial demonstrated comparable virologic efficacy among children who were randomized to receive either an NNRTI -based or a n LPV/r -based ARV regimen.6 Children were aged 2 months to <6 years and had no perinatal exposure to NVP. Selection of the NNRTI was based on age (children aged <3 years received NVP, and those aged >3 years primarily received EFV). The proportion of children with viral loads <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks was 80% Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-4 in the LPV/r arm versus 76% in the NNRTI arm, a difference of 4% that was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI], -9% to +17%). Clinical investigation of INSTI -based regimens in children has been limited to noncomparative studies that have evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PKs of these drugs. The recommendation for using an INSTI as part of an initial regimen is based largely on extrapolation from adult comparative trials \u2014which showed that INSTI-containing regimens have superior efficacy when compared to PI- containing and NNRTI- containing regimens7,8\u2014and small studies in ART -naive adolescents.9 When combined with two NRTIs, the following drugs and drug combinations are considered Preferred initial regimens for children: Newborns aged <14 days: NVP Newborns aged < 4 weeks and weighing 2 kg: Raltegravir (RAL) Newborns aged 14 days to < 4 weeks : LPV/r Infants and c hildren aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg: Dolutegravir (DTG) Children aged 2 years and weighing 14 kg: DTG or Bictegravir (BIC). BIC is available only as a component of the fixed -dose combination (FDC ) tablet BIC/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF). Preferred initial r egimen s by age, w eight, and drug c lass are shown in Figure 1 below . Additional information about Preferred initial regimens, Preferred NRTI backbones, lternat ive initial regimens , and Alternative NRTI backbones are shown in detail in Table 7 approved by the FDA for treating ARV-na ive adults and children with HIV. INSTI -based regimens have quickly become the recommended regimens in adults due to their virologic efficacy, lack of drug interactions, and favorable toxicity profile. RAL is approved for the treatment of infants and children from birth onward with a weight of 2 kg. DTG is approved by the FDA for use in infants and children aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. The FDC tablet BIC/FTC/TAF (Biktarvy) is approved by the FDA for use in children weighing 14 kg. EVG has been studied in adolescents in two FDC regimens and in combination with two NRTIs and ritonavir (RTV , r) boosting. BIC and DTG, the second -generation INSTIs, have higher barriers to resistance than the first -generation INSTIs RAL and EVG10,11 and may have more activity against non-B subtypes of HIV.12,13 Table 8 below lists the advantages and disadvantages of using INSTIs. See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed pediatric information on each drug. Preferred and Alternative INSTIs are presented in alphabetical order below. Bictegravir BIC/ FTC/TAF was approved by the FDA in 2018 for use in adults and in 2019 for use in children or adolescents weighing 25 kg. In October 2021, a lower strength formulation of BIC/FTC/TAF received FDA approval for use in children weighing 14 kg to <25 kg. BIC/FTC/TAF is approved for use in patients who are ART naive, and it also can be used to replace the current ARV regimen in patients who have been virologically suppressed (viral load <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-5 regimen, with no history of treatment failure , and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of the FDC tablet. BIC/FTC/TAF has been studied in adolescents (Cohort 1) aged 12 years to <18 years and weighing 35 kg and in two younger cohorts of children : Cohort 2, a ged 6 years to <12 years who weighed 25 kg, and Cohort 3, aged 2 years and who weighed 14 kg to <25 kg. All participants had maintained viral loads <50 copies/mL for 6 months. Cohorts 1 and 2 received the adult formulation of BIC/FTC/TAF. Children in Cohort 3 received BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg. Overall, the drug was well tolerated in all participants in all cohorts. Drug exposure in all cohorts was similar to the exposure observed in adults. At 24 weeks, all 50 adolescents and 50 children in Cohort s and 2 maintained viral suppression and at W eek 48, 49 of 50 participants in each cohort maintained suppression.14-18 Among children in Cohort 3, after 24 weeks, all 12 participants maintained viral suppression.17,18 Recommendation BIC/FTC/TAF is recommended as a Preferred INSTI -based regimen for children aged 2 years and weighing 14 kg (AI* ). The Panel bases this recommendation on the virologic potency and safety profile observed for this combination in adult and pediatric studies. Dolutegravir DTG is approved by the FDA for use in infants and children 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. This recomme ndation is based on PK and safety data from two ongoing clinical trials (IMPAACT P1093 and ODYSSEY), as well as a study of treatment -experienced (but INS TI-naive ) older children.9,19-21 Early data from Botswana about the use of DTG around the time of conception showed a small significant increase in the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) that has decreased over time.17,22,2324 In the most recent analysis of data from this study, the prevalence of NTDs did not differ significantly between women receiving DTG and non-DTG regimens. .24 For additional information, refer to Teratogenicity , Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy , and Appendix C: Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers in the Perinatal Guidelines . Recommendation DTG plus a two -NRTI backbone is recommended as a Preferred INSTI -based regimen for infants, children, and adolescents aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg (AI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on the virologic potency and safety profile observed for this combination in adult and pediatric studies. 7,9,21,25,26 Early concerns about the potential increased risk of NTDs with the use of DTG in women who were receiving DTG at the time of conception have decreased substantially. The Panel for Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents and the Panel on Treatment of HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission include DTG among the preferred ARV agents for use in people of childbearing potential and for use by people who are pregnant or are trying to conceive. P ediatric and adolescent care providers should discuss risks and benefits with patients (and their caregivers ) who are receiving or initiating DTG so that they can make informed decisions about the use of DTG ( see Appendix C: Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers in the Perinatal Guidelines ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-6 Elvitegravir EVG is an INSTI that is available as a single -drug tablet, an FDC tablet that contains EVG/c obicistat (COBI, /FTC/TDF, FDC tablet that contains EVG/c/FTC /TAF. Both FDC tablets are approved by the FDA for use in ART -naive adults with HIV. EVG/c/ FTC/TAF is approved for use in ART -naive children and adolescents weighing 25 kg. COBI, c is a specific, potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor that has no activity against HIV . It is used as a PK enhancer, which allows once - daily dosing of EVG. Recommendation EVG/c/FTC /TAF is recommended as an Alternative INSTI -based regimen for children a nd adolescents weighing 25 kg who have creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30 mL/min (AI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on the virologic potency and safety profile observed for this combination in adult and adolescent studies . The Panel does not recommend EVG/c/FTC/TAF as a Preferred INSTI -based regimen because EVG has a lower barrier to resistance compared with BIC or DTG and the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions from COBI .27-31 Raltegravir RAL is approved by the FDA for treatment of infants and children weighing 2 kg, and it can be used starting at birth. It is available in film -coated tablets, chewable tablets, and single-use packets of granules for oral suspension. Clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection when i nitiating RAL -based treatment regimens in neonates, infants, and very young children. Additional information can be found in Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection . Recommendation RAL plus a two-NRTI backbone is recommended as a Preferred INSTI -based regimen for infants and children from birth to age 4 weeks who weigh 2 kg (AI*). It is an Alternative INSTI -based regimen for children aged 4 week s due to its twice -daily dosing requirement and lower barrier to resistance compared with other INSTIs (AI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on data from randomized clinical trials in adults and pediatric studies that were performed largely in ARV -experienced children and adolescents.7,32-40 Currently, the Panel does not recommend once -daily dosing of RAL for initial therapy in children and infants. Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-Based Regimens Doravirine (DOR; for children weighing 35 kg), E FV (for children aged 3 months), etravirine (ETR; for children a ged 6 years), NVP (for children aged 15 days), and rilpivirine (RPV; for children aged 12 years) have been approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV infection in pediatric patients. NNRTIs have a long half- life that allows less frequent drug administrati on; a lower risk of dyslipidemia and fat maldistribution than some agents in the PI class ; and, generally, a lower pill burden than PIs. However, a single viral mutation can confer high-level drug resistance to all NNRTIs except ETR , and cross -resistance t o other NNRTIs is common. Rare, but serious and potentially life -threatening, skin and hepatic toxicity can occur with the use of all NNRTI drugs, but these AEs are most frequently observed in patients taking NVP , at least among adults with HIV. NNRTIs have the potential to interact with other drugs that are also metabolized via hepatic Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-7 enzymes; however, these drug interactions are less frequent with NNRTIs than with boosted-PI regimens. Table 8 below lists the advantages and disadvantages of using NNRTIs. See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed pediatric information for each drug. Preferred and Alternative NNRTIs are presented in alphabetical order below. Doravirine DOR is available both as a single -drug tablet and an FDC tablet that contains DOR 100 mg/3TC 300 mg/TDF 300 mg, marketed as Delstrigo . Efficacy studies in adults have demonstrated that DOR/3TC/TDF to EFV -based regimens and darunavir (DRV)-based regimens. Virologic efficacy of DOR was similar in patients with higher viral loads >100,000 copies/mL as to those with viral loa ds 100,000 copies/mL. DOR , more so than EFV , compared favorably to the other drugs in these trials in terms of AE s (including better central nervous system tolerability ) and is recommended as initial ART in adults with certain clinical situations . The FDC tablet has been studied in 45 adolescents age d 12 years to 17 years and weighing 45 kg. Of these adolescents , 43 were virologically suppressed and 2 were ART -naive. After 24 weeks of treatment, the regimen was well tolerated , with a low incidence of drug- related AEs (2.2%; 95% CI, 0.1-11.8). None of the AE s were serious or led to regimen discontinuation. HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL was demonstrated in all participants except for one ART -naive participant who met the criteria for virologic failure based on poor adherence to the study regimen. 44 Recommendation DOR plus a two -NRTI backbone is recommended as an Alternative NNRTI -based regimen for initial treatment of HIV in children and adolescents weighing 35 kg (BI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on data from studies that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of this drug in adults ,41-43 as well as early findings from pediatric PK studies .44 Efavirenz Although EFV dosing recommendations are available for patients aged 3 months and weighing 3.5 kg, t he Panel does not endorse the use of this drug in infants and children aged 3 months to 3 years because the PKs of EFV in very young patients can be highly variable. There may be a role for use of EFV in children aged <3 years who have HIV and TB coinfection, because EFV is one of the few ARVs with minimal drug-drug interaction.45 Recommendation EFV plus a two-NRTI backbone is recommended as an Alternative NNRTI -based regimen for initial tre atment of HIV in children aged 3 years (AI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on data from studies that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of this drug in adults and children.25,32,46-63 Nevirapine Extensive clinical and safety data exist for the use of NVP in children with HIV, and NVP has shown ARV efficacy when used as a componen t in a variety of combination regimens.1,5,6,64-68 NVP also has been used extensively as prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV transmission in young infants during the peripartum period and during breastfeeding.69 The safety and PKs of NVP have been studied at low doses used for prophylaxis. Less information is currently available from studies in very young infants about the safety and PKs of NVP at the higher doses required for treatment. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-8 Early testing of infants allows HIV infection to be confirmed before 14 days of age. The Panel recommends the use of NVP as a Preferred NNRTI when a clinician plans to initiate treatment before age 14 days. Although early treatment initiation may limit the size of the viral reservoir ,70,71 no clinical trial data currently suggest that initiating treatment within the first 14 days of life improves outcomes compared to starting treatment after age 14 days (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral -Naive Children ). Clinicians should consult an expert in pediatric HIV infection when consi dering the use of NVP in infants aged <14 days. Additional considerations regarding the use of NVP in infants aged <14 days can be found in Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection . Recommendation NVP plus a two-NRTI backbone is recommended as a Preferred NNRTI -based regimen in infants aged <14 days and as an Alternative NNRTI -based regimen for children aged 14 days to <3 years (AI) . Clinicians should consider switching from NVP to LPV/r or RAL in children aged 14 days to < 4 weeks because these drugs are the Preferred ARV agents for this age bracket. LPV/r ha s better clinical outcomes than NVP in children aged <3 years. The Panel recommends switching from NVP to LPV/r in these patients because NVP is associated with rare occurrences of significant hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens -Johnson syndrome, and rare (but potentially life -threatening) instances of hepatitis. N VP also has a low barrier to resistance, and conflicting data exist about the virologic efficacy of NVP -based regimens compared to the efficacy of Preferred regimens.1,5,6,66-68,72-79 Rilpivirine RPV is currently available both as a single -drug tablet and a once -daily FDC tablet that contains FTC/RPV /TDF. The single -drug tablet is approved for use in children and adolescents aged 12 years. RPV also is available as an extended-release injectable suspension in a kit that contain s an extended- release injectable cabotegravir (CAB) suspension. The two -drug regimen of injectable CAB and RPV is approved for treatment of HIV -1 infection in adults with viral suppression; it is not approved for initial therapy . This regimen is under study in adolescents. Recommendation RPV plus a two-NRTI backbone is recomme nded as an Alternative NNRTI -based regimen for children and adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg who have HIV viral loads 100,000 copies/mL (AI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on the limited experience with RPV in adolescents and the larg er body of evidence in adults.53,80-83 Protease Inhibitor Advantages of PI-based regimens include excellent virologic potency and a high barrier to drug resistance ( because multiple mutations are required for a patient to develop resistance). However, because PIs are metabolized via hepatic enzymes, these drugs have the potential for multiple drug interactions. They also may be associated with metabolic complications , such as dyslipidemia, fat maldistribution, and insulin resistance. Factors to consider when selecting a PI -based regimen for treatment -naive children include virologic potency, dosing frequency, pil l burden, food or fluid requirements, the availability of palatable pediatric formulations, the drug interaction profile, the toxicity profile (particularly toxicities related to metabolic complications), the age of the child, and Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-9 the availability of data regarding the use of the drug in children. Table 8 below lists the advantages and disadvantages of using PIs. See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Inform ation for detailed pediatric information on each drug. RTV is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme and can be used in low doses as a PK booster when coadministered with some PIs, increasing drug exposure by prolonging the half-life of the boosted PI. Currently, only LPV/r is available as a coformulated product. In addition, the use of RTV boosting increases the risk of hyperlipidemia84 and drug interactions. COBI is an alternative CYP3A4 inhibitor that also can be used as a booster. It is available in a single -drug tablet and in coformulat ions with atazanavir (ATV) and with DRV. Currently, the single -drug tablet is approved by the FDA for administration with ATV in children weighing 35 kg and for administration with DRV in children weighing 40 kg. Preferred and Alternative PIs are presented in alphabetical order below. Atazanavir Boosted with Ritonavir or Cobicistat ATV is a once -daily PI that was approved by the FDA in March 2008 for use in combination with a two-NRTI backbone in children aged 6 years. A TV is most often boosted with RTV . Approval was extended in 2014 for use in infants and children aged 3 months and weighing 5 kg.85,86 ATV administered in combination with COBI has been approved by the FDA for use in adults (using the single -agent COBI tablet ) and in children weighing 35 kg. Recommendation ATV/r plus a two -NRTI backbone is recommended as a n Alternative PI-based regimen for children aged 3 months (AI*) . ATV/c plus a two-NRTI backbone is an Alternative PI-based regimen for children weighing 35 kg. These regimens have been shown to be virologically potent in adult and pediatric studies and have been well tolerated in pediatric studies. However, the oral powder formulations of ATV and RTV and the oral solution formulation of RTV can be cumbersome to administer.35,49,82,84,87-92 The Panel does not recommend the us e of unboosted ATV. Darunavir Boosted with Ritonavir or Cobicistat DRV/r is approved by the FDA for use in ARV -naive and ARV -experienced children aged 3 years and weighing 10 kg. In addition, once -daily dosing of DRV/r is approved for ARV -naive children aged 3 years and weighing 10 kg, and for ARV-experienced patients who do not have DRV resistance- associated mutations. Once -daily dosing of DRV/r was investigated during a substudy of a twice -daily dosing trial in children aged 3 years to <12 years. This PK evaluation lasted only 2 weeks, after which the participants were switched back to the twice-daily regimen.93 FDA dosing recommendations are based on PK models from this study, but this dose has ne ver undergone trials for clinical efficacy in this age group. A more recent study also suggested that once -daily DRV/r dosing is acceptable for children and adolescents. In this study, the plasma concentration-time curve for DRV/r was substantially lower t han the mean value observed in adults; however, trough levels were similar. Due to these findings, and because of the lack of more information about the efficacy of once -daily DRV/r dosing in ARV-naive and ARV-experienced children aged <12 years, the Panel recommends a twice-daily dose of DRV/r in children aged >3 years to <12 years. 94 DRV administered in combination with COBI has been approved by the FDA for use in adults (using the single -agent COBI tablet ) and in children weighing 40 kg. 95 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-10 Recommendation DRV/r plus a two-NRTI backbone is recommended as an Alternative PI -based regimen for children aged 3 years and weighing 10 kg (AI*). The Panel bases these recommendations on the virologic potency shown by DRV/r in adult and pediatric studies, and this combination's high barrier to the development of drug resistance and excellent toxicity profile in adults and children.35,96-103 Based on findings from the DIONE study, once -daily dosing of DRV/r is part of an Alternative PI-based regimen in ARV -naive children and adolescents weighing 40 kg (AI*). Twice -daily dosing of DRV/r should be used for children aged 3 years to <12 years. Twice -daily dosing of DRV/r should be used when the following DRV resistance -associated substitutions are -NRTI backbone is recommended as an Alternative PI-based regimen for adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 40 kg who are not sexually mature. Lopinavir/Ritonavir LPV/r is approved to tre at HIV infection in infants and children with a postmenstrual age 42 weeks and postnatal age 14 days. Once -daily LPV/r dosing is approved by the FDA for initial therapy in adults,104 but PK data in children do not support a recommendation for once -daily dosing.105,106 Recommendation LPV/r plus a two-NRTI backbone is recommended as a Preferred PI-based regimen for infants with a postmenstrual age 42 weeks and postnatal age 14 days to < 4 weeks (AI) and as an Alternative PI-based regi men in children aged 4 weeks (AI*). This regimen has been shown to be virologically potent in adult and pediatric studies and has been well tolerated in pediatric studies. Although it is recommended only as a Preferred PI -based regimen for a narrow age range, use of LPV/r is supported by many Panel members as a Preferred PI -based regimen in children up to 3 years of age due to extensive experience with this drug and ease of administering a liquid formulation in infants and very young children.25,51,87,88,96,104-111 Selection of Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Backbone as Part of Initial Combination Therapy Dual -NRTI combinations form the backbone of combination regimens for both adults and children. The advantages and disadvantages of the different dual -NRTI backbone options that are recommended for initial therapy in children are listed in Table 8 below .14,31,59,89,112-116 See What Not to Start for more information. Also, see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed pediatric information on each drug. In the dual -NRTI backbone s listed below, 3TC and FTC are interchangeable. Both 3TC and FTC are well tolerated and have few AEs. FTC is similar to 3TC and can be substituted for 3TC as one component of a Preferred dual-NRTI backbone (i.e., FTC used in combination with ABC, TDF , or zidovudine [ ZDV]). The main advantage of FTC over 3TC is that it can be administered once daily as part of a n initial regimen. Both 3TC and FTC select for the M184V resistance mutation, which is Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-11 associated with high -level resistance to both drugs, a modest decrease in susceptibility to ABC , and improved susceptibility to ZDV and TDF as a result of decreased viral fitness.117,118 The Panel no longer recommends using didanosine or stavudine as part of ARV regime ns for children due to the significant toxicities observed when using these drugs and the availability of safer agents . These drugs are no longer commercially available for use in general . Dual -NRTI combinations are presented in alphabetical order below. Abacavir in Combination with Lamivudine or Emtricitabine ABC is approved by the FDA for use in children aged 3 months when administered as part of an ARV regimen. ABC also has been reported to be safe in infants and children aged 1 month. More recently, a n ABC dosing recommendation using PK simulation models has been endorsed by the World Health Organization using weight -band dosing for full -term infants from birth to 1 month of age. Based on this endorsement, the Panel recommends ABC from birth in full -term infants testing negative for the HLA -B5701 allele .119,120 Recommendation ABC plus 3TC or FTC is recommended as the Preferred dual -NRTI combination for children aged 3 months (AI) and for full -term infants from birth (BIII) . A negative test for the HLA - B5701 allele should be obtained prior to starting ABC regardless of age. Studies of adults and children have reported virologic efficacy and favorable toxicity profiles for these combinations.33,121-128 Recent data from the IMPAACT P1106 trial and two observational cohorts provide reassuring data on the safety of ABC in infants when initiated at age <3 months.129-131 Additional informatio n about the use of ABC between birth and 1 month of age can be found in the Appendix A : Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . Due to ABC- associated hypersensitivity, negative testing for HLA -B5701 allele should be confirmed before administration of ABC. Once -daily dosing is recommended when using the pill formulation of ABC. Twice -daily dosing of liquid ABC is recommended for initial therapy; a change to once -daily dosing can be considered for clinically stable patients with undetectable viral loads and stable CD4 counts.132-135 Tenofovir Alafenamide in Combination with Emtricitabine TAF is an oral prodrug of tenofovir. It is approved by the FDA as a component of an FDC tablet that also contains EVG, COBI, and FTC for the treatment of HIV in ARV -naive individuals weighing 25 kg who have an estimated CrCl 30 mL/min. A dditional safety and PK data are available for children aged 6 years to <12 years who are receiving this FDC tablet. 30 TAF formulated as an FDC tablet with FTC and BIC is FDA approved for use in children weighing 14 kg (see Bictegravir).14,136 An FDC tablet that contains FTC /TAF (Descovy) is available for use in children weighing 14 kg, with dosage determined by a child's weight . In January 2022, the FDA approved a low er strength formulation of the FTC/TAF FDC tablet for use in children weigh ing 14 kg to <25 kg.137 Coadministration of TAF with boosted ATV, DRV, or LPV increase s TAF exposure to concentrations that are higher than those seen with use of EVG/c/FTC/TAF. Because no data exist on the use of this combination in children weighing <35 kg, the safety of FTC/TAF combined with Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-12 COBI-boosted or RTV -boosted PIs in children weighing <35 kg cannot be assured and is not recommended. Recommendation FTC/TAF is recommended as a Preferred dual -NRTI combination in children and adolescents weighing 14 kg with estimated CrCl 30 mL/min when used with an INSTI or NNRTI. FTC/TAF is a Preferred dual -NRTI combination when used with a PI in children and adolescents weighing 35 kg who have estimated CrCl 30 mL/min (AI *). FTC/TAF also is recommended as a Preferred drug combination when used in the regimen BIC/FTC/TAF for children and adolescents weighing 14 kg (AI*). EVG/ c/FTC/TAF is recommended as an Alternative drug regimen for children and adolescents weighing 25 kg (AI*). The Panel makes these recommendations because TAF has a lower risk of renal and bone AEs than TDF. FTC/TAF is neither approved by the FDA nor recommended for use in combination with a booste d PI in children weighing <35 kg, because this combination has not been adequately studied in this age and weight group. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in Combination with Lamivudine or Emtricitabine TDF is approved by the FDA for use in children and adoles cents aged 2 years when administered as part of an ARV regimen. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in adults and children receiving TDF, but the clinical significance of these decreases is unknown.113-116,140,141 Before s tarting treatment, clinicians should consider whether the benefits of using TDF outweigh the potential risk of decreased BMD.142 Recommendation TDF plus 3TC or FTC is recommended as an Alternative dual -NRTI combination for children aged 2 years to 12 years (AI*). The Panel bases this recommendation on the virologic efficacy and ease of dosing of these combinations.113-116 ,122-125 ,143-148 Zidovudine in Combination with Abacavir In a European pediatric study, patients who received Z DV plus AB C had lower rates of viral suppression and a greater number of toxicities that led to regimen modification than in patients who received ABC plus 3TC.112,121 Recent data from the IMPAACT P1106 trial and two observational cohorts provide reassuring data on the safety of ABC in infants when initiated at age <3 months.129-131 Recommendation ZDV plus ABC is recommended as an Alternative dual-NRTI combination for children aged 1 month (BII) . Zidovudine in Combination with Lamivudine or Emtricitabine ZDV is available as a syrup, a capsule, and a tablet, and it is also available in injectable/intravenous preparations. It is approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV in infants aged 4 weeks and for prophylaxis in newborns. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-13 Recommendation ZDV plus 3TC or FTC is recommended as a Preferred dual -NRTI combination for infants and children from birth to age 1 month, and as an Alternative combination in children aged 1 month and adolescents (AI*). T wice -daily dosing is required for all ages with ZDV. Other NRTIs that require only once -daily dosing in children aged 6 years are available.126,149-151 In children aged 6 years and adolescents who are not sexually mature (i.e., those with SMRs of 1-3), the Panel recommends ZDV plus 3TC or FTC as an Alternative dual -NRTI combination (BII) . Figure 1 . Preferred Regimen by Age, Weight , and Drug Class Patient Age and Weight Class Birth to <14 Days of Agea,b,c Aged 14 Days and 2 kg to < 4 Weeks Aged 4 Weeks and 3 kg to <2 Years Aged 2 Years and 14 kg Aged 6 Years and 25 kg INSTI - Based Regimens Two NRTIs plus NRTIs plus LPV/rb a Preferred NRTIs are listed in Table 7 below . If treatment is scheduled to begin before a patient is aged 14 days, NVP or RAL are Preferred agents because they are the only options with dosing information available for this age group. Although many pediatric experts favor initiating antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after birth to limit the establishment of viral reservoirs, available clinical trial data do not suggest that initiating treatment within the first 14 days of life leads to better clinical outcomes than initiating treatment after 14 days of age. Clinicians should consult an expert in pediatric HIV infection before initiating treatment in infants aged <14 days. Additional considerations regarding the use of NVP or RAL in infants aged <14 days can be found in Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection . Switching from NVP to LPV/r should be considered when the infant is aged 14 days with a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks (the span of time between the first day of the m other's last menstrual period and birth, plus the time elapsed after birth); LPV/r has produced better clinical outcomes than NV P in studies of children aged <3 years . Data are limited on the clinical outcomes of using RAL in infants and children aged <2 y ears. b In general, LPV/r should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of 14 days (see the Lopinavir/Ritonavir section in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-14 c RAL granules can be administered to infants and children weighing 2 kg from birth to age 2 years. Oral RAL granules can be used up to a dose of 100 mg in the 14 kg to <20 kg weight band. RAL pills or chewable tablets can be used in children aged 2 years. Chewable RAL tablets can be crushed and dispersed in liquid to infants as young as 4 weeks of age who weigh at least 3 kg. d BIC is available only as part of a fixed -dose combination (FDC) tablet that contains BIC/FTC/TAF ; this FDC tablet is recommended as a Preferred regimen for children aged 2 years and weighing 14 kg. Two strengths of BIC/ FTC/TAF are available, with dosing according to a child's weight ( see Bictegravir ). e DTG is recommended as a Preferred agent for infants, children, and adolescents aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. DTG dispersible tablets can be administered in infants and children aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. DTG film-coated tablets can be used in children weighing 14 kg. An FDC tablet that contains ABC/DTG/3T C (Triumeq) is available for children weighing 25 kg. f NVP should not be used in post -pubertal girls with CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts >250/mm3, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. NVP is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of infants aged 15 days.

Antiretroviral Regimens Recommended for Initial Therapy for HIV Infection in Children An antiretroviral (ARV) regimen for treatment -naive children is generally made up of a two- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI cobicistat (COBI ). Regimens are designated Preferred based on efficacy, ease of administration, and acceptable toxicity. Alternative regimens also have demonstrated efficacy, but clinical experience with these regimens is limited , or these regimens are more difficult to administer than Preferred regimens. R egimens should be tailored to the individual patient by weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each combination. Many agents have multiple formulations and age and weight recommendations. Refer to Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for additional information and recommended doses and formulations (also see Table 8 below). In addition, many drugs that are recommended for use in newborns do not have dosing recommendations for premature infants. Additional information regarding dosing recommendations in this population can be found in Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection . Children who are receiving effective and tolerable ARV regimens can continue using those regimens as they age, even if the combinations they are receiving are no longer Preferred regimens. Refer to the Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy sections for decisions about transitioning children to other regimens as they grow.

Data are limited on the clinical outcomes of using RAL in infants and children aged <2 years. b In general, LPV/r should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of 14 days (see the Lopinavir/Ritonavir section in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Some experts would choose not to start with LPV/r as a Preferred initial regimen in neonates aged 14 days to <4 weeks but would choose to start with NVP in stead. c RAL granules can be administered to infants and children weighing 2 kg from birth to age 2 years. Oral RAL granules can be used up to a dose of 100 mg in the 14 kg to <20 kg weight band. RAL pills or chewable tablets can be used in children aged 2 years. Chewable RAL tablets can be crushed and dispersed in liquid and administered to infants as young as 4 weeks of age who weigh at least 3 kg. d DTG is recommended as a Preferred agent for infants, children, and adolescents aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. DTG dispersible tablets can be administered in infants and children aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. DTG film-coated tablets can be used in children weighing 14 kg. An FDC tablet that contains ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq) is available for children weighing 25 kg. e BIC is available only as part of an FDC tablet that contains BIC/FTC/TAF; this FDC tablet is recommended as a Preferred regimen for children weighing 14 kg. Two strengths of BIC/FTC/TAF are available, with dosing according to a child's weight (see Bictegravir ). f ABC is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use i n full-term neonates and infants aged <3 months. Recent data from the IMPAACT P1106 trial and two observational cohorts provide reassuring data on the safety of ABC in infants when initiated at the age of <3 months (see Abacavir ). Before ABC administration, a negative HLA -B 5701 allele test should be available. An FDC tablet that contains ABC/3TC (Epzicom and generic) is available for use in children weighing 25 kg. g FDA-approved FDC tablets are not included in this table when they are not approved for use in the specific patient populations being discussed. h An FDC tablet that contains 3TC/ZDV (Combivir and generic) is available f or use in children weighing 30 kg. Some members of the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Pan el) prefer ABC over ZDV because ABC can be dosed once daily . i FTC plus TAF is recommended as a Preferred NRTI combination for children and adolescents weighing 14 kg when used with an INSTI or NNRTI ; an FDC tablet that contains FTC/TAF (Descovy) is available in two strengths , with dosage determined by a child's weig ht (see Tenofovir Al afenamide ). FTC/TAF is approved by the FDA for children weighing 14 kg when used in the regimen BIC/FTC/TAF , which is also available in two strengths, with dosage determined by a child's weight. EVG/c/FTC/TAF is approved for use in children weighing 25 kg. FTC/TAF is a Preferred NRTI combination for children and adolescents weighing 35 kg when used with a boosted PI ; FTC/TAF is not approved or recommended for use with a boosted PI in children weighing <35 kg. j NVP should not be used in post -pubertal girls with T lymphocyte cell counts >250/mm3, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. NVP is approved by the FDA for the treatment of infants aged 15 days. k DRV should only be used in children weighing 10 kg. Once- daily DRV should not be used in children aged <12 years or weighing <40 kg. Once- daily DRV should also not be used when any one of the following res recommended as an Alternative drug combination for children aged 6 years to <12 years and weighing >25 kg because there are other drugs that can be administered once daily and that are better tolerated. Note that DRV/r can be administered once daily in adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 40 kg who are not sexually mature (SMR 1- 3). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-18 l EFV is approved by the FDA for use in children aged 3 months and weighing 3.5 kg, but it is not recommended by the Panel for initial therapy in children aged 3 months to 3 years. FDC tablets that contain EFV/FTC/TDF (Atripla) and EFV 600 mg/3TC/TDF are available. See the Efavirenz section in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for information about use of the FDC EFV 400 mg/3TC/TDF (Symfi Lo). m EVG is currently recommended only as a component of FDC tablets. Tablets that contain EVG/c/FTC/TAF (Genvoya) are recommended as an Alternative regimen for children and adolescents weighing 25 kg due to multiple drug- drug interactions from COBI and a lower barrier to the development of resistance to EVG . n DOR is not FDA approved for pediatric use. Based on data from studies that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of DOR in adults , as well as early findings from pediatric PK studies, the Panel recommends DOR as an Alternative ARV for children and adolescents weighing 35 kg. An FDC tablet containing DOR/3TC/TDF is available. o ATV/c is available as an FDC tablet containing ATV/c (Evotaz) that has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents weighing 35 kg. p RPV should be administered to adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg who have initial viral loads 100,000 copies/mL. FDC tablets that contain FTC/RPV/TAF (Odefsey) and FTC/RPV/TDF (Complera) are available. q DRV/c is available as part of an FDC tablet containing DRV/c/FTC/TAF (Symtuza) that has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adoles cents weighing 40 kg. r An FDC tablet that contains FTC/TDF (Truvada) is available. = zidovudine Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-19 Table 8. Advantages and Disadvantages of Antiretroviral Components Recommended for Initial Therapy in Children See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information and Table 7. Antiretroviral Regimen Considerations for Initial Therapy Based on Specific Clinical Scenarios in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for more information. ARV Class/ Agent(s) Advantages Disadvantages All INSTIs INSTI Class Advantages Few drug- drug interactions Well tolerated INSTI Class Disadvantages Limited data on pediatric dosing or safety Possible weight gain in adults, especially Black/African American women BIC Once -daily administration Can give with or without food Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) The FDC tablet is not recommended for patients w ith hepatic impairment or an estimated CrCl <30 mL/min. The FDC should rifampin or dofetilide. DTG Once -daily administration Can give with food Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Single -agent DTG pills are available in several doses and are small in size. DTG is available as dispersible tablets for suspension. Drug interactions EFV, side effects, particularly sleep disturbances . Early concerns about a possible increased risk of NTDs in infants born to women who were receiving DTG at the time of conception have decreased substantially. The Panel for Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents and the Panel on Treatment of HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission include DTG among the preferred ARV agents for use in people of childbearing potential and for use in people who are pregnant or are trying to conceive. Risks and benefits should be discussed to support informed decisi on making, see Dolutegravir , Appendix C: Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers . EVG Once -daily administration Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Among INSTIs, EVG has the lowest barrier to the development of resistance. If EVG is coadministered with COBI, the potential exists for multiple drug interactions because COBI is metabolized by hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4). COBI inhibits tubular secretion of creatinine, and this may result in increased serum creatinine but normal glomerular clearance. RAL Can give with food Available in tablet, chewable tablet, and powder formulations Potential for rare systemic allergic reaction or hepatitis Granule formulation requires a multistep preparation before administrat ion; caregiver must be taught how to properly prepare this formulation. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-20 ARV Class/ Agent(s) Advantages Disadvantages Chewable tablets can be crushed and mixed with various liquids for infants 4 weeks of age who weigh 3 kg. Once -daily administration (with RAL HD) can be used for treatment -naive or virologically suppressed children weighing 40 kg. All NNRTIs NNRTI Class Advantages Long half -life Lower risk of dyslipidemia and fat maldistribution than PIs PI-sparing Lower pill burden than PIs for children taking the solid formulation; easier to use and adhere to than PI -based regimens NNRTI Class Disadvantages A single mutation can confer resistance, with cross - resistance between EFV and NVP. Rare , but serious and potentially life- threatening, cases of skin rash (including SJS) and hepatic toxicity. All NNRTIs pose this risk, but the risk is greatest with NVP ; these toxic effects have not been reported in neonates. Potential for multiple drug interactions due to metabolism via hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4) . Information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker DOR Once -daily administration Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Can be taken with or without food Has continued antiviral activity in the setting of some NNRTI mutations Neuropsychiatric AEs , but fewer than reported for EFV DOR is contraindicated when co- administered with drugs that (CYP)3A enzyme inducers between DOR and rifabutin induce the metabolism of DOR and require an additional dose of DOR 100 mg to be administered 12 hours after a fixed -dose combination of DOR/3TC/TDF or an increase of the DOR dose to 100 mg twice daily , see Doravirine . EFV Once -daily administration Available in FDC tab lets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Potent ARV activity Can give with food (but avoi d high -fat meals) Capsules can be opened and added to food. Neuropsychiatric AEs (bedtime dosing is recommended to reduce CNS effects) Rash (generally mild) No commercially available liquid formulation Limited data on dosing for children aged <3 years No data on dosing for children aged <3 months NVP Liquid formulation is available. Dosing information for young infants is available. Can give with food Extended- release formulation that allows once- daily dosing in older children is available . Reduced virologic efficacy in young infants, regardless of exposure to NVP as part of a peripartum preventive regimen Higher incidence of rash/HSR than other NNRTIs Higher rates of serious hepatic toxicity than EFV Decreased virologic response compared with EFV Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-21 ARV Class/ Agent(s) Advantages Disadvantages Twice-daily dosing necessary in children with BSA <0.58 m2 Low barrier to resistance RPV Once -daily dosing Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Should not use in patients with viral loads >100,000 copies/mL Must be taken with a 500 kcal meal at a consistent time each day; this may affect adherence. Low barrier to resistance All PIs PI Class Advantages NNRTI -sparing Clinical, virologic, and immunologic efficacy are well-documented. Resistance to PIs requires multiple mutations. When combined with a dual -NRTI backbone, a regimen that contains a PI targets HIV at two steps of viral replication by inhibiting the activity of viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzym es. PI Class Disadvantages Metabolic complications, including dyslipidemia, fat maldistribution, and insulin resistance Potential for multiple drug interactions because of metabolism via hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4) Higher pill burden than NRTI -based or NNRTI - based regimens for patients taking solid formulations Poor palatability of liquid preparations, which may affect adherence Most PIs require RTV boosting, resulting in drug interactions that are associated with RTV . Boosted ATV Once -daily dosing Powder formulation is available. ATV has less effect on TG and total cholesterol levels than other PIs (but RTV boosting may be associated with elevations in these parameters). No liquid formulation Should be administered with food Indirect hyperbil irubinemia is common, but asymptomatic. Scleral icterus may be distressing to the patient, which may affect adherence. Must be used with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system defects (can prolong the PR interval of an ECG) RTV is associated with a large number of drug interactions. Boosted DRV Can be used once daily in children aged 12 years Liquid formulation is available. DRV requires a boosting agent. Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Pediatric pill burden high with current tablet dose formulations Should be administered with food Must be boosted to achieve adequate plasma concentrations Contains sulfa moiety. The potential for cross - sensitivity between DRV and other drugs in sulfonamide class is unknown. RTV is associated with a large number of drug interacti ons. Can be used only once daily in the absence of certain PI-associated resistance mutations . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-22 ARV Class/ Agent(s) Advantages Disadvantages LPV/r LPV is only available coformulated with RTV in liquid and tablet formulations. Tablets can be given without food, but they may be better tolerated when taken with a meal or snack. Poor palatability of liquid formulation (bitter taste) Liquid formulation should be administered with food. RTV is associated with a large number of drug interactions. Should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks (the span of time between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and birth, plus the time elapsed after birth) and a postnatal age 14 days Must be used with caution in patients with pre- existing conduction system defects (can prolong PR and QT interval of an ECG) ABC plus (3TC or FTC) Palatable liquid formulations Can give with food Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Risk of ABC HSR; perform HLA -B*5701 screening before initiating ABC. FTC/TAF for children aged 6 years Once -daily dosing Small tablet size Lower risk of TFV -associated renal and bone toxicity with TAF than with TDF in adults Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Limited data on the safety and efficacy of this combination in children Increased lipid levels TDF plus (3TC or FTC) for adolescents with SMRs of 4 or 5 Once -daily dosing for TDF Resistance is slow to develop. Lower risk of mitochondrial toxicity than other NRTIs Can give with food Available as reduced- strength tablets and or al powder for use in younger children Available in FDC tablets (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets ) Limited pediatric experience Potential bone and renal toxicity Appropriate dosing is complicated by numerous drug- drug interactions with other ARV agents, including ddI, LPV/r, ATV, and TPV. ZDV plus (3TC or FTC) Extensive pediatric experience Coformulations of ZDV and 3TC are available (Combivir and generic) for children weighing 30 kg. Palatable liquid formulations Can give with food FTC is available as a palatable liquid formulation that can be administered once daily. Bone marrow suppression and lipoatrophy with ZDV ZDV requires twice -daily dosing. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-23 ARV Class/ Agent(s) Advantages Disadvantages ZDV plus ABC Palatable liquid formulations Can give with food Risk of ABC HSR; perform HLA -B*5701 screening before initiating ABC.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-27 What Not to Start: Regimens Not Recommended for Use in Antiretroviral -Naive Children Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 This section describes antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and drug combinations that either are not recommended for use in ARV -naive children or lack sufficient data to recommend their use in ARV-naive children. Although m any ARV agents and combinations are available , some are not recommended for use as pa rt of an initial regimen in ARV -naive children, but they may be used in ARV-experienced children (see Recognizing a nd Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Several ARV drugs that are no longer available or recommended for use in children for several years have been removed from this chapter, including the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Drugs in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). The PI ritonavir is no longer recommended for use as the sole PI in an ARV regimen but is used at a reduced dose as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer (boosting agent) with other ARV drugs (e.g., atazanavir, darunavir). The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) classifies ARV drugs and drug combinations that are not recommended for use in ARV-na ive children into one of three categories: Not Recommended for Initial Therapy : These include ARV drugs and drug combinations that are not recommended for initial therapy in ARV -naive children because they produce an inferior virologic response, they pose potential serious safety concerns (including potentially overlapping toxicities), they are associated with pharmacologic antagonism , or better options are available within a drug class . These drugs and drug combinations are listed in Table 9, and selected drugs or drug combinations are discussed below . Insufficient Data to Recommend for Initial Therapy : ARV drugs and drug combinations that are approved for use in adults but have insufficient, limited, or no PK and/ or safety data for children cannot be recommended for initial therapy in children. However, these drugs and drug combinations may be appropriate to consider when manag ing treatment -experienced children (see Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ). These drugs also ar e listed in Table 9, and selected drugs or drug combinations are discussed below . Antiretroviral Drug Regimens That Are Never Recommended: Several ARV drug and drug combinations should never be used in children or adults. The y are summarized in Table 10 . Clinicians also should be aware of the components of fixed-dose combination (FDC ) tablets so that patients do not inadvertently receive a double dose of a drug contained in such a combination. Antiretroviral Drugs and Drug Comb inations Not Recommended for Initial Therapy in Children Atazanavir Without Ritonavir or Cobicistat Boosting Although unboosted atazanavir (ATV) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for use in treatment -naive adolescents \u2014aged 13 years and weighing 40 kg \u2014who are unable to Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-28 tolerate ritonavir (RTV), data from the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT )/Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) 1020A st udy indicate that adolescents require higher doses of unboosted ATV (as measured by m illigram per meter squared of body surface area) than adults to achieve adequate drug concentrations.1 The Panel does not recommend using ATV without RTV boosting because of these findings. Regimens T hat Contain Only Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors In adult trials, regimens that contain only NRTIs have shown less potent virologic activity than non- nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- based or PI -based .2,3 Data on the efficacy of triple -NRTI regimens for treatment of ARV -naive children are limited to small observational studies .4,5 In a study on the use of the triple -NRTI regimen abacavir plus lamivudine (3TC) plus zidovudine in ARV-ex perienced children, this combination showed evidence of only modest viral suppression; only 10 of the 102 children had viral loads of <400 copies/mL at Week 48 of treatment . 6 Therefore, regimens that contain only NRTIs are not recommended for treatment - naive or treatment -experienced children. Regimens T hat Contain Three Drug Classes The P anel does not recommend using regimens that contain agents from three drug classes as initial regimens (e.g., an NRTI plus an NNRTI plus a PI or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor plus an NRTI plus a PI or NNRTI ). Although studies of regimens that contain three classes of drugs have demonstrated that these regimens are safe and effective in ARV- experienced children and adolescents , these regimens have not been studied as initial regimens in treatment -naive children and adolescents . These regimens also have the p otential to induc e resistance to three drug classes, which could severely limit future treatment options.7-11 Ongoing studies are investigating the use of drugs from three drug classes to treat neonates. Regimens T hat Contain Three Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors and a Non - Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Current d ata are insufficient to recommend using a regimen that contains three NRTIs plus an NNRTI in young infants. A review of nine cohorts from 13 European countries s uggested that this four-drug regimen produced responses that were superior to the responses observed in patients receiving boosted-PI regimens or three -drug NRTI regimens . 12 There has been speculation that poor tolerance and poor adherence to a PI -based regimen may account for some of the differences. The AntiRetroviral Research f or Watoto (ARROW ) trial, conducted in Uganda and Zimbabwe , randomized 1,206 children (with a median age of 6 years) to receive either a standard NNRTI-bas ed, three -drug regimen (two NRTIs and one NNRTI) or a four-drug regimen (three NRTIs and one NNRTI). After a 36-week induction period, the children on the four-drug regimen continued treatment on a regimen that contained two NRTI s plus one NNRTI or a three -NRTI regimen. Although improvements in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts were observed at Week 36 (with a percentage change of approximately 14.4% in the four-drug arm compared with 12.6% in the three - drug arm), these benefits were not sustained after patients switched to the three-drug regimen s for the duration of the study. Furthermore, no differences in viral suppression rates were observed between the two arms at Week 36.13 Because three -drug regimens have been shown to be effective and well tolerated and because efficacy data are lacking for the four-drug regimen, the Panel currently does not recommend the four- drug regi men . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-29 Antiretroviral Drugs and Combinations with Insufficient Data to Recommend for Initial Therapy in Children Several ARV drugs and drug regimens are not recommended for use as initial therapy in ARV -naive children or for specific age groups because of insufficient pediatric data. In some cases, new agents have shown promise in adult clinical trials but do not have sufficient pediatric PK and safety data to recommend their use as components of an initial therapeutic regimen in children. In addition, some dosing schedules may not be recommended in certain age groups because of insufficient data. As new data become available, these agents may be come recommended agents or regimens , as summarized below and also listed in Table 9. Cabotegravir with or Without Rilpivirine for Oral or Intramuscular Injections In 2021, the FDA approved long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of cabotegravir (CAB), a novel INSTI, and the NNRTI rilpivirine (RPV) for the treatment of HIV infection in adults to replace a current, stable ARV regimen in patients with no prior history of treatment failure and no known or suspected resistance to CAB or RPV who have demonstrate d sustai ned viral suppression (e.g., 3- 6 months). These two LAI ARVs are copackaged together and marketed as Cabenuva . An oral lead-in with the oral formulations of the ARV s for at least 28 days is recommended to assess tolerability. The LAI formulations can then be administered on a monthly or an every 2 month schedule in adults. Clinical trials in adolescents are ongoing and planned for younger children. At this time, the Panel does not recommend the use of this LAI regimen for children. Darunavir with Low -Dose Rito navir -Based Regimens Administered Once Daily for Children Aged 3 Years to <12 Years Whereas modeling studies identified a once -daily dosing schedule for darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) that is now approved by the FDA, the Panel is concerned about the lack of direct PK studies for this approach in individuals aged 3 years to <12 years. Therefore, the data are not sufficient to recommend once -daily dosing for initial therapy in this age group. For children aged 3 years to <12 years, twice -daily DRV/r is a Preferred drug combination. For older children who have undetectable viral loads while receiving a twice -daily DRV/r-based regimen, practitioners can consider switching to once -daily DRV/r dosing if no DRV-associated resistance mutations are present. Once -daily dosing helps support adherence by making this drug combination easier to use. Efavirenz- Based Regimens for Children Aged 3 Months to 3 Years EFV is approved by the FDA for use in children aged > 3 months and weighing 3.5 kg. An EFV - based regimen has been shown to have variable PKs in studies of the very young; because of this, the Panel does not recommend using EFV in children aged <3 years at this time (see the Efavirenz section in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). When the use of EFV is being considered for children aged < 3 years, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 genotyping should be performed, if predict a patient's metabolic rate for EFV . Therapeutic drug monitoring also can be considered. Additionally, EFV in children <3 years may be considered in the setting of HIV/ tuberculosis coinfection, because EFV is one of the few ARVs with minimal drug-drug interactions seen with other ARVs Etravirine- Based Regimens Etravirine (ETR) is an NNRTI that has been studied in treatment -experienced chil dren aged 1 years and is approved now by the FDA for use in children aged 2 years and weighing 10 kg.15-17 ETR is Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-30 associated with multiple interactions with other ARV drugs, including TPV /ritonavir, ATV/ritonavir, and unboosted PIs, and must be administered twice daily. The use of ETR likely will not be studied in treatment-naive children. directed attachment inhibitor that is not approved for use in pediatric patients. FTR was approved by the FDA in 2020 for use in adults in combination with other ARV drugs, with approval limited to heavily treatment -experienced adults with multidrug -resistant HIV who are failing their current ART regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations. A PK and safety study of FTR in children and adolescents 20 kg ( PENTA Foundation: NCT04648280 ) will soon be open to enrollment . At this time, the Panel does not recommend FTR as part of an initial treatment regimen for HIV -1 infection in children. Ibalizumab -Containing Regimens Ibalizumab (IBA) binds to CD4 extracellular domain 2 and prevents conformational changes in the CD4 -HIV envelope gp 120 essential for viral entry, thereby blocking HIV entry into CD4 cell s.18 It was approved for use in adults with HIV -1 infection who are heavily pretreated, have multi drug-resistant virus , and are experiencing treatment failure. IBA has an orphan drug designation exempting the r equirement for pediatric studies under the Pediatric Research Equity Act. At this time, because there is no experience with IBA in children, the Panel does not recommend its use as initial treatment for HIV -1 infection. Maraviroc -Based Regimens Maraviroc (MVC) is an entry inhibitor approved by FDA for use in children weighing 2 kg who have CCR5 -tropic HIV -1. It has been used infrequently in children. A recent dose -finding study administered both the liquid and tablet formulations of MVC to treatment -experienced children aged 2 to 18 years who were grouped in to four age cohorts .19 The i nitial dose wa s based on body surface area and scaled from the recommended adult dose. Dose adjustments were required in patients who were not receiving a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.19 A recent study of MVC in newborns at risk of HIV acquisition and weighing at least 2 kg established a dosing protocol that achieved target exposures and was deemed safe . No apparent differences in PK parameters were observed among infants of mothers with exposure to EFV and those without. None of the infants had HIV infection, nor were they receiving potent P450 CYP3A inhibitors.20 As an entry inhibitor, MVC is under study in intensive treatment trials because of its hypothetical potential to limit the estab lishment of cell- associated viral reservoirs. However, MVC has several features that limit its role for routine uses, including multiple drug interactions, the need to be administered twice daily, and the fact that tropism assays must be performed prior to its use to ensure the presence of only CCR5-tropic virus. For those reasons, MVC is not recommended by the P anel for first -line treatment for neonates or older children. Two -Drug Regimens Increasi ng evidence suggests that in adults two -drug/two-class ARV regimens can be used in patients who have achieved and sustained viral suppression on a three -drug ART regimen. In general , adults who have had viral suppression for at least 3 to 6 months and with know n susceptibility to the ARVs in the two -drug regimen have success after switching to these regimens. Regimens that demonstrated efficacy in adult clinical trials include DTG plus RPV, DTG plus 3TC or FTC, and boosted DRV plus DTG. At this time, no dat a support this strategy in children, and it is not recommended by the Panel. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-31 Table 9.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-1 Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection Updated: Dec.30, 202 1 Reviewed : Dec.30, 202 1 Panel 's Recommendations All newborn s who were exposed perinatally to HIV should receive postpartum antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV (AI). Newborn ARV regimens administered at doses that are appropriate for the infant 's gestational age should be initiated as close to the time of birth as possible , preferably within 6 hours of delivery (AII) . A newborn 's ARV regimen should be determined based on maternal and infant factors that influence the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV (AII) . The uses of ARV regimens in newborns include the following : o ARV Prophylaxis: The administration of one or more ARV drug s to a newborn without documented HIV infection to reduce the risk of perinatal acquisition of HIV . o Presumptive HIV Therapy: T he administration of a three -drug ARV regimen to newborn s who are at highest risk of perinatal acquisition of HIV . Presumptive HIV therapy is intended to be preliminary treatment for a newborn who is later documented to have HIV , but it also serves as prophylaxis against HIV acquisition for those newborns who are exposed to HIV in utero , during the birthing process , or during breastfeeding and who do not acquire HIV. o HIV Therapy: The administration of a three -drug ARV regimen at treatment doses ( called antiretroviral therapy [ART ]) to newborns with documented HIV infection (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children ). A 4-week zidovudine (ZDV) ARV prophylaxis regimen can be used in newborns whose mother s received ART during pregnancy and had viral suppression within 4 weeks prior to delivery (defined as a confirmed HIV RNA level <50 copies/mL) and for whom maternal adherence is not of concern (BII) . Newborn s at high risk of perinatal acquisition of HIV should begin presumptive HIV therapy (see Table 12 for recommended regimens) . Newborns at high risk of HIV acquisition includ e those born to people with HIV who \u2014 o Have not received antepartum ARV drugs (AI) , or o Have received only intrapartum ARV drugs (AI) , or o Have received antepartum ARV drugs but who did not achieve viral suppression (defined as a confirmed HIV RNA level <50 copies/mL) within 4 weeks of delivery (AII), or o Have primary or acute HIV infection during pregnancy (AII) . Presumptive HIV therapy should be administered to infants of mothers who have primary or acute HIV infection while breastfeeding (AII) . If a patient presents with unknown HIV status and has a positive expedited HIV test during labor or shortly after delivery , the infant should begin presumptive HIV therapy (AII) . If supplemental maternal testing is negative, the infant 's ARV regimen should be discontinued (AII) . For newborn s with HIV infection , ART should be initiated (AI). The use of ARV drugs other than ZDV, lamivudine , and nevirapine cannot be recommended for any indication in premature newborn s (<37 weeks gestational age) because of the lack of dosing and safety data (BII) . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-2 General Considerations for Antiretrovi ral Management of Newborns Exposed to HIV or Born with HIV All newborns with perinatal exposure to HIV should receive antiretroviral (ARV) drugs during the neonatal period to reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission , with selection of the appropriate ARV regimen guided by the level of transmission risk. HIV transmission can occur in utero, intrapartum, or during breastfeeding. Maternal viral load is the most important risk factor for HIV transmission to a newborn. Ne wborns are at an increased risk for transmission when the ir mothers do not receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy, when mothers start antepartum treatment late in pregnancy, or when antepartum treatment does not result in viral suppression (defined as a confirmed HIV RNA level <50 copies/mL) . Higher maternal viral load , especially in late pregnancy, correlates with higher risk of transmission. A spectrum of transmission risk depends on these and other maternal and infant factors, including mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery, and maternal health status. Historically, the use of ARV drugs in the newborn period was referred to as ARV prophylaxis because it primarily focused on protect ion against newborn perinatal acquisition of HIV . More recently, clinicians have begun to identify newborns at highest risk for HIV acquisition and initiate three -drug ARV regimen s as presumptive treatment of HIV. In this section , the following terms will be used: ARV Prophylaxis: The administration of ARV drugs to a newborn without documented HIV infection to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. ARV prophylaxis includes administration of a single agent \u2014usually zidovudine ( ZDV)\u2014as well as combinations of two or three ARV drugs . Presumptive HIV Therapy: The administration of a three -drug ARV regimen to newborns at highest risk of HIV acquisition. Presumptive HIV therapy is intended to be early t reatment for a newborn who is late r documented to have acquired HIV , but it also serves as ARV prophylaxis against HIV acquisition for those newborns who are exposed to HIV in utero, during the birthing process , or during breastfeeding and who do not acquire HIV. HIV Therapy: The administration of a three -drug ARV regimen to newborn s with documented HIV infection (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children ). The terms ARV prophylaxis and presumptive HIV therapy describe the clinician 's intent when prescribing ARV drugs , which may lead to an overlap between these two terms . For example, a presumptive HIV therapy regimen also provide s ARV prophylaxis for a newborn. However , two - drug (or some times three -drug) ARV prophylaxis regimens , notably those that use prophyla doses rather than therapeutic doses of nevirapine (NVP ), are not considered presumptive HIV therapy. Providers with questions about ARV management of perinatal HIV exposure should consult t he National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) , which provides free clinical consultation on all aspects of perinatal HIV, including newborn care (AIII) . Rating of Recommendations : A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence : I = One or more randomized trials with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinion Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-3 The interval during which newborn ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy can be initiated and still be benefi cial is undefined; however, most studies support providing ARV drugs as early as possible after delivery.1-6 Table 11 provide s an overview of neonatal ARV management recommendations according to the risk of perinatal HIV transmission to the newborn, and Table 12 summarizes the recommendations for ARV drug dosing in newborns . Additional information about dose selection for newborns , including premature infants (<37 weeks ' gestational age) , can be found in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines . Information about infants born to people with H IV-2 infection is available in HIV-2 Infection and Pregnancy and Table 11 . In addition, t he National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) is a federally funded service that provides free clinical consultation on difficult cases to providers who are caring for pregnant people with HIV and their newborns, and consultants can provide referral s to local or regional pediatric HIV specialists.

Refer to the What to Start in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines for specific treatment recommendations. a ZDV prophylaxis regimen is recommended for infants born to mothers with HIV -2 mono- infection, see HIV-2 Infection and Pregnancy . If the mother has HIV -1 and HIV -2 infection, the infant ARV regimen should be based on the determination of low or high risk of HIV -1 transmission as described in the above table. Because HIV -2 is not susceptible to NVP, RAL should be considered for infants at high risk of perinatal HIV -2 transmission . See text for evidence that support s the use of presumptive HIV therapy and a two -drug ARV prophylaxis regimen. b See Intrapartum Care for People with HIV for guidance on indications for scheduled cesarean delivery and intrapartum intravenous ZDV to reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission for mothers with an elevated viral load at delivery. c Most Panel members would opt to administer presumptive HIV therapy to infants whose mothers had acute HIV during pregnancy because of the higher risk for in utero transmission . If acute HIV is diagnosed during breastfeeding, the mother should immediately discontinue breastfeeding. d The optimal duration of presumptive HIV therapy in newborns who are at a high risk for perinatal HIV transmission is unknown. If possible, newborns who are at a high risk for HIV acquisition should receive ZDV for 6 weeks. Additional medications \u2014such as 3TC, RAL, or NVP \u2014may need to be administered for 2 to 6 weeks; the recommended duration for these drugs varies depending on infant HIV NAT results, maternal viral load at the time of delivery, and additional risk factors for HIV transmission. Consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV is recommended when selecting a therapy duration because this decision should be based on case- specific risk factors and interim infant HIV NAT results. The two -drug regimen used in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human D evelopment -HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN Group ( PACTG ) 1043 for infants who were at a high risk for HIV acquisition is described in the text ( see the Two- Drug Antiretroviral Prophylaxis section) . e Infant ART should be initiated without waiting for the results of confirmatory HIV NAT testing , given the low likelihood of a false - positive HIV NAT. However, the specimen for confirmatory HIV testing should be obtained prior to ART initiation. Note: ARV drugs should be initiated as close to the time of birth as possible, preferably within 6 hours of delivery. See Table 12 for dosing specifics.

ABC also has been reported to be safe in infants and children 1 month of age. More recently, an ABC dosing recommendation using PK simulation models has been endorsed by the WHO using weight -band dosing for full -term infants fr om birth to 1 month of age. NVP 200 mg/m2 BSA per dose orally twice daily; only make this dose increase for infants with confirmed HIV infection. RAL Note: If the mother has taken RAL 2 to 24 hours prior to delivery, the neonate' s first dose of RAL should be delayed until 24 to 48 hours after birth; additional ARV drugs should be started as soon as possible.7 37 Weeks ' Gestation at Birth and Weighing 2 kge Birth to Age 6 Weeks Body Weight Volume (Dose) of RAL 10 mg/mL Suspension Birth to 1 Week: Once -Daily Dosing Approximately 1.5 mg/kg per dose 2 to <3 kg 0.4 mL (4 mg) once daily 3 to <4 kg 0.5 mL (5 mg) once daily 4 to <5 kg 0.7 mL (7 mg) once daily 1 to 4 Weeks: Twice -Daily Dosing Approximately 3 mg/kg per dose 2 to <3 kg 0.8 mL (8 mg) twice daily 3 to <4 kg 1 mL (10 mg) twice daily 4 to <5 kg 1.5 mL (15 mg) twice daily 4 to 6 Weeks: Twice -Daily Dosing Approximately 6 mg/kg per dose 3 to <4 kg 2.5 mL (25 mg) twice daily 4 to <6 kg 3 mL (30 mg) twice daily 6 to <8 kg 4 mL (40 mg) twice daily Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-8 See Abacavir in Appendix A: Pediatric Anti retroviral Drug Information for additional information about the use of ABC between birth and 1 month of age. At this time, the Panel does not recommend ABC as part of a presumptive HIV therapy regimen. However, in situations where ZDV is not available or the infant has ZDV -associated toxicity, ABC could be considered an alternative to ZDV. This substitution should be considered in circumstances where increased risk of ZDV toxicity may exist , such as in infants with anemia or neutropenia. Because of ABC -associated hypersensitivity, negative testing for HLA -B5701 allele should be confirmed prior to administration of ABC. d The NVP doses for infants 34 to <37 weeks gestation at birth and infants 37 weeks gestation at birth are not yet approved by the FDA. T he FDA also has not approved a dose of NVP for infants aged <1 month. The doses for infants 32 to <34 weeks gestation at birth are based on modeling and might underestimate potential toxicity in infants of 32 to <34 weeks gestational age because the doses used to develop the model were lower than the doses now recommended. See the Two- Drug Antiretroviral Prophylaxis section in the text for prophylactic Nevirapine in Appendix Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for additional information about dosing. e RAL dosing is increased at 1 week and 4 weeks of age because metabolism by UGT1A1 is low at birth and increases rapidly during the next 4 to 6 weeks of life. No dosing information is available for preterm infants or infants weighing <2 kg at birth. In infants with HIV infection, twice -daily RAL can be replaced with once- daily DTG at 4 weeks of age (see Dolutegravir and What to Start in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ).

In the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) 076 study, ZDV alone reduced the incidence of perinatal HIV transmission by 66%, and ZDV is recommended as prophylaxis for neonates whose mothers received ART that resulted in consistent viral suppression during pregnanc y.8 The optimal minimum duration of neonatal ZDV prophylaxis has not been established in clinical trials. A 6-week ZDV regimen was studied in newborns in PACTG 076. However, the evidence that support s a reduced duration of ZDV prophylaxis in infants born to wo men w ho were suppress ed virologically during pregnancy and at the time of delivery is mounting.9-11 In the Uni ted Kingdom and many other European countries, a 2-week neonatal ZDV prophylaxis regimen is recommended for infants born to women who have a very low risk of HIV transmission. These women have been on ART for longer than 10 weeks and have had at least two documented maternal HIV viral loads < 50 copies/mL at least 4 weeks apart and have viral loads <50 copies/mL at or after 36 weeks ' gestation. A 4 -week course of ZDV is recommended12 if any of these criteria are not fulfilled but the maternal viral load is <50 copies/mL at or after 36 weeks ' gestation . Compared with the 6 -week ZDV regimen, 2 to 4 week s on this regimen has been reported to allow earlier recovery from anemia in otherwise healthy newborns.13,14 The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health does not recommend infant ARV prophylaxis for infants of women with regular follow -up, ART use during pregnancy, and where maternal viral load is <50 copies/mL , ideally sustained throughout pregnancy, but at least at the last two consecutive measurements before delivery where viral load testing is performed at least 4 weeks apart and the last viral load is measure d after week 36 of pregnancy.15 Currently, the Panel recommends a 4 -wee k neonatal ZDV prophylaxis regimen for newborns if the mother achieved viral suppression (defined as a confirmed HIV RNA level < 50 copies/mL ) on ART during pregnancy within 4 w eeks of delivery and maternal adherence is not of concern. Some Panel Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-10 members are supportive of the shorter 2-week ZDV regimen, as recommended by the British HIV Association and implemented in the United Kingdom and other European countries , in cases where there is very low risk of HIV transmission as defined above. Dosing recommendations for ZDV are available for premature newborns , and an intravenous preparation of ZDV is a vailable. Table 12 shows recommended neonatal ZDV dosing based on gestational age and birthweight. Newborn s Born to Mothers Who Received No Antepartum Antiretroviral Drugs, Who Received Intrapartum Antiretroviral Drugs Only, Who Received Antiretroviral Drugs and Were Not Viral ly Suppress ed Near Delivery , or Who Acquired HIV During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding The Panel recommends that a ll newborns born to mothers w ho do not have viral suppression (defined as a confirmed HIV RNA level <50 copies/mL) within 4 weeks prior to delivery , who received only intrapartum ARV drugs , or who received no ARV drugs during pregnancy are at high risk for HIV acquisition and should receive presumptive HIV therapy .5,16-21 Primary or acute HIV infection during pregnancy also is associated with an increased risk of perinatal transmission of HIV . Infants born to people who acqui red HIV during pregnancy should receive presumptive HIV therapy (see Acute HIV Infection ). The experience with these two strategies is described below. Presumptive HIV Therapy Early effective treatment of HIV infection in infants restric ts the viral reservoir size, reduces HIV genetic variability , and modifies the immune response.22-30 Because of these potential benefits of early ART, the Panel recommends a three-drug ARV presumptive HIV therapy regimen consisting of ZDV, lamivudine (3TC ), and either NVP (at treatment dose) or raltegravir (RAL ) for newborns at high risk of perinatal acqu isition of HIV . Although no clinical trials have compar ed the safety and efficacy of presumptive ART with single - drug or two-drug regimens, emerging data suggest that early presumptive HIV therapy has not been associated with serious adverse events . In the International Maternal, Pediatric, Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) P1115, 438 neonates who were at least 34 weeks gestational age at birth and enrolled within 48 hours of birth received a presumptive HIV therapy regimen containing two nucleoside reverse transcriptase 6 mg/kg twice daily for term neonates (37 weeks gestational age) or 4 mg/kg twice daily for 1 week and 6 mg/kg twice daily therapy for preterm neonates (34 to <37 weeks gestational age). Among the study participants, 7% reported Division of AIDS ( DAIDS ) Grade 3 or 4 adverse events at least possibly related to ART. These G rade 3 or 4 events included 6% with neutropenia and 1% with anemia.21 The Early Infant Treatment Study in Botswana initiated ART consisting of NVP 6 mg/kg twice daily, ZDV , and 3TC at <7 days gestational age in 40 i nfants who were 35 weeks gestational age and 2 kg at birth with HIV infection. Eighteen percent of these infants had Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, mostly neutropenia .31 Similar findings have been reported from other smaller studies of presumed HIV therapy or early treatment of confirmed HIV infection.31-33 In a prospective cohort in Thailand , infants who receiv ed a presumptive HIV therapy regimen that contain ed ZDV, 3TC, and NVP were more likely to have G rade 2 or higher anemia at 1 and 2 months of life compared with infants who receiv ed ZDV alone (48.5% vs. 32.3%; P = 0.02). However, no difference was found in the incidence of severe anemia (G rade 3) between the two groups .34 Additionally, in a Canadian study, nonspecific signs and symptoms (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, rash, jitteriness, irritability) that were potentially attributable to medication -related adverse effects were Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-11 reported among the newborns who receiv ed presumptive HIV therapy but not among those who receiv ed ZDV only (10.2% vs. 0%; P < 0.001). Infants were more likely to discontinue presumptive HIV therapy prematurely than a regimen of ZDV alone (9.5% vs. 2.1%; P = 0.01).33 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend s a three -drug ARV regimen for HIV - postexposure prophylaxis following occupational and nonoccupational HIV exposure. HIV acquisition risk in these circumstances is often lower than for newborns who are at high risk for HIV acquisition.35,36 The pharmacokinetic ( PK) and safety data of presumptive HIV therapy have provided reassuring evidence for its use in the neonatal period. Although the use of NVP to prevent perinatal HIV transmission has been found to be safe in neonates and newborns of low birthweight, these prophylaxis -dose regimens target trough drug levels that are at least 10-fold lower than targeted therapeutic levels. However , recent studies of therapeutic doses of NVP and RAL have established safe doses that achieve targeted PK parameters.37-42 At this time, if a presumptive HIV therapy regimen is required, the Panel recommends using a combination of ZDV, 3TC, and NVP (treatment dose) or ZDV, 3TC, and RAL (see Table 11 and Table 12 ). The optimal duration of presumptive HIV therapy in newborns at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission is unknown. Some Panel members opt to discontinue a dditional medications if infant birth nucleic acid test (NAT ) results are negative, whereas others would continue presumptive HIV therapy for 2 to 6 weeks depending on the risk of HIV transmission. In all cases, ZDV should be continued for 6 weeks. If HIV infection is confirmed and the infant is receiving NVP , NVP should be replaced with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a boosted protease inhibitor. Information about selecting an agent and recommended dosing can be found in What to Start in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines . New dosing recommendations for abacavir (ABC) in neonates based on IMPAACT P1106 trial and two observational European and African cohorts are now available from the World Health Organization (WHO). ABC is not approved by t he U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for use in neonates and infants aged <3 months. However, a 2 mg/kg per dose twice -daily dose has been modeled using PK simulation and is endorsed by WHO using weight -band dosing for full -term infants from birth through 1 month of age. Limited observational data suggested safety of ABC when initiated in neonates <1 month of age (see Abacavir in the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ). At this time, the Panel does not recommend ABC as part of a presumptive HIV therapy regimen. However, in situation s where ZDV is not available or the infant has ZDV -associated toxicity, ABC could be considered an alternative to ZDV . This substitution should be considered in circumstances where increased risk of ZDV toxicity may exist , such as in infants with anemia or neutropenia. It also is suggest ed that negative testing for HLA-B5701 allele be confirmed prior to administration of ABC . Consulting an expert in pediatric HIV is recommended when selecting a therapy duration based on case -specific risk factors and interim HIV NAT results.43-45 Two -Drug Antiretroviral Prophylaxis To date, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development - HIV Prevention Trials Network 040/Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 1043 (NICHD-HPTN 040/PACTG 1043) trial is the only randomized clinical trial of multi-ARV prophylaxis in newborns at high risk of HIV acquisition.5 In this study, 1,746 formula -fed infant s born to women with HIV who did not receive any ARV drugs during pregnancy were randomized to receive one of three newborn prophylaxis regimens: the standard 6-week ZDV regimen; 6 weeks of ZDV plus three doses of NVP given during the first week of life (first dose given at birth or within 48 hours of birth, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-12 second dose 48 hours after the first dose, and third dose 96 hours after the second dose); and 6 weeks of ZDV plus 2 weeks of 3TC plus nelfinavir (NFV) . Forty-one percent of the mothers received ZDV during labor. The risk of intrapartum transmission was significantly lower in the two -drug and three -drug arms (2.2% and 2.5%, respectively, vs. 4.9% for 6 weeks of ZDV alone; P = 0.046 for each experimental alone).5 The NICHD - HPTN 040/PACTG 1043 regimen was associated with NRTI resistance in 3 of 53 participants (5.7%) with in ute ro infection who were treated with ZDV alone and in 6 of 33 participants (18.2%) who were treated with ZDV plus NVP (P > 0.05). In addition, the third drug in the three -arm regimen was NFV , which has highly variable PKs in this age group and did not reach the NFV target plasma concentration in 46% of study participants .46 Although transmission rates with the two regimens were similar, neutropenia was significantly more common with the thre e-drug regimen than with the two -drug or (27.5% vs. 14.9% vs. 16.4%; P < 0.001 for both comparisons ). For newborns who are at a high risk for HIV acquisition, the two-drug regimen used in NICHD-HPTN 040/PACTG 1043 is an option for preventing HIV transmission in infants aged 32 weeks ' gestation with a birthweight of 1.5 kg. This two -drug regimen consists of 6 weeks of ZDV plus three doses of the prophylactic dose of NVP, with the NVP doses given within 48 hours of birth, 48 hours after the first dose, and 96 hours after the second dose. The p rophylactic doses are NVP 12 mg per dose orally for infants weighing >2 kg and NVP 8 mg per dose orally for infants weighing 1.5 kg to 2 kg. These are the actual doses, not the milligram per kilogram doses. ZDV dosing is shown in Table 12 . Choosing B etween Presumptive HIV Therapy and Two -Drug A ntiretroviral Prophylaxis Because a spectrum of transmission risk depends on maternal viral load and other maternal and infant factors and no randomized trials have compar ed the safety and efficacy of presumptive HIV therapy and two -drug ARV prophylaxis, experts have differing opinions about when to initiate presumptive HIV therapy and when to initiate two-drug prophylaxis . For instance, among people who received ARV drugs during pregnancy but who have a detectable viral load within 4 weeks prior to delivery, the level of maternal viremia that would prompt the use of a t wo-drug ARV prophylaxis regimen or presumptive HIV therapy is not definitively known. In two large observational studies of women on combination antenatal ARV drugs, perinatal transmission rates were 0.05% and 0.3% when the mother had a viral load <50 copi es/mL at delivery. Rates of transmission in these studies increased to 1.1% and 1.5 percent when viral load w as 50 to 399 copies/mL and 2.8% and 4.1% when viral load w as >400 copies/mL.47,48 Although most Panel members would recommend initiating presumptive HIV therapy with any detectable level of viremia within 4 weeks prior to delivery, others may opt for a two -drug prophylaxis regimen if maternal viral load was less than 200 to 400 copies/mL. Emer ging data about the lack of serious safety issues associated with presumptive HIV therapy in newborns is reassuring, even though mild -to-moderate adverse events may occur more frequently. In summary, in scenarios where the infant is at high risk for HIV transmission, most Panel members recommend presumptive HIV therapy. In some situations, a two -drug ARV prophylaxis regimen may be considered (see Two -Drug Antiretroviral Prophylaxis in this section ). Choosing between these regimens will depend on the clinician's assessment of the likelihood of HIV transmission, and a decision should be made after weighing the risks and benefits of the proposed regimen and discussing these transmission prevent ion strategies with the parents. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-13 Consult ing an expert in pediatric HIV or the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) is recommended when select ing a regimen based on case-specific risk factors. Newborn s Born to Mothers with Unknown HIV Status Who Present in Labor Expedited HIV testing is recommended during labor for people with unknown HIV status ; if testing is not performed during labor, it should be performed as soon as possible after birth for the mothers and/or their newborns (see Maternal HIV Testing and Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure ). Expedited test results should be available within 60 minutes. If maternal or infant expedited testing is positive, the newborn should begin presumptive HIV therapy immediately without waiting for the results of supplemental tests. Expedited HIV testing should be available on a 24-hour basis at all facilities with a maternity service and/or neonatal intensive care unit or special care or newborn nursery. A positive initial test result in mothers or newborns should be presumed to indicate maternal HIV until supplemental testing clarifies maternal and newborn status . If appropriate test results for a mother (or newborn) are negative, newborn ARV drugs can be discontinued. Clinicians should be aware of their state laws because not all states allow HIV testing in infants without parental consent. A nursing mother who is suspected of having HIV based on an initial positive antibody or antibody/antigen test result should discontinue breastfeeding immediately until HIV is co nfirmed or ruled out. Pumping and temporarily discarding or freezing breast milk can be recommended. If HIV is ruled out, breastfeeding can resume. If HIV is confirmed, breastfeeding should be discontinued permanently.49 Newborn s Born to Moth ers with Antiretroviral Drug-Resistant Virus The optimal ARV regimen for newborns born to mothers with ARV drug -resistant virus is unknown. Although some studies have suggested that ARV drug-resistant virus may have decreased replicative capacity (reduced viral fitness) and transmissibility,50 perinatal transmission of multidrug-resistant virus does occur.51-56 Whether resistant virus in the mother increases the antepartum/intrapartum risk of HIV acquisition by the infant also is unknown. A recen tly reported secondary analysis of data from the NICHD-HPTN 040/PACTG 1043 study demonstrated that the risk of perinatal transmission was not related to the presence of drug resistance mutations in mothers who had not received ARV drugs before the start of the study (adjusted odds ratio 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-1.5).56 Maraviroc (MVC) was approved recently for infants 2 kg and may provide an additional treatment option for newborns of mothers carrying multidrug- resistant HIV -1 that remains CCR5-trophic .57 However, the lack of data about MVC as prophylaxis or treatment in infants and the risk of drug interactions will limit its role for routine use in neonates . The ARV regimen for newborns born to mothers with known or suspected drug resistance should be determined in consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist before delivery or through consultation via the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448- 8765). Additionally, no evidence exists that shows that neonatal prophylaxis regimens customized based on presence of maternal drug resistance are more effective than standard neonatal prophylaxis regimens. Newborn s with HIV Infection Until recently, neonatal AR V regimens were designed for prophylaxis against perinatal HIV transmission and were intended to be as simple as possible for practical use. There was little reason Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-14 to develop ARV regimens for the treatment of neonates because the long turnaround times to receive HIV NAT results meant that neonatal infections , in general, were not diagnosed during the first weeks of life. HIV NAT results are now available within a few days , and HIV in newborns is b eing diagnosed as early as the first days of life in many centers . A positive HIV NAT must be repeated to confirm HIV. However, ART initiation should not be delayed while waiting for the results of the confirmatory HIV NAT, given the low likelihood of a fa lse-positive HIV NAT. A confirmatory specimen should be obtained prior to ART initiation. To date , evidence that early treatment (before age 2 weeks) will lead conclusively to prolonged remission or better outcomes in newborns with HIV is lacking. Informa tion regarding the safety of early treatment of HIV in newborns has been reported from two studies. In the IMPAACT P1115 study, 54 infants with HIV began presumptive HIV therapy between 0.4 and 40 hours of life. G rade 3 or 4 related events \u2014most of which were hem atologic \u2014 occurred in 22 of 54 infants (41%) through 52 weeks of the study.58 Forty infants with HIV in Botswana began treatment with NVP plus ZDV plus 3TC at a median age of 2 days (range 1-5 days) and transitioned to lopiniavir/ritonavir (LPV/r ) plus ZDV plus 3TC at approximately 2 weeks of age . These infants had minimal toxicity during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Only one instance of Grade 3 neutropeni a was reported, and no instances of G rade 3 or 4 anemia were reported.31 Earlier diagnosis of HIV in newborns and the increasing use of presumptive HIV therapy in newborns at high risk for HIV acquisition have necessitated the investigation of dosing and the safety of ARV drugs in term and preterm newborns. Although data are still incomplete, especially for preterm newborns, PK and safety profiles of ARV drugs are increasingly available. As already noted, the recommended neonatal ARV doses for prophylaxis and for treatment are the same , with the important exception of NVP (see the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Sufficient data exist to provide dosing recommendations for the treatment of HIV in neonates using the following medications (see the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ): From birth in term and preterm newborns: ZDV, 3TC, NVP From , RAL , MVC , ABC From age 2 weeks in term newborns : LPV/r From age 4 weeks in term newborns: DTG Dosing recommen dations for for premature newborn s\u2014is summarized in Table 12 . For more detailed information about neonatal dosing recommendations and considerations when using these drugs, please see the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines . Consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV is recommended to assist with management of infants born at <32 weeks gestation. Newborns of Mothers Who Receive an HIV Diagnosis While Breastfeeding People with suspected HIV (e.g., a positive initial screening test) should discontinue breastfeeding immediately until HIV is ruled out. Pumping and temporarily discarding or freezing breast milk can be recommended to mothers who are suspected of having HIV but whose HIV serostatus is not yet confirmed and who want to continue to breastfeed. If HIV is ruled out, breastfeeding can resume. Breastfeeding is not recommended for people with confirmed HIV in the United States, including Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-15 those receiving ART (see Counseling and Managing Individuals with HIV in the United States Who Desire to Breastfeed ).59 The risk of HIV acquis ition associated with breastfeeding depends on multiple newborn and maternal factors, including maternal viral load and CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count.60 Newborns of people who develop acute HIV while breastfeeding are at greater risk of acquiring HIV than those whose mothers have chronic HIV infection61 because acute HIV infection is accompanied by a rapid increase in viral load and a corresponding decrease in CD4 count .62 Other than discontinuing breastfeeding, optimal strategies for managing a newborn who was breastfed by a mother with HIV (often because the mother just learned of her own HIV diagnosis ) have yet to be defined. Some Panel members would conside r the use of postexposure prophylaxis in newborns for 4 to 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding. Postexposure prophylaxis, however, is less likely to be effective in this circumstance than with other nonoccupational exposures because the exposure to breast milk is likely to have occurred over a prolonged period rather than during a single exposure to the virus . 63 Several studies of newborns who were breastfed by women with chronic HIV infection in low - resource settings have shown that a newborn's daily regimen of NVP , 3TC, LPV/r , plus the risk of postnatal infection during breastfeeding.64-68 See Counseling and Managing Individuals with HIV in the United States Who Desire to Breastfeed for additional information. No trials have evaluated the use of multidrug regimens to prevent transmission after cessation of breastfeeding in mothers with acute HIV infection. Given the high er risk of postnatal transmission from a person with acute HIV infection who is breastfeeding , an alternative approach favored by some Panel members is to offer presumptive HIV therapy until the infant 's HIV status can be determined . If the infant 's initial HIV NAT is negative, the optimal duration of presumptive HIV therapy is unknown. A 28-day course may be reasonable based on current recommendations for nonoccupational HIV exposure.63 When making decisions about ARV management, clinicians should consult a pediatric HIV specialist and counsel the parents on the potential risks and benefits of a particular treatment strategy. The National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448- 8765) can provide referral s to local or regional pediatric HIV specialists. Newborns exposed to HIV during breastfeeding should be tested for HIV infection prior to initiati ng presumptive HIV therapy, as well as 4 to 6 weeks and 4 to 6 months after diagnosis of maternal HIV infection and cessation of breastfeeding. An additional virologic test should be performed 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuing presumptive HIV therapy (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children ). If a n HIV -exposed newborn is already receiving an ARV prophylaxis regimen other than presumptive HIV therapy and is found to have HIV , prophylaxis should be discontinued and treatment for HIV should be initiated. Resistance testing should be performed, and the ART should be modified if needed (see the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Short -Term Antiretroviral Drug Safety Newborn prophylaxis with ZDV has been associated with only minimal toxicity, primarily transient hematologic toxicity (mainly anemia), which generally resolves by age 12 weeks (see Initial Postnatal Management of the Neonate Exposed to HIV ). Data on toxicit ies in newborns who were expos ed to multiple ARV drugs are limited . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-16 Other than ZDV, 3TC is the NRTI with the most clinical experience for neonat al prophylaxis. In early studies, neonatal exposure to combination ZDV /3TC therapy was limited , in general, to 1 week19,69,70 or 2 weeks.5 Six weeks of ZDV/ 3TC exposure in newborns also has been reported. These studies suggest that hematologic toxicity may be greater with ZDV/ 3TC than with ZDV alone, although the newborns in these studies also had in utero exposure to maternal HIV therapy that may have contributed to the toxicity. In a French study, more cases of severe anemia and neutropenia were observed in newborns who were exposed to 6 weeks of ZDV/ 3TC prophylaxis plus maternal antepartum ZDV/ 3TC than in a historical cohort of newborns who were exposed only to maternal and newborn ZDV. Anemia was reported in 15 % of newborns , and neutropenia was reported in 18% of newborns who were exposed to ZDV/ 3TC, with 2% of newborns requiring blood transfusion and 4% requiring treatment discontinuation for toxicity.71 Similarly, in a Brazilian study of maternal 6-week newborn ZDV/ 3TC prophylaxis, neonatal hematologic toxicity was common, with anemia seen in 69 % and neutropenia seen in 13 % of newborns.72 Recent data from the IMPAACT P1106 trial and two observational European and African cohorts provided reassuring data on the safety of ABC in infants when initiated at <3 months of age, including infants with weight <3 kg.73-75 See the Abacav ir section of the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines for additional information. At this time, the Panel suggests using ABC as an alternative to ZDV in certain situations and after negative HLA-B5701 allele testing. Experience with other NRTI drugs for neonatal prophylaxis is more limited.76,77 Hematologic and mitochondrial toxicity may be more common with exposure to multiple NRTI drugs than with exposure to a single NRTI .71,78-81 In rare cases, chronic multiple -dose NVP prophylaxis in pregnant women has been associated with severe and potentially life -threatening rash and hepatic toxicity.82 These toxicities have not been observed in newborns receiving prophylactic dosing with single -dose NVP or the two -drug ZDV regimen plus three doses of NVP in the first week of life used in NICHD -HPTN 040/PACTG 1043 or in breastfeeding newborns receiving NVP prophylaxis daily for 6 weeks to 18 months to prevent transmission of HIV via breast milk.5,64-66,68,83 The FDA approved infa nt dosing of RAL for term neonates aged 37 weeks ' gestation at birth and weighing 2 kg. Dosing information for RAL is not available for preterm or low -birthweight infants . PK modeling studies in infants with birthweight < 2.5 kg with gestational age at birth ranging from 32.7 to 40 weeks suggests that prematurity reduces RAL clearance, and a modified dosing regimen may be needed to avoid elevated plasma RAL concentrations.84 Infant RAL dosing needs to be increased at 1 week and 4 weeks of age. RAL is metabolized by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT ) 1A1, elimination of bilirubin. UGT enzyme activity is low at birth, and RAL elimination is prolonged in neonates. In addition, bilirubin and RAL may compete for albumin binding sites , and extremely elevated neonatal plas ma RAL concentrations could pose a risk of kernicterus .40 IMPAACT P1110 is a Phase 1, multicente r trial that enroll ed full-term neonates who were exposed to HIV and who we re at risk for acquiring perinatal HIV-1 infection, with or without in utero RAL exposure. Daily RAL was safe and well tolerated during the first 6 weeks of life. Infants were treat ed for 6 weeks from birth and followed for 24 weeks . Only one episode of G rade 4 neutropenia, possibly related to RAL, was reported. Among infants with RAL exposure (infants whose mothers received RAL within 2 to 24 hours before Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-17 delivery), the first dose of RAL should be delayed for 24 to 48 hours after birth .85 See the Raltegravir section of the Pediatric Antiretroviral Guidelines for additional information.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-1 Special Considerations for Antiretroviral Therapy Use in Adolescents with HIV Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel 's Recommendations All adolescents with HIV should receiv e maximally suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) therapy ; this is urgent for those who are sexually active, considering pregnancy, or pregnant (AII) . ARV regimen selection should include consideration of the adolescent 's individual needs and preferences (AIII) . See What to Start and Management of Ch ildren Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy for more information. All adolescents with HIV should be screened for mental health disorders and substance use disorders (AII) . Reproductive health issues \u2014including pregnancy intentions, contraceptive methods, safer sex techniques to prevent transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections , pre-exposure prophylaxis for partners, pregnancy planning, and preconception care \u2014should be discussed regularly (AI) . Providers should be aware of potential interactions between specific ARV medications and hormonal contraceptives that could lower contraceptive efficacy (AII*) . Pediatric and adolescent care providers should prepare adolescents for the transition into adul t care settings (AIII) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observ ational cohort studies with long -term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studi es in adults with long -term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents , but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents . Background The majority of individuals in the United States who acquired HIV through perinatal transmission are now adolescents or young adults . Most have had a long clinical course with an extensive antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history .1,2 Many older youth and adults may have initially received nonsuppressive monotherapy or dual therapy prior to the availability of combination ARV regimens , including fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations . Challenges that affect the treatment of adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV include e xtensive drug resistance, complex regimens, the long-term consequences of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART ) exposure ,3 the developmental transition to adulthood, and psychosocial factors .4-7 In the Unite d States, m ost adolescents aged 14 years who recently received HIV diagnose s acquired their infection by horizontal , rather than perinatal , transmission .8 They generally follow a clinical course similar to that of adults , and the Ad ult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines should be consulted for treatment recommendations for these patients . Additional information that is specific to the care of post -pubertal adolescents can be found in Adolescents and Young Adults with HIV . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-2 Timing and Selection of Antiretroviral Therapy All adolescents with HIV (like all people with HIV) should initiate ART as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis . Recommendations for ART selection in adolescents with sexual maturity ratings (SMRs) between 1 and 3 can be found in What to Start and Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . ART r ecommendations for adolescents and young adults with SMRs between 4 and 5 are available in the What t o Start section of the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines . Optimizing and simplifying treatment may be especially important when treating adolescents, because this can help improve adherence (see Modifying Antiretroviral Regimens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy ). Clinicians who are treating adolescents of ch ildbearing potential should consider additional factors before initiating ART, including potential drug interactions with contraception and the safety of using certain ARV drugs before conception or during pregnancy (see the Contraception, Pregnancy, and A ntiretroviral Therapy section below). Dosing of Antiretroviral Therapy for Adolescents with HIV Clinical providers need to pay attention to the transition of adolescents from pediatric to adult ART dosing. Many ARV drugs (e.g., abacavir, inhibitors [PIs]) are administered to children at higher body weight -based doses or body surface area -based doses than would be predicted by direc t extrapolation of adult doses. These doses are based on reported pharmacokinetic data that indicat e more rapid drug clearance in children than in adults . Therefore, failure to ensure weight -appropriate dosing in adolescents can result in an increased risk of drug toxicity if higher pediatric dosing is not transitioned to lower adult dosing (often between 25 kg and 40 kg, depending on the particular drug).9 Adherence Conce rns in Adolescents Poor adherence to ART is a common problem among adolescents with HIV . Both psychosocial and cognitive developmental factors may contribute to adherence challenges , and these factors should be assessed regularly. The adolescent 's individu al needs and preferences also should be considered when making decisions about initiating or changing ART. Comprehensive systems of care are required to serve both the medical and psychosocial needs of adolescents with HIV, because they are frequently inexperienced with managing their health care and may also lack health insurance. Adolescents with perinatal ly acquired HIV infection are at risk for neurocognitive impairment , which also can interfere with medication adherence. 10 Many also are at risk for mental health comorbidities , including psychiatric, behavioral, and substance use disorders that may interfere with adherence to ART .7,11 Compared with adults, youth have lower rates of viral suppression and higher rates of virologic rebound and loss to follow -up.12,13 For further discussion of interventions to promote adherence in adolescents, see the Adolescents and Young Adults with HIV section of the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and a 2013 review by Agwu and Fairlie .3 A specific chall enge is presented by youth who, despite interventions , remain unable to adhere to therapy. In these cases, alternative s to changing the ARV regimen can include , but are not limited to, simplifying treatment to a once -daily regimen or an FDC tablet; using cellphone alerts and other mHealth approaches to remind patients to take their medication and attend clinic visits ; initiating a short -term deferral of treatment until adherence improve s or while adherence -related problems (including mental health and substance use disorders) are aggressively addressed; initiating an adherence testing and training period during which a placebo (e.g., vitamin pill) is administered; scheduling appointments more frequently ; employing directly observed therapy; and avoid ing Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-3 regimens with a low genetic resistance threshold. Such decisions should be individualized, and the patient 's clinical and laboratory status monitored carefully. T he use of long-acting oral and injectable ARV regimens for adolescents is currently being investigated . These regimens may provide an alternative approach for adolescents with adherence challenges. Mental Health and Substance Use Concerns in Adolescents Many factors can increase the risk of adverse mental health outcomes among a dolescents with perinatally acquired HIV, including long -term medical treatment for a chronic disease, hospitalizations, stigma, the neurocognitive impacts of HIV, parental psychiatric and substance use disorders , and family and caregiver stress and loss. The prevalence of mental health disorders in youth with perinatally acquired HIV is high , with nearly 70% of these adolescents meeting the criteri a for a psychiatric disorder at some point in their lives .7,14-16 The m ost common conditions include anxiety and behavioral disorders, mood disorders (including depression), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In at least one cohort, the risk of psychosis and severe chronic mental health disorders w as higher in adolescents with perinatally acqui red HIV than expected in the general young adult population.17 Effectively managing psychiatric comorbidities can improve a patient 's adherence to medical care, including ART, and can lead to better academic performance and interpersonal relationships (see Substance Use Disorders and HIV in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines).11,18-20 Interventions that address mental health in youth with perinatal ly acquired HIV include pharmacologic interventions ; behavioral modification; and individual, family, and group counseling. The use of telehealth or counseling via videoconferencing may be feasible and acceptable and may improve access to mental health treatment for adolescents with HIV.21 However, data are lack ing on the effe ctiveness of these interventions on HIV clinical outcomes .22-24 Current evidence suggests that a combination of tailored psychotherapy\u2014such as cognitive behavioral therapy\u2014and pharmacotherapy can reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with HIV ; however, clinicians who prescrib e pharmacotherapy for depression must take potential interactions with ARV drugs into account . 25,26 There is evidence that adolescent s with perinatally acquired HIV are more likely to have substance use disorders compared to the general population.27 However, available studies on substance use among adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV show age of initiation and rates of substance use similar to age -matched peers without HIV.28 In a comparison of 390 youth with perinatal exposure t o HIV versus 211 youth living with perinatally acquired HIV, investigators from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) found that nearly half of both groups had ever used alcohol or marijuana , with a majority having used either substance in the last 3 months , and one out of five marijuana users reporting at least daily use.29 In another study, t here was no difference in substance use between adolescents exposed to HIV and adolescents living with HIV. While rates of substance use may not be higher in adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV, the impact on health outcomes \u2014includ ing interference with medication adherence and increased risk taking and decreased safe sex practices \u2014and the potential for comorbid mental health concerns make addressing substance use in adolescents with HIV an important consideration for HIV care providers.30,31 Providers who are caring for adolescents with HIV should incorporate screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders into routine care and refer patients t o age -appropriate services as needed. The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement provides some guidance and screening tools, particularly for depression. Screening tool s for substance use \u2014such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) or Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends , and Trouble (CRAFFT) \u2014 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-4 may be used.32 Providers also should consider emerging substance use trends when screening adolescents with HIV. Further guidance on screening tools for substance use and mental health is provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse 's Screenin g and Assessment Tools Chart . Sexually Transmitted Infections in Adolescents Clinicians should discuss the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with their patients. All adolescents with HIV should be screened for STIs and treated appropriately. Clinicians should regularly obtain a detailed sexual history for adolescents to determine which STI screening tests are appropriate. In young men who have sex with men , screening for ST Is often require s sampling from several body sites \u2014including the oropharynx, rect um, and urethra \u2014because multiple sites of infection are common. Furthermore, a negative assay at a single site does not exclude infection at another site .33 For a more detailed discussion o f STIs, see the most recent C enters for D isease Control and Prevention guidelines ,34 Human Papillomavirus Disease in the Adult and Adole scent Opportunistic Infection Guidelines , and Human Papillomavirus in the Pediatric O pportunistic Infection G uidelines. All female adolescents with HIV who are sexually active should receive gynecologic services. A ll adolescents should receive three doses of the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccination . Contraception, Pregnancy, and Antiretroviral Therapy Adolescents with HIV may initiate sexual activ ity before or after puberty. Sexually active adolescents are at risk for unintended pregnancy. A pproximately half of pregnancies in the United States , including those among women with HIV, are unintended or unplanned.35,36 Providers should regularly assess adolescents ' desires to become pregnant or avoid pregnancy ( also known as their pregnancy intentions) . Family planning counseling \u2014including a discussion of the risks of sexual HIV transmission, perinatal HIV transmission , and methods for reduc ing these risks \u2014should be provided to all youth. Reproductive health options \u2014such as pregnancy planning, preconception care, contracepti ve methods, pre -exposure prophylaxis for partners, the concept of Undetectable = Untransmi ttable (U=U),37,38 and safe r sex techniques (including instruction on t he correct and consistent use of condoms) for prevention of sexual HIV transmission\u2014should be discussed regularly (see U .S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use ). For additional information, refer to the following sections of the Perinatal Guidelines : Prepregnancy Counseling and Care for Persons of Childbearing Age with HIV and Reproductive Options When One or Both Partners Have HIV . The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence offers guidance about the integration of sexual and reproductive health care in pediatric clinical settings .39 The possibility of planned and unplanned pregnancy should be considered when selecting a n AR V regimen for a female adolescent. The most vulnerable period in fetal organogenesis is the first trimester, often before pregnancy is recognized. When treating adolesc ents of childbearing potential, clinicians should carefully review the potential toxicities of ARV drugs and consider making any necessary changes to a regimen as promptly as possible (e.g., before conception, when possible). For information about the sele ction and management of ARV drugs before and during pregnancy for people with HIV who are of childbearing age, s ee Table 5 in the Recomme ndations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy section of the Perinatal Guidelines . When discussing ART options with female adolescents and their caregivers , it is important to consider the benefits and risks of all ARV drugs and to provide the information and counseling needed to support informed decision-making (see Appendix C : Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-5 Interactions Between Contraceptives and Antiretroviral Drugs People living with HIV can use all available contraceptive methods, including hormonal contraceptives, implantable devices, intrauterine devices, the transdermal patch , and a vaginal ring .40 Several PI s and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors alter the metabolism of oral contraceptives , which theoretically may reduc e the eff icacy of oral contraceptive agent s or increase the risk of estrogen-related or progestin-related adverse effects41-43 (see Drug -Drug Interactions in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker ). Integrase strand transfer inhibitors appear to have no interaction with estrogen-based contraceptives.44,45 For more information about p otential interactions between ARV drugs and hormonal contraceptives , see Table 3 in the Perinatal Guidelines . Concerns about loss of bone mineral density with long-term use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DMPA ), with or without coadministration of ART (specifically TDF ), should not preclude the use of DMPA as an effective contraceptive, unless clinical evidence indicates bone fragility. Pregnant Adolescents with HIV Adolescents who want to become pregnant should receive preconception counseling and care, including a discussion of pregnancy planning and special considerations when using AR V drugs during pregnancy (see Prepregnancy Counseling and Care for Persons of Childbearing Age with HIV in the Perinatal Guidelines) . Pregnancy should not preclude the use of optimal therapeutic ARV regimens. Clinicians need to consider maternal and fetal safety, as well as the need to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV , when selecting regimens for pregnant people or adolescents who are planning to become pregnant. See the Prepregnancy Counseling and Care for Persons of Childbearing Age with HIV for more details about choosing an ARV regimen for pregnant people with HIV, including adolescents. Pregnancies occur as adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV enter adolescence and young adulthood.46,47 Some studies suggest higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcome s\u2014such as small -for-gestational- age infants \u2014among pregnant people with perinatal ly acquired HIV than among those who acquired HIV by horizontal transmission . Unplanned pregnancy is not uncommon in youth living with perinatally acquired HIV.47-49 Women with perinatally acquired HIV als o may be more likely to have complex ARV histories , virologic failure , and drug resistance at the time of pregnancy .50-52 However , the rate of perinatal transmission among pregnant people with perinatally acquired HIV who are receiving ART appears to be similar to th e rate among people on ART who acquired HIV by horizontal transmission.53-57 Special Considerations for Adolescents with HIV Who Are Sexual Minorities Adolescence represents a period of emerging recognition of sexual identity. Adolescents with HIV who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or nonbinary require both culturally competent providers and tailored medical care. Health care providers should ask patients nonju dgmental questions about their sexual and gender identity to determine whether they require specific medical and support services . It is important to consider the possibility of drug-drug interactions in adolescents who are receiving both ART and gender- affirming hormon e therapy. Additional resources for the care of these adolescents can be found in the Adolescents and Y oung A dults with HIV section and the Transgender People with HIV section of the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-6 Transitioning Adolescents into Adult HIV Care Settings Transition, as defined by Reiss et. al., may be described as \"a multifaceted, active process that attends to the medical, psychosocial , cognitive and educational, or vocational needs of adolescents as they move from the child- to the adult -focused health care system.\"58 Facilitating a s uccessful transition for adolescents with HIV from their pediatric/adolescent care clinic to adult care is important , but challenging.59-62 Many adolescents disengage from care duri ng the transition to adult care, putting them at r isk for HIV progression and transmission to partners.63-65 Pediatric and adolescent care providers and their multidisciplinary teams should have a formal written plan in place to transition adolescents t o adult care. Although transition generally occurs when individual s are in their late teens or early 20s, discussion of and planning for the transi tion process should be initiate d early in the teen years , with involvement from both the adolescent and their parents and/or caregivers . Care models for children and adolescents with perinata lly acquired HIV tend to be family centered, consisting of a multidisciplinary team that often includes physicians, nurses, social workers, and mental health professionals. These providers generally have long -standing relationships with patients and their families, and care is rendered in discreet, intimate settings. Although expert care also is provided under the adult HIV care medical model, adolescent s and their car egivers may be unfamiliar with the busier, more individual -centered clinics that are typical of adult medical care providers . These providers often expect patients to assume a greater level of responsibility for their care, and adolescents may be uncomfortable with providers with whom they do not have a long- standing relationship. One multisite study in the United States found t hat adolescents who transitioned to adult care at an older age reported greater satisfaction with their care than those who transitioned at a younger age. Additionally, adolescents who reported being able to perform certain tasks that were related to their care (e.g., making appointments, requesting prescriptions, arranging transportation to appointments ) were more likely to be engaged in adult care.66 It may be beneficial t o provide adolescent s, caregivers, and their new adult medical care providers with support and guidance regarding the expectations for each person involved in the patient -provider relationship. In this situation, it may be helpful for a pediatric care provider and an adult care provider to share joint care of a patient for a period. Adolescent care providers should have a candid discussion with the transitioning adolescent and their caregivers to understand what qualities the adolescent considers most important when choosing an adult care setting (e.g., confidentiality, small clinic size, low patient-to -provider ratio, availability of after-school or evening appointments). Social determinants \u2014such as the patient 's developmental status, behavioral/mental health comorbidities , housing, family support, employment status , recent discharge from foster care, peer pressure, illicit drug use, and incarceration\u2014should be considered during transition. No definitive model of transition to adult HIV care currently exists , and only a limited number of studies have report ed on outcomes following transition, al though research in this area is ongoing. However, emerging qualitative research has revealed the importance of the patient -provider relationship, including trust, the need for developmentally appropriate preparation for transition, and opportunities for growth and independence.62,67 Recent studies have shown po tential for successful transition and ongoing retention using models that include a multidisciplinary approach, which utiliz es providers co-trained in both internal medicine and pediatrics, peer navigators, social workers , mental health support , and a youth-focused care model for adolescents who were already attending adult HIV clinic s.68,69 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-7 Several studies have shown that youth with HIV who transitioned in to adult care settings had higher rates of attrition from care than those who remain ed in pediatric/adolescent care; U .S. stud ies show that less than half of youth who transitioned care to an adult clinic remained in care after 9 to 12 m onths .63,64,70 In addition to poor retention in care, several studies have identified poor viral suppression rates in transitioned youth and young adults with HIV.2 Pre-transition vi rologic failure and longer linkage time s have been associated with worse outcomes post -transition.62,65 Furthermore , some r eport s from the United Kingdom suggest that the mortality rate of adolescents with HIV increases after transition,19,65,71 underscoring the need to critically examine transition and determine the best mechanisms to optimize the long -term outcomes for youth with perinatal ly acquired HIV.63 Some general guidelines , mostly based on anecdotal evidence and consensus expert opinion, are available about transition plans and who might benefit most from them.60,72-79 To maximize the likelihood of success, providers should prepare adolescents for transition long before it occurs. Attention to the following key areas could improve retention in care and minimize the risk of ART interruptions : Educating HIV care teams and staff about transitioning; Beginning discussions about transition early, before the actual transition process ; Developing a written , individualized transition plan to address comprehensive care needs , including medical, psychosocial , and financial aspects of transitioning; Optimizing communication between providers at pediatric/adolescent clinics and providers at adult clinics; Identifying adult care providers who are expert s in providing care to adolescents and young adults; Fostering a trusting patient-provider relationship with new adult care providers; Addressing barriers caused by a lack of information, stigma , or disclosure concerns ; Discussing the differences between the practice styles of adult clinics and pediatric/ adolescent clinic s; Helping youth develop the skills needed to manage their care, including counseling them on appointment management, the appropriate use of a primary care provider, the importance of prompt symptom recognition and reporting, and the importance of managing me dications , insurance, and state and federal benefits; Identifying an optimal clinic model for a given setting (e .g., simultaneous transition of mental health and/or case management services versus a gradual phase -in); Clearly defining the desired outcomes for the transition, such as retention in care, ongoing access to other services (e.g., case management, mental health), clinical outcomes (e.g., viral suppression), and patient satisfaction ; Implementing ongoing evaluations to measure the success of a transition model; Engaging in regular multidisciplinary case conferences between adult and adolescent care providers; Implementing interventions that may be associated with improved outcomes, such as support groups and mental health consultation; and Identifying a care navigator who can provide support during the transition.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-16 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-1 Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel 's Recommendations Strategies to maximize adherence should be discussed before and/or at initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and before changing regimens (AIII) . Adherence to therapy must be assessed and promoted at each visit, and strategies to maintain and/or improv e adherence must be continually explored (AIII) . In addition to viral load monitoring, at least one other method of measuring adherence to ART should be used ( AIII). Once -daily antiretroviral regimens and regimens with a low pill burden should be prescribed whenever feasible (AII*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observ ational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studi es in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents , but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Background Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a principal deter minant of virologic suppression. Suboptimal adherence may include missed or late doses, treatment interruptions and discontinuations, and subtherapeutic or partial dosing.1,2 Poor adherence will result in subtherapeut ic plasma antiretroviral (ARV ) drug concentrations, facilitating the development of resistance to one or more drugs in a given ARV regimen and possibl e cross -resistance to other drugs in the same class. Multiple factors \u2014including regimen potency, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, viral fitness, and the genetic barrier to ARV resistance \u2014influence the adherence -resistance relationship.3-5 In addition to compromising the efficacy of the current regimen, suboptimal adherence can limit the options for future effective ARV drug regimens in patients who develop multidrug -resistant HIV ; it also can increa se the risk of secondary transmission of drug-resistant virus . Poor adherence to ARV drugs is commonly encountered in the treatment of children and adolescents with HIV. A variety of factors \u2014including medication formulation, frequency of dosing, drug toxicities and side effects, and the child 's age and developmental stage , as well as psychosocial , behavioral , and sociodemographic characteristics of children and caregivers \u2014have been associated with inadequate adhere nce. However, no consistent predictors of either good or poor adherence in children have been identified.6-8 Several studies have demonstrated that adherence is not static and can vary with time on treatment.9 More recently, findings from the U .S. Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) demonstrated that the prevalence of nonadherence increased with age. Among 381 children and adolescents with perinatal ly acquired HIV, the prevalence of nonadherence increased from 31% to 50% (P < 0.001), and the prevalence of unsuppressed viral loads increased from 16% to 40% (P < 0.001) between pre-adolescen ce and late adolescence/young adulthood.10 Similarly, in a Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-2 report from the Early Pediatric Initiation Canada Cure Cohort, only 73% of the children initiated on ART maintained viral suppression 3 years after it was first achieved.11 These findings illustrate the difficulty of maintaining high levels of adherence and underscore the need to work with patients and their families to ensure that adherence education, support, and assessment are integral components of care. Specific Adherence Issues in Children Adherence is a complex health behavior that is influenced by drug regimen, patient and family factors, and the patient -provider relationship. 12,13 Despite improvements over the last several years, the availability of once -daily and single -tablet ARV regimens and palatable f ormulations for infants and young children are limited .14 Furthermore, infants and children are dependent on others for medication administration ; adult caregivers may face barriers that undermine adherence in children, includ ing forgetting doses, changes in routine, being too busy, and child refusal.15,16 Caregivers also may be inadequately prepared to support their child' s adherence. In a study of communication strategies among caretakers of children with perinatally acquired HIV in rural South Africa, many caregivers used coercion and threats of grave consequences of nonadherence as a communication strategy to enforce adherence.17 Furthermore, s ome caregive rs may place too much responsibility for managing medications on older children and adolescents before they are developmentally able to undertake such tasks.18 Adherence also may be jeopardized by social and health issues within a family (e .g., substance use , poor physical or mental health , unstable housing, poverty, violence, involvement with the criminal justice system, limited social support).19-22 Adherence Assessment and Monitoring Clinici ans should begin assessing potential barriers to adherence and discussing the importance of adherence with patients before initiating or changing an ARV regimen. Evaluations should assess social and behavioral factors that may influence adherence and should identify individual needs for intervention. Clinicians should ask patients about their experience with taking medications, as well as concerns and expectations about treatment. Before be ginning treatment, it is important that the patient explicitly agree to the treatment plan, which should include strategies to support adherence. I t is also important to alert patients to potential adverse effects (AEs) of ARV drugs (e.g., nausea, headaches, abdominal discomfort , sleep disturbances ), explain how they can be managed, and emphasize the importance of informing the clinical team if they occur. A routine adherence assessment should be incorporated into every clinic al visit. Adherence is difficult to assess accurately; different methods of assessment have yielded different results , and each approach has limitations.23-25 Viral load monitoring is the most useful indicator of adherence and is a routine component of monitoring individuals who are on ART (see Plasma HIV -1 RNA [Viral Load ] and CD4 Count Monitoring in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). It also can be used as positive reinforcement to encourage continued adherence .26 In addition to viral load monitoring, clinicians should use at least one other method to assess adherence.24 Table 13 below includes common approaches to monitoring medication adherence . Strategies to Improve and Support Adherence When concerns about adherence emerge , a patient should be seen and/or contacted frequently (by telephone, text message , email, and social networking as allowed within the context of local legal and regulatory requirements) to assess adherence and to determine the need for strategies that can improve and support adherence. During the first month of treatment (or a regimen change), a patient can be contacted weekly, or even daily, if necessary. The growing use of telemedicine visits, which Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-3 allow remote and often face -to-face contact, provide s new opportunities to support families and visualize ART handling/swallowing , as well as to conduct directly observed therapy (DOT) in the home setting (see Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection and Table 3 ). Strategies should include simplifying the ARV drug regimen, developing treatment plans that integrate medication administration into daily routines (e.g., associating medication administration with daily activities , such as brushing teeth), and optimizing the use of social and community support servi ces. M ultifaceted approaches that include regimen -related strategies; educational, behavioral, and supportive strategies focused on children and families; and strategies that focus on health care providers may be more effective than one specific interventi on. Table 1 4 below summarizes some of the strategies that can be used to support and improve adherence to ARV medications. The Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a web -based toolkit (consisting of four evidence- based HIV medication adherence strategies ) to HIV care providers .27 A recent analysis using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)-Adolescent model of HIV disease and treatment model ed the impact of a 12- month hypothetical adherence intervention (based on an interactive smartphone -based reminder system) among youth with HIV in the United States. Compared with the standard of care , the analysis showed that youth- targeted adherence interventions , even with modest efficacy to improve virologic suppression, could improve life expectancy, prevent onward HIV transmissions , and be cost -effective.28 Regimen -Related Strategies To the extent possible, ARV regimens should be simplified with respect to the number of pills or volume of liquid prescribed as well as the number of daily doses , and drugs in the regimen should be chosen to minimize drug interactions and AEs . 29 Efforts should be made to reduce the pill burden and pill size and to prescribe once -daily ARV regimen s and single -tablet regimens whenever feasible (see Table 16 in Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ). With the introduction of new ARV drug classes and a wider array of once -daily formulations \u2014including some medications that are now available in a small pill size \u2014more options for less toxic, simplified regimens are now available , particularly for older children and adolescents. Several studies in adults have demonstrated better adherence with once -daily ARV regimens than with twice -daily regimens , and better adherence with single -tablet with multiple -tablet regimens .14,30-33 Appendix A , Table 1 shows which ARV drugs are available in fixed-dose combination (FDC ) tablet s, and Appendix A, Table 2 provides information about minimum body weight requirements and other considerations when using FDC tablets in children. When nonadherence is related to the poor palatability of a liquid formulation or crushed pills, the offending taste can sometimes be masked with a small amount of flavoring syrup or food if simultaneous administration of food is not contraindicated (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ).34 Unfortunately, the taste of lopinavir/ritonavir cannot be masked with flavoring syrup. A small study of childr en and youth aged 4 years to 21 years found that t raining children to swallow pills was associated with improved adherence at 6 months post -training .35 Finally , if drug- specific toxicities are thought to be contributing to nonadherence, efforts should be made to alleviate the AE s by changing the particular drug (or, if necessary , the drug regimen) when feasible. Patient/Family -Related Strategies Patient and caregiver education is an essential component of establishing good medication adherence in children. Educating families about adherence should begin before initiat ing or chang ing ARV medications and should include a discussion of the goals of therapy, the importance of optimizing adherence, and the specific plans for supporting and maintaining a child's medication adherence. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-4 Caregiver adherence education strategies should include the provision of both information and adherence tools, such as written and visual materials; a daily schedule illustrating times and doses of medications; and demonstration of th e use of syringes, medication cups, and pill boxes. Additionally, it may be helpful to a ssess the medication adherence of the caregiver or other household members who currently tak e ARV drugs or other chronic medications. Several behavioral tools can be us ed to integrate taking medications into a child 's daily routine. The use of behavior modification techniques, especially the application of positive reinforcements and the use of small incentives (including financial incentives) for taking medications, can be effective tools to promote adherence. 36 Treating mental health disorders (e.g., depression) may facilitate adherence to complex ARV regimens .37,38 If the child has not been informed of their HIV status, HIV disclosure should be discussed with the caregivers . In a recent review that explored the relationship between ART adherence and disclosure , five studies linked disclosure to improved adherence, four studies found that disclosure led to worse adherence among study participants , and five studies found no association.39 In interviews with caregivers of children with HIV in South Africa, investigators found that caregivers who had disclosed to their child that they (i.e., the child) were living with HIV were truthful in their communications and named the disease as HIV , but communication about HIV was infrequent and focused on pill taking. By comparison, those who had not disclosed used deception, deflecti on, and coercion in response to health-related qu estions and to enforce adherence .17 The decision to disclose HIV status should not necessarily be expected to improve adherence but should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the psychosocial milieu a nd the needs of the child and family. In poorly adherent children who are at risk of disease progression and who have severe and persistent aversion to taking medications , the use of a gastrostomy tube may be considered.40 If adequate resources are available, home-nursing interventions or DOT also may be beneficial. The evidence is mixed as to the efficacy of programs that are designed to improve adherence through DOT, but DOT may still be a useful strategy for some patients.41-43 Among 50 adolescents on atazanavir -based second-line therapy participating in a study of modified directly administered ART (mDAART), there was a significant increase in self -reported adherence (relative risk [RR] = 0.1; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.02-0.8 ; P = 0.023) but a nonsignificant increase in virological suppression to <1,000 copies/m L (P = 0.105) among those randomized to the intervention arm compared to the standard of care arm.44 A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 12-week multicomponent intervention\u2014including remote coaching, electronic dose monitoring, and tailored outreach (Triggered Escalating Real -Time Adherence) \u2014for viremic youth in the U nited States demonstrated improved adherence but not viral suppression compared with the standard of care.21 Other strategies to support adherence include using mobile app lication s (apps) that remind patients to take medications; setting patients ' cellphone alarms to go off at medication times; sending text - message reminders; conducting motivational interviews; providing pill boxes , blister packaging, and other adherence support tools; and deliver ing medications to the home. The CDC has an adherence toolbox, which includ es a free mobile app (Every Dose Every Day mobile app) that is available through its website . Several systematic reviews evaluating the u se of mobile phone technologies to improve ART adherence (mHealth) have been published . In a recent review , the authors found what they described as \"ambiguous results with high variability\" about the effectiveness of mHealth interventions to improve adherence in low - and middle -income countries .45 Of 17 studies, 56% reported a statistically significant positive impact of mHealth o n adherence; 44% reported insignificant results. Another systematic re view reported that the efficacy of mobile short message service ( SMS) interventions Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-5 varied depending on the specific SMS intervention tested.46 A third systematic review of the effectiveness of using mobile phone interventions to improve adherence to ART also report ed mixed results; effectiveness varied depending on the measured outcome s and the specific intervention ( e.g., whether the study evaluated the use of text s or the use of phone calls).47 It should be noted, however, that the evidence base for effective adherence interventions in adolescents and young adults who are taking daily ART is limited.48-54 Lowenthal et al. examined the association between medication-specific reactance\u2014 an aversive response to perceived threats against personal agency (behav ioral freedom)\u2014and treatment failure in a cohort of adolescents with HIV in Botswana. The authors explain that reactant individuals may hear health messaging as a threat to their perceived freedom and respond by engaging in the opposed behavior. In the study, adolescents were asked to rate the following two questions on a 5-point scale , ranging from definitively false (1) to definitively true (5): (1) whether verbal reminders to take medicines made them want to avoid taking them, and (2) whether they fel t anger when reminded to take medicine s. Reactant adolescents , those scoring >4, had a 2.05-fold (95% CI, 1.23-3.41) greater odds of treatment failure than non-reactant youth ( P = 0.043). Psychological reactance needs further study and may provide some ins ight into adherence behaviors among youth ; it also may be important to consider in adherence counseling and in designing interventions .55 Two recently published studies provided evidence of the efficacy of peer-based interventions to improve ART adherence and viral suppression among adolescents and young people living with HIV in Africa . In Project YES! in Ndola , Zambia, 273 youth aged 15 to 24 years receiving HIV care in four health facilities \u2014including a children 's hospital \u2014were randomly assigned to monthly meetings with youth peer mentors. At 6 months , viral suppression improved in both study arms, but among participants in care at the pediatric clinic, the rate of viral suppression increased from 37.5% to 70.5% in the intervention arm versus the comparison arm , 60.3% to 59.4% (interaction term odds ratio [OR ], 4.66; 95% CI, 1.84-11.78).56 Mavhu et al. tested the efficacy of a peer -led differentiated service delivery intervention on HIV clinical outcomes among adolescents with HIV aged 13 to 19 years in rural Zimbabwe. Sixteen clinics were randomized to standard of care or the enhanced intervention in which adolescents were assigned a community adolescent treatment supporter ; attended monthly support group; and received text messages, calls, home visits, and clinic -based counseling. Overall , 212 adolescents were recruited at intervention sites and 284 at control sites, with a median age of 15 years. A t 96 weeks, among 479 adolescents with data, 52 (25%) adolescents in the intervention arm versus 97 (36%) in the control arm had viral load >1,000 copies/mL or had died (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 -0.94; P = 0.03). The study reported 28 deaths (17 in the intervention arm , 11 in the control arm) and 57 hospital admissions (20 in the intervention arm , 37 in the control arm). These s tudies demonstrate that peer-based interventions have the potential to improve adherence and health outcomes among youth with HIV.57 Further evidence of the efficacy of peer -support interventions for people living with HIV comes from a recent systematic review and met a-analysis , including 20 RCTs comprising 7 ,605 participants from nine countries . The authors found superior retention in care (RR 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12 at 12 months follow -up) and better ART adherence (RR 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10 at 3 months follow - up) but no statistically significant difference in viral suppression (RR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.11 at 6 months follow -up) among peer -support participants .58 Health Care Provider- Related Strategies To improve and support ART adherence, providers should maintain a nonjudgmental attitude, establish trust with patients and caregivers, and identify mutually acceptable goals for care. Providers can improve adherence through their relationships with patients ' families. This process begins early Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-6 in a provider's relationship with a family , when the clinician obtains explicit agreement about the medication and treatment plan and any further strategies to support adherence. Fostering a trusting relationship and engaging in open communication are particularly important. Focus groups and semi - struct ured interviews were conducted with adolescents and their caregivers participating in a longitudinal adherence study. Participants who self- reported high adherence but for whom electronically monitored data reflected low adherence were selected . Adolescent s described hiding and discarding pills and lying about their adherence . Adolescents and parents considered negative feedback for prior poor adherence as motivation for efforts to hide current poor adherence. The authors suggest that positive feedback for truth- telling may help develop family and staff alliances in support of adherence.59 Provider characteristics that have been associated with improved patient adherence in adults include consistency, willingness to give information and ask questions, technical expertise, and commit ment to follow -up. Creating an environment in the health care setting that is child-centered and includes caregivers in adherence support also has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. Immigrant children and families may face unique social and cultural issues; it is important to recognize these issues and facilitate linkage to community resources, particularly for fami lies who are recent immigrants. Providing comprehensive multidisciplinary care (e.g., with nurses, case managers, pharmacists, social workers, psychiatric care providers) also may better serve more complex patient and family needs, including adherence. Provider-initiated education about viral load and counseling targeted at understanding viral load results , the health benefits of undetectable viral load, and the undetectable = untransmittable (U = U) concept are other strategies providers can use. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-7 Table 1 3. Approaches for Monitoring Medication Adherence Routine Assessment of Medication Adherence in Clinical Carea Description Monitor viral load . Viral load monitoring should be done more frequently after initiating o r changing medications .a Assess a quantitative self -report of missed doses . Ask the patient and/or caregiver about the number of missed doses over a defined period (1, 3 , or 7 days) . Request a description of the medication regimen. Ask the patient and/or caregiver about the name, appearance, and number of medications and how often the medications are taken. Assess barriers to medication administration . Engage the patient and caregiver in a dialogue about potential barriers to adherence and strategies to overcome them. Monitor pharmacy refills . Approaches include a pharmacy -based or clinic -based assessment of on -time medication refills . Employ telemedicine to monitor and support medication administration. Telemedicine visits allow remote and often face-to-face contact and provide new opportunities to support families ; to visualize ART preparation, handling, and swallowing ; and to conduct DOT in the home setting . Conduct announced and unannounced pill counts . Approaches include asking patients to br ing medications to the clinic , conduct ing home visits, or providing referral to community health nursing. Targeted Approaches to Monitor ing Adherence in Special Circumstances Description Implement DOT in person and via telemedicine . Includ e a brief period of hospitalization if indicated . Measure drug concentration in plasma or DBS. Measuring drug concentration s can be considered for particular drugs . Approaches to Monitor ing Medication Adherence in Research Settings Description Measure drug concentrations in hair . Measuring hair drug concentrations can be considered for particular drugs; it provides a good measure of adherence over time .23,60,61 Use electronic monitoring devices . Approaches include MEMS caps and Wisepill . Use mobile phone -based technologies . Approaches include i nteractive voice response, text messaging , and mobile apps . a See Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection regarding the frequency of adherence assessment after initiating or changing therapy.

Strategies to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral Medications Initial Intervention Strategies Establish trust and identify mutually acceptable goals for care. Obtain explicit agreement on the need for treatment and adherence. Identify depression, low self -esteem, substance abuse, or other mental health issues in the child/adolescent and/or the caregiver that may affect adherence. Evaluate and initiate treatment for mental health issues before starting ARV drugs, if possible. Determine whether the child is aware of their HIV status. Consider talking to the child' s caregivers about disclosing this information to the child in a developmentally appropriate way. Identify family, friends, health team members, and others who can suppor t adherence. Educate the patient and family about the critical role of adherence in therapy outcome, including the relationship between partial adherence and resistance and the potential impact on future drug regimen choices . Develop a treatment plan that the patient and family understand and to which they feel committed. Work with the patient and family to make specific plans for taking medications as prescribed and for supporting adherence. A ssist them in arranging administ ration during day care, school, and in other settings , when needed. Consider home delivery of medications. Establish a patient 's readiness to take medication by staging practice sessions or by other means. Schedule a home visit or telemedicine visit to rev iew medications and determine how they will be administered in the home setting. In certain circumstances, c onsider a brief period of hospitalization at the start of therapy for patient education and to assess the tolerability of the chosen medications. Medication Strategies Choose the simplest regimen possible ; reduc e dosing frequency , pill size, and number of pills (see Appendix A, Table 1 and Appendix A, Table 2). When choosing a regimen, consider the patient 's daily and weekly routines and potential variations in patient and family activities . Choose the most palatable medicine possible (pharmacists may be able to add syrups or flavoring agents to increase palatability). Choose drugs with the fewest AEs; provide anticipatory guidance for managing AEs. Simplify food requirements for medication administration. Prescribe drugs carefully to avoid adverse drug- drug interactions. Assess pill -swallowing capacity and offer pill -swallowing training and aids ( e.g., pill-swallowing cup , pill glide) . Adjust pill size as needed. Follow -Up Intervention Strategies Have more than one member of the multidisciplinary team monitor adherence at each visit and in between visits by telephone, email, text, and social media, as needed. Provide ongoing support, encouragement, and understanding of the difficulties associated with maintaining adherence to daily medication regimens . Provide education and counseling that explain the meaning and significance of viral load results . Use patient education aids , including pictures, calendars, and stickers. Encourage the use of pill boxes, reminders, mobile apps, alarms, and timers. Provide follow -up clinic visits, telephone calls, text messages , and telemedicine visits to support and assess adherence. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-9 Provide access to support groups, peer groups, or one -on-one counseling fo r caregivers and patients, especially for those with known depression or drug use issues that decrease adherence. Provide pharmacist -based adherence support, such as medication education and counseling, blister packs, refill reminders, automatic refills, and home delivery of medications. Consider DOT at home, in the clinic, or , in certain circumstances, during a brief period of inpatient hospitalization. Consider gastrostomy tube use in certain circumstances.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-1 Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel's Recommendations In children with HIV who have severe or life -threatening toxicity (e.g., a hypersensitivity reaction) , all antiretroviral (ARV) drugs should be stopped immediately (AIII) . Once symptoms of toxicity have resolved, ARV therapy should be resumed with substitution of a different ARV drug or drugs for the offending agent(s) (AII*) . When modifying ARV therapy because of toxicity or intolerance to a specific drug in children with virologic suppression , changing one drug in a multidrug regimen is permissible; if possible, an agent with a different toxicity and adverse effect profile should be chosen (AI*). The toxicity and the medication presumed responsible should be documented in the medical record of the patient, and the caregiver and patient should be advised of the drug -related toxici ty (AIII) . In general, dose reduction is not a recommended option for management of ARV toxicity (AII*) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or mor e well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long -term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -design ed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long -term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Medication Toxicity or Intolerance The overall benefits of viral suppression and improved immune function as a result of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) far outweigh the risks associated with the adverse effects (AEs) of some antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. AE s have been reported , howeve r, with the use of all ARV drugs . Currently recommended ARV regimens are associated with fewer serious and intolerable AEs than regimens used in the past . In the mid -1990s when combination ART was introduced, AEs were among the most common reasons for switching or discontinuing therapy and for medication nonadherence1-3 (see Adverse Effects of Antiretroviral Agents in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). In recent clinical trials , however, < 10% of ARV-treated pa tients had treatment -limiting AE s.4-13 The incidence of some lon ger-term complications of ART (e.g., bone or renal toxicity, dyslipidemia, accelerated cardiovascular disease) might be underestimated , because most clinical trials enroll a select group of patients based on highly specific inclusion criteria and the durat ion of participant follow -up is relatively short .6,7,14-16 To achieve sustained viral suppression during a child's lifetime , both short - and long-term ART toxicities must be anticipated. The clinician must consider potential AE s and issues with medication palatability when selecting an ARV regimen, as well as the individual child's comorbidities, concomitant medications, and history of drug intolerance or viral resistance . The AEs caused by ARV drugs can vary from mild, more common symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance , fatigue ) to infrequent but severe and life -threatening, illness. Drug-related toxicity can be Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-2 acute (i.e., occurring soon after a drug has been administered), subacute (i.e., occurring within 1 day to 2 days after administration ), or late (i.e., occurring after prolonged drug administration). For a few ARV medications, pharmacogenetic markers associated w ith the risk of early toxicity have been identified; however, the only marker that is routinely screened for is HLA -B*5701, a marker for abacavir (ABC) hypersensitivity.17 For selected children aged <3 years who require treatment with efavirenz (EFV) , 2B6 genotype, should be assessed in to prevent toxicity17-21 (see Efavirenz in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). For agents such as EFV , therapeutic ranges for plasma concentrations , as determined by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), may indicate the need for dose reduction or modification of ART in patients who experience central nervous system (CNS) AEs . The most common acute and chronic AEs that are associated with currently recommended ARV drugs or drug classes are presented in Tables 15a-15k, which are listed below. These tables include infor mation on common causative drugs, estimated frequency of occurrence, timing of symptoms, risk factors, potential preventive measures, and suggested clinical management strategies . The tables also include selected references that provide further information about these toxicities in pediatric patients . Table 15a. Central Nervous System Toxicity Table 15b. Dyslipidemia 15c. Effects Table cts 15j. Osteopenia and Osteoporosis Table 15k. Rash and Hypersensitivity Reactions Information on toxicities associated with older ARV drugs that are no longer recommended can be found in the Archived D rugs section and archived toxicity tables . Management ART -associated AE s can range from acute and potentially life threatening to chronic and insidious. Serious life -threatening events (e.g., hypersensitivity reaction [HSR] due to AB C, symptomatic hepatotoxicity, severe cutaneous reactions) require the immediate discontinuation of all ARV drugs and re-initiation of an alternative regimen without overlapping toxicity. Toxicities that are not life threatening (e.g., urolithiasis caused by atazanavir, renal tubulopathy caused by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) usually can be managed by substituting another ARV agent for the presumed causative agent without interrupting ART. Other chronic, non -life-threatening AE s (e.g., dyslipidemia) can be addressed either by switching the potentially causative agent for another agent or by managing the AE with additional pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions , such as lifestyle modification . Management strategies must be individualized for each child, taking into account the severity of the toxicity , the child's viral suppression status , and the available ARV options. Clinicians should anticipate Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-3 the appearance of co mmon, self-limited AEs and reassure patients that many AEs will resolve after the first few weeks of ART. For example, when initiating therapy with boosted protease inhibitors (PIs ), many patients experience gastrointestinal AEs , such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pai n. Instructing patient s to tak e PIs with food may help minimize these AE s. Some patients may require antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents for symptom management. CNS AEs are encountered commonly when initiating therapy with EFV . Symptoms can include dizziness, drowsiness, vivid dreams, or insomnia. Patients should be instructed to take EFV -containing regimens at bedtime and on an empty stomach to help minimize these AEs. Patients should be advised that these AEs usually diminish within 2 to 4 weeks of initiating therapy in most people ; however, they may persist for months in some patients and may require a medication change .22 In addition, mild rash can be ameliorated with drugs , such as antihistamines. Addressing AEs is essential, because c ontinued use of an ARV agent that a patient finds intolerable may lead the patient to stop their treatment, risking viral rebound and the development of drug resistance. In patient s who experience intolerable AEs from ART , every attempt should be made to identify the offending agent and to replace the drug with another effective agent as soon as possible .9,23 For mild-to - moderate toxicities, changing to a drug with a different toxicity profile might be sufficient , and discontinuation of all therapy might not be required. When interrupting a non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, many experts will stop the NNRTI for 7 to 14 days before stopping the dual nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase backbone, because of the long half- life of NNRTI drugs. However, patients who have a severe or life -threatening toxicity (e.g., HSR \u2014see Table 15k. Rash and Hypers ensitivity Reactions ) should stop all components of the drug regimen simultaneously, regardless of drug half-life. Once the offending drug or alternative cause for the AE has been determined, planning can begin for \u2014 Resuming therapy with a new ARV regimen that does not contain the offending drug, or Resuming therapy with the original regimen if the event is attributable to another cause. All drugs in the ARV regimen should then be started simultaneously, rather than one at a time , while observing the patient for AEs. When therapy is changed because of toxicity or intolerance in a patient with virologic suppression, agents with different toxicity and AE profiles should be chosen, when possible . 24-27 Clinicians should have c omprehensive knowledge of the toxicity profile of each agent before selecting a new regimen. In the event of drug intolerance, changing a single drug in a multidrug regimen is permissible only for patient s whose viral loads are undetectable. In general, dose reduction is not a recommended strategy for toxicity management, because inadequate ARV drug levels may lead to decreased virologic efficacy. TDM is not routinely recommended ; however, it may be used in the management of a child with mild or moderate toxicity, if the toxicity is thought to be the result of a drug concentration exceeding the normal therapeutic range .28,29 An expert in the management of pediatric HIV should be consulted when considering dose reduction based on the results of TDM . Dose reduction after TDM has been studied most extensively with EFV , because increased CNS toxicity has clearly been associated with higher levels of EFV (see Efavirenz in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). To summarize, m anagement strategies for drug intolerance include the following: Symptomatic treatment of mild -to-moderate , transient AE s. Switching one drug for another drug that is active against a patient's virus (e.g., chang ing to ABC for zidovudine -related anemia or to a PI or integrase strand transfer inhibitor for EFV -related CNS Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-4 symptoms) (see Modifying Antiretroviral Regimens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy ). Using dose reduction , guided by TDM , after consult ing with an expert in pediatric HIV. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-5 References 1.

Switching to a PI-sparing regimen, a PI-based regimen with a more favorable lipid profile or COBI boosting causes a decline in LDL-C or TG values. However, the lipid-lowering effect for LDL- C is less pronounced than with statin therapy. Refer patients to a lipid specia list early if LDL -C is 250 mg/dL or TG is 500 mg/dL. If LDL -C is 130 mg/dL but <250 mg or TG is 150 mg/dL but <500 mg/dL, the following staged treatment approach is recommended by the NHLBI guidelines :b Implement diet , nutrition, and lifestyle management for 6-9 months.

If TG or LDL -C is elevated or if a patient has additional risk factors, obtain FLP . Children with Lipid Abnormalities and/or Additional Risk Factors Obtain 12- hour FLP before initiating or changing therapy and every 6 months thereafter (more often if indicated). Children Receiving Lipid- Lowering Therapy with Statins or Fibrates Obtain 12- hour FLP, LFT, and CK at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months after starting lipid therapy. If minimal alterations in AST, ALT, and CK are indicated, monitor every 3- 4 months during the first year and If a 6- to 9-month trial of lifestyle modification fails and the patient is aged 10 years, consider implementing lipid-lowering therapy after consult ing a lipid spec ialist.

Elevation in Serum Creatinine DTG, COBI, RPV , BIC Onset Within 1 month of starting treatment Presentation Asymptomatic. These drugs decrease renal tubular secretion of creatinine, leading to an increase in serum creatinine levels without a true change in eGFR. Common laboratory finding. The risk factors in children are unknown. Monitor serum creatinine. Assess for renal dysfunction if serum creatinine increases by >0.4 mg/dL or if increases continue over time. No need to change therapy. Reassure the patient about the benign nature of the laboratory abnormality. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-41 Clinicians need to distinguish between a true change in eGFR and other causes. A true change may be associated with other medical conditions, the continuing rise of serum creatinine levels over time, and albuminuria.

Antiretroviral Therapy- Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations\u2014 Osteopenia and Osteoporosis Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Adverse Effects Associated ARVs Onset/Clinical Manifestations Estimated Frequency Risk Factors Prevention/ Monitoring Management Osteopenia and Osteoporosis Any AR V regimen Specific Agents of Concern TDF, especially when used in a regimen that includes a boosting agent (i.e., RTV, COBI) PIs (LPV, ATV>DRV) EFV Onset Any age; decrease in BMD is usually seen soon after initiating ART. Presentation Usually asymptomatic Rarely presents as osteoporosis , a clinical diagnosis defined by evidence of bone fragility (e.g., a fracture with minimal trauma) . BMD z score Less Than 2.0 <10% in U.S. cohort s Approx imately 10% to 2 0% in international cohorts Longer duration and greater severity of HIV disease Detectable viral load Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency Delayed growth or pubertal delay Low BMI Lipodystrophy Smoking Prolonged systemic corticosteroid use Medroxyprogesterone use Lack of weight -bearing exercise Prevention Ensure that the patient has sufficient intake and levels of both calcium and vitamin D . Encourage weight -bearing exercise. Minimize modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, low BMI, use of steroids or medroxyprogesterone). Use TAF instead of TDF whenever possible. Use TDF with RPV or an unboosted INSTI . When using TDF or EFV in a regimen, consider measuring vitamin D levels and supplementing with vitamin D3 if deficiency is identified. Monitoring Assess nutritional intake (calcium, vitamin D, and total calories). Consider measuring serum 25- OH- vitamin D levels, particularly in patients who are taking ARV drugs of concern .a DXA is rarely indicated.b Same options as for prevention. Consider changing the ARV regimen (e.g. , switching from TDF to TAF, and/or from LPV/r to RPV or an unboosted INSTI whenever possible) with vitamin D3 serum 25- OH-vitamin D concentrations to >30 ng/m L. There is no clear benef it to administering daily supplemental vitamin D3 doses that are >4,000 IU. If patients are receiving a daily dose of vitamin D3 that is >4,000 IU , consider monitoring levels of 25-OH-vitamin D . An increase in BMD was seen in one trial that evaluated the use of alendronate in youth with HIV and low BMD . However, t he role of bisphosphonates in managing osteopenia and osteoporosis in children with HIV has not been established. a Drugs of greatest concern are TDF and EFV. S ome experts measure 25- OH-vitamin D in children with HIV with additional risk factors , including living at high latitudes, sun avoidance, low dietary intake, and obesity (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 2021 guidelines) . b DXA scanning is not routinely recommended for children and youth who are being treated with TDF . DXA scanning can be considered for children and youth who are receiving additional medications which also affect bone density or have non- HIV related conditions for which DXA scans may be indicated (such as cerebral palsy).

Providers may consider antiretroviral (ARV) regimen changes for the following reasons: Treatment s implification : Modifying ARV regimens in children who are currently receiving effective ART in order to simplify the regimen . Treatment optimization : Increasing the treatment potency or barrier to resistance of an effective , but older or potentially fragile regimen or improving the adverse -event profile . Toxicity m anagement : Recognizing and managing ARV drug toxicity or intolerance (s ee Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ). Treatment f ailure : Recognizing and managing treatment failure (see Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Modifying Antiretroviral Regi mens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy Panel's Recommendations Children who have sustained virologic suppression on their current antiretroviral (ARV) regimen should be evaluated regularly for opportunities to change to a new regimen that facilitate s adherence, simplif ies administration, increases ARV potency or barrier to drug resistance , and decreases the risk of drug- associated toxicit y (AII). Before changing a patient's ARV regimen, c linicians must carefully consider the patient's previous regimens, past episodes of ARV therapy failure, prior drug- resistance test results, drug cost, and insurance coverage, as well as the patient's ability to tolerate the new drug regimen (AII I). Archived drug resistance can limit the antiviral activity of a new drug regimen. Children should be monitored carefully after a change in treatment. Viral load measurement is recommended 2 to 4 weeks after a change in a child's ARV regimen (BIII) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence : I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observ ational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studi es in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents , but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Clinicians choose initial ARV regimens for children with HIV by evaluating the pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data for the drugs that are available in formulations suitable for the child's age and we ight at the start of treatment. New ARV drug options may become available as children grow Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-2 and learn to swallow pills and as new drugs, drug formulations , and data become available. Even in cases wherein patients have achieved sustained virologic suppression (i .e., suppression for 6-12 months) on their current regimen, clinicians should consider switching patients to new ARV regimens to permit the use of pills instead of liquids, reduce pill burden, allow the use of once -daily medications, reduce the risk of adverse events , minimize drug interactions , and align a child's regimen with widely used, efficacious adult regimens.1 These changes often enhance adherence and improve quality of life.2 Treatment Simplification Many infants and children with HIV initiate d treatment with t wice -daily dosing (especially prior to the approval of integrase strand transfer inhibitor [INSTI ] medications in children), and regimens include d a variety of drug formulations, depending on which formulations were available for a child's age and weight. Clinicians should regularly review treatment options as children grow , because it may be possible to simplify dosing using coformulated drugs and/or once -daily regimens (see Table 16 below ). Clinicians also should consider a child's ART history and drug-resistance test results . Small studies have shown that children who achieve virologic suppression using twice -daily dosing for certain abacavir [ABC], nevirapine [NVP] ) maintain virologic suppression when they a re switch ed from twice -daily dosing to appropriate once -daily dosing of the same drugs (see the Abacavir and N evirapine sections and fixed -dose combinations [FDCs] in Appendix A, Table 1 . Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets and Appendix A, Table 2 . Antiretroviral Fixed -Dose Combination Tablets : Minimum Body Weights and Consideration for Use in Children and Adolescents ). However, these studies reported mixed results when switching the dosing for lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) from twice daily daily . Therefore, once -daily dosing of LPV/r is not recommended .3-6 Once-daily dosing of NVP is available for some age groups, but most pediatric HIV experts would opt for more potent ARV options with a higher barrier to drug resistance and a better side -effect profile (see Table 16 below). Treatment Optimization The aim s of treatment optimization may include improving the potency of the regimen, improv ing a child's growth or other health outcomes through reduced drug side effects and/or better treated HIV , or maximiz ing palatability. More s tudies are directly evaluating treatment optimization in children , and early results support the safety and efficacy of regimen switches for those with viral suppression. Older studies have demonstrated sustained viral suppression and improved growth outcomes i n young children who have demonstrated good adherence and no baseline resistance and who were switched from LPV/r-based regimens to either a n NVP -based regimen (NEVEREST 2 Trial ) or an efavirenz (EFV )-based regimen (NEVEREST 3 Trial ); however, many providers would not consider a switch to an NVP -based optimization regimen because of its low barrier to resistance and side - effect profile.7-10 Likewise, replacing LPV/r with EFV may provide some benefits (e.g., once -daily dosing and a different side -effect profile ), but most pediatric HIV experts would prefer r eplac ing LPV/r with an equally potent studies in adults and emerging evidence of noninferiority or superiority in children.11,12 Although not a switch trial, p reliminary findings from the randomized controlled Once -daily DTG based ART in Young People vs. Standard Therapy (ODYSSEY) study of more than 700 children aged <18 years in eight countries showed superior virologic and clinical outcomes in children randomized to optimization with DTG-based ART compared with those in the standard of care (PI - or non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI ]-based regimens) , contributing to evidence Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-3 supporting optimization with DTG -based regimens .13 Additionally, several observational studies in sub-Saharan Africa that are evaluating efforts to optimize pediatric ARV regimens have shown improved viral suppression rates in children switched to DTG -based regimens14-16. Similarly, a retrospective s tudy from six African countries reporting on 2,655 children age d 0 to 19 years demonstrated sustained high levels of viral suppression in children optimized from NNRTI- and PI- based regimens to DTG cobicistat/FTC/TAF ) also have shown efficacy and similar rates of long- term viral suppression in adolescents . Early results from small randomized studies also show potential for switches to newer -generation NNRTI medications \u2014such as rilpivirine (RPV )18 and doravirine (DOR )19\u2014in children and adolescents weighing 35 kg who have been virologically suppressed on a stable ARV regimen. Toxicity Management Several studies of small cohorts of children have demonstrated sustained virologic suppression and reassuring safety outcomes when drugs that have greater long -term toxicity risk s are replaced with drugs that are thought to have l ower toxicity risk s (e.g., replacing stavudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, TAF , zidovudine , or ABC ; replacing PI s with NNRTI s), including improved lipid profiles.20-24 Similarly, adolescents who were switched from EFV to RPV, a newer generation of NNRTI s, showed similar rates of viral suppression with improved metabolic profiles and cognitive outcomes .18 Additionally, studies in adults have shown improved tolerability, lipid profiles , and insulin sensitivity in patients who were switched from PIs to INSTIs ,25-29 and adults who were switched from EFV to an INSTI have shown improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms . However, the use of INSTIs , as well as TAF , has been associated with weight gain in adults and adolescents , with emerging data showing an association in children.30-34 Treatment Failure Treatment failure is another common reas on providers change ARV regimens in children with HIV. This topic is covered in Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treat ment Failure . Regimens That Are Not Recommended for Use have been used to simplify or reduce the toxicity of regimens in adult patients who have sustained virologic suppression, but with varying success . The se strategies are still being explored, but they are not currently recommended as management strateg ies in children because of the lack of data.36,39-42 Two-drug regimens, specifically nucleoside -sparing regimens, have shown efficacy in adults a nd are being studied in children and adolescents. The PENTA -17 SMILE study, which includ ed 318 children aged 6 to 18 years in 11 countries , showed that DRV/r combined with an INSTI was noninferior in maintaining virologic suppression at 48 weeks in participants without an INSTI or PI resistance.43 However, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV ( the Panel ) does not currently recommend this investigational drug combination in children or adolescents. A similar two-drug FDC tablet containing Juluca \u2014is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a complete regimen to replace the current ARV regimen in adult patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies /mL) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months and who have no history of treatment failure . This approval was based on two P hase 3 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-4 clinical trials, SWORD -1 and SWORD -2, in which treatment -experienced adults who were virologically suppressed on three - or four-drug regimens were randomized either to switch to DTG/ RPV (early -switch group) or to stay on their original regimen s through 48 weeks and then switch to DTG/RPV (late -switch group). R esults from these trials show ed similar rates of virologic suppression in both group s (noninferiority) through 3 years of follow -up.44-46 No equivalent data exist for this drug combination in pediatric patients. The Panel usually endorses the use of adult formulations in adolescents, and this product may be appropriate for certain adolescents. However, because th is treatment simplification strategy has not been evaluated in adolescents who may have difficulties adhering to therapy, the Panel does not recommend the routine use of DTG/RPV or other nucleoside -sparing regimens in adolescents and children until more data are available. Potential A ntiretroviral Drug Switches in Children with Virologic Suppression Table 16 below contains examples of potential ARV drug changes in children with sustained virologic suppression on their current regimen for the purpose of treatment simplification, optimization, or reduced toxicity. When considering such a change, a clinician should first ensure that a recent viral load test indicates that the child is not experiencing virologic failure and that the child has a reliable history of good adherence (assessed by self and parental report, pharmacy refill, prior viral loads , etc.) . Among treatment -naive youth in the United States age d 13 to 24 years, some evidence exists that single -tablet regimens (STRs) improve the odds of viral suppression47; emerging evidence also supports the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of STRs in younger children.48-50 Although these data have not been replicated in treatment -experienced adolescents, clinicians should consider using STRs in children and youth with sustaine d viral suppression, because these regimens reduce pill burden and dosing frequency. Clinicians also must consider AR T history, tolerability, and all prior drug-resistance test results to avoid choosing new ARV drugs for which archived drug resistance would reemerge and limit the activity of the regimen .51-55 The evidence that support s many of these ARV changes is indirect , that is, extrapolated from data about drug performance during initial therapy or follow -up therapy after treatment failure. When such changes are made, careful monitoring (e .g., taking a viral load measurement 2- 4 weeks after making the switch to the new regimen) is important to ensure that virologic suppression is maintained. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-5 Table 16. Examples of Changes in Antiretroviral Regimen Components for Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression This list is not exhaustive and does not necessarily contain all potential treatment options. Instead, it provides examples of changes that could be made. The table includes information only about switching between ARV drugs; it does not include all the information that clinicians should consider before prescribing these drugs, such as drug cost and the pa tient's insurance coverage .

Review NNRTI mutations and check for drug- drug interactions before use. a The possibility of planned and unplanned pregnancy should be considered when selecting an ART regimen for an adolescent. When discussing ART options with adolescents of childbearing potential and their caregivers, it is important to consider the benefits and risks of all ARV drugs and to provide the information and counseling needed to support informed decision- making; refer to the Perinatal Guidelines (see Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy , Table 5. Situation- Specific Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant People and Nonpregnant People Who Are Trying to Conceive , and Appendix C: Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers ). b For infants and young children who are being treated with liquid formulations of ABC, initiation with once- daily ABC is not generally recommended. In clinically stable patients with undetectable viral loads who have had stable CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts on twice- daily ABC, the dose can be changed from twice daily to once daily. ABC is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in neonates and infants aged <3 months. Recent data from the IMPAACT P1106 trial and two Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-9 observational cohorts provide reassuring evidence of the safety of ABC in infants aged <3 months. Based on these data, clinicians may consider the use of ABC in infants aged 1 month to <3 months , in consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist (see Abacavir ). c For children and adolescents weighing 14 kg to <35 kg, TAF can be used in combination with an INSTI or an NNRTI, but not a boosted PI. For children and adolescents weighing 35 kg, TAF can be used in combination with an INSTI, an NNRTI, or a boosted PI. d RAL is recommended for twice -daily use in children. Chewable tablets can be used as dispersible tablets starting at 4 weeks of age. RAL HD once daily is only recommended for virologically suppressed children weighing 40 kg.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-9 Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel's Recommendations The causes of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment failure \u2014which include poor adherence, drug resistance, poor absorption of medications, inadequate dosing, and drug- drug interactions \u2014should be assessed and addressed (AII). Perform ARV drug- resistance testing when virologic failure occurs, while the patient is still taking the failing regimen (AI *) (see Drug -Resistance Testing in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for more information) . ARV regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug- resista nce testing, including both past and current resistance test results ( AI*). The new regimen should include at least two , but preferably three, fully active ARV medications ; the assessment of anticipated ARV activity should be based on treatment history and past resistance test results ( AII*). The goal of therapy following treatment failure is to achieve and maintain virologic suppression, which is defined as a plasma viral load that is below the limits of detection as measured by highly sensitive assays wit h lower limits of quantification of 20 copies/mL to 75 copies/mL (AI*). When complete virologic suppression cannot be achieved, the goals of therapy are to preserve or restore immunologic function (as measured by CD4 T lymphocyte values), prevent clinical disease progression, and prevent the development of additional drug resistance that could further limit future ARV drug options (AII). Children who require evaluation and management of treatment failure should be managed by or in collaboration wit h a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with cli nical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Categories of Treatment Failure Treatment failure can be categorized as virologic failure, immunologic failure, clinical failure , or some combination of the three . Immunologic failure refers to a suboptimal immunologic response to therapy or an immunologic decline while on therapy, but no standardized definition exists . Clinical failure is defin ed as the occurrence of new opportunistic infections (OIs) (excluding immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [IRIS]) and/or other clinical evidence of HIV disease progression during therapy. Almost all antiretroviral (ARV) management decisions for treatment failure are based on addressing virologic failure. Virologic Failure Virologic failure refers to either an incomple te initial response to therapy or a viral rebound after virologic suppression is achieved. Virologic suppression is defined as having a plasma viral load Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-10 below the lower level of detection , as measured by highly sensitive assay s with lower limits of quanti tation of 20 copies/mL to 75 copies/mL . Virologic failure is defined as repeated instances of a plasma viral load 200 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy. Laboratory results must be confirmed with repeat testing before a final assessment of virologic fail ure is made. Infants with high plasma viral loads at initiation of ART occasionally take longer than 6 months to achieve virologic suppression. Because of this, some experts continue the treatment regimen for infants if their viral load is declining but is still 200 copies/mL at 6 months . These infants should be monitor ed closely until they achieve virologic suppression.1 However, ongoing regimens \u2014increases the risk of drug resistance.2,3 The clinical implications of HIV RNA levels that are between the lower level of detection and <200 copies/mL in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain unclear . Adults with HIV who have detectable viral loads and a quantified result <200 copies/mL after 6 months of ART generally achieve virologic suppression without changing regimens . 4,5 However, some studies in adults have found that multiple viral load measurements of 50 copies/mL to <200 copies/mL (sometimes characterized as low -level viremia) may be associated with an increased risk of later virologic failure.6-9 In contrast, a recent study that followed a cohort of 57 adult patients with low -level viremia (21-200 c opies/m L) reported that none of the patients ha d resistance to their regimens , and all had adequate plasma ARV concentrations. At 96 weeks of follow -up, 67% remained with low-level viremia , 26% had viral loads <20 copies/m L, and only 7% had viral failure ; none was attributed to viral resistance.10 \"Blips \"\u2014defined as isolated episodes of a detectable but low level of plasma viral load (i.e., <500 copies/mL) that are followed by a return to viral suppression\u2014are common and not generally reflective of short -term virologic failure , although they may indicate an increased risk of virologic failure after 12 to 24 months .11-13 However, repeated or persistent plasma viral loads that are 200 copies/mL (especially viral loads that are >500 copies/mL) in patients who have previously achieved virologic suppression usually indicate virologic failure.5,13-15 In a cohort of children from Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam who were on first-line combination therapy,16 among those who achieved viral suppression (<50 c opies/ mL on two successive measurements), 17% had at least one viral load with low -level viremia over a median follow -up of 6 years . More than a third of those had repeated episodes of low -level viremia . The rate of viral failure was 8. 9 per 100 patient -years in those with low -level viremia versus 3.3 per 100 patient -years in those without low-level viremia . Of note, 97% of the cohort were started on a n NNRTI -based regimen, which has a lower barrier to resistance than other regimens and, therefore , may not be generalizable to patients on other regimens . Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression Poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression is uncommon in children.17 Patients with baseline severe immunosuppression (i.e., a CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count < 500 cells/mm3) often take longer than 1 year to achieve immune recovery, even if virologic suppression occurs more promptly. During this early treatment period of persistent immunosuppression, additional clinical disease progression can occur. In an international study, 12% of pediatric and adolescent patients had a poor immunologic response 1 year after viral suppression (defined as <400 copies/m L), although poor immunologic response dropped to 7% at 2 years and 3% at 3 years in those with continued viral Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-11 suppression. Among those with a poor immunologic response at 1 year post viral suppression, a fourfold increased r isk of an AIDS diagnosis or death was o bserved, compared with immune responders (rate ratio 4.04 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.83-8.92; P < 0.001).18 In cases of poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression, clinicians should first exclude laboratory error in CD4 values or viral load measurements and ensure that CD4 values have been interpreted correctly in relation to the natural decline in CD4 count that occurs during the first 5 to 6 years of life. Another laboratory consideration is that some viral load assays may not amplify all HIV groups and subtypes (e.g., HIV-1 non-M groups , HIV-2), resulting in falsely low or negative viral load results (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children and Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). Once laboratory results are confirmed, clinicians should evaluate patients for adverse events , medical conditions, and other factors that can cause CD4 values to decrease (see Table 17 below ). Several drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents) and conditions (e.g., hepatitis C virus [T B], malnutrition, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis, viral infections) are independently associated with low CD4 values.19 Patients who have very low baseline CD4 values before initiating ART are at higher risk of an impaired CD4 response to ART and, based on data from adult studies, may be at higher risk of death and AIDS -defining illnesses despite virologi c suppression.20-22 In a study of 933 children aged 5 years who received ART that resulted in virologic suppression, 348 children (37%) had CD4 counts <500 cells/mm3 at ART initiation, including 92 (9.9%) w ho had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3. After 1 year of virologic suppression, only seven children (1% of the cohort) failed to reach a CD4 count 200 cells/mm3, and 86% of children had CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3. AIDS -defining events were uncommon overall ( occurring in 1% of participants ), but they occurred both in children who achieved improved CD4 counts and those who did not .17 Studies in adults with HIV note that CD4 count recovery at 1 year and 2 years post -initiation of initial therapy is independent of the drug class used, that is , boosted prot ease inhibitor (PI), integrase or NNRTI.23 In summary, poor immunologic response to treatment can occur. Management consists of confirming that CD4 values and viral load measurements are accurate, avoiding the use of drugs that are associated with low CD4 values , and treating other conditions that could impair CD4 recovery. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) does not recommend modifying an AR V regimen based on lack of immunologic response if virologic suppression is confirmed. Poor Clinical Response Despite Adequate Virologic and Immunologic Responses Clinicians must carefully evaluate patients who experience clinical disease progression despite favorable immunologic and virologic responses to ART ; not all cases represent ART failure. At times, after initiation of ART, patients will suffer a clinical deterioration due to paradoxical worsening of a known OI or unmasking of a previously undiagnosed OI due to a profound immune response (i.e., IRIS ) related to successful viral suppression. This does not represent ART treatment failure and does not generally require discontinuation of or a change in ART. IRIS does not mean that ART has fail ed, and it does not generally require discontinuation of ART. 24,25 Children who have suffered irreversible damage to their lungs, brain, or other organs \u2014especially during prolonged and profound pre -treatment immunosuppression\u2014 may continue to have recurrent infections or symptoms in the damaged organs , because the immunologic improvement may not reverse damage to the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-12 organs.26 Such c ases do not represent ART failure , and these children would not benefit from a change in ARV regimen. Before a definitive conclusion of ART clinical failure is reached, a child should be evaluated to rule out (and, when indicated, treat) other causes or conditions that can occur with or without HIV -related immunosuppression, such as pulmonary TB , malnutrition, and malignancy. Occasionally, however, children will develop new HIV -related OI s (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or esophageal candidiasis that occurs more than 6 months after achieving markedly improved CD4 values and virologic suppression) that are not related to IRIS, pre -existing organ damage, or another cause .17 Although such cases are rare, they may represent ART clinical failure , and improvement in CD4 values may not necessarily normaliz e immunologic function. In children who have signs of new or progressive abnormal neurodevelopment, some experts change the ARV regimen, aiming to include agents that are known to achieve higher con centrations in the central nervous system . However, the data regarding the effectiveness of this strategy are inconclusive . 27,28 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-13 Table 17. Discordance Among Virologic, Immunologic, and Clinical Responses Differential Diagnosis of Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression and Good Clinical Response Laboratory error (in CD4 value or viral load measurement ) Misinterpretation of normal , age-related CD4 count decline (i.e., the immunologic response is not actually poor) Low pre- treatment CD4 count or percentage AEs that are associated with the use of certain drugs (e.g., ZDV, TMP -SMX, systemic corticosteroids) Use of systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutic agents Conditions that can cause low CD4 values (e.g., HCV , acute viral Sjogren's syphilis) Poor Immunologic and Clinical Responses Despite Virologic Suppression Laboratory error (in CD4 value or viral load measurement) Falsely low viral lo ad result for an HIV strain/type that is not detected by viral load assay ( i.e., HIV-1 , this with newer viral load assays ]) Persistent immunodeficiency that occurs soon after initiati ng ART, but before ART -related reconstitution Primary protein- calorie malnutrition Untreated TB Malignancy Differential Diagnosis of Poor Clinical Response Despite Adequate Virologic and Immunologic Responses IRIS A previously unrecognized, pre-existing infection or condition (e.g., TB , malignancy) Malnutrition Clinical manifestations of previous organ damage: brain ( e.g., strokes, vasculopathy cardiomyopathy), renal ( i.e., HIV-related kidney disease) A new clinical event due to a non-HIV illness or condition A new, or otherwise unexplained, HIV-related clinical event ( e.g., treatment failure) Key: AEs = adverse effects; ART = antiretroviral therapy; CD4 = CD4 T lymphocyte; HCV = Management of Virologic Failure The approach to managing and subsequent ly treating virologic failure will differ, depending on the etiology of the problem. When assessing a child with suspected virologic failure , clinicians should evaluat e therapy adherence and medication intolerance, confirm that the prescribed dosing is correct (and understood by the child and/or caregiver) for all medications in the regimen, consider possible pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions that might lead to low drug levels, and test for possible drug resistance ( see Drug-Resistance Testing in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Although many factors can contribute to virologic failure, t he main barrier to sustained virologic Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-14 suppression in adults and children is incomplete adherence to medication regimens, with subsequent emergence of viral mutations that confer partial or complete resistance to one or more components of the AR V regimen. S ee Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV for guidance on assessing adherence and strategies for improv ing adherence. Virologic Failure with No Antiretrov iral Drug Resistance Identified Persistent viremia in the absence of detectable viral resistance to current medications is usually a result of nonadherence, but it is important to consider other factors , such as poor drug absorption, incorrect dosing, and drug interactions. If adequate drug exposure can be ensured, then adherence to the current regimen should result in virologic suppression. Resistance testing should take place while a child is on therapy. After discontinuing therapy, plasma viral strains may quickly revert to wild type and reemerge as the predominant viral population, in which case , resistance testing can fail to identify the drug-resistant virus (see Drug-Resistance Testing in the Adult and Adol escent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). In this situation, resistance can be identified by restarting the prior medications while emphasizing adherence and repeat ing resistance testing in 4 weeks if plasma virus remains detectable . If the HIV plasma viral load becomes undetectable, then nonadherence was likely the original cause of virologic failure. Virologic failure in children receiving boosted PI-based regimens is frequently associated with no detect ed major PI-resistance mutations .29 Virologic suppression may be achieved by continu ing the PI-based regimen , implementing adherence- improvement measures , and addressing any PI -related side effects .30-32 However, continued virologic failure on PI-based regimens \u2014especially if PI drug levels are subtherapeutic or in the presence of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI s)- resistance mutations \u2014can lead to major PI mutations.33 In some cases, if a new , more convenient regimen could address the main barrier to adherence , it may be reasonable for a clinician to switch a patient to this new regimen (e.g., a single fixed-dose combination [FDC] tablet taken once daily) w hile closely monitoring adherence and viral load. Similarly, if an ART side effect or tolerability is found to be impacting adher ence, switching to a new regimen with close monitoring should be considered. H owever, in cases where clinicians determine that patients have poor adherence to the current regimen and that adherence is unlikely to improve with a new regimen, clinicians should focus on improving adherence before initiating a new regimen (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV ). Virologic Treatment Failure with Antiretrov iral Drug Resistance Identified After deciding that a change in therapy is ne cessary , a clinician should attempt to identify at least two, but preferably three , fully active ARV agent s from at least two different drug classes to use in a patient's new regimen. The clinician should consider all of the patient's past and recent drug- resistance test results , the patient's prior exposure to ARV drugs , whether the patient is likely to adhere to the regimen, and whether the patient finds a particular regimen acceptable .34-38 This process often requires using agents from one or more drug classes that are new to the patient. However, clinicians should be aware that drug-resistance mutations can confer cross -resistance within a drug class, so a drug that is new to the patient may still have diminished antiviral potency. Substituting or adding a single drug to a failing regimen is not recommended, because this is unlikely to lead to durable virologic suppression and will likely result in additional drug resistance. When reviewing results of drug- resistance assays, clinicians should consult the Stanford University HIV Drug Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-15 Resistance Database to determine if a change in the ARV regimen is required and, if a change is required, which ARV agents can be retain ed. The process of switching a patient to a new regimen must include an extensive discussion of treatment adherence and potential toxicity with the patient and the patient's ca regivers. This discussion should be appropriate for the patient's age and stage of development . Clinicians should be aware that some medications have conflicting food requirements and concomitant medication restrictions that may complicate the administration of a regimen. Timing of medication administration is particularly important, because it helps ensure adequate ARV drug exposures throughout the day. Palatability, pill size, number of pills, and dosing frequency all need to be considered when choosing a new regimen.39 Therapeutic Options to Achieve Complete Virologic Suppression After Virol ogic Failure A pediatric HIV specialist should be consulted when determining which new regimen will have the best chance of achieving complete virologic suppression in children who have already experienced treatment failure. ARV regimens should be chosen based on a patient's treatment history and drug -resistance test results to optimize ARV drug potency in the new regimen (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and A dolescents with HIV ). A general strategy for regimen change s is shown in Table 18 below ; however, as additional agents are licensed and studied for use in children, newer regimens that are better tailored to the needs of each patient may be constructed. Data from adult and pediatric studies support the efficacy of a regimen that contains a boosted PI plus two NRTIs for those who experience treatment failure on an initial NNRTI -based regimen .40 Studies of adults have found that a regimen that contains both a boosted PI and raltegravir (RAL) produces similar outcomes to a regimen that contains a boosted PI and two NRTIs .40,41 A clinical trial in adults who had experienced treatment failure on an initial NNRTI -based regimen reported that dolutegravir (DTG) had better efficacy and a better safety profile than lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ), when t hese drugs were used in second-line regimen s that included at least one active NRTI.42 Pediatric and adolescent data support the use of two NRTIs plus an INSTI , following the failure of an NNRTI -based regimen .43-45 However, caution should be exercised when considering the use of regimens that include first- generation IN STIs with a lower barrier to resistance (e.g., RAL) , because children who experience treatment fail ure on NNRTI -based regimens often have substantial NRTI resistance .46 Resistance to the NNRTI nevirapine (N VP) results in cross -resistance to the NNRTI efavirenz (EFV) , rilpivirine (RPV) NVP -resistant virus or EFV -resistant virus in the absence of certain key NNRTI mutations), but ETR has generally been tested only in regimens that also contain a boosted PI.34,47 For this reason, the Panel recommends using ETR as part of a regimen that includes a ritonavir-boosted PI (see the Etravirine section ). Doravirine is a once -daily NNRTI that retains activity against EFV/NVP -resistant virus and was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and adolesce nts weighing 35 kg. Studies are ongoing in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years48 (see the Doravirine section).If a child experiences virologic failure on an initial PI -Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-16 based regimen , there are often limited resistance mutations detected , indicating that poor adherence/t olerance of the regimen may be the cause of poor viral control.46,49 In these cases, an alternative PI that might be potent and better tolerated can be used. For example, LPV/r -based regimens have been shown to have durable ARV activity in some PI-experienced children.50-52 Darunavir (DRV) /r-based therapy also has been used.53,54 Switching to an INSTI-based regimen also can be effectiv e in some PI-experienced children .43,45,55-57 When making the switch from a failing PI- based regimen to an INSTI-based regimen, preference might be given to the s econd-generation INSTIs DTG or bictegravir (BIC), because these drugs have a higher barrier to resistance than the first-generation INSTIs RAL and elvitegravir. The availability of new er drugs with in existing drug classes and the introduction of new classe s of drugs increase the likelihood of finding three active drugs, even for children with extensive drug resistance (see Table 18 below ). As previously discussed, INSTI -based regimens are increasingly used for children who have experienced treatment fail ure on NNRTI -based regimens or PI-based regimens.43,45 RAL is the INSTI that has been studied and used most often in children, but both DTG and BIC have the advantage of once -daily dosing, small pill size , and higher barrier to development of drug resistance ; they also often retain ARV activity in patients who have experienced treatment failure on RAL -based therapy (see the Dolutegravir and Bictegravir sections for the latest age and weight indications).58 Early data about the use of DTG around the time of conception showed a small significant increase in the prevalence of infant neural tube defects (NTDs) that has declined over time. In the most recent analysis, the prevalence of NTDs did not differ significantly between women receiving DTG a nd non -DTG ARV regimens at the time of conception59. For additional information when prescribing DTG or other ARVs for adolescents of childbearing potential , see the Dolutegravir section and refer to the Perinatal Guidelines (see Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Appendix C. Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers ). Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist , provides a new drug class ; however, many ART -experience d children and a number of ART -naive children already harbor CX use.60,61 Regimens that includ e an INSTI and a potent boosted PI with or without ETR have been effective during small studies of extensively AR T-experienced patients with multiclass drug resistance.62-65 It is important to review individual drug profiles for information about drug interactions and dose adjustment s when devising a regimen for children with multiclass drug resistance. Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information provides detailed information on drug formulations , pediatric and adult dos es, and toxicity, as well as discussion s of the available data on the use of ARV drugs in children. Previously prescribed drugs that were discontinued because of poor tolerance or poor adherence may sometimes be reintroduced if drug resistance did not develop and if prior difficulties with tolerance and adherence can be overcome (e.g., by switching to a new formulation, such as an FDC tablet). Some studies in adults have suggested that lamivudine (3TC) can still contribute to suppression of HIV replication in patients with 3TC resistance mutations. Continuation of 3TC also can maintain a 3TC mutation (184V) that can partially reverse the effects of other mutations that confer resistance to zidovudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate . 66-68 NRTI-sparing and NRTI-containing regimens in adults with multidrug resistance who experienced virologic failure on a previous regimen. These studies have demonstrated no clear benefit of including NRTIs in the new regimen. 69,70 One of these studies reported no difference in rate of virologic suppression but a trend toward a higher mortality in adults Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-17 who were random ized to receive a regimen that included NRTIs than in adults who were randomized to receive an NRTI -sparing regimen.70 There are no studies of NRTI -sparing regimens in children with virologic failure and multidrug resistance, but an NRTI-sparing regimen may be a reasonable option for children with exte nsive NRTI resistance. Enfuvirtide (T-20) is approved by the FDA for use in ART -experienced children aged 6 years , but it must be administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily.71,72 Regimens that contain more than three drugs (up to three PIs and/or two NNRTIs) hav e shown efficacy in a pediatric case series , but they are complex, often poorly tolerated, a nd subject to unfavorable drug-drug interactions.73 The availability of agents with an increased barrier to resistance \u2014such as the PI DRV , the INSTIs DTG and lessened the need for T- 20, dual -PI regimens, and regimens of four or more drugs. Two agents that inhibit the attachment of the glycoprotein (gp) 120 region of the virus to the CD4 molecule are approved for adolescents >18 years with multidrug resistance . Oral fostemsavir is a gp120 attachment inhibitor, and ibalizumab ( given by infusion twice monthly) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the gp120 attachment area on the CD4 molecule .74,75 Because these represent drugs with new novel targets, they would be expected to be beneficial in patients with multiclass drug resistance . When searching for at least two fully active agents in cases of extensive drug resistance, clinicians should consider the potential availability of new therapeutic agents that are not currently being studied in children or that may be approved for use in children in the future. Information about clinical trials can be found using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases database and by consulting a pediatric HIV speciali st. Children should be enrolled in clinical trials of new drugs whenever possible. The use of new drugs that have been evaluated in adults but have not been fully evaluated in children may be justified; ideally, this would be done in the framework of a cli nical trial. Expanded access programs or clinical trials may be available (see ClinicalTrials.gov ). New drugs should be used in combination with at least one, but ideally two, additional active agents. Pediatri c dosing for off- label use of ARV drugs is problematic , because absorption, hepatic metabolism, and excretion change with age.76 In clinical trials of several ARV agents, direct extrapolation of a pediatric dose from an adult dose, based on a child's body weight or body surface area, was shown to result in an underestimation of the appropriate pediatric dose. 77 Off-label u se of ARV agents , however, may be necessary for children with HIV who have limited ARV drug options. In this circumstance, consult ing a pediatric HIV specialist for advice about potential regimens, assistance with access to unpublished data from clinical trials or other limited off- label pediatric use, and referral to suitable clinical trials are recommended. Management Options When Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered It may be impossible to provide an effective and sustainable therapeutic regimen when there is no combination of currently available agents that are active against an extensively drug-resistant virus in a patient or when a patient is unable to adhere to or tolerate ART. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-18 The decision to continue a nonsuppressive regimen must be made on an individual basis after weighing potential benefits and risk s. Specifically, providers must balance the inherent tension between the benefits of virologic suppression and th e risks of continued viral replication with potential evolution of viral drug resistance in the setting of inadequate ARV drug exposure ( e.g., nonadherence or a nonsuppressive , suboptimal regimen). could decrease viral fitness and , thus , slow clinical and immunologic deterioration while a patient is either working on adherence or awaiting access to new agents that are expected to achieve sustained virologic suppression.78 However, persistent viremia in the context of ARV drug pressure has the potential to generate additional resistance mutations that could further compromise agents in the same class that might otherwise have been ac tive in subsequent regimens (e.g., continuing first -generation INSTIs or NNRTIs). Patients who continue to use nonsuppressive regimens should be followed more closely than those with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a ful ly suppressive ARV regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. The use of NRTI-only holding regimens or a complete interruption of therapy is not recommended . One trial , International Maternal Pediatric Adolescents AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT P1094 ) randomized children with the M184V resistance documented nonadherence to continue their nonsuppressive, non- NNRTI -based regimen or to switch to a 3TC (or emtricitabine) monotherapy-holding regimen. Children who switched to monotherapy were significantly more likely to experience a 30% decline in absolute CD4 count (the primary outcome) over a 28-week period. 79 Complete treatment interruption also has been associated with immunologic declines and poor clinical outcomes ,80,81 theref ore, it is not recommended (see Antiretroviral Treatment Interruption in Children with HIV ). Table 18. Options for Regimens with at Least Two Fully Active Agents to Achieve Virologic Suppression in Patients with Virologic Failure and Evidence of Viral Resistance To optimize antiretroviral (ARV) drug effectiveness, c linicians should evaluate a patient's treatment history and drug-resistance test results when choosing a new AR V regimen. Doing so is particularly important when selecting the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor transcriptase (NNRTI )-based regimen, where drug resistance to the NNRTI can occur rapidly if the virus is not sufficiently sensitive to the NRTIs. Regimens should contain at least two, but preferably three, fully active drugs for durable and potent virologic suppression. If the M184V/I mutation associated with emtricitabine and lamivudine is present, these medications should be continued if the new regimen contains of this mutation may increase susceptibility to these NRTIs. Please see individual drug profile s for information about weight and age limitations (e.g., do not use darunavir in children aged <3 years), drug interactions, and dose adjustments when devising a regimen for children with multiclass drug resistance (see Appendix A : Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist is especially important when choosing regimens for children with multiclass drug resistance. Re gimens in this table are provided as examples, but the list is not exhaustive.

Two NRTIs plus an NNRTIc Failed regimen(s) that included NRTI(s), NNRTI(s), and PI(s) If Are Fully Active INSTI plus two NRTIs If NRTIs Are Not Fully Active INSTI plus two NRTIs with or without an RTV-boosted PI If There I s Minimal NRTI Activity INSTI with or without an RTV-boosted PI with or without ETR, or RPV with or without NRTI(s) Consider adding T-20 and/or MVC if additional active drug( s) are needed. Consider off-label use of approved agents or enrollment in clinical trials for novel antiretroviral treatments . a The possibility of planned and unplanned pregnancy should be considered when selecting an ART regimen for an adolescent. When discussing ART options with adolescents of childbearing potential and their caregivers, it is important to consider the benefits and risks of all ARV drugs and to provide the information and counseling needed to support informed decision- making; refer to the Perinatal Guidelines (see Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy , Table 5 Situation- Specific Recommendations for Use of Ant iretroviral Drugs in Pregnant People and Nonpregnant People Who Are Trying to Conceive , and Appendix C : Antiretrov iral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers ). b Raltegravir has a low barrier to resistance and requires twice- daily dosing in children and adolescents ; BIC and DTG have a higher barrier to resistance and only require once- daily dosing. Many Panel members would use bictegravir /emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy) in patients with prior treatment failure who have virus with the M184 mutation (see the Bictegravir section ). c NNRTI s could be an option in younger patients with no exposure to NNRTIs and with taste aversion to boosted PIs.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-22 Antiretroviral Treatment Interruption in Children with HIV Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 Reviewed : Apr .11, 2022 Panel's Recommendations Outside the context of clinical trials, s tructured interruption s of antiretroviral therapy are not recommended for children (AII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observ ational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long -term outcomes; II* = One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studi es in adults with long- term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents , but not studies limited to post -pubertal adolescents Unplanned Treatment Interruptions Temporary discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be unavoidable in some situations \u2014 such as in cases of serious treatment -related toxicity , acute illnesses , or planned surgeries \u2014that preclude oral intake . Lack of available medication also may result in temporary ART discontinuation. In resource -limited settings , children might experience interruptions due to drugs being out of stock local ly. Children with HIV who are immigrating to the United States may also experience gaps in medication availability . Prolonged interruptions of ART also can result from disengagement from care or other social or psychologic al issues that affect adherence. Some patients, particularly adolescents and young adults, might attempt to conceal long periods of treatment interruption by restarting treatment in the few weeks ahead of clinic visits and viral load testing. Observational studies of children and youth with un planned or nonprescribed treatment interruptions suggest that interruptions are common, that most patients will experience immunologic decline during the treatment interruption, and that most patients will restart therapy.1-4 In a retrospective study of 483 children in a French pediatric cohort from the National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis (ANRS) , 42% of participants had treatment interruptions of 3 months (with a median of 12.1 months). Interruption was associated with lower CD 4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell percentage s after 4 years, even in those who restarted therapy.5 A similar retrospective study of 136 youth (median age 12.9 years) in the United States found that 38 participants (28%) with histories of treatment interruption had lowe r CD4 counts and higher HIV RNA levels than participants w ho had continuous treatment .6 Whether unplanned interruptions occur by accident or necessity (e.g., because of toxicity ), all efforts should be made to minimize their duration. If a child will be traveling for an extended period, clinicians can help prevent treatment interruption by ensuring that the child will have access to the necessary drugs during the trip. If the requ ired drugs will not be available at the destination, pharmacies can be asked to dispens e extra medication. Additional guidance on supporting adherence can be found in Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents with HIV . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-23 Structured Treatment Interruptions Structured treatment interruptions are scheduled periods of time during which ART is not presc ribed or administered. This strategy was once considered a method for providing patients with time off ART to reduce the risk of toxicity and costs. Randomized c linical trials of adults with HIV have demonstrated that structured treatment interruptions are associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality than continuous ART.7 Current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HIV treatment guidelines recommend against planned, long -term structured treatment interruptions in adults ( see Discontinuation or Interruption of Antiretroviral Therapy in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral G uideline s). Few studies have evaluated structured treatment interruption in children . In one trial from Europe and Thailand (PENTA 11), 109 children (median age 9 years) on ART and with virologic suppression were randomized to receive continuous therapy (CT) or to undergo treatment interruption . Although no significant differences in rates of adverse events (AEs) were observed between the two groups at 2 years, 19 of 56 children (34%) in the structured treatment interruption arm met CD4 criteria to restart therapy between 6 and 42 weeks after interruption, suggesting that the time off ART provided by this strategy was ultimately li mited .8,9 The Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER ) trial in South Africa was designed to determine whether infants who initiated ART early could safely discontinue therapy at either 40 weeks or 96 weeks ; infants would reinitiate treatment based on CD4 decline . The median time to the start of continuous ART after interruption was 33 weeks ( interquartile range [IQR] 26-45 weeks ) among the infants who discontinued ART after 40 weeks , and 70 weeks (IQR 35-109 weeks) among the infants who discontinued ART after 96 weeks .10,11 A secondary analysis of neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years did not show any significant differences among the children in the different study arm s.12 However, brain magnetic resonance imaging studies in a subset of participants found that children with HIV on interrupted ART (n = 21) had a thicker cortex than uninfected controls in the left frontal and right insular regions, but children with HIV on CT (n = 25) showed no difference from controls .13 In another randomized trial , 12 of 21 infants in the treatment interruption arm met ART restart criteria within 3 months .14 In summary, although trials of structured treatment interruptions in children have not shown significant short -term morbidity, the gains in time off ART are limited, and the long- term outcomes remain unknown. The case of an infant from Mississippi who initiated ART soon after birth and had a prolonged period of time without viremia after an unplanned treatment interruption raised the hope that it may be possible to stop or reduce the intensity of ART (e.g., use fewer agents) in some infants (see Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV ).15,16 However, the \"Mississippi infant \" had documented viral rebound after 28 months off ART ,17 and additional reports have emerged of infants who experienced rebound viremia after stopping ART , despite having undetectable HIV DNA and RNA while on ART .18-20 A South African child aged 9.5 years was reported to have low levels of virus that was not replication competent after receiving ART from approximately 2 to 24 months of age; the factors that led to this outcome remain unknown.21 Future research might identify treatment strategies and diagnostic tests that enable ART to be safely interrupted in some children. \" Analytical\" treatment interru ptions are currently being incorporated into studies of remission in adults and children, but the potential risks and benefits of strategies need to be critically evaluated . 22-24 Currently, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) does not recommend treatment interruption as a strategy in clinical settings to Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-24 confirm diagnosis or to assess remission or cure in infants who re verted to negative serology, tested negative for HIV DNA, or received an initial diagnosis that was based on a single positive nucleic acid test . The Panel encourages providers to consult an expert on pediatric HIV when they are concerned about the validit y of the test results that led to treatment in itiation in children with HIV . Short -Cycle T herapy Strategies One approach, called short -cycle therapy (SCT), schedules 4-day treatment interruptions , rather than waiting to restart ART after CD4 count decline s or other AEs occur . In one proof-of-concept study (ATN015), 32 participants (aged 12- 24 years) underwent short cycles of 4 days on and 3 days off ART.25 Participants received protease inhibitor-based ART and had at least 6 months of documented viral suppression (defined as a viral load < 400 copies/m L) and CD4 count s above 350 cells/mm3. Most p articipants demonstrated good adherence to the schedule, but 12 participants (37.5%) developed confirmed viral load rebounds >400 copies /mL, and 18 participants (56%) left the study. SCT had no impact on CD4 counts. The BREATHER (PENTA 16) s tudy sought to examine the safety and benef its of SCT with 5 days on and 2 days off ART; PENTA 16 was a noninferiority trial that randomized 199 children and young adults (aged 8 -24 years ) for SCT or CT .26,27 To enrol l, participants had to be receiving efavirenz (EFV) plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors , and they had to have been virologic ally suppress ed (defined as a viral load <50 c opies /mL) for >12 months. By 48 weeks, six participants (6%) in the SCT arm and seven participants (7%) in the CT arm experienced confirmed virologic failure , which was defined as a viral load >50 copies/m L (difference 1.2%; 90% confidence interval , 7.3% to 4.9%). Of the six participants in the SCT arm who experience d virologic failure , five were able to regain virologic suppression. Two participants in the SCT arm and five participants in the CT arm had major mutations related to resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at the time of virologic failure. At 48 weeks , the SCT arm had higher D -dimer levels but no other evidence of increased inflammation across a number of other biomarkers. Participants generally reported appreciat ing the option of SCT.28 A long-term follow -up study of children from the BREATHER study (which included 194 of the original 199 children) suggests comparable virologic failure rates between the SCT and CT arms after a median of 3.6 years ; both arms had a failure rate of approximately 16%.29 The participants in the SCT arm experienced a great er number of serious AE s than participants in the CT arm (20 serious AEs in the SCT arm versus 8 in the CT arm , with the primary difference being rate of hospitalizations); however, the arms experienced comparable rates of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Grade 3 or 4 AE s. The BREATHER trial suggests that SCT with EFV -based ART may be safe in some adolescents and may yield increased patient satisfaction that could lead to better long-term adherence . However, the P anel believes that additional data are needed to decide whether this strategy would be safe in different patient populations, with different antiretroviral (AR V) regimens, outside of the context of a trial, and over longer periods . Conclusion Most studies have shown that treatment can be safely interrupted in c hildren with HIV only for short periods . Furthermore, treatment interruption yield s minimal potential benefits to counterbalance the risks associated with the use of this strategy , and long-term follow -up data are limited . One benefit of treatment interruptions was the potential reduction of toxicity; however, current ARV agents have lower toxicity than older ARV drugs . It is possible that SCT strategies may be safe for some patients, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-25 but additional data are needed to support the use of these strategies . Currently, t he Panel does not recommend structured treatment interruption in the clinical care of children with HIV ; additional studies of treatment- interruption strategies in specific situations are warranted.

For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate (Aged Birth Through <1 Month ) Dose Oral Solution Abacavir (ABC) is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in neonates aged < 1 month. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) recommends ABC 2 mg/kg twice daily for full- term infants from birth through <1 month of age. This recommendation is based on data from pharmacokinetic ( PK) modeling of neonatal ABC dosing to target adult plasma ABC exposures, and observational data supporting safety of A BC in neonates . The World Health Organization (WHO) HIV guidelines Annex 1: Dosages for ARV Drugs provide weight -band dosing recommendations for full- term neonates based on the same data (see Approval, Pharmacokinetics in Neonates and Infants , and Safety in Neonates and Infants sections below). Infant (Aged 1 Month to <3 Months) Dose Oral Solution ABC is not approved by the FDA for use in infants aged <3 months. Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR s) can be fatal. HSRs usually occur during the first few weeks of starting therapy. Symptoms may include fever, rash, nausea, vomiting, malaise or fatigue, loss of appetite, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath). Special Instructions Test patients for the HLA -B*5701 allele before starting therapy to predict the risk of HSR s. Patients who test positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele should not be given ABC . Patients with no prior HLA -B*5701 testing who are tolerating ABC do not need to be tested. Warn patients and caregivers about the risk of serious , potentially fatal HSR s. Occurrence of an HSR requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of ABC . Do not rechallenge. ABC can be given without food. The oral solution does not require refrigeration. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before using ABC FDC tablets that contain lamivudine (3TC) . Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when 3TC is discontinued, see Lamivudine . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-3 The Panel recommends ABC 4 mg/kg twice daily i n full -term infants aged 1 month to <3 months . This recommendation is based on modeling data of the ABC 4 mg/kg twice- daily dose using PK simulation for full -term infants aged 1 month to <3 months . The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT ) P1106 study and two observational cohorts provide reassuring data on the safety of ABC in infants with HIV aged <3 months . See Approval, Pharmacokinetics in Neonates and Infant s, and Safety in Neonates and Infants sections below. Infant and Child (Aged 3 Months) Dose Oral Solution ABC 8 mg/kg twice daily (maximum 300 mg per dose) or ABC 16 mg/kg once daily (maximum 600 mg per dose) In infants and young children who are being treated with liquid formulations of ABC , initiation with once- daily ABC is not generally recommended. In older children who can be treated with tablet formulations, therapy can be initiated with once- daily admini stration. In clinically stable patients who have undetectable viral load s and stable CD4 T lymphocyte count s while receiving the liquid formulation of ABC twice daily , the ABC dose can be changed from twice daily to once daily with the liquid or tablet formulations (see text below).

The m ajority of ABC is excreted as metabolites in urine. Abacavir Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment ABC requires a dose adjustment in patients with mild hepatic insufficiency and is contraindicated with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency . Do not use Epzicom and Triumeq (or the generic equivalents of these FDC tablet s) in patients with impaired hepatic function, because the dose of ABC cannot be adjusted. Abacavir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment ABC does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. Do not use Epzicom and Triumeq (or the generic equivalents of these FDC tablet s) in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min or patients on dialysis , because the doses of 3TC (in all three FDCs ) cannot be adjusted. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-4 This FDC tablet can be used in patients who are antiretroviral (ARV) -naive or ARV -experienced (but integrase strand transfer inhibitor -naive) dose for pediatric patients is one tablet once daily for patients weighing 40 kg (see Dolutegravir for more information). Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Abacavir (ABC) neither inhibit s nor is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, it does not cause significant changes in the clearance of agents that are metabolized through these pathways, such as protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhi bitors. ABC plasma concentrations can decrease when ABC is used concurrent ly with the ritonavir -boosted PIs atazanavir/ritonavir , lopinavir/ritonavir , and darunavir/ritonavir.1-3 The mechanism and the clinical significance of the drug interactions with the se PIs are unknown. Currently, no recommendations exist for dose adjustments when ABC is coadministered with one of these boosted PIs. Alcohol exposure (0.7 g per kg ethanol, which is equivalent to five alcoholi c drinks) interfere s with ABC metabolism ; it affect s the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase. This interference increase d ABC area under the curve (AUC) plasma exposure by 41% in adult men with HIV who received ABC 600 mg dail y.4 ABC oral solution contains sorbitol , which decreased the exposure of lamivudine (3TC) oral solution in adults when the drugs were administered concurrently.5 Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diarrhea, rash, anorexia Less common (more severe): Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) have been observed in approximately 5% of adults and children ( the rate varies by race/ethnicity) receiving ABC . HSRs generally occur during the first 6 weeks of therapy, but they have also been reported after a single dose of ABC. The risk of an ABC HSR is associated with the presence of the HLA -B*5701 allele; th e risk is greatly reduced by not using ABC in those who test positive for the HLA -B*5701 allele. The HSR to ABC is a multiorgan clinical syndrome usually characterized by rash, or signs or symptoms in two or more of the following groups: o Fever o Constitution al symptoms , including malaise, fatigue, or achiness o Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms , including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain o Respiratory signs and symptoms , including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis o Laboratory and radiologic abnormaliti es, including elevated liver function tests, elevated elevated creatinine, lymphopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. Lactic acidosis and Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-5 severe hepatomegaly with steatosis \u2014including fatal cases \u2014also have been reported. Pancreatitis with laboratory abnormalities can occur. If an HSR is suspected, ABC should be stopped immediately and not restarted because hypotension and death may occur upon rechallenge . Rare: Increased levels of liver enzy mes, elevated blood glucose levels , elevated triglycerides (see cardi ovascular risk below). acidosis , hepatomegaly with steatosis \u2014 including fatal cases \u2014have been reported. Rare : Drug r eaction (or rash) with e osinophilia and s ystemic s ymptoms ( DRESS ) syndrome . Rare: Several observational cohort studies suggest that an increased risk of myocardial infarction exists in adults who are currently using ABC or who have recently used ABC ; however, other studies have not substantiated this finding, and no prospective da ta are available on the cardiovascular risks associated with ABC use in children. One cohort study of South African adolescents (in which 385 participants had HIV and 63 participants were HIV -negative controls) with a median age of 12 years reported an association between ABC exposure and insulin resistance, which was evaluated using homeostatic model assessment. These findings suggest that the use of ABC may be a cardiovascular risk factor for young people with perinatally acquired HIV . 6 Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval ABC is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children with HIV aged 3 months as part of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) component of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The World Health Organization (WHO) , however, provides dosing guidance for ABC as a component of the NRTI backbone for full-term neonates starting at birth and weighing 2 kg (see Annex 1: Dosages for ARV Drugs in the WHO HIV guidelines ). Th e WHO guidance for ABC dosing in neonates increases the choices of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for the management of newborns in special situations where stock outs of nevirapine or zidovudine (ZDV) may affect the ability to effectively provide postnatal prophyl axis or treatment of neonatal HIV . The WHO recommendation of ABC dosing for infants starting at 1 month of age is based on the inclusion of ABC as a preferred NRTI component of the first- and second- line ARV regimens for children in the WHO HIV guidelines . This recommendation also takes into account the availability of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) tentatively approved pediatric generic ABC formulations \u2014including coformulations that include 3TC\u2014and the cost of AR V drugs in resource -limited settings . Efficacy Both the once -daily and twice -daily doses of ABC have demonstrated durable antiviral efficacy in pediatric clinical trials that is comparable to the efficacy observed for other NRTIs in children.7-11 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-6 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Neonates and Infants The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT ) P1106 trial reported PK data in 25 infants aged <3 months who were initiated on a median ABC dose of 10 mg/kg ( range , 6-13 mg/kg ) twice daily in combination with lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Median age was 6 weeks (range , 1.5-11 weeks ); median weight was 2,250 g (range , 1,360 -3,320 g); median gestational age was 36 weeks , 27-39 weeks ). Sparse and pre -dose PK ABC samples were repeatedly obtained throughout 24 weeks of study follow -up, and population PK modeling was applied. ABC plasma exposures were high compared to the published data in infants aged >3 months and decreased rapidly bet ween 2 and 8 months of age as the infants matured and ABC clearance increased.12 PK modeling of ABC starting at birth has been conducted using pooled data from 308 ABC concentration measurement s obtained from three studies administering ABC liquid to 45 young infants (including 21 full - term neonates <15 days of age with intensive PK ).13 Two of these studies, the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) 321 study and Ty gerberg cohort, performed intensive PK sampling in full -term neonates receiving ABC for HIV prophylaxis. T he third study, IMPAACT P1106, performed sparse PK sampling on full-term and low -birth weight ([ LBW ] <2,500 g) infants with HIV, initiating ABC -base d ART after 1 month of age. LBW infants were older at the first PK assessment , with a median postnatal age of 78 days (range , 41- 190) and weight of 3.6 kg (range , 2.4-5.8). ABC PK parameters in neonates were estimated using PK simulations to achieve plasma ABC exposures (AUC 0-12) within the expected adult range (3.2-25.2 mcg hr/mL). ABC elimination was greatly reduced at birth but rapidly increased during the first weeks of life. Simulations predicted that an ABC dose of 2 mg/kg twice daily in full -term neonates from birth to <4 weeks and an ABC dose of 4 mg/kg twice daily in infants aged 4 to 12 weeks would achieve target AUC 0-12; however, data i n LBW infa nts are lacking.13 Based on these data , the weight -band dosing of ABC for neonates has been developed for neonates from birth to age <1 month and is included in the WHO HIV Guidelines Annex 1: Dosages for ARV Drugs .14 This weight -band dosing for neonates approximates the ABC dosing per kg based on the postnatal age (see Table 1 below ). Table 1. Simplified Weight-Band Dosing for Full -Term Neonates from Birth to <1 Month of Age ( WHO HIV guidelines Annex 1 : Table A1.4) Birth to <1 Month of A ge Weight Volume of ABC Oral Solution 20 mg/mL Twice Dailya,b ABC Dose in mg Twice Daily (ranges mg/kg , from lowest to highest weight within the weight band)a,b 2 kg to <3 kg 0.4 mL 8 mg (4.0 -2.8 mg/kg) 3 kg to <4 kg 0.5 mL 10 mg (3.3 -2.6 mg/kg) 4 kg to < 5 kg 0.6 mL 12 mg (3.0 -2.4 mg/kg) a Simplified w eight -band dosing exceeds recommended ABC dosing in neonates and infants . b Neonatal ABC dose is based on birth weight and does not require weight -based adjustment during the first month of life. Key: ABC = Abacavir Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-7 For infants aged 1 month with weight 3 to <6 kg, the WHO HIV guidelines currently recommend a twice - daily dose of 3 mL (60 mg) of ABC 20 mg/mL solution (range , 20.0-10.2 mg/kg). The weight -band dosing for neonates and infants within the WHO HIV g uidelines is higher than the modeled weight -based dosing for practical considerations in resource -limited settings. As new , generic pediatric formulations of ABC become available in resource- limited settings, there is potential for the revision of the WHO weight -band dosing of ABC for young infants. Based on th e PK modeling f rom three infant studies13 and the neonatal and infant safety data from IMPAACT 1106 study and two observational cohort studies (see Safety in Neonates and Infants below ), the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommends an ABC dose of 2 mg/kg t wice daily for neonates from birth to <1 month of age and an ABC dose of 4 mg/kg twice daily for full-term infants age d 1 month and <3 months. Pharmacokinetics in Children PK studies of ABC in children aged <12 years have demonstrated that metabolic clearance of ABC in adolescents and young adults (aged 13-25 years) is slower than that observed in younger children and approximates clearance seen in older adults.15 The PK s of ABC administered once daily in children with HIV aged 3 months through 12 years w ere evaluated in three crossover, open- label PK trials of twice -daily versus and ARROW [n = 36]).4,16-19 The data from these three pediatric trials were used to develop a model for ABC PKs; this model predicted that systemic plasma ABC exposure after once -daily dosing would be equivalent to the exposure seen after twice -daily dosing in infants and children aged 12 years.16-20 Both these trials and PK modeling have demonstrated that once -daily dosing with either the tablet or the liquid formulation of ABC produces plasma exposures comparable to those seen with a twice -daily dosing schedule that uses the same total daily dose of ABC.4 Dosing Dosing and Formulations Initially, the recommended dose for pediatric use was ABC 8 mg/kg twice daily for a total of 16 mg/kg per day. A 2015 FDA review suggested that a total daily dose of ABC 600 mg could be used safely in a person weighing 25 kg (i.e., ABC 24 mg/kg per day, a 50% increase from the previously recommended dose ). The weight -band dosing table recommends total daily doses as high as ABC 21.5 mg/kg per day to ABC 22.5 mg/kg per day when treating patients with the tablet formulation.4 No difference is seen in the ABC plasma C max and area unde r the curve for the ABC liquid formulation compared to the tablet formulation .21 Doses of the liquid ABC formulation are similar to those used for weight -band dosing with tablet formulations and should be considered for use in younger children who are unable to swallow a pill . In the three ABC dosing pediatric trials described above ,16-19 only child ren who had low viral loads and who were clinically stable on the twice -daily dose of ABC were eligible to chang e to once -daily ABC dosing. Efficacy data from a 48-week follow -up in the ARROW trial demonstrated clinical non-inferiority of once - daily ABC (n = 336) versus twice -daily ABC (n = 333) in tablet form combined with a once -daily or twice - daily 3TC -based ARV regimen.11 To date, n o clinical trials have been conducted involving children who initiated therapy with once -daily dosing of the ABC liquid formula tion. In children who can be treated with pill formulations, initiati ng therapy with once -daily dosing of ABC at a dose of 16 mg/kg (with a maximum dose of ABC 600 mg ) is recommended. However, twice -daily dosing is recommended for infants and young Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-8 childre n who initiate therapy with the liquid formulation of ABC. S witching to once -daily dosing with the liquid or pill formulation could be considered in clinically stable children with suppressed viral loads and stable CD4 T lymphocyte count s. Toxicity Safety in Neonates and Infants Recent data from the IMPAACT P1106 trial and two observational European and African cohorts provided reassuring data on the safety of ABC in infants when initiated at <3 months of age, including infants with weight <3 kg.12,22,23 The IMPAACT P1106 trial reported 24 weeks of safety data in 25 infants who i nitiated ABC at the median age of 6 weeks. Of the 25 infants, one infant died of unknown cause 3 days after entry. Fourteen infants had Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs); the most common were gastroenteritis (n = 4) and respiratory infection (n = 4). No hypersensitivity was reported. All AEs were assessed as unrelated to ABC, except for one possibly related Grade 2 alanine aminotransferase in which all ARVs were stopped for 2 weeks until resolution and were restarted without further complications.12 The European Pregnancy and Paediatric Infections Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) reported safety outcome s among 139 children from 13 cohorts in 11 countries in Europe who initiated ABC at age <3 months. By 12 months on ABC, 3.6% (n = 4) had discontinued ABC because of an ART safety concern and 11.8% (n =15) discontinued ABC for any reason.22 Another observational study of nine cohorts from the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Southern Africa collaboration compared safety outcomes between infants who started ABC age d <28 days (n = 96) and those aged 28 days (n = 835) and between infants who started ABC with weight <3 kg (n = 246) and those with weight 3 kg (n = 53).23 ABC discontinuations at 6 and 12 months were not significantly different in infants who started ART aged <28 days and 28 days or in infants who weighed <3 kg and 3 kg.23 ABC has less of an e ffect on mitochondrial function than the NRTI ZDV7,8 and less and rena l toxicity than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .24,25 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-9 References 1.

Some members of the Panel Special Instructions Although FTC can be administered without regard to food, some FDC tablet formulations that contain FTC have food requirements . FTC oral solution can be kept at room temperature, up to 77\u00b0 F (25\u00b0C), if used within 3 months; refrigerate oral solution for long- term storage. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus ( HBV) infection before using FTC or FDC tablets that contain FTC . Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when FTC is discontinued; therefore, hepatic function and hepatitis B viral load should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking FTC. Metabolism /Elimination No cytochrome P450 interactions Eighty -six percent of FTC is excreted in urine. FTC may compet e with other compounds that undergo renal elimination. Emtricitabine Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Atripla should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed -Dose Combination T ablets and refer to other sections of the Drug Appendix for drug interaction information for each individual component of an FDC tablet . Renal elimination: FTC may c ompet e with other compounds that undergo renal tubular secretion . Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease clearance of FTC . Major Toxicities More common : Headache, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, rash. Hyperpigmentation/skin discoloration, which may be more common in children than in adults . Less common (more severe) : Neutropenia. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, h ave been reported. Exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) /HIV coinfection who switched from regimens that included FTC to regimens that did not include FTC . Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval FTC is approved by the U .S. Food and Drug Administration for once -daily administration in children, starting at birth. FTC often is used as part of a dual -NRTI backbone in antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for children and adolescents because of its once -daily dosing, minimal toxicity, and favorable pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) data. Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Comparative Clinical Trials Studies that assess the efficacy and/ or potency of nucleoside/nucleot ide analogues have been more concerned with the dynamic components of regimen\u2014such static components , such as FTC or 3TC. FTC and 3TC have been considered to be interchangeable, but data to support this conclusion are lacking . Investigators studying the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands (ATHENA) cohort compared the efficacy of TDF plus FTC with TDF plus 3TC when these drugs were Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-13 administe red lopinavir) in antiretroviral therapy (AR T)-naive patients .1 The adjusted hazard ratio for the virologic failure of 3TC-containing regimens compared with FTC -containing regimens within 240 weeks of starting therapy was 1.15 (95% confidence int erval, 0.58-2.27). N o difference between these regimens was observed in the time to virologic suppression during the first 48 weeks of therapy or time to virologic failure after attaining suppression. In a Swiss cohort, Yang et al. found a potential difference in efficacy between FTC and 3TC; however, the difference disappeared after adjusting for pill burden.2 Current evid ence suggests that FTC and 3TC have equivalent efficacy and toxicity in ARV-na ive patients. Efficacy Following a dose-finding study by Wang et al. (described in the Pharmacokinetics: Liquid Versus Capsule section below),3 a once -daily dose of FTC 6 mg/kg administered in combination w ith other ARV drugs was studied in 116 patients aged 3 months to 16 years .4 The study used a maximum dose of 240 mg of the FTC liquid formulation. PK results showed that the plasma exposures seen in these children and adolescents were similar to those seen in adults who receiv ed FTC 200 mg once daily. Follow -up data extending to We ek 96 indicated that 89% of ART -naive children and 76% of ARV - experienced children maintained plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL (75% of ARV -naive children and 67% of ARV -experienced children had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL). Minimal toxicity was observed during this trial. Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) P10215 evaluated the use of FTC 6 mg/kg (with a maximum dose of FTC 200 mg per day of the liquid formulation ) as part of a three -drug regimen dosed once daily to ARV -naive children aged 3 months to 21 years . In this trial, 85% of children achieved HIV RNA <400 copie s/mL , and 72% (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL ) through 96 weeks of therapy. The median CD4 T lymphocyte count rose by 329 cells/mm3 at Week 96. Pharmacokinetics : Liquid Versus Capsule A single -dose PK study of the FTC oral solution and FTC capsules enrolled 25 children with HIV aged 2 years to 17 years .3 FTC was found to be well absorbed following oral administration, with a mean elimination half -life of 11 hours (range , 9.7-11.6 hours). Plasma concentrations in children who receiv ed the once -daily dose of FTC 6 mg/kg were approximately equivalent to those seen in adults who receiv ed the standard dose of FTC 200 mg. However, plasma concentrations of FTC after administration of the capsule formulation were approximately 20% higher than those observed after administration of the oral solution in this small cohort of children. Pharmacokinetics in Infants A study i n South Africa evaluated the PK s of FTC in 20 infants aged <3 months with perinatal HIV exposure . The participants received a dose of FTC 3 mg/kg once daily for two 4-day courses, separated by an interval of 2 weeks.6 FTC exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) in neonates receiving FTC 3 mg/kg once daily was with in the range of exposures seen in pediatric patients aged >3 months who receiv ed the recommended dose of FTC 6 mg/kg once daily and adults who receiv ed the recommended once -daily dose of FTC 200 mg. During the first 3 months of life, FTC AUC decreased with increasing age, correlating with an increase in total body clearance of the drug. In a small group of neonates (n = 6) who receiv ed a single dose of FTC 3 mg/kg and whose mothers received a single dose of FTC 600 mg during delivery, the FTC AUC exceeded the AUC seen in adults and older children. However, FTC had a half -life of 9.2 hours in these neonates, which is Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-14 similar to that observed in adults and older children.7 Extensive safety data are lacking for this age range. Considerations for Use The FTC oral solution has an advantage over the liquid formulation of 3TC , because it can be given once daily at ARV initiation, whereas the liquid formulation of 3TC needs to be given twice daily at ARV initiation. When pill formulations of 3TC or FTC are used, they can be administered once daily . Both FTC and 3TC have antiviral activity an d efficacy against HBV.

Severe acute exacerbations of HBV can occur after discontinuation of lamivudine. Hepatic function and HBV viral load should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking 3TC. Patients with HBV/HIV coinfection who receive Dovato will require additional treatment for chronic HBV infection. Metabolism/Elimination Lamivudine Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No change in 3TC dosing is required for patients with hepatic impairment. FDC tablets containing abacavir ( ABC) or zidovudine (ZDV) should not be used in patients who have impaired hepatic function.

Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease clearance of lamivudine (3TC). Do not use 3TC in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) , because these drugs have similar resistance profiles and using them together offers no additional benefit.1 Do not use 3TC with fixed-dose combination (FDC) medications that contain 3TC or FTC . Please see Appendix A, Table 1 . Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets and refer to other sections of the Drug Appendix for drug interaction information about each individual component of FDC tablets . Major Toxicities More common: acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of HIV drug resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediat ric Use Approval 3TC is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of children aged 3 months. Considerations for Use The efficacy and toxicity of 3TC are equivalent to the efficacy and toxicity of FTC . The oral formulation of FTC has an advantage over the liquid formulation of 3TC because it can be given once daily at antiretroviral (ARV ) initiation , whereas the liquid formulation of 3TC needs to be gi ven twice daily at ARV initiation. When pill formulations of 3TC or FTC are used, they can be administered once daily . Comparative Clinical Trials Investigators studying the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands (ATHENA) cohort compared the efficacy o f tenofovir d isoproxil fumarate (TDF ) plus FTC to TDF plus 3TC when these drugs Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-19 were administered with a for the failure of 3TC -containing regimens compared to FTC-containing regimens within 240 weeks of starting therapy was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-2.27). T hese regimens had no difference in time to virologic suppression during the first 48 weeks of therapy or time to virologic failure after attaining suppression. In a Swiss cohort, Yang et al. found a potential difference in efficacy between FTC and 3TC; however, the difference disappeared after adjusting for pill burden. Current evidence suggests that FTC and 3TC have equivalent efficacy and toxicity in ARV -naive patients.3 Efficacy 3TC has been studied in children with HIV both alone and in combination with other ARV drugs. Extensive data have demonstrate d the safety of 3TC and have shown that this drug is associated with clinical improvement and virologic response. It is commonly used in children with HIV as a component of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI ) backbone.4-12 In one study that evaluated the efficacy of NRTI background components , the combination of 3TC plus abacavir (ABC ) was superior to zidovudine (ZDV) plus 3TC ZDV plus ABC in achieving long-term virologic efficacy.13 Pharmacokinetics in Infants Because of its safety profile and availability in a liquid formulation, 3TC has been given to infants during the first 6 weeks of life starting at a dose of 2 mg/k g every 12 hours before age 4 weeks.9 A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of infants who receiv ed 3TC affirms that adjusting the dose from 3TC 2 mg/kg to 3TC 4 mg/kg every 12 hours at age 4 weeks provides optimal 3TC exposure for infants with normal maturation of renal function.14 For infants, the World Health Organization weight -band dosing (which is up to five times higher than the FDA -approved dose) results in greater plasma concentrations than the 3TC 2 mg/kg dos e.15 In HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN ) 040, 3TC was administered as a component of a three -drug regimen to prevent perinatal transmission during the first 2 weeks of life. For 2 weeks, a ll infants weighing >2,000 g received 3TC 6 mg twice daily , and infants weighing 2,000 g received 3TC 4 mg twice daily. These doses resulted in 3TC exposure that was similar to th e exposure seen in infants who received the standard twice -daily dosing schedule of 3TC 2 mg/kg per dose for neonates.16 Pharmacokinetics of Liquid versus T ablet Preparations The PKs of 3TC have been studied after either single or repeat doses in 210 pediatric subjects. Pediatric subjects who received 3TC oral solution according to the recommended dose regimen achieved plasma concentrations of 3TC that were approximately 25% lower than those of adults with HIV who received the oral solution. Pediatric subjects who received 3TC tablets achieved plasma concentrations that were comparable to or slightly higher than those observed in adults who received tablets. In pediatric subjects, the relative bioavailability of 3TC oral solution is approximately 40% lower than the relative bioavailability of tablets that contain 3TC , despite no difference in the bioavailability of these two formulations among adults. The mecha nisms for the diminished relative bioavailability of 3TC oral solution are unknown, 17 but results from a study in adults that compared the PKs of 3TC oral solution administered either alone or with increasing concentrations of sorbitol indicate that sorbitol decreases the total exposure of 3TC oral solution.18 Sorbit ol is a component of several ARV solutions, including ABC , as well as common over-the -counter medications that may be used in infants and young children; this may explain the PK discrepancy between the oral solution Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-20 and tablet formulations. Modeling of PK data in pediatric patients suggests that increasing the oral solution dose to 3TC 5 mg/kg per dose twice daily or 3TC 10 mg/kg per dose once daily (with a maximum of 3TC 300 mg administered daily) in children aged 3 months would provide exposures similar to those seen in adult patients who received tablet formulations. However, modeling was done with PK data derived from studies that did not use 3TC liqui d formulation, and so modeling may not predict exposures for 3TC oral solution, especially when used with liquid ABC . The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) does not recommend using a once -daily d ose of 3TC until a child is aged 3 years. However, t his new dosing schedule is now included in the 3TC package insert, even though no clinical data are available for patients who receiv ed both 3TC and sorbitol -containing medications. Dosing Considerations\u2014 Once -Daily versus Twice -Daily Administration The standard adult dose for 3TC is 300 mg once daily, but data are lack ing on once -daily administration of 3TC in children. Population PK data indicate tha t once -daily dosing of 3TC 8 mg/kg leads to area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC 0-24h) values that are similar to those seen in patients taking 3TC 4 mg/kg twice daily, but minimum blood plasma concentration ( Cmin) values are significantly lower and max imum blood plasma concentration (C max) values are significantly higher in children aged 1 year to 18 years.19 Intensive PKs of once -daily versus twice -daily dosing of 3TC were evaluated in children with HIV aged 2 to 13 years in the PENTA (Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS) 13 trial4 and in children aged 3 months to 36 months in the PENTA 15 trial.20 Both the PENTA 13 and PENTA 15 trials used a crossover design with doses of 3TC 8 mg/kg once daily or 3TC 4 mg/kg twice daily. AUC 0-24 and clearance values were similar between these two dosing schedules, and most children maintained an undetectable HIV RNA value after the switch. An ARROW (AntiRetroviral Research fOr Watoto) trial PK study of 41 children aged 3 to 12 years (median age 7.6 years) in Uganda who were stable on twice -daily 3TC also showed equivalent AUC 0-24h and good clinical outcome s (defined by a low disease stage and a high CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cel l count) after switching to once -daily 3TC . Median follow -up time during this study was 1.15 years.21 The larger ARROW trial was a randomized, noninferiority trial that investigated once -daily versus twice -daily doses of 3TC in >600 pediatric patients who had initiated therapy with twice -daily 3TC and who had been receiving therapy for 36 weeks. Median follow -up time during the study was 114 weeks. Rates of p lasma HIV RNA suppression and adverse event profiles for once -daily 3TC were similar to ( and statistically noninferior to) those of twice -daily 3TC.22 All four of the studies discussed above enrolled patients who had a low plasma HIV RNA or who were clinically stable on twice -daily 3TC before switching to once -daily dosing. Therefore, the Panel supports switching from twice -daily to once -daily dosing of 3TC in children aged 3 years who have been clinically stable for 36 weeks with an undetectable viral load and stable CD4 count. Clinicians should use a 10 mg/kg per dose of 3TC oral solution or a weight -based dose of 3TC tablets (neither exceeding 3TC 300 mg) as part of a once -daily regimen.23 More long-term clinical trials with viral efficacy endpoints are needed to confirm that once -daily dosing of 3TC can be used effectively as part of an initia l ARV regimen in children. 3TC undergoes intracellular metabolism to reach its active form, 3TC triphosphate. In adolescents, the mean half -life of intracellular 3TC triphosphate (17.7 hours) is considerably longer that of unphosphorylated 3TC in plasma (1.5-2 hours). Intracellular concentrations of 3TC triphosphate are equivalent whether 3TC is given once daily or twice daily in adults and adolescents. This supports a recommendation for once -daily 3TC dosing based on FDA recommendations.24,25 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-21 Considerations for Use Weight -band dosing recommendations for 3TC have been developed for children weighing 3 kg and receiving either the 10 -mg/m L oral solution or the 150-mg scored tablets.26-28 Both FTC and 3TC have antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B virus.

Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating TAF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when TAF is discontinued; therefore, hepatic function should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking TAF . The FDA does not recommend using Genvoya with other ARV drugs , but this FDC tablet has been safely used with DRV .1 Descovy can be safely used2 with DRV or atazanavir in patients weighing 35 kg. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-24 The U.S. Food and D rug Administration (FDA) approved Biktarvy for use only in antiretroviral therapy (ART) -naive patients or to replace the current antiretroviral ( ARV) regimen in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen, with no history of treatment failure, and no known muta tions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy. Some members of the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommend the use of Biktarvy in patients with prior treatment failure who have virus with the M184V mutation. See the B ictegravir section for additional information. [Descovy] FTC/TAF Child , Adolescent , and Adult Dose One tablet once daily, with or without food.

In certain circumstances, TAF 25-mg tablets (Vemlidy) might be used as one component of a combination ARV regimen, with dosing recommendations similar to those for Descovy. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a substrate triphosphate -dependent transporters P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and the breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ). Drugs that strongly affect P -gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in TAF absorption. P -gp inducers are expected to decrease TAF exposure, and P -gp inhibitors are expected to increase absorption and plasma concentrations of TAF .2 A study of 98 healthy participants without HIV measured plasma TAF and tenofovir (TFV) exposures when TAF was administered with other antiretroviral (ARV) drug s. Coadministration of TAF with rilpivirine (RPV) and dolutegrav ir (DTG) did not change either TAF or TFV exposure. Coadministration of TAF with the P exposures. Coadministration of TAF with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) resulted in unchanged TAF area under the curve (AUC ) and doubl ed TFV AUC. and efavirenz decreased TAF and TAF with elvitegravir (EVG) and COBI, in addition to TAF (see the Elvitegravir and Cobicistat sections for details ). EVG glucuronosyltransferase 1A1/3, and by oxidative Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-26 metabolism pathways. E VG is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. COBI is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak of CYP2D6; in addition, COBI inhibits the adenosine triphosphate - dependent transporters BCRP and -gp and the organic anion-transporting polypeptides OAT1B1 and OAT1B3. Potential exists for multiple drug interactions when using both EVG and COBI. Absorption: Administering EVG and bictegravir (BIC) concurrently with antacids or supplements that contain iron, calcium, aluminum and/or magnesium lowers plasma concentrations of these ARV drugs (see the Elvitegravir and Bictegravir sections for details ). Odefsey contains RPV , which is a CYP3A substrate , and requires dose adjustments when administered administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions . Renal e limination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g., acyclovir, ganciclovir, high-dose nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory of the TAF metabolite TFV or emtricitabine (FTC). Concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided when using Genvoya. Protease inhibitors: Genvoya should not be administered concurrently with or regimens that contain ritonavir (RTV) , because COBI and RTV similar effects on CYP3A metabolism. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, diarrhea, headache . Greater weight gain has been reported with the use of TAF than with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF ) in adults and childre n6 (see Table 15 h. Lipodystrophies and Weight Gain for details ). Less common (more severe): Cases of l actic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutation s, and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval TAF is available as a component of several fixed -dose combination (FDC) tablets. These F DC tablets are listed in Appendix A, Table 1 and Appe ndix A, Table 2 . Descovy, a n FDC tablet that contains FTC and TAF (FTC /TAF ), is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for use in children who weigh 14 kg to <25 kg at a dose of FTC 120 mg/ TAF 15 mg and for children who weigh 25 kg to <35 kg at a dose of FTC 200 mg/ TAF 25 mg when used as part of an ARV regimen that does not include a boosted protease inhibitor (PI). Descovy is a pproved by the FDA for use in children who weigh 35 kg at a dose of FTC 200 mg/ TAF 25 mg when used in combination with any ARV drugs, including RTV -boosted or Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-27 COBI-boosted PIs. Odefsey, an FDC tablet that contain RPV , and TAF (FTC /RPV /TAF ), is approved by the FDA7 for use in children who weigh 35 kg. Genvoya, an FDC tablet that contain s EVG, COBI, FTC , and TAF (EVG/ c/FTC/TAF), is approved by the FDA for use in children who weigh 25 kg when used without other ARV drugs8 (see Table A below ). BIC is available only as part of the FDC tablet Biktarvy, which contains BIC , FTC , and TAF (BIC/FTC/TAF). Biktarvy is approved by the FDA9,10 for use in children or adolescents with body weigh t 14 kg to <25 kg at a dose of BIC 30 mg/ FTC 120 mg/ TAF 15 mg and for children, adolescents , and adults with body weight 25 kg at a dose of BIC 50 mg/ FTC 200 mg/ TAF 25 mg.10,11 Symtuza and TAF (DRV/ c/FTC/TAF) is approved by the FDA12 for use in children and adolescents who weigh 40 kg . TAF ha s antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Testing for HBV should be performed prior to starting treatment with TAF . If HBV is found, rebound of clinical hepatitis could occur when TAF is stopped. For more information about hepatitis rebound in patients with HBV/HIV coinfection, see the Hepatitis B V irus section of the Pediatric Opportunistic Infection Guidelines . TAF alone (as Vemlidy) is approved by the FDA for use in persons age d 8 years, but it is approved only for treating H BV, not HIV . Formulations TAF -containing pills are smaller than their TDF -containing counterparts, a significant advantage for some pediatric patients who may have trouble swallowing larger pills (see Appendix A, Table 2 ). EVG/ c/FTC/TAF contains TAF 10 mg , whereas FTC/TAF and FTC/RPV/TAF contain TAF 25 mg. BIC/FTC/TAF is available in two strengths: one containing TAF 15 mg for children aged 2 years and weighing <25 kg and the other containing TAF 25 mg for persons weighing 25 kg. COBI boosts TAF blood concentrations and tenofovir diphos phate (TFV -DP) intracellular exposure after TAF administration. Therefore, in persons weighing 25 kg, administration of EVG/c /FTC/TAF , which contains TAF 10 mg and COBI, achieves TFV -DP systemic exposure that is similar to the exposure achieved by FTC/RPV /TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF containing TAF 25 mg but no COBI.

Key: ARV = antiretroviral; TFV. After oral administration , TDF is well absorbed13,14 and is so rapidly metabolized to TFV that TDF itself cannot be measured in blood (even when plasma is sampled within 5 minutes of adm inistration ).15 TFV is the main compound that is measurable in plasma after TDF administration. From the bloodstream , TFV enters cells and is phosphorylated to the active agent TFV -DP. TAF also has good oral bioavailability.16,17 Within the enterocyte and liver, TAF is not metabolized to TFV as quickly as TDF, so the plasma TFV concentration is much lower with admini stration of TAF than with TDF , and the main component in plasma is the prodrug itself, TAF .18 Once inside the cell, TAF is hydrolyzed to TFV ,19,20 and then TFV -DP is produced by the same mechanism as for TDF. Relative to TDF, TAF more effectively delivers TFV to cells throughout the body.16 Therefore , a much lower dose of TAF results in intracellular concentrations of TFV -DP that are higher than the concentrations seen after TDF administration (see Table B below). Additionally, the half- life of TFV -DP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is longer for TAF (2.9 days, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-5.5) than for TDF The key pharmacokinetic (PK) difference between TDF and TAF is that TDF results in high er plasma TFV concentration s than TAF , but when administered at FDA -approved doses , both drugs Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-29 produce high , therapeutically effective -DP that suppresses viral replication, TAF should ha ve antiviral effi cacy that is equivalent to the antiviral efficacy of TDF . However, the toxicities that are specifically related to high plasma TFV concentrations should not occur when using TAF . High plasma TFV concentration has been linked to TDF -related endoc rine disruption that is associated with low bone mineral density (BMD).23 High plasma TFV concentration also has been closely associated with both glomerular23-25 and proxima l tubular26 renal toxicity.

N o differences occurred in BMD or the frequency of renal glomerular toxicities or renal tubular toxicities between the se groups, but the TAF group showed a decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL ) cholesterol levels , whereas the ABC group had an increase in HDL cholesterol levels36 (2 mg/dL vs. +2 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.0003). iral load suppression was at tained in about 90% of study participants when TAF was given as part of the coformulated BIC/FTC/TAF .37-39 Tenofovir Alafenamide Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adolescents and Children The combination of EVG, COBI, FTC, and TAF has been shown to have similar efficacy when used in adults and two groups of children: those weighing 35 kg and aged 12 years40 and those weighing 25 kg and aged 6 years41 (see the Elvitegravir section for details). In a s witch study, treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF resulted in viral load suppression at 48 weeks in 49 of 50 (98%) children aged 6 years to <12 years, and in 50 of 50 (100%) children aged 12 years to <18 years9 (see the Bictegravir section for details). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-30 Pharmacokinetics Drug Exposure and Virologic Response Virologic suppression in people who are taking TAF or TDF is most closely related to intracellular TFV -DP concentrations. In adults, TAF generates peripheral blood mononuclear cell TFV -DP concentrations that are twofold22 to seven fold higher than those generated with TDF , at clinically meaningful doses.18,21,27 Higher TFV -DP concentrations res ult in a stronger antiviral potency18 and a higher barrier to resistance .42,43 Therefore , because TAF administration leads to higher intracellular TFV -DP concentrations than TDF, TAF may be more effective against NRTI -resistant virus than TDF . The mean TFV -DP concentration is high er in youth aged 12 to 18 years than in adults : 221.8 fmol/million cells (with a coefficient of variation versus 120.8 fmol/million cells (CV 91.4%), respectively.40 Drug Exposure and Safety : All Age Groups FTC/TAF can be safely combined with DTG or raltegravir without concern for drug interactions. FTC and TAF also have been safely combined with BIC in the FDC tablet Biktarvy. When FTC/TAF, which contains TAF 25 mg, is combined with boosted ATV , DRV, or LPV , the P-gp inhibitors COBI or RTV increase the TAF exposure to higher concentrations than those seen with the use of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF , which contains TAF 10 mg. However, the plasma TFV concentrations seen with the use of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF or TAF plus DRV/r or DRV/c are still much lower than thos e seen with the use of Stribild, an FDC tablet that contains EVG, COBI, FTC , and TDF (see Table C below ).

Source : Table modified from U.S. Food and Drug Administration Summary Review of TAF and from the TAF clinical pharmacology review using data from the Stribild product label and Genvoya product label . Key: c linical trials in adults that have show n the safety of FTC plus TAF administered with ATV/r or DRV/r have used FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg, a formulation that is not available in the United States.44 The FDA states that when FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg is combined with boosted ATV, DRV, or LPV in adults , \"no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed or are expected.\"2 The combination of FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg is approved by the FDA for use in adults , independent of the accompanying ARV drugs (which may include a boosted PI or an integrase strand transfer Phase 2b trial in adults that compar ed a regimen of DRV/c plus FTC /TAF 10 mg to a regimen of DRV/c plus FTC /TDF , virologic outcome s at W eek 48 were worse for participants in the TAF 10-mg arm than in the TDF arm.45 Hence , FTC /TAF 25 mg was recommended for approval instead of FTC /TAF 10 mg.45 This is not the case in Canada or Europe where FTC is combined with TAF 10 mg in an FDC for use in combination with boos ted PIs. Drug Exposure and Safety: Aged 12 to 18 Years and Weighing 35 kg A study of FTC /TAF in 18 children and adolescents (aged 12 years to 18 years and weighing 35 kg) was performed using FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg plus a boosted third ARV drug or FTC 200 mg/TAF Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-32 25 mg with an unboosted third ARV drug. Th e results of this study showed TAF exposures in children and adolescents that were like those seen in adults . TAF was well tolerated and efficacious during the 24 weeks of study. Asymptomatic G rade 3 or 4 elevations in amylase levels were noted in 5 of 28 participants (18%) , and G rade 3 or 4 elevations in fasting low -density-lipoprotein ( LDL) levels were noted in 2 of 28 participants (7%) .46 Studies of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF in children aged 12 years to 18 years and weighing 35 kg show ed that TAF and TFV exposures were like those found in adults (see Table C above ), and that the drug combination was well tolerated and efficacious over 48 weeks of study.40 Because these TAF and TFV exposures were similar to those seen in adults, FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg was also approved by the FDA for use in this age and weight group, independent of the accompanying ARV drugs in the regimen (which may include a boosted PI or an INSTI ).2 The formulation of Biktarvy, which contains BIC 50 mg /FTC 200 mg/ TAF 25 mg , was administered to 50 children aged 6 years to <12 years and weighing 25 kg and 50 children and adolescents aged 12 years to <18 years and weighing 35 kg who had had viral loads <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months. The drug was well tolerated . All 50 participants in the study9 had viral loads <50 copies/m L at Week 24, and 49 participants had viral loads <50 copies/mL at Week 48 (see the Bictegravir section for details ). Drug Exposure and Safety: Aged 6 Years to <12 Y ears and Weighing 25 kg to <35 kg Studies of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF in children aged 6 years to <12 years who weigh ed 25 kg show ed that TAF and TFV exposures were somewhat higher than those found in adults (see Table C above ), but the drug combination was well tolerated and efficacious over 24 weeks of study.41,47 This led to FDA approval of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF for use in children aged 6 years and weighing 25 kg.8 Follow -up to 96 weeks in a small number of participants showed no change from baseline in the median spine BMD z-score , but there was a decline in the median total body BMD z-score , and a possible decline in the median estimated glomerular filtration rate .48 Because INSTIs do not inc rease TAF concentrations, regimens that include FTC /TAF 25 mg plus an INSTI are expected to result in safe drug exposures that are like those seen with coformulated EVG/ c/FTC/TAF 10 mg. This l ed the FDA to approve FTC/TAF 25 mg for use in children aged 6 years and weigh ing 25 kg when used in combination with other ARV drugs that do not include a boosted PI .2 Because boosted ATV, DRV , or LPV increase TAF exposure to concentrations that are higher than those seen wi th use of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF , and because no data exist on the use of this combination in children weighing <35 kg, the safety of FTC/TAF combined with COBI-boosted or RTV -boosted PIs in children weighing between 25 kg and <35 kg cannot be assured. Therefore, FDA approval for FTC/TAF used in combination with boosted PIs is limited to chi ldren weighing 35 kg (see Table A above ).2 Drug Exposure and Safety: Aged 2 Years and Weighing 14 kg to <25 kg Biktarvy tablets consisting of BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg were administered to children aged 2 years weighing 14 kg to <25 kg and who had viral loads <50 copies/mL on stable ART . At 24 weeks, the median change in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count was 100 cells/ mm3, and the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-33 change in CD4 percentage was +0.5%. HIV RNA at <50 copies/mL was maintained in 20 of the 22 participants at 24 weeks49 (see the Bictegravir section for details ). Dosing: Crushing Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir Alafenamide Tablets Viral load suppression was reported in one adult patient with HIV who received crushed FTC /TAF tablets plus crushed DTG tablets. The crushed tablets were mixed with water and administered via a gastrostomy tube . Each dose was followed by a can of a nutritional supplement. No PK parameters were measured.50 In adult s without HIV , the PKs of crushed DRV/c/FTC/TAF tablets showed decreased TAF bioavailability compared to whole tablets. The clinical implications of these findings are unc lear.51 Toxicity Bone TAF causes bone toxicity less frequently than TDF .27-29,32-35,52,53 For example , in one study of 1, 733 randomized adult participants with HIV, those treated with EVG/ c/FTC/TAF had a smaller decrease in BMD at the spine (mean change 1.30% vs . 2.86%; < 0.0001) vs . 2.95%; P < 0.0001) at 48 weeks than those given EV G/c/FTC/TDF .27 These differences were maintained until 96 week s.30 The clinical importance of these changes in BMD is unclear. Renal Studies in adolescents age d 12 to 17 years40 and adults27-29,32,33,35 show that TAF is less frequently associated with glomerular and renal tubular damage than TDF.54 For example , in one study of 1,733 randomized adult participants with HIV, those treated with EVG/ c/FTC/TAF had a smaller mean increase in serum mg/dL vs . those given EVC/ c/FTC/TDF , and a smaller percent change from baseline in urine protein to creatinine ratio (median % change 3% vs . +20%; P < 0.0001) at 48 week s.27 These differences persisted until 96 weeks of follow up.30 Safety of EVG/ c/FTC/TAF has been demonstrated in adults with estimated creatinine clearances between 30 mL/min and 69 mL/min.55 TAF may require less intense renal safety monitoring than TDF , but more experience with the drug in broad c linical practice will be needed before a specific recommendation can be made. Lipids In treatment -naive adults who were evaluated after 48 weeks of therapy, initiation of EVG/ c/FTC /TAF wa s associated with increases in serum lipids that were greater than those observed with the initiation of EVG/ c/FTC /TDF , with a mean increase in total cholesterol levels of 31 mg/dL versus 23 mg/dL , and a mean increase in LDL cholesterol levels of 16 mg/dL versus 4 mg/d L, respectively . In 48 adolescents who were treated wi th EVG/ c/FTC /TAF , the following median change s from baseline occurred at Weeks 24 and 36: Fasting total cholesterol levels increased 26 mg/ dL and 36 mg/ dL, respectively; fasting direct LDL levels increased 10 mg/dL and 17 mg/d L, respectively; and fasting triglycerides increased 14 mg/d L and 19 mg/d L, respectively.56 Similar TAF -related increases in total cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol levels have been found when TAF is administ ered with other combinations of ARV drugs .33 Monitoring serum lipids while the patient is ta king TAF -containing FDC tablet s is warranted , given these data (see Table 15b . Dyslipidemia for details ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-34 Weight Gain Observational data are limited and no randomized controlled trials have examined TAF -associated weight gain in children . In adults, greater weight gain has been reported with the use of TAF than with the use of TDF57-63 (see Table 15h. Lipodystrophies and Weight Gain for details ). Although weight gain at ART initiation might represent a \"return to health,\" 63 patients initiating treatment with TAF had larger increases in weight than those initiating treatment with TDF58,59; increases in weight and BMI have been observed in ARV switch studies , as well .60,63,64 In adults, the effect may be greatest in Black females ,59,63 especially if administered in combination with INSTI s.59,61 A study in adult women showed increased BMI with the switch to either an INSTI or TAF, but these BMI increases were only seen in persons with BMI <30 kg/ m2 at baseline .57 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-35 References 1.

Special Instructions TDF oral powder for mulation is available for patients who are unable to swallow tablets. TDF o ral powder should be measured only with the supplied dosing scoop: o ne level scoop = 1 g powder = TDF 40 mg. Mix TDF oral powder with 2 to 4 oz of soft food that does not require chewing (e.g., applesauce, yogurt) . Administer immediately after mixing to av oid the bitter taste. Do not try to mix the TDF oral powder with liquid. The powder may float on the top even after vigorous stirring. Although TDF can be administered without food, food requirements vary depending on the other ARV drugs contained in an FDC tablet . Food requirements are listed with dosing recommendations and in Appendix A, Table 2. Measure serum creatinine and perform a urine dipstick test for protein and glucose before starting a TDF -containing regimen. Serum creatinine should be monitored, and urine should be tested for protein and glucose at intervals during continued therapy (see Table 15i. Nephrotoxic Effects ). Measure serum phosphate if there is clinical suspicion of hypophosphatemia. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before using TDF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when TDF is discontinued; therefore, hepatic function should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking TDF . Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is associated with less bone and renal toxicity than TDF, but it has equal antiviral efficacy. Do not use TAF and TDF together . Consider switching from TDF to TAF in appropriate clinical settings.

Stribild should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Atripla, Symfi, and Symfi Lo should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; Symfi and Symfi Lo are not recommended for use in moderate or severe hepatic impairment. TDF Dosing in Patients with TDF is renally excreted. The dose of TDF should be decreased in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] <50 mL/min) . Consult the manufacturer's prescribing information for directions on how to adjust the dose in accordance with used in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min or in patients who requir e dialysis. The FDC Truvada should not be used in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min or in patients who requi re dialysis. The FDC Stribild should not be initiated in patients with estimated CrCl < 70 mL/min and should be discontinued in patients with estimated CrCl <50 mL/min.

Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is adenosine triphosphate - dependent transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein. When TDF is coadministered with i nhibitors of these transporters, an increase in TDF absorption may be observed, with the potential for enhanced TDF toxicity .1 Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion could reduce clearance of plasma tenofovir (TF V). Avoid frequent or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs in pa tients who are taking TDF . Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Didanosine (ddI) serum concentrations increase when th is drug is coadministered with TDF , and this combination should not be used because of the increased risk of ddI toxicity . Protease inhibitors (PIs): Atazanavir (ATV) be with TDF, because TDF decreases ATV plasma concentrations . The plasma concentrations has been found in pediatric patients in a multi -ethnic setting. The 400- mg dose of EFV may be too low in children or adolescents with SMR s of 1 to 3 who weigh 40 kg. Some members of The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV suggest therapeutic drug monitoring when Symfi Lo is used in pediatric patients weighing 40 kg.

If using Stribild, see the Elvitegravir section of Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for additional information. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence Less common ( more severe): TDF caused bone toxicity (osteomalacia and reduced bone mineral density [BMD]) in animals when given in high doses. Decreases in BMD have been reported in both adults and children taking TDF . Renal toxicity \u2014including serum phosphate \u2014has been observed. P atients at increased risk of renal glomerular or tubular dysfunction should be closely monitored. Cases of l actic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval TDF has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for use in children aged 2 years and weighing 10 kg when used as a component of antiretroviral therapy (ART ). TDF is available as a component of fixed-dose combination tablets (see Appendix A , Table 2 ). TDF has antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is approved by t he FDA for HBV treatment in children age d 2 years and weighing 10 kg. For a comprehensive review of this topic, see the Hepatitis B Virus section in the P ediatric Opportunistic Infection Guidelines . Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adults Compared with Children and Adolescents The standard adult dose that was approved by the FDA for adults and children aged 12 years and weigh ing 35 kg is TDF 300 mg once dai ly. For children age d 2 to 12 years , the FDA -approved dose is TDF 8 mg/ kg per dose administered once daily, which closely approximates the dose of TDF 208 mg/ m2 per dose used in early studies in children.3 In adults, the recommended once -daily dose of TDF 300 mg is highly effective when used in combination with other antiretroviral ( ARV) drugs .4-11 The FD A approved Cimduo and Temixys (both of which contain lamivudine [3TC ] 300 mg/ TDF 300 mg) and Sym fi (efavirenz [ EFV ] 600 mg /3TC 300 mg/ TDF 300 mg) based on results of prior clinical trials .5,12 FDA a pproval of Symfi Lo (EFV 400 mg /3TC 300 mg /TDF 300 mg) was based on a study that compar ed the use of Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-41 EFV 400 mg with the use of EFV 600 mg, each administered with emtricitabine 200 mg and TDF 300 mg, in 630 AR T-naive adult s.13 See the E favirenz section for a detailed discussion of this study. In children, the published efficacy data for TDF -containing ARV combinations are mixed, but potency equal to that in adults has been seen in pediatric patients aged 3 to 18 years with susceptible virus . In children age d 2 years to <12 years, TDF 8 mg/kg per dose once daily was to twice -daily zidovudine -containing ART or over 48 weeks of randomized treatment.14,15 Virologic success is lower in treatment -experienced patients with extensive multiclass drug resistance .16-18 Pharmacokinetics Relationship of Drug Exposure to Virologic Response Virologic suppression is most closely rela ted linked to plasma TFV concentration.19 A modeling study suggests that children and adolescents who are treated with TD F may have higher intracellular TFV -DP concentrations than adults ,20 even though plasma TFV concentrations are lower in children and adolescents , because weight -adjusted renal clearance of TFV is higher in children than in adults .3,21,22 Formulations Special Considerations The taste -masked granules that make up the TDF oral powder give the vehicle (e.g., applesauce, yogurt) a gritty consistency. Once mixed with a vehicle, TDF should be administered promptly because its taste becomes bitter when it is allowed to sit for too long. Toxicity Bone Toxicity TDF administration is associated with d ecreased BMD in both adult s23,24 and children.15,25-27 When treated with TDF, y ounger children with sexual m aturity r ating s (SMR s) of 1 and 2 may be at a higher risk of decreased BMD than children with more advanced pubertal development (i.e., SMR s 3).21 Discontinuation of TDF results in partial or complete recovery of BMD .25,28 In the study that led to FDA approval of TDF in adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg, 6 of 33 participants (18%) in the TDF arm ex perienced a >4% decline in absolute lumbar spine BMD in 48 weeks , whereas only 1 of 33 participants (3%) in the placebo arm experienced this decline .16 TDF administration disrupts vitamin D metabolism,29,30 and t he decrease in BMD associated with TDF initiation was attenuated in adults with coadministration of high doses of vitamin D 3 (4,000 International Units [IU ] daily) and calcium carbonate (1,000 mg daily) for the first 48 weeks of TDF treatment .31 During chronic TDF administration, youth with HIV who received vitamin D3 supplements (50,000 IU once monthly) had decreased serum parathyroid hormone levels and increased lumbar spine BMD compared with study participants who were not treated with high doses of vitamin D3.29,32 The serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D concentration was 37 ng/mL in the group with Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-42 improved BMD. Similar improvements in BMD were seen in youth with HIV who were treated with an ARV regimen that included TDF and who received vitamin D3 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU daily.33 Measurement of plasma vitamin D concentration is recommended for patients who are being treated with an ARV regimen that includes TDF , and vitamin D supplementation is recommended for those with vitamin D deficiency (see Table 15j. O steopenia and Osteoporosis ). High concentrations of the TDF metabolite plasma TFV have been associated with TDF -related endocrine disruption and low BMD .34 Plasma TFV concentrations are higher when TDF is coadministered with boosted PIs.1 Tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF), which is associated with lower plasma TFV concentrations than TDF, has less effect on parathyroid hormone levels35 and causes less decline in BMD than TDF . See the T enofovir A lafenamide section for more information. Consider switching from TDF to TAF or avoiding coadministration of TDF with boosted PI s in patients for whom loss of BMD is a concern. Monitoring Potential Bone Toxicity The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) does not recommend routine dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) monitoring for children or adolescents who are being treated with TDF (see Table 15j. Osteopenia and Osteoporosis ). TDF has been shown to be effective, and it can be administered once daily; however, the use of TDF has been associated with a risk of BMD loss. Because childhood and early adolescence are important periods of rapid bone accrual, and because children with perinatally acquired HIV are at risk for low peak bone mass,36,37 the Panel favors the use of abacavir or TAF over TDF in children with SMRs 1 to 3. Renal Toxicity New-onset renal impairment and worsening renal impairment ha ve been reported in adults38 and children39,40 receiving TDF . In one study, renal toxi city led to discontinuation of TDF in 6 of 159 (3.7%) children with HIV who were treated with TDF .18 Although TDF is clearly associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate, the effect is generally small, and severe glomerular toxicity is rare.38,39 Irreversible renal failure is quite rare , but cases ha ve been reported.41 The main target of TDF nephrotoxicity is the renal proximal tubule .39 Case reports highlight the infrequent but most severe manifestations of renal Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemia , hypocalcemia, diabetes an d fractures .42,43 Subclinical renal tubular damage is more common than clinically apparent renal tubular injury. Increased urinary beta -2 microglobulin was identified in 12 of 44 children (27%) who were treated with TDF and in 2 of 48 children (4%) who were not treated with TDF .44 The risks of TDF - associated proteinuria and chronic kidney disease increase with the duration of treatment.45,46 Of 89 participants aged 2 to 12 years who received TDF in Gilead Study 352 (where participant s had a median drug exposure of 104 weeks), four participants were discontinued from the study for renal tubular dysfunction, with the discontinuations occurring between 84 and 156 weeks on TDF therapy.14 In adults, renal dysfunction is more common when TDF is used in patients with older age or a pre -existing renal disease47; in children, renal dysfunction may be more common when TDF is used with boosted PI s than with non-nucleoside rever se transcriptase inhibitors .48 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-43 Plasma TFV is the TDF metabolite most closely associate d with both glomerular34,49 and proximal tubular50 toxicity . As previously noted, plasma TFV concentrations are higher when TDF is coadministered with boosted PIs.1 TAF , which generates lower plasma TFV concentrations than TDF, is associated with a lower risk of renal toxicity than TDF51 (see Tenofovir Alafenamide ). Monitoring Potential Renal Toxicity Because TDF has the potential to decrease creatinine clearance and cause renal tubular dysfunction, the Panel recommends measuring serum creatinine and using a urine dipstick to check protein and glucose concentration before initiati ng TDF . It is unclear how often creatinine and renal tubular function (urine protein and glucose) should be monitored in asymptomatic patients. Many Panel members monitor creatinine with other blood tests every 3 to 4 months and perform urinalysis every 6 to 12 months. Serum phosphate should be mea sured if clinically indicated; renal phosphate loss can occur in the presence of normal creatinine and in the absence of proteinuria. Because nephrotoxicity increases with the duration of TDF treatment , monitoring should be continue d during long -term thera py with the drug. Because renal glomerular damage primarily increases the concentration of albumin in urine and proximal renal tubular damage increases the concentration of low -molecular -weight proteins like beta-2 microglobulin in urine, dipstick urinalys is (which primarily measures urine albumin) may be a relatively insensitive marker for TDF -associated tubular damage. Measu ring urine albumin and urine protein and calculati ng the ratio of urine albumin to urine protein can be helpful in identifying the non-albumin proteinuria that is seen in TDF -associated nephrotoxicity.52,53 Although these more complex and expensive tests may be used in research settings, i n clinical practice, using a renal dipstick to identify normoglycemic glycosuria and proteinuria i s the easiest way to detect renal damage.

Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when 3TC is discontinued; therefore, hepatic function should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking 3TC. Metabolism/Elimination ZDV is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism. atients with Hepatic Impairment The dose of ZDV may need to be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment. Do not use FDC products (e.g., Combivir, Trizivir) in patients who have impaired hepatic function. Zidovudine Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment A dose adjustment is required for ZDV in patients with renal insufficiency. Do not use FDC products (e.g., Combivir, Trizivir) in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min and patients who are on hemodialysis.

Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents , including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, interferon a lfa, and ribavirin: These agents m ay increase the hematologic toxicity of antagonize in vitro antiviral of ZDV. Doxorubicin: Simultaneous use of doxorubicin and ZDV should be avoided. Doxorubicin may inhibit the phosphorylation of ZDV to its active form. Major Toxicities More common: Hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and anemia , particularly in patients with advanced H IV disease. Headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. N eutropenia may occur more frequently in infants who are receiving both lamivudine (3TC) and ZDV than in infants who are receiving only ZDV.1 Less common (more severe) : Myopathy (associated with prolonged use), myositis, and liver toxicity. Cases of l actic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Fat maldistribution. Rare: Possible increased risk of cardiomyopathy.2-4 Resistance The International A ntiviral Society -USA maintains a list of HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-49 Pediatric Use Approval ZDV is frequently included as a component of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI ) backbone for antiretroviral therapy (ART), and it has been studied in children in combination with other NRTIs , including abacavir (ABC) and 3TC.5-8 Pediatric experience with ZDV both for treat ing HIV and for preventi ng perinatal transmission is extensive . However, the mitochondrial toxicity of ZDV leads many experts to favor the use of ABC or tenofovir alafenamide in cases where the patient 's age and the results of viral resistance testing do not restrict the use of these drugs . Efficacy in Clinical Trials The combination of ZDV and 3TC has been extensively studied in children and has been a part of antiretroviral (ARV) regimens in many trials. The s afety and efficacy of ZDV plus 3TC w ere compared to the safety and efficacy of ABC plus 3TC and stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC in children aged <5 years in the CHAPAS -3 (Children with HIV in Africa Pharmacokinetics and Adherence of Simple antiretroviral regimens) study. All regimens also included eit her nevirapine or efavirenz. All the NRTIs had low toxicity and produced good clinical, immunologic, and virologic responses.9 A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of different dual -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbones used as part of combination ART.10-12 Infants with Perinatal HIV Exposure The Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) 076 clinical trial13 demonstrated that administering ZDV to pregnant women and their infants could reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission by nearly 70%. S ee Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal HIV Exposure or HIV Infection for further discussion o n using ZDV to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV. A dose of approximately ZDV 4 mg/kg of body weight every 12 hours is recommended for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission in neonates and infants with gestational age s 35 weeks . Infants who have been exposed to HIV but who are uninfected should continue on the prophylactic dose for 4 weeks to 6 weeks , depending on the ir gestation al age at time of delivery and the risk assessment for perinatal transmission. Simplified , alternative weight -band dosing has also been developed, and the rationale for these doses is based on the intracellular metabolism of ZDV (see Pharmacokinetics below ). The rate -limiting step in the phosphorylation of ZDV to active ZDV triphosphate is the limited amount of thymidylate kinase. Increasing the dose of ZDV will lead to increased ZDV plasma concentrations and increased intracellular concentrations of but not infants who receiv to prevent perinatal transmission, levels of intracellular ZDV metabolites measured after delivery. Plasma ZDV and intracellular ZDV monophosphate decreased by roughly 50% between post -delivery Day 1 and Day 28, whereas ZDV diphosphate and ZDV triphosphate remained low throughout the sampling period.14 ZDV dose is poorly correlated with the active form of ZDV that is found intracellularly. Because of this, a simplified weight -band dosing approach can be used for the first 4 weeks of life in infants with gestational ages 35 weeks (see the dosing table above ). This approach should simplify the minor dose adjustments that are commonly made based on changes in infant weight during ZDC use in the first 4 weeks of life and will make it easier for caregivers to administer ZDV oral syrup to their infants. The changes in Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-50 weight and the small differences in ZDV dose will have minor effects on the intracellular concentrations of ZDV triphosphate. Infants with HIV Infection The Early Infant Treatment Study in Botswana evaluated the safety and efficacy of initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the first week of life. Forty infants who tested positive for HIV within 96 hours of birth were started on ZDV, 3TC, and nevirapine ( LPV/r ) at 2 to 5 weeks after delivery. Early treatment was found to be safe and effective , with most infants achieving and maintaining viral suppression by 24 weeks of age.15 For full -term neonates who receive an HIV diagnosis during the first days to weeks of life , the ZDV dose should be increased to the continuation dose at age 4 weeks (see the dosing table above ). The activity of the enzymes responsible for glucuronidation is low at birth and increases dramatically during the first 4 to 6 weeks of life in full -term neonates. This increase in metabolizing enzyme activity lead s to an increased clearance of plasma ZDV , and the dose of ZDV should be adjusted when ZDV is used to treat HIV after the first 4 weeks in full -term infants . For premature infants who receive an HIV diagnosis , the time to increase the ZDV dose from the initial dose varies with post -gestational age and the clinical status of the neonate . On the basis of population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulations and data from studies that have evaluated ZDV PK s in premature infants, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommends the following: For infants with HIV born at 30 weeks to <35 weeks, switch to a dose of ZDV 12 mg/kg twice daily at a post -gestational age of 6 weeks to 8 wee ks. For infants born at <30 weeks , switch to ZDV 12 mg/kg twice daily at a post -gestational age of 8 weeks to 10 weeks.16 Clinicians shoul d perform a careful clinical assessment of the infant, evaluate hepatic and renal function, and review concomitant medications before increasing the ZDV dose to the dose recommended for full -term infants. Pharmacokinetics ZDV undergoes intracellular metabolism to achieve its active in pediatric patients aged >3 months are like those seen in adults. Although the mean half -life of intracellular ZDV triphosphate (9.1 hours) is considerably longer than that of unmetabolized ZDV in plasma (1.5 hours), once -daily ZDV dosing is not recommended because of the low intracellular ZDV triphosphate concentrations seen with 600- mg, once -daily dosing in adolescents .17 PK studies, such as PACTG 331, demonstrate that dose adjustments are necessary for premature infants because they have reduced clearance of ZDV compared with the clearance observed in term newborn s of similar postnatal age s.6 ZDV has good central nervous system (CNS) (cerebrospinal fluid-to -plasma concentration ratio is 0.68), and ZDV has been used in children with HIV -related CNS disease.8 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-51 PK and safety of ZDV, 3TC, and LPV/r in children living with HIV and severe acute malnutrit ion (SAM) was studied in International Maternal, Pediatric, Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT ) P1092.18 Steady -state PK, safety, and tolerability was compared in children with HIV with and without SAM. Overall safety and tolerability did not differ between the two cohorts and similar area- under- the-curve values for ZDV, 3TC, and LPV/r were observed in these children who were dosed according to W orld H ealth O rganization weight -band dosing recommendations.18 Toxicity Several studies suggest that t he adverse hematologic effects of ZDV may be concentration- dependent, with a higher risk of anemia and neutropenia in patients with higher mean plasma area- under-the -curve values for ZDV.5,6,19 A significant reduction in the incidence of hematologic toxicity was observed during a retrospective analysis of infants who received a short course of ZDV (2 weeks) to prevent perinatal HIV transmission.20 In this study, 137 infants received ZDV for 2 weeks, and 184 infants received ZDV for > 2 weeks ; of these infants, 168 (91.3%) received 4 weeks of ZDV prophylaxis. The r isk of anemia (defined as a Division of AIDS [DAIDS ] severity gr ade of mild or higher) was significantly lower in the short -course group at both age 1 month ( P < 0.001) and age 3 months ( P < 0.001).20 Some nationa l guidelines , including those from Germany /Austria and Great Britain , recommend a minimum of 2 weeks of post -exposure prophylaxis in infants at low risk or very low risk of HIV transmission.21 Current U .S. guidelines recommend 4 weeks of prophylaxis for infants at low risk of HIV transmission. For infants who develop significant anemia while receiving ZDV for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission, early discontinuation may be considered for infants who a re determined to be at a low risk of transmission after expert consultation. A recent study conducted in Thailand evaluated the safety of triple antiretroviral neonatal presumptive therapy with ZDV/3TC/ nevirapine for 6 weeks in infants at high risk of acqu isition of HIV compared with 4 weeks of mono therapy with ZD V in infants considered at low risk. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of neutropenia, hepatoxicity, or severe anemia between the triple antiretroviral and the ZDV monotherapy groups .22 Incidence of hematologic al toxicity was investigated in t he ARROW study, which randomized ART - naive Ugandan and Zimbabwean children to receive either ZDV-containing regimens or ABC - containing regimens . The incidence of severe anemia was similar regardless of ZDV use , and this finding suggests that advanced HIV disease contributed to low hemoglobin values. Z DV use was associated with severe neutropenia in a small number of children.23 In a retrospective study conducted in Ethiopia, an evaluation of predictors of anemia among children on ART24 was conducted for the time period of 2007 to 2017. Study participants receiving ZDV -containing regimens were four times more likely to develop anemia than those children r eceiving ABC- containing regimens. Other predictors of anemia in addition to ZDV in this patient population included tuberculosis, severe immunosuppression, and undernutrition. ZDV is associated with greater mitochondrial toxicity than ABC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , but it is associated with less mitochondrial toxicity than d4T .25,26 Although the incidence of cardiomyopathy associated with perinatal HIV infection has decreased dramatically since the use of ART became routine , the use of a regimen that contains ZDV may increase the risk.2,4 Analysis of data from a U.S.-based , multicenter , prospective cohort study (PACTG 219/219C) found that ongoing ZDV exposure was independently associated with a higher rate of cardiomyopathy.2 As part of t he Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS)/Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP) study, echocardiogram measurements were collected between 2008 and 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-52 in 325 youth aged 7 to 16 years with perinatally acquired HIV infection. A n association between ZDV use and increased end -systolic wall stress was observed in this study. The investigators speculate that a lterations in cardiac structure in these children could progress to symptomatic cardiomyopathy later in life.3 A large cohort study to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction in children and young adults <26 years of age was conducted in Kenya .4 Approximately 28% of participants were found to have evidence of early cardiac dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction negatively correlated with prior ZDV exposure , detectable HIV RNA, and elevated interleukin -6 concentrations.4 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-53 References 1.

Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Child and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose DOR 100 mg once daily in antiretroviral (ARV) -naive patients and ARV- experienced patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations asso ciated with resistance and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily in ARV- naive patients and ARV- experienced patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of D elstrigo Nausea Abdominal pain Diarrhea Abnormal dreams Insomnia, s omnolence Special Instructions DOR can be taken with or without food . Do not use DOR with other non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. When DOR is coadministered with rifabutin, the dose should be increased from DOR 100 mg once daily to DOR 100 mg twice daily . When DOR/3TC/TDF (Delstrigo ) is coadministered with rifabutin, an additional 100-mg dose of freestanding DOR needs to be administered approximately 12 hour s later. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before us ing Delstrigo, which contains 3TC and TDF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV can occur when 3TC or TDF are discontinued; therefore, hepatic function and HBV viral load should be monitored for several months after halting therapy with 3TC or TDF. Metabolism /Elimination DOR is metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-56 DOR has multiple interactions with several drugs (see Drug Interactions section below ). Doravirine Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. D OR has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment . Doravirine Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Dose adjustment is not required when using DOR in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment . DOR use has not been studied in patients with end- stage renal disease or in patients on dialysis. DOR administered with 3TC and TDF as components of Delstrigo is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Doravirine (DOR ) is a cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A substrate that is associated with several important drug interactions with drugs that are strong CYP 3A enzyme inducers. Coadministration with these drugs may cause significant decreases in DOR plasma concentrations and potential decrease s in efficacy, which can lead to the development of resistance. Before DOR is administe red, a patient's medication profile should be review ed carefully for potential drug interactions with DOR .1,2 DOR should not be coadministered with nevirapine.3,4 In a Phase 1 trial (described below under Efficacy in Clinical Trials ), DOR plasma ex posure transiently decreased by 62% when DOR was started immediately after stopping EFV . A post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 DRIVE -SHIFT study (described below under E fficacy in Clinical Trials ), however, showed that at Week 4, DOR plasma levels in patients who had switched from an EFV -based regimen to a DOR -based regimen were similar to DOR plasma levels in patients who switch ed from a protease inhibitor ( PI)-based regimen to a DOR -based regimen (all of the regimens in the study used a backbone of lamivudine [3TC] plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF ]).5 A similar EFV -based ART on the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of DOR w as demonstrated in IMPAACT 2014 (described below under Efficacy in Clinical Trials) among adolescent s weighing 45 kg who switched from EFV -based ART to DOR -based ART with 3TC/TDF .6,7 DOR should not be coadministered with the following : the anticonvulsants John's wort.3,4 Drug interactions between DOR and rifabutin induce the metabolism of DOR and require an additional dose of DOR 100 mg to be administered 12 hours after a fixed -dose combination of DOR/3TC/TDF or an increas e of the DOR dose to 100 mg twice daily.2-4 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-57 Major Toxicities More common: Nausea , headache, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormal dreams Less common (more severe): Neuropsychiatric adverse events (AEs) , including insomnia, somnolence, and altered sensorium . Immune reconstitution i nflammatory syndrome may occur . Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. DOR is expected to have activity against HIV with isolated NNRTI resistance that is associated with mutations at positions 103, 181, or 190. S ome single mutations and combinations of viral mutations , however, have been shown to significantly decrease suscepti bility to DOR . Specifically, clinical HIV isolates containing the Y188L mutation alone or in combinations with K103N or V106I, combinations of V106A with G190A and or to DOR .3,4 In patients with multiple NNRTI mutations, consult an HIV expert and a resistance database to evaluate the potential efficacy of DOR . Pediatric Use Approval DOR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in children or adolescents weighing 35 kg .3,4 IMPAACT 2014 , an ongoing Phase 1/ 2 study ( described below under Efficacy in Clinical Trials ), is evaluating the PKs, safety, and tolerability of DOR and DOR /3TC/ TDF in children and adolescents with HIV.(Best, Yee, et al. 2019, Melvin, Best, et al. 2021) Efficacy in Clinical Trials The efficacy of DOR was evaluated using data from four randomiz ed adult clinical trials. The first study was a Phase 2b dose-selection , double -blind trial that enrolled treatment -naive adults with HIV.8 The efficacy trials included two randomized, multicenter, double -blind, active -controlled Phase 3 trials -FORWARD and DRIVE -AHEAD) active -controlled, randomized, noninferiority trial enrolled virologically suppressed adults on antiretroviral t herapy ( DRIVE -SHIFT ).12 The dose -selection trial enrolled treatment-na ive adults stratified by HIV RNA level at screening (100,000 copies/mL or >100,000 copies/m L) and randomized participants to receive one of four different doses (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg , or 200 mg) of once -daily DOR or EFV 600 mg with open- label emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg/TDF 300 mg. After dose selection at Week 24, all participants were switched to DOR 100 mg and, with additional enrollment, 216 participants were randomized to receiv e once -daily DOR 100 mg (n = 108) or EFV 600 mg (n = 108) for 96 weeks with FTC /TDF . At Week 24, 72.9% of participants on DOR 100 mg and 73.1% of participants on EFV 600 mg had HIV RNA <40 copies/mL.8 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-58 In DRIVE -FORWARD, adult subjects received either DOR 100 mg (n = 383) or darunavir 800 mg /ritonavir 100 mg ( DRV/r ) (n = 383) once daily, each in combination with FTC /TDF or abacavir/3TC.9 In DRIVE -AHEAD, adult subjects received either coformulated DOR /3TC/TDF (n = 364) or EFV /FTC/TDF (n = 364) once daily.10 An integrated efficacy analysis from both trials (DRIVE -FORWARD and DRIVE -AHEAD) at W eek 48 demonstrated that 84.1% of patients who were treated with the DOR -based regimen achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL , compared with 79.9% of patients who were treated with the DRV/r -based regimen and 80.8% of patients who were treated with EFV /FTC/TDF . Results were similar across different baseline viral loads, genders , race s, and HIV-1 subtype s.10 At Week 96 in the DRIVE -FORWARD trial, 277 (95%) of 292 participants who remained on DOR maintained viral suppression (that is, 73% of the overall 383 participants), whereas 248 (91%) of 273 participants who remained on DRV/r maintained viral suppression (that is, 66% of the overall 383 participants).11 In the DRIVE -SHIFT study , adult subjects with HIV who were virologically suppressed for 6 months on two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a boosted PI , boosted elvitegravir or on a n NNRTI were randomized to switch to a once -daily, single -tablet regimen of DOR 100 mg /3TC 300 mg/ TDF 300 mg or to c ontinue their current therapy (baseline regimen) . At Week 24, 93.7% on DOR/3TC/TDF versus 94.6% on baseline r egimen had HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL (difference 0.9 [ 4.7 to 3.0]). At Week 48, 90.8% on DOR/3TC/TDF had HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL, demonstrating noninferiority versus baseline r egimen at W eek 24 (difference 3.8 [ 7.9 to 0.3]).12 Participants were switched on Day 1 (immediate -switch group [ISG]; n = 447) or at Week 24 (delayed-switch group [DSG]; n = 209). Long-term efficacy in the extension arm at Week 144 showed virologic suppression (HIV RNA <50 copies/m L) in 80.1% of ISG (351 out of 438) and 83.7% of DSG (175 out of 209) in FDA snapshot (intent -to-treat) analysis.13 IMPAACT 2014 study data in ARV -naive or ARV- experienced virologically suppressed adolescents suggest favorable antiviral effect comparable to adult data.(Melvin, Best et al. 2021) A total of 45 participants, 43 virologically suppressed (50% on EFV -based ART) and 2 ARV -naive adolescents with m ean age 15 years (12-17 years), were treated with DOR/3TC/TDF. At Week 24, 42 out of 45 (93.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 81.7-98.6) achieved or maintained HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL in FDA snapshot (intent -to-treat) analysis, while 42 out of 43 (97.7%; 95% CI, 87.7-99.9) achieved or maintained HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL in observed failure (on- treatment) analysis .7 Pharmacokinetics The PKs of DOR have been evaluated in treatment- naive adults aged 18 years and both treatment - naive and treatment -experienced adolescent s. A Phase 2 trial evaluat ed DOR across a dose range of 0.25 times to 2 times the recommended dose in treatment -naive participants with HIV who also received FTC /TDF. No exposure -response relationship for efficacy was reported for DOR .10 Toxicity In trials that compa red DOR -based regimens and EFV -based regimens, central nervous system (CNS) AEs (dizziness, sleep disorder and disturbances, and altered sensorium) occurred less frequently among the patients who received DOR than among those who received EFV . In the dose - finding trial , CNS AEs were reported in 26.9% of patients on DOR -based regimen s, compared with 47.2% of patients on EFV -based regimens at W eek 24.8 In the integrated safety analysis from the DRIVE -FORWARD and DRIVE -AHEAD trials , 25.5% of patie nts on DOR -based regimens Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-59 experienced CNS AEs at Week 48 , compared with 55.9% of patients on EFV -based regimes .10,14 Neither DRIVE -FORWARD nor DRIVE -AHEAD included an integrase strand transfer inhibitor- based regimen as an active control. Fewer participants who received DOR -based regimens experienced diarrhea than those treated with DRV/ r-based regimen s (12.4% vs . 22.5%, respectively). In the DRIVE -SHIFT study , among adults who were re ceiving a ritonavir-boosted PI at study entry, mean reductions in fasting low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high -density lipoprotein cholesterol at Week 24 we re significantly greater in people who received DOR /3TC/ TDF compared with the baseline PI -based regimen with 3TC /TDF (P < 0.0001).12 The reduction in fasting lipids w as maintained through Week 144 in the extension arm of the DRIVE -SHIFT study.13 Similarly, the 9 6 weeks of data from the DRIVE -FORWARD trial support ed greater mean reduction s in low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (14.6 mg/dL [95% CI, 18.2 -density (18. 4 mg/dL [95% CI, 22.5 to 14.3]) among participants in the DOR arm than among those in the DRV/r arm.11 In the IMPAACT 2014 study of 43 treatment -experienced and 2 ARV -naive adolescents aged 12 to <18 years on DOR/3TC/TDF at Week 24, there were no grade 4 AEs, serious AEs , or premature study discontinuation due to AEs. The s ingle drug-related Grade 1 AE was dizziness , and nine participants had the following drug-unrelated Grade 3 AEs : increased alanine aminotransferase (n = 1); increased creatinine with decreased estimated rate (eGFR ( n = 1); diarrhea (n = 1); and increased blood pressure (n = 4).7 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-60 References 1.

Pediatric Dose EFV capsules can be opened and the contents used as a sprinkle preparation for infants and children who are unable to swallow capsules. Infants and Children Aged 3 Months to <3 Years and Weighing 3.5 kg The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (t he Panel ) does not recommend the use of EFV in children aged 3 months to <3 years due to highly variable pharmacokinetics in this age group. If the use of EFV is unavoidable due to a clinical situation, the Panel suggests using investigational doses of EFV in this age group (see Table A in the Pharmacokinetics and Dosing: Infants and Children Aged <3 Years section below). Rash, which is generally mild and transient Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms , such as fatigue, poor sleeping patterns, ins omnia, vivid dreams, impaired concentration, agitation, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation, late -onset ataxia, and encephalopathy Gynecomastia Use EFV may produce false- positive results with some cannabinoi d and benzodiazepine tests. Special Instructions EFV capsule s and tablet s can be swallowed whole, or EFV capsules can be administered by sprinkling the contents of an opened capsule on food as described below. Bedtime dosing is recommended, particularly during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, to improve tolerability of CNS side effects.

Capsules may be administered by sprinkling the contents o nto an age- appropriate food (see Special Instructions below ). b Some experts recommend a dose of EFV 367 mg per m2 of body surface area (maximum dose 600 mg) due to concerns about underdosing at the upper end of each weight band (see the Pediatric Use section below for details). Weight bands approximate a dose of EFV 367 mg per m2 of body surface area, with a maximum dose of 600 mg. Child and Adolescent (Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose EFV 600 mg once daily Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF) Child and Adolescent (Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily Take on an empty stomach. [Symfi] Efavirenz 600 mg /Lamivudine /TDF Child and Adolescent (Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily Take on an empty stomach. [Symfi Lo] Efavirenz 400 mg /Lamivudine /TDF Child and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily Take on an empty stomach. Note : Symfi Lo has not been studied in children (sexual m aturity ratings [SMR s] 1-3), and major interindividual variability in EFV plasma concentrations has been found in pediatric patients in a multiethnic setting. The 400- mg dose of EFV may be too low in children or adolescents with SMR s 1 to 3 who weigh 40 kg. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring is suggested by some Panel members when Symfi Lo is used in pediatric Administer EFV, Atripla, Symfi , or Symfi Lo on an empty stomach. Avoid administration with a high- fat meal because this has the potential to increase absorption. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautions that EFV should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy because of potential teratogenicity. However, after a review of updated evidence regarding teratogenicity risks, the Perinatal Guidelines do not restrict use of EFV in female adolescent s and adults who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. Instructions for Us ing the Efavirenz Capsule as a Sprinkle Preparation with Food or Formula Hold capsule horizontally over a small container and carefully twist open to avoid spillage. Gently mix ca psule contents with 1 to 2 teaspoons of an age-appropriate soft food (e.g., applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt) or reconstituted infant formula at room temperature. Administer within 30 minutes of mixing and do not consume additional food or formula for 2 hours after administration. Metabolism/Elimination Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 variability in EFV exposure can be explained in part by polymorphisms in CYP, particularly CYP2B6 polymorphisms. Slower metabolizers are at higher risk of toxicity . See the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring section below for information about the management of mild or moderate toxicity. Efavirenz Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment EFV is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Atripla , Symfi , and Symfi Impairment Because Atripla, Symfi, and Symfi Lo are FDC products containing TDF, lamivudine, and/or emtricitabine that require dose adjustment s based on renal function, they should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min or in patients on dialysis. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-61 patients who weigh 40 kg (see the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring section below) . Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism : Coa dministration of efavirenz (EFV) with drugs that are primarily metabolized 450 (CYP) 2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, or CYP3A isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drugs. Drugs that induce CYP3A and CYP2B6 activity would be expected to increase the clearance of EFV , resulting in lower plasma concentrations. There is potential for multiple drug interactions with EFV . Importantly, dose adjustment or the addition of ritonavir may be necessary when EFV is used in combination with atazanavir (ATV) , lopinavir/ritonavir or maraviroc (MVC). Before EFV is administered, a patient's medication profile should be reviewed carefully for potential drug interactions with EFV . Corrected QT (QTc ) prolongation has been observe d with the use of EFV .1,2 An alternative to EFV should be considered in patients who are recei ving a drug that has a known risk of Torsades de Pointes or in patients who are at higher risk of Torsades de Pointes. Major Toxicities More common: Skin rash, increased transaminase levels. Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities \u2014such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, abnormal thinking, impaired concentration, amnesia, agitation, depersonalization, hallucinations, euphoria, and seizures \u2014have been reported , primarily in adults . See Table 15a . Antiretroviral Therapy- Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations \u2014Central Nervous System Toxicity for information on managing these toxicities . Rare : QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of EFV , and Torsades de Pointes has been reported with EFV use .3 An association between EFV and suicidal ideation, suicide, and attempted suicide (especially among those with a history of mental illness or substance abuse) was found in one retrospective analysis of four comparative trials in adults. This association, however, was not found in analyses of two large observational cohorts. Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA mai ntains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of eac h mutation . Pediatric Use Approval EFV has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as part of antiretroviral ( ARV) therapy in children aged 3 months and weighing 3.5 kg. T he FDA has also Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-62 approved the use of Symfi Lo, the fixed-dose combination of EFV 300 mg /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg, in children weighing 35 kg. Efficacy in Clinical Trials EFV-based regimens have proven virologically superior or noninferior to a variety of regimens in adults, including those to be inferior to dolutegravir (DTG) in the SINGLE trial in adults, which compared the virologic response of DTG plus abacavir/ 3TC with the virologic response of EFV /TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) at Weeks 48 and 144. The differences were most likely due to more drug discontinuations in the EFV group.11 In clinical trials in adults and children with HIV, EFV used in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been associated with excellent virologic response. F DA approval of Symf i (EFV 600 mg/ 3TC/TDF) wa s based on the results from a clinical trial that compared the use of T DF with the use of stavudine when each drug was administered with 3TC and EFV .12 This trial showed that these regimens were si milarly effective. The 96- week results of the Evaluation of Novel Concepts in Optimization of antiRetroviral Efficacy (E NCORE) 1 trial, a randomized trial in adults, showed that EFV 400 mg used in combination with TDF and FTC was noninferior to EFV 600 mg used in combination with TDF and FTC .13 EFV used in combination either with two NRTIs or with an NRTI and a protease inhibitor has been studied in children and has shown virologic potency and safety comparable to what has been seen in adults.14-16 FDA approval of Symfi Lo wa s based on a comparison between EFV 400 mg and EFV 600 mg, both taken with FTC 200 mg plus TDF 300 m g in 630 ARV -naive adult participants with a mean age of 36 years (range 18 -69 years ). Sixty -eight percent of participants were male, 37% were of African heritage, 33% were of Asian ethnicity, 17% were Hispanic , and 13% were White . This study showed similar rates of viral load suppression and toxicities among participants in each group.13 Because EFV clearance is related to age and CYP2B6 polymorphisms, and because allele frequency varies by ethnicity , some members of the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) suggest using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) when using Symfi Lo in pediatric patients weighing 40 kg. Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacogenomics Genetic polymorphisms in the genes that code for enzymes involved in the metabolism of EFV may alter enzyme activity, which causes a high degree of interpatient variability in drug exposure. CYP2B6 is the primary enzyme for EFV metabolism, and pediatric patients with the CYP2B6-516- T/T genotype have reduced metabolism, resulting in higher EFV levels in these patients than in those with the G/G or G/T genotype s.17-20 The CYP2B6-516 -T/T allele frequency varies by ethnicit y. In a study of adults from the United States and Italy, this allele ha d a frequency of 24.4% among White study participants , a frequency of 31.3% among Black study participants , and a frequency of 34.9% among Hispanic study participants.21 A retrospective study of pediatric patients in a multiethnic, high-income setting c onfirmed that EFV plasma concentrations can vary among patients. The interindividual variability could be explained in large part by polymorphisms in drug metabolizing genes, as well as by age at treatment initiation and time since treatment initiation.22 International Material Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials ( IMPAACT ) P1070 has shown that aggressive dosing with approximately 40 mg/ kg of EFV using opened capsules resulted in therapeutic EFV concentrations in 58% of children aged <3 years with the G/G or G/T genotype s, but excessive Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-63 exposure occurred in those with the T/T genotype.23 Optimal dosing may require pretreatment <3 years (see Phar macokinetics and Dosing: Infants and Children Aged < 3years discussion below).20,23 Other variant s, CYP2B6 alleles and variant CYP2A6 alleles , have been found to influence EFV concentrations in adults and children.20,24 -27 Pharmacokinetics and Dosing: Infants and Children Aged <3 Years The Panel does not recommend the use of EFV in children aged 3 months to <3 years. Limited pharmacokinetic ( PK) data in children aged <3 years or weighing <13 kg have shown that it is difficult to achieve target trough concentrations in this age group.18,28 These data show age-related differences in absorption and the impact of formulation on EFV PKs.19 Also, hepatic enzyme activity is known to change with age. Using a pharmacometric model, the increase in oral clearance of EFV as a function of age is predicted to reach 90% of mature value by a ge 9 months.19 This maturation of oral clearance is postulated to result from an increase in the expression of CYP2B6 with age.19 The CYP2B6-516-G/G genotype is associated with the greatest expression of hepatic CYP2B6 when compared with the CYP2B6-516-G/T or -T/T genotype.17 In children with the CYP2B6-516-G/G genotype, the oral clearance rate of EFV has been shown to be higher in children aged <5 years than in older children.17 Efficacy data for opened capsules with contents used as a sprinkle preparation suggest acceptable palatability and bioavailability for infants and children aged <3 years; however, the difficulty ass ociated with sprinkling the contents of opened capsules contributes to the variability of PK measures in this age group. IMPAACT P1070 studied children aged <3 years with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) coinfection using doses of EFV that were determined by band based on /G G/T genotypes were considered extensive metabolizers (EM s), and children with T/T genotypes were considered slow metabolizers (SMs ) (see Table A below). When doses were used without regard to genotype, a dose of approximately 40 mg/kg per day resulted in therapeutic EFV concentrations in an increased proportion of study participants with G/G or G/T genotypes but excessive exposure in a high proportion of participants with T/T genotypes. This dose is higher than the FDA -approved dose of EFV . 23 Therefore, doses were modified so that infants and young children with the T/T genotype received a reduced dose. The doses listed for P1070 in Table A are investigational. A recent study evaluated the PKs of EFV in children aged <3 years who had TB/HIV coinfection and were receiving anti -TB treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The findings from this the use of CYP2B6-516 genotype -directed EFV dosing and showed that, in general, the EFV weight -band dose did not need to be modified further for children aged <24 m onths. Dosing for children aged 24 to 36 months requires further investigation.29 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-64 Investigational Dosing for Children Aged 3 Months to <3 Years b y CYP2B6 Genotype Table A. Comparison of Efavirenz Doses Used in P1070 and the FDA- Recomm ended Doses Weight Protocol Dosing for Children Aged Months to <3 Years (Without Regard to CYP2B6 Genotype) 5 kg to <7 kg 300 mg 50 mg 150 mg 7 kg to <7.5 kg 400 mg 100 mg 150 mg 7.5 kg to <10 kg 400 mg 100 mg 200 mg 10 kg to <14 kg 400 mg 100 mg 200 mg 14 kg to <15 kg 500 mg 150 mg 200 mg 15 kg to 17 kg 500 mg 150 mg 250 mg a Investigational doses are based on the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT ) study P1070.23,29 Evaluation of CYP2B6 genotype is required before initiating efavirenz (EFV) . Therapeutic drug level monitoring is recommended, with a trough concentration measured 2 weeks after initiati ng EFV and again at age 3 years for a possible dose adjustment. Key: CYP = cytochrome P450; EM = extensive metabolizer; slow metabolizer The FDA -approved doses of EFV for use in infants and children aged 3 months to <3 years were derived from a population PK model that was based on data from older subjects in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) 1021 and PACTG 382, as well as from data collected during AI266-922, a study that assessed the PK s, safety, and efficacy of using capsule sprinkles in children aged 3 months to 6 years (see Table A ). The FDA -approved doses are lower than the CYP2B6 EM doses and higher than the CYP2B6 SM doses from the P1070 study. PK modeling, based on P1070 PK data, was used to generate estimates of the percentage of participants who were likely to reach therapeutic EFV target concentrations on FDA -indicated doses, according to the participants' genotypes .23 The study reported that an estimated one -third of EM children who received the FDA - approved dose would experience subtherapeutic EFV exposures, and more than half of SM children who received the FDA -approved dose would have area under the curve (AUC) values that were above the target range. The Panel does not recommend use of EFV in children aged 3 months to <3 years. If the clinical situation demands the use of EFV , the Panel recommends determining CYP2B6 genotype prior to use (see a list of laboratories that perform this test ). Patients should be classified as extensi ve metabolizers to guide dosing, as indicated by the investigational doses from IMPAACT study P1070 (see Table A). Whether the doses used are investigational or approved by the F DA, EFV plasma concentrations should be measured 2 weeks after initiating EFV (see the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring section below). The mid -dose EFV plasma concentration target of 1.0 mg/L to 4.0 mg/L derived from adult clinical monitoring data also , typically , is applied to trough concentrations. A study of 128 African children (aged 1.7-13.5 years) suggests that the concentration at 2 4 hours (C 24h) threshold for increased risk of unsuppressed viral load30 is C 24h 0.65 mg/L. Consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV infection is recommended before adjusting the dose. In addition, when Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-65 following the P1070 investigational dose recommendations, some experts would measure EFV concentrations at age 3 years before transitioning the child to the recommended dose for children aged 3 years. Pharmacokinetics: Children Aged 3 Years and Adolescents Even with the use of FDA -approved pediatric dosing in children aged 3 years, EFV concentrations can be suboptimal.17,31 -35 Therefore, some experts recommend using TDM in patients who are receiving EFV and possibl y using higher doses in young children, especially in certain clinical situations , such as virologic rebound or lack of response in an adherent patient. In one study in which the EFV dose was adjusted in response to measurement of the AUC, the median administered dose was EFV 13 mg/kg (367 mg per m2 of body surface area ), and the range was from 3 mg/kg to 23 mg/kg (69 -559 mg per m2 of body surface area ).36 Toxicity: Children V ersus Adults The toxicity profile for EFV differs for adults and children. One adverse effect (AE) commonly seen in children is rash, which was reported in up to 40% of children and 27% of adults.37 The r ash is usually maculopapular, pruritic, mild to moderate in severity, and rarely requires drug discontinuation. Onset is typically during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Although severe rash and Stevens -Johnson syndrome have been reported, they are rare. Multiple studies in adults have shown t hat EFV use is associated with low v itamin D levels , and several studies have found an association between EFV use and low bone mineral density.38-41 Efavirenz induces CYP3A4 and CYP24 en zymes that may affect v itamin D homeostasis . Because of these f indings, t he Panel recommends measurement of vitamin D in patien ts receiving EFV and vitamin D supplementation for those with v itamin D deficiency (see Table 15j.Osteopenia and Osteoporosis ). In adults, CNS symptoms are commonly reported a nd affect ed 29.6% of patients in one meta - analysis of randomized trials.42 These symptoms usually occur early in treatment and rarely require drug discontinuation, but they sometimes can persist for months. Administering EFV at b edtime appea rs to decrease the occurrence and severity of these neuropsychiatric AEs . For patients who can swallow capsules or tablets, ensuring that EFV is taken on an empty stomach also reduces the occurrence of neuropsychiatric AEs. In several studies, the incidenc e of neuropsychiatric AEs was correlated with EFV plasma concentrations, and the symptoms occurred more frequently in patients with higher concentrations.43-46 The ENCORE1 study in adults demonstrated that a dose of EFV 400 mg is associated with fewer AEs and a noninferior virologic response when compared with the recommended 600 -mg dose of EFV .13,47 A Tanzanian study of children aged 6 to 12 years showed that those who were receiving EFV , especially dose s of EFV that were high er than or equal to those recommended by the World H ealth O rganization, had more anxiety and more difficulty concentrating at school than children who were receiving alternative ARV medications.48 Adverse CNS events occurred in 14% of children who received EFV in clinical studies49 and in 30% including ataxia and encephalopathy, may occur months to years after initiating EFV. Some events of late -onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients with certain CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms who received standard doses of EFV. These polymorphisms have been associated with slow metabolism of EFV and increased EFV levels (see the package insert for EFV ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-66 An association between EFV and suicidal ideation, suicide, and attempted suicide (especially among those with a history of mental illness or substance abuse) wa s found in a retrospective analysis of four comparative trials in adults and in the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START ) Trial, a prospective analysis of adults.51,52 This association, however, was not found in the analyses of two large observational cohorts ,53,54 and no cases of suicide were reported in a systematic review of randomized trials.42 In patients with pre -existing psychiatric conditions, EFV should be used cautiously. Toxicity: QTc Prolongation The effect of EFV on the QTc interval was evaluated in a study of 58 healthy a dult participants ; a variety of CYP2B6 polymorphisms was represented within this group. A positive relationship between EFV concentration and QTc prolongation was observed.1 Clinicians should c onsider using an alternative to EFV in patients who are receiving a drug that has a known risk of Torsades de Pointes (e.g., quinidine, clarithromycin) or in patients who are at higher risk for Torsades de Pointes.2 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring It is reasonable for a clinician to use TDM to determine whether a patient is experiencing toxicity, because the concentration of EFV is higher than the normal therapeutic range for some toxicities .55,56 Dose reduction or drug discontinuation would b e considered appropriate management of drug toxicity. Dose reduction is best performed in consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV. Also, TDM should be considered when administering EFV to children aged 3 months to <3 years due to increased oral clearance and variable PK properties in this young age group. TDM should also be considered when using a lower dose of EFV \u2014such as the dose found in S ymfi Lo \u2014in children weighing 40 kg. Two weeks after initiati ng EFV in patients aged <3 years, clinicians should measure the plasma concentration of EFV . In cases where a dose adjustment may be necessary, clinicians should consult an expert in pediatric HIV infection prior to adjusting the dose . If a child initiated EFV at an investigational dose at <3 years of age, some experts would also measure plasma concentration at age 3 years , after the child transitions to the recommended dose for children aged 3 years. The currently accepted minimum effective concentration of EFV is a mid -dose concentration (C 12h) >1 mg/L in adults, and concentrations of >4.0 mg/L are associated with CNS side effects.44 However, the validity of using a single target has been called into question.57 In addition, a lower limit of C 12h >0.7mg/L was most predictive of virologic outcome in a study of 180 adults.58 Findings from a study of 128 African children (aged 1.7-13.5 years) suggest that the C 24h threshold for increased risk of unsuppres sed viral load is C 24h 0.65 mg/L.30 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-67 References 1.

Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate and Infant Dose Etravirine (ETR) is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Child Dose ETR is not approved for use in children aged < 2 years. Etravirine Dosing Table for Antiretroviral Therapy - Experienced Children and Adolescents Aged 2 to 18 Years and Weighing 10 kg Body Weight Twice -Daily Dose 10 kg to <20 kg 100 mg 20 kg to <25 kg 125 mg 25 kg to <30 kg 150 mg 30 kg 200 mg ETR is a pproved for use in children and adolescents who are treatment experienced. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommends that ETR is used as part of a regimen that includes a ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI) (see Efficacy in Clinical and Drug Interactions below ). Cobicistat -boosted with ETR . Raltegravir and dolutegravir should only RTV-boosted atazanavir, darunavir, or lopinavir . Adult Dose for Antiretroviral Therapy -Experienced Patients ETR 200 mg twice daily with food Nausea Diarrhea Rash, including Stevens -Johnson syndrome Hypersensitivity with rash, constitutional symptoms, and, sometimes , organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure Special Instructions ETR tablets are sensitive to moisture; store the tablets at room temperature in the original container with desiccant. Always administer ETR with food. Area under the curve of ETR is decreased by about 50% when the drug is taken on an empty stomach. The type of food does not affect the exposure to ETR . Swallowing ETR tablets whole is the preferred means of administration. Although the package insert contains instructions for dispersing ETR tablets in water or other liquids, using this administration method generally results in lower ETR exposures compared with swallowing tablets whole . Children who receive dispersed ETR tablets should switch to swallowing tablets whole as soon as developmentally able. Metabolism /Elimination ETR is an inducer CYP2C19, - glycoprotein. It substrate for CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 . ETR is involved in m ultiple interactions with antiretroviral agents and other drugs (see Drug Interactions below ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pedi atric HIV Infection L-71 Etravirine Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required when using ETR in patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. No dosing information is available for patients with severe hepatic impairment . Etravirine Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment No d ose adjustment is required when using ETR in patients with renal impairment. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Etravirine (ETR) is associated with multiple drug interactions. A patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions before ETR is administered . ETR should not be administered inhibitors (PIs), or cobicistat -boosted .1 ETR should not be administered with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase or elvitegravir/cobicistat . ETR reduce s the trough concentration of raltegravir2 (RAL) and dolutegravir (DTG). RAL and DTG should be used with ETR only when these drugs coadministered More common: Nausea, diarrhea, and mild rash. Rash occurs most commonly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rash generally resolves after 1 week to 2 weeks on continued therapy. A history of NNRTI-related rash does not appear to increase the risk of developing rash with ETR . However, patients who have a history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use should not receive ETR . Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy, severe rash, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and erythema multiforme all have been reported. Instances of severe rash have included Stevens -Johnson syndrome, and HSRs have included constitutional symptoms and organ dysfunction, inc luding hepatic failure. Discontinue ETR immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or HSRs develop (including severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, and eosinophilia). Clinicians should monitor a patient's c linical status , including levels of liver transaminases , and initiate appropriate therapy when necessary . Continuing to use ETR after the onset of severe rash may result in a life -threatening reaction. People who have a history of severe rash while using NVP or EFV should not receive ETR . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pedi atric HIV Infection L-72 Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval ETR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in antiretroviral therapy (AR T)- experienced children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years. Efficacy in Clinical Trials In the Paediatric study of Intelence As an NNRTI Option (PIANO) study,3 ART-experienced children aged 6 years to <18 years received ETR with a ritonavir (RTV)-boosted PI as part of an optimized background regimen. At Week 24, 67% of these participants had plasma HIV RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL , and 52% had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL. At Week 48, 56% of the participants had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and a mean increase in their CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count s of 156 cells/mm3 from baseline. At Week 48, 68% of children aged 6 years to <12 years had plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL, whereas only 48% of adolescents aged 12 years to <18 years achieved a plasma viral load of <50 copies/mL . In a retrospective study of 23 adolescents and young adults in Spain receiving ETR -based therapy , 78% of participants achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/m L at a median of 48.4 weeks of follow -up.4 In the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials ( IMPAACT ) P1090 trial,5 ART -experienced children age d 2 years to <6 years received ETR with a n RTV -boosted PI as part of an optimized background regimen. Participants received ETR at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (10 kg to <20 kg) or 125 mg twice daily (20 kg to <25 kg). At W eek 48, 75% had an HIV -1 RNA <400 copies/mL or a >2 -log reduction in HIV -1 RNA from baseline . The mean increase in CD4 count and CD4 percentage over 48 weeks was 298.5 cells/mm3 and 5.2%, respectively. Due to the PIANO and IMPAACT P 1090 study findings, if ETR is utilized to treat an ART -experienced child or adolescent, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (t he Panel ) recommends that ETR is part of a regimen that includes a RTV -boosted PI plus an optimized background regimen . Pharmacokinetics In a Phase 1 dose -finding study that involved children aged 6 to 17 years , 17 children were given ETR 4 mg/kg twice daily . The study reported that two pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters \u2014area under the curve for 12 hours post -dose (AUC 0-12h) and minimum plasma concentration (C min)\u2014were lower than the corresponding parameters observed in adults during previous studies.6 However, a higher dose (ETR 5.2 mg/kg twice daily; maximum 200 mg per dose) yielded acceptable parameters and was chosen for evaluation in the P hase 2 PIANO study. Exposures (mean AUC 0-12h) remained lower in older adolescents th an in adults and younger children, and exposures were lower in Asian participant s than in either White or B lack participants. In the PIANO study, children and adolescents with ETR concentrations in the lowest quartile (<2,704 ng\u00b7h/mL or pre -dose concentration [C0h] <145 ng/ mL) were less likely to achieve sustained virologic responses (defined as plasma viral load s Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pedi atric HIV Infection L-73 <50 copies/m L) after 48 weeks of treatment than those with ETR concentrations in the upper three quartiles .7 Table A. Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Children, Adolescents, and Adults Receiving Etravirine Twice Daily with an Optimized Background Regimen, I ncluding a R itonavir - Boosted P rotease (n = 41) 5,684 377 Adolescents Aged 12-17 Years (n = 60) 4,895 325 Adults (n = 575) 5,506 393 Key: AUC 0-12h = area under the curve for 12 hours post-dose; C 0h = pre- dose concentration; ETR = P1090 the PK and safety of ETR in treatment -experienced children with HIV aged 2 years to <6 years .5 All participants received ETR as part of an optimized background regimen, which included a RTV -boosted PI . The tablets were swallowed whole or dispersed in liquid. ETR was initially given at a dose of 5.2 mg/kg twice daily to a cohort of six children ; however, at this dose , the geometric mean ETR AUC 0-12h values fell below the target range of 60% of the values seen in adults. Subsequent participants were given twice -daily doses of ETR that were determined by weight band: children weighing 10 kg to <20 kg were given 100 mg twice daily , and children weighing 20 kg to <25 kg were given 125 mg twice daily . The p rotocol -specified PK targets for ETR were achieved at these doses ; the geometric mean AUC 0-12h was 3,823 ng\u00b7hr/mL , which was range of 2,713 ng\u00b7hr/mL to 6,783 ng\u00b7hr/mL (60 % to 150% of the AUC 0-12h value seen in adults ). However, considerable intersubject variability was observed, with 5 (33.3%) of 15 participants having AUC 0-12h values that were below the 10th percentile for AUC 0-12h range (<2,350 ng\u00b7hr/mL). The ETR AUC 0-12h values were significantly lower in children who received dispersed tablets than in children who swallowed intact tablets: 2,919 ng\u00b7hr/mL (n = 11) versus 10,982 ng\u00b7hr/mL (n = 3), respectively ( P = 0.0008). The Panel recommends that children swallow tablets whole (rather than dispersed in liquid) as soon as developmentally able. Six children with HIV aged 1 year to <2 years also were enrolled in IMPAACT P1090. Although t he ETR exposure s 2,713 ng\u00b7hr/mL and 6,783 ng\u00b7hr/mL), they were lower in these children compared with historical data in adults and adolescents (geometric mean ETR AUC 0-12h of 3,328 ng\u00b7hr/mL). Virologic failure , which was defined as a confirmed viral load of 400 copies/mL or less than a 2- log reduction in HIV -1 RNA from basel ine, occurred in four of six children by Week 48. Thus, the Panel does not recommend the use of ETR in those younger than 2 years of age. Given that both the PIANO and IMPAACT P1090 trials were conducted in children receiving RTV - boosted PIs as part of the ir optimized background regimens, t he Panel recommend s using ETR as part of a regimen that includes a n RTV -boosted PI. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pedi atric HIV Infection L-74 Toxicity In the PIANO study, rash and diarrhea were the most common adverse drug reactions that were deemed to be possibly related to the use of ETR. Rash (Grade 2 or higher) occurred in 13 % of pediatric subjects and emerged at a median of 10 days, lasting a median of 7 days . Rash was observed more frequently in female patients (13 of 64 patients ; 20.3%) than in male patient s (2 of 37 patients ; 5.4%).7 In IMPAACT P1090, adverse drug reactions that were reported for children aged 2 years to <6 years were comparable in frequency, type, and severity to those reported for adults . Twelve participants (46.2 %) developed Grade 1 or 2 rashes within the first 48 weeks of ETR, but no subject discontinued the study prematurely due to rash. Diarrhea occurred in 8 (30.8%) of 26 patients .5 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pedi atric HIV Infection L-75 References 1. Molto J, Curran A, Miranda C, et al.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-75 Nevirapine (NVP, Viramune) Updated: Ap Suspension: mg/mL Tablets: release (XR) 100- mg and 400- mg tablets Generic Formulations 10 mg/m L suspension Immediate- release 200- mg tablets XR 400-mg tablets The oral suspension formulation of nevirapine (brand name Viramune) is not typically stocked in local pharmacies or hospitals . Clinicians should direct pharmac ies to ask their drug wholesaler to order it from the Boehringer -Ingleheim distribution center. The distribution center should be able to ship the formulation directly to the pharmacy. Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Note : Nevirapine (NVP) often is used to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV. See Antiretroviral Management of Newborns with Perinatal H IV Exposure or HIV Infection . Child and Adolescent Dose In most situations, NVP is given once daily for 2 weeks to allow autoinduction of the enzymes involved in its metabolism. This may not be necessary in children aged <2 years.a See Special Considerations for Dosing: Neonates and Premature Infants below. Immediate -Release Tablets and Oral Suspension Gestational Age of 32 to <34 Weeks Birth to a ge 2 weeks: NVP 2 mg/kg per dose twice daily (no lead- in dosing)a Age 2 to 4 w eeks : NVP 4 mg/kg per dose twice daily Age 4 to 6 w eeks : NVP 6 mg/kg per dose twice daily Age >6 w eeks: NVP 200 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) per dose twice daily; only make this dose increase for infants with confirmed HIV infection. This dosing strategy is recommended by the P anel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) based on the review of pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation data. This dosing strategy has not been evaluated in clinical trials and is not approved by the U.S. Food and D rug Administration (FDA) . Rash, including Stevens -Johnson syndrome Symptomatic hepatitis, including fatal hepatic necrosisb Severe systemic hypersensitivity syndrome with potential for multisystem organ involvement and shock Special Instructions The oral suspension must be s hake n well before administering, and it should be store d at room temperature. NVP can be given without food. NVP-associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during the initial 14- day lead- in period, do not increase the dose until the rash resolves (see Major Toxicities below ). Extended- release tablets must be swallowed whole. They cannot be crushed, chewed, or divided. If NVP dosing is interrupted for > 14 days, NVP should be restarted with once- daily dosing for 14 days, followed by escalation to the full, twice -daily regimen (see Dosing Considerations: Lead- In Dosing below ). Most cases of NVP- associated hepatic toxicity occur during the first 12 weeks of therapy; Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-76 Gestational Age of 34 to <37 Weeks Birth to a ge 1 w eek: NVP 4 mg/kg per dose twice daily (no lead- in dosing)a Age 1 week to 4 w eeks: NVP 6 mg/kg per dose twice daily Age >4 w eeks: NVP 200 mg/m2 of BSA per dose twice daily; only make this dose increase for infants with confirmed HIV infection. This dosing strategy is recommended by the P anel based on the review of PK and safety data on this regimen from clinical trials. This dosing strategy is not approved by the FDA. Gestational Age of 37 Weeks to Age of <1 Month Birth to a ge 4 w eeks : NVP 6 mg/kg per dose twice daily (no in Age >4 w eeks: NVP 200 mg/m2 of BSA per dose twice daily; only make this dose increase for infants with confirmed HIV infection. This dosing strategy is recommended by the P anel based on the review of PK and safety data on this regimen from clinical trials. This dosing strategy is not approved by the FDA. Aged 1 Month to <8 Years NVP 200 mg/ m2 of BSA per dose twice daily after lead- in dosing.a In children aged 2 years , some experts initiate NVP without lead- in dosing (maximum dose of immediate- release tablets is NVP 200 mg twice daily) . Aged 8 Years NVP 120 mg to 150 mg/ m2 of BSA per dose twice daily after lead- in dosinga (maximum dose of immediate- release tablets is NVP 200 mg twice daily) . When adjusting the dose for a growing child, the mg dose need not be decreased as the child reaches age 8 years; rather, the mg dose can be left static to achieve the appropriate mg- per-m2 dose as the child grows, if no adverse effects emerge. Extended -Release Tablets Aged 6 Years Patients aged 6 years who are already taking immediate- release NVP tablets twice daily can be switched to extended- release NVP tablets without lead- in dosing.a Body Surface Area Dosing for Extended -Release Nevirapine Tablets Body Surface Area Once -Daily Dose 0.58 m2 to 0.83 m2 NVP 200 mg (two 100-mg tablets) 0.84 m2 to 1.16 m2 NVP 300 mg (three 100-mg tablets) 1.17 m2 NVP 400 mg (one 400-mg tablet ) frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring, includin g liver function tests, is important during this period (see Major Toxicities below ). Metabolism/Elimination NVP Impairment NVP should not be administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Nevirapine Dosing in Patients with Renal Failure Who Are Receiving Hemodialysis An additional dose of NVP should be given following each dialysis session . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-77 Adolescent and Adult Dose NVP 200 mg twice daily or NVP 400 mg with the extended- release tablets once daily after lead- in dosing.a,b Nevirapine Used in Combination with Lopinavir /Ritonavir A higher dose of lopinavir /ritonavir may be needed in patients who also are receiving NVP (see the Lopinavir /Ritonavir section ). a NVP is usually initiated at a lower dose that is increased in a stepwise fashion. NVP induces cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes, which results in increased drug clearance. The stepwise increase in dose decreases the occurrence of rash. Clinicians generally should i nitiate therapy with the immediate- release tablet formulation once daily instead of twice daily for the first 14 days of therapy. If no rashes or other adverse effects emerge after 14 days of therapy, increase the dose of NVP to the age-appropriate full dose of the immediate- release tablet formulation administered twice daily. For example, the recommended oral dose for pediatric patients aged 1 month to <8 years is NVP 200 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) once daily for the first 14 days , followed by NVP 200 mg/ m2 of BSA twice daily thereafter. However, in children aged 2 years, some experts initiate NVP without lead- in dosing (see the Dosing Dosing and Special Considerations for Dosing: Neonates and Premature Infants sections below ). In patients who are already receiving the full, twice -daily dose of the immediate- release tablets , extended- release tablets can be used without the lead- in period. Patients must swallow extended- release tablets whole. They must not be chewed, crushed, or divided. Patients must never take more than one form of NVP at the same time. The dose should not exceed NVP 400 mg daily. b Severe, life- threatening, and, in rare cases, fatal hepatotoxicity \u2014including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic have occurred in patients who were taking NVP . These toxicities are less common in children than adults. Most cases occur during the first 12 weeks of therapy and may be associated with rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) . NVP should be discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations, or HSRs . Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . autoinduction of metabolism occurs in 2 to 4 weeks, leading to a 1.5-fold to twofold increase in NVP clearance. M ultiple drug interactions with NVP are possible . Some genetic polymorphisms of CYP2B6 are associated with increased NVP serum concentrations. CYP2B6 polymorphisms vary among populations and may contribute to differences in NVP exposure. See the Efavirenz section for more information on how polymorphisms can alter enzyme activity . NVP should not be coadministered to patients who are receiving atazanavir (ATV) (with or without ritonavir), because NVP substantially decreases ATV exposure. NVP increases the metabolism of lopinavir (LPV) . A dose adjustment of LPV is recommended when the two drugs are coadministered (see the Lopinavir/ Ritonavir section). Before NVP is administered , a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities The following toxicities are seen with continuous dosing regimens, not during single -dose NVP prophylaxis. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-78 More common: Skin rash (some severe cases have requir ed hospitalization, and s ome cases have been life-threatening, including instances of Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), fever, nausea, headache, and elevated hepatic transaminases. In the two largest case series of NVP -induced Stevens -Johnson syndrome in children, the incidence rate was estimated between 1.4% and 7.1%.1,2 NVP should be discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop severe rash, rash with constitutional symptoms (i.e., fever, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, or blistering), or rash with elevated levels of hepatic transaminases. N VP- associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during the initial 14 -day lead-in period, do not increase the dose until rash resolves. However, the risk of developing NVP resistance with extended lead-in dosing is unknown, and this concern must be weighed against the current antiviral response and a patient's overall ability t o tolerate the regimen. Less common (more severe): Severe, life -threatening, and, in rare cases , fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure . These toxicities are less common in children than adults. Most cases occur during the first 12 weeks of therapy and may be associated with rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR ). Risk factors for NVP -related hepatic toxicity in adults include baseline elevation in serum transaminase levels, hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, female sex , and higher CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count at time of therapy initiation (CD4 count >250 cells/mm 3 in adult females and >400 cells/mm3 in adult males). Children with CD4 percentages >15% have a threefold increase in the risk of rash and hepatotoxicity after initiating NVP.3 HSRs have been reported, including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, and significant hepatic abnormalities. N VP should be discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations, or HSRs. Less common (more severe): In a cross -sectional study of 201 children with HIV aged 6 to 16 years, 43% of whom had hypertension, the use of NVP was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (adjusted odds ratio 3.14; confidence interval , P = 0.03) but not left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.4 The median duration on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in this cohort was 4.7 years (interquartile range 2.6-6.4 years ). Most participants (76.6%) were receiving a regimen that included two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a non- nucleoside (NNRTI ). However, the use of NVP was not associated with LVH in a more recent study by the same a uthors . LVH has been associated with NVP use in adults.5,6 Resi stance The International AIDS Society-USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval NVP is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of HIV in children from infancy (age d 15 days) onward and remains a mainstay of ART , especially in resource -limited Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-79 settings.7-15 The extended -release tablet formulation has been approved by the FDA for use in children aged 6 years. Efficacy in Clinical Trials Randomized clinical trials in children have demonstrated that lopinavir /ritonavir (LPV/r ) is superior to NVP in young children but not in older children. IMPAACT P1060 demonstrated the superiority of LPV/r over NVP in children aged <3 years , as have observational studies. PENPACT -1 and PROMOTE -pediatrics showed no differences in virologic outc omes between a n NNRTI -based regimen efavirenz [EFV] ) and a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen in older children with HIV.16-22 In infants and children who were previously exposed to a single dose of NVP to prevent perinatal HIV transmission , NVP -based ART is less likely to control viral load than LPV/r -based ART. In IMPAACT P1060, 153 children with HIV and previous exposure to NVP for perinatal prophylaxis (mean age 0.7 years) were randomly assigned to treatment with zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC) plus either NVP or LPV/r. At 24 weeks post -randomization, 24% of children in the NVP arm had experienced virologic failure compared with 7% of children in the LPV/r arm (P = 0.0009); virologic failure was defined as <1 log 10 decrease in HIV RNA during Weeks 12 to 24 or HIV RNA >400 copies/mL at Week 24 . When all primary endpoints were considered, including virologic failure, death, and treatment discontinuation, the PI arm remained su perior ; 40% of children in the NVP arm met a primary endpoint compared with 22% of children in the LPV/r arm ( P = 0.027).19 Similar results were reported in a randomized trial that compar ed NVP and LPV/r in children aged 6 to 36 months who had not been previously exposed to NVP . This finding suggest s that LPV/r -based therapy is superior to NVP -based therapy for infants, regardless of past NVP exposure.16 Extended -release NVP tablets (400 mg) w ere approved by the FDA for use in children aged 6 years in November 2012. Trial 1100.1518 was an open-label, multiple -dose, nonrandomized, crossover trial performed in 85 pediatric participants with HIV. The participants had received at least 18 weeks of immediate -release NVP tablets and had plasma HIV RN A <50 copies /mL prior to enrollment. Participants were stratified according to age (3 years to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, and 12 years to <18 years). Participants received immediate -release NVP tablets for 11 weeks. Participants were then treated with NVP extended-release tablets once daily in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for 10 days, after which steady -state pharmacokinetics (PKs) were determined .23 Forty participants who completed the initial part of the study were enrolled in an optional extension phase of the trial, which evaluated the safety and antiviral activity of extended-release NVP tablets through a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment. Of the 40 participants who entered the treatment extension phase, 39 complet ed at least 24 weeks of treatment. After 24 weeks or more of treatment with extended -release tablets ,24 all 39 participants cont inued to have plasma HIV RNA <50 copies /mL. General Dosing Considerations Body surface area (BSA) has traditionally been used to guide NVP dosing in infants and young children. It is important to avoid underdosing NVP , because a single point mutation (K103N) in the HIV genome may confer NNRTI resistance to both NVP and EFV . Younger children (aged 8 years) have higher apparent oral clearance than older children. T o achieve drug exposures that are equivalent to those see n in children aged >8 years, younger children require higher doses of NVP than older children.12,13 Because of this, it is recommended that children aged < 8 years receive NVP Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-80 200 mg /m2 of BSA per dose twice daily ( the maximum dose of the immediate-release tablet formulation is NVP 200 mg twice daily) or NVP 400 mg/m2 of BSA administered once daily as the extended -release tablet formulation (the maximum dose of the extended-release tablet formulation is NVP 400 mg once daily). For children aged 8 years, the recommended dose of the immediate - release tablet formulation is NVP 120 mg /m2 of BSA per dose (with a maximum dose of NVP 200 mg) administered twice daily. The maximum dose of the extended-release tablet formulation is NVP 400 mg once daily for children aged 6 years . When adjusting the dose for a growing child, the milligram dose need not be decreased (from NVP 200 mg to NVP 120 mg /m2 of BSA ) as the child reaches 8 years of age ; rather, the milligram dose can be left static if no adverse effects emerge and the dose achieve s the appropriate mg /m2 of BSA dose as the child grows. Some practitioners dose NVP at 150 mg /m2 of BSA every 12 hours or NVP 300 mg/ m2 of BSA once daily if using the extended- release tablets , regardless of age, as recommended in the FDA -approved product label. Regardless of age, the m aximum dos e should never exceed NVP 200 mg twice daily for immediate -release formulations of NVP or NVP 400 mg once during the lead-in period may have potentially contributed to the poorer performance of NVP in the IMPAACT P1060 trial. This potential for underdosing, which can increase the risk of resistance, has led t o a re-evaluation of lead -in dosing in children who have never received NVP . Traditional ly, NVP is initiated with an age -appropriate dose that is given only once daily instead of twice daily (NVP 200 mg /m2 of BSA in infants aged 15 days and children aged <8 years , using the immediate -release formulations ) during the first 2 weeks of treatment to allow the autoinduction of the liver enzymes CYP3A and CYP2B6, which are involved in NVP metabolism. Studies have previously indicated poten tial for greater drug toxicity without lead-in dosing; however, most of these studies have been performed in adult cohorts .25 The CHAPAS -1 trial26 randomized 211 children to initiate ART with immediate -release NVP without a lead -in dose (participants received an age-appropriate dose twice daily) or with a lead -in dose (participants received an age- appropriate dose once daily) for 2 weeks , followed by the standard twice -daily dosing of the immediate -release formulation of NVP . Children were followed for a median of 92 weeks ( with a range of 68 -116 weeks ), and no difference emerged in the frequency of G rade 3 or 4 adverse events between the two groups. The group that initiated NVP without a lead -in dose had a statistically significant increase in the incidence of G rade 2 rash, but most participants were able to continue NVP therapy after a brief interruption. Through 96 weeks, a similar percentage of participants in both groups reached the CD4 count and virologic failure endpoints. After children had been on NVP for 2 weeks, investigators conducted a substudy that examined NVP plasma concentrations 3 to 4 hours after a morning dose of NVP . Among children aged <2 years, 3 of 23 children (13% ) who initiated at full dose had subtherapeutic NVP levels (<3 mg/L) at 2 weeks compared with 7 of 22 children (32% ) who initiat ed at half dose ( P = 0.16). N o rash events occurred in the substudy group of participants aged <2 years ; in the parent CHAPAS study, a strong age effect on rash occurrence was seen , with the risk of rash increasing with age . These findings suggest that a lead-in dose may not be necessary in young patients.27 The standard practice has been to reinitiate half-dose NVP for another 2 weeks in children who have interrupted therapy for 7 days or longer; however, given the current un derstanding of NVP Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-81 resistance, the half -life of CYP enzymes,28 and the results of CHAPAS -1, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) recommends rest arting full-dose NVP in children who interrupt therapy for 14 days or less. Special Considerations for Dosing: Neonates and Premature Infants The PK and safety of NVP during the first weeks of life were evaluated as part of IMPAACT 1115. This study demonstrated that NVP dosed at 6 mg/kg twice daily for infants 37 weeks gestational age ( GA) and 4 mg/kg twice daily for 1 week and 6 mg/kg twice daily thereafter for infants 34 to <37 weeks GA achieved concentrations appropriate for treatment.29 Among 438 infants (389 infants 37 weeks GA), measured NVP concentrations were above the minimum HIV treatment target (3 mcg/mL) in 90% of infants at Week 1 and 87% of infants at Week 2. Grade 3-4 adverse events possibly related to treatment occurred in 7% of infants (with neutropenia and anemia most common) but did not lead to NVP cessation. PK modeling and simulation were performed with partial data from IMPAACT P1106 and P1115 to determine appropriate NVP dosi ng in premature infants 32 to <34 weeks GA . GA and postnatal age were significantly correlated with NVP oral clearance ; thus the authors recommended a GA-based starting dose for premature infants treated with NVP and a stepwise increase in dosing at 2 -week intervals .30 These data might underestimate potential drug toxicity in infants of 32 to <34 weeks GA, because the doses used to develop the model were lower than the doses now recommended. NVP is shown to be safe in infants >34 weeks GA, so the risk of toxicity in infants 32 to <34 weeks GA seem s low. The Panel considers that this risk -benefit ratio may justif y the use of this dose in premature infants 32 to <34 weeks GA. The Early Infant Treatment Study in Botswana started 40 infants with HIV 35 weeks GA on NVP 6 mg/kg twice daily (without lead -in dosing) along with ZDV and 3TC at a median age 2 days (range 1-5 days). NVP was switched to LPV/r at Week 2, 3, 4, or 5 according to delivery GA. Although NVP trough concentrations were below the therapeutic target (3,000 mg/mL) for 50% of 2-week measurements, 37 of 40 infants (92.5%) had an HIV RNA decline .31 Providers who consider initiating treatment in premature infants or in infants aged <2 weeks should weigh the risks and benefits of using unapproved ART dosing and should incorporat e case-specific factors , such as exposure to ARV prophylaxis.

Child and Adolescent ( Aged 12 Years and Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose RPV 25 mg once daily with a meal in antiretroviral therapy (ART) -naive patients w ho have HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL or in patients who are virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) with no history of virologic failure or resistance to RPV and other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in the new regimen. Depression Insomnia Headache Rash (can be severe and include DRESS (drug reaction [or rash] with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ). Hepatotoxicity Altered adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test of uncertain clinical significance Special Instructions Do not start RPV in patients with HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL because of the increased risk of virologic failure. RPV concentrations are significantly increased when either RPV or dolutegravir ( DTG )/RPV is administered with a moderate- or high- fat meal.1 Patients must be able to take RPV (or DTG/RPV) with a meal of at least 500 calories on a regular schedule (a protein drink alone does not constitute a meal) . Guidelines for the Use of Ant iretroviral Agents in ( Aged 12 Years and Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily with a meal in ART-naive patients with baseline viral loads 100,000 copies/mL . One tablet once daily also can be used to replace the current ARV regimen in patients who are currently on their first or second regimen and who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies /mL) for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Complera. [Juluca] Dolutegravir /Rilpivirine Adult Dose One tablet once daily with a meal as a complete regimen to replace the current ARV regimen in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies /mL) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Juluca.

One tablet once daily also can be used to replace a stable ARV regimen in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies /mL) for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of O defsey . [Cabenuva] Cabotegravir (CAB) and Rilpivirine (RPV) Kit Child and Adolescent (Aged 12 Years and Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose Cabenuva is a two -drug co- packaged product for intramuscular (IM) injection that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV -1 in patients with HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL on a stable ARV regimen with no his tory of treatment failure and no known or suspected resistance to CAB or RPV. Oral lead- in dosing for at least 28 days is can be used to assess tolerability prior to initiating IM CAB and RPV injections or patients can proceed directly to IM CAB and RPV on the last day of their current ARV regimen. Refer to Cabotegravir for dosing information. Do not use RPV with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors . Do not pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, pantoprazole) . Antacids should only be taken at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after RPV . H2 receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine) should only be administered at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after RPV. Use RPV with caution when coadminister ing it with a drug that has a known risk of prolonging the QTc interval or causing Torsades de Pointes (for more information, see CredibleMeds ). Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before using FDC tablets that contain TDF or TAF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when TDF or TAF discontinued, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and Tenofovir Alafenamide . Therefore, hepatic function and hepatitis B viral load should be monitored for several months after therapy with TDF or TAF is discontinued in patients with HBV. Refer to Cabotegr avir for special instructions when using CAB and RPV for IM injection . Metabolism /Elimination Cytochrome P450 3A substrate . Refer to Cabotegravir for about the IM CAB and RPV regimen. Rilpivirine Dosing in P atients with H epatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients w ith mild or moderate hepatic im pairment. Rilpivirine Dosing in P atients Impairment RPV decreases tubular secretion of creatinine and slightly increases measured serum creatinine, but it does not affect glomerular filtration. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, RPV should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or end- stage renal disease. These patients should be monitored more frequently for adverse events ; renal dysfuncti on may alter drug absorption, distribution, and metabolism , leading to increased RPV concentrations . The FDC tablet Complera should not be in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min , and the FDC tablet be used in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min. Patients with CrCl <30 mL/min who are taking Juluca should be monitored closely. Guidelines for the Use of Ant iretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-84 Long -acting CAB and RPV for IM injection is not approved for children aged <12 years . When using Complera , see the TDF section of the guidelines ; when using Odefsey , see the TAF section . Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: when admini stered with CYP3A -modulating medications. A patient 's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions before RPV is administered . Coadminist ering RPV with drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of RPV . o Antacids should only be taken at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after RPV . o H2 receptor antagonists should only be administered at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after RPV . o Do not use RPV with proton pump inhibitors. Rifampin and rifabu tin rifampin and RPV is contraindicated who are concomitantly receiving rifabutin and RPV , the dose of RPV should be doubled to 50 mg once daily and taken with a meal. In a c ohort of adolescent patients, RPV exposure was two to three times greater when RPV was administered in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) than when RPV was administered alone .2 Major Toxicities More common: Insomnia, headache, rash Less common (more severe): Depression or mood cha nges, suicidal ideation In studies of adults , 7.3% of patients who were treated with RPV showed a change in adrenal function characterized by an abnormal 250-microgram adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test (peak cortisol level <18.1 microgram s/dL). In a study of adolescent s, 6 out of 30 patients (20%) developed this abnormality .3 The clinical significance of these results is unknown. Rare : RPV drug-induced liver injury has been reported.4 Resistance The International A ntiviral Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Transm itted drug resistance to second-generation non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs ) may be present in infants and children who have recent ly received a diagnosis of HIV . Guidelines for the Use of Ant iretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-85 Pediatric Use Approval With the viral load and antiretroviral ( ARV) resistance restrictions noted above, RPV (Edurant) used in combination with other ARV agents , (CAB) and RPV (Cabenuva) are all approved by the U.S. F ood and D rug A dministration (FDA) for use in persons aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg. The FDC tablet dolutegravir/ rilpivirine (DTG/RPV; Juluca) is not approved for use in pediatric or adolescent patients at the time of this review . Efficacy in Clinical Trials An RPV -containing regimen has been compared to an efavirenz (EFV) -containing regimen in two large clinical trials in adults \u2014ECHO and THRIVE. In both studies, RPV was shown to be non- inferior to EFV . Patients with pretreatment HIV viral loads 100,000 copies/mL who receiv ed RPV had higher rates of virologi c failure than those who receiv ed EFV . These findings resulted in FDA approval for initial therapy with RPV only in patients with HIV viral load s 100,000 copies/mL.5-8 A study of antiretroviral therapy (ART )-naive adolescents aged 12 to 18 years demonstrated that RPV 25 mg, given once daily in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs ), was well tolerated over 48 weeks. In studies of adolescents with baseline viral loads 100,000 copies/mL, 86% had a virologic response at 24 weeks and 79% had a virologic response at 48 weeks . In adolescents with baseline viral loads >100,000 copies/mL, 38% had a virologic response at 24 weeks and 50% had a virologic response at 48 weeks.9 Patients must be able to take RPV on a regular schedule and with a full meal, which may limit its usefulness for some adolescents with irregular schedules. The FDC formulation Odefsey is a small pill and can be useful for certain patients who have difficulty swallowing pills and want to switch from a multipill regimen , and who do not have any drug resistance mutations that are associated with the components of Odefsey. A Spanish multicenter observational study enrolled 17 adolescents (aged <18 ye ars) who acquired HIV perinatally to receive FTC/RPV/TDF (Complera) as part of an off-label medication use program. At the time of enrollment, 12 patients were on a protease inhibitor- based regimen, 4 were on an NNRTI -based regimen, and 1 had not received ART. After a median follow -up of 90 weeks (for participants with undetectable viral loads at baseline) or 40 weeks (for participants with detectable viral loads at baseline), 86% and 89% of patients, respectively, achieved and maintained an unde tectable viral load. None of the patients discontinued RPV -based therapy because of adverse events (AEs); no skin rashes or central nervous system (CNS)-related events were observed. In addition, serum lipids improved, and two adolescents with a history of insomnia and abnormal dreams while receiving EFV -based therapy did not report similar problems while receiving RPV - based therapy.10 Guidelines for the Use of Ant iretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-86 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PKs), safety, and efficacy of RPV in children aged < 12 years have not been established but are currently being studied in patients aged 6 years to <12 years and weighing 17 kg (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00799864 ). The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) has agreed that the use of RPV may be appropriate in certain children aged <12 years and weighing 35 kg. However, the Panel advises consulting an expert in pediatric HIV infection prior to prescribing RPV for a child in this age and weight group. An international (India, Thailand, Uganda, and South Africa) Phase 2 trial , Pediatric Study in Adolescents Investigating a New NNRTI TMC278 (PAINT) , investigat ed a 25-mg dose of RPV given i n combination with two NRTIs in ARV-na ive adolescents age d 12 years to < 18 year s who weigh ed 32 kg and who had viral loads 100,000 copies/mL .9 In the dose -finding phase of the study, 11 youth aged >12 years to 15 years and 12 youth aged >15 years to 18 years underwent intensive PK assessment after they took an observed dose of RPV with a meal. PKs were comparable to those in adults; r esults are listed in the table below.11 Table A. Rilpivirine Pharmacokinetics in Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 Years to <18 Years Parameter Adults Adolescents Aged 12 Years to <18 Years Dose RPV 25 mg once daily RPV 25 mg once daily Number of Participants Studied 35 85 \u00b1 40 Median (Range) 73 (2- 288) 79 (7- 202) Source : Adapted from Rilpivirine [package insert]. Food and 12 Key: AUC 24h = area under the curve after 24 hours ; C0h = plasma concentration just prior to next dose; RPV = rilpivirine ; SD = standard deviation In a PK study of youth age d 13 to 23 years who receiv ed RPV ,2 RPV exposure was comparable to the exposure observed during the PAINT study in patients who receiv ed 25-mg doses of RPV without DRV/r and substantia lly higher than the exposure observed in those who receiv ed 25-mg doses of RPV with DRV/r (RPV area under the curve in this study was 6,740 ng\u00b7h/mL). No dose adjustments are currently recommended for adults when RPV is coadministered with DRV/r , where a similar two fold to three fold increase in RPV exposure has been reported.3 RPV has been reported to ha ve fewer CNS AEs than EFV , and it has been promoted as a replacement ARV drug for some patients who experience CNS effects while receiving EFV . However, concern exists that the prolonged half-life of EFV might result in residual drug levels that could have an Guidelines for the Use of Ant iretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-87 impact on RPV levels . A Thai study evaluated 20 Thai adolescents 4 weeks after they switch ed from EFV to RPV . The PK parameters of RPV in this study population were comparable to those in previous pediatric (PAINT) and adult (ECHO/THRIVE) PK substudies. No virologic failure was detect ed at 12 or 24 weeks , and no patients discontinued RP V because of AE s.13 Simplification of T reatment Juluca is a n FDC tablet that contains DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg. The results from t wo trials in adults (SWORD -1 and SWORD -2) support ed FDA approval of DTG/ RPV as a complete regimen for treatment simplification or maintenance therapy in certain patients . The two identical SWORD trials enrolled 1,024 patients with suppressed viral replication who had been on s table AR T for at least 6 months and had no history of treatment failure or evidence of resistance mutations that are associated with DTG or RPV . The participants were randomized to receive DTG/ RPV (\"early switch \") or to continue their suppressive ARV regimen. After 48 weeks of treatment, 95% of patients in both arms ma intained HIV RNA <50 copies/mL.14 After 52 weeks, the participants who had been randomized t o continue their suppressive ARV regimen were switched to DTG /RPV (\"late switch \"). At 148 weeks of treatment, 84% of the early switch patients and 90% of the late switch patients remained virologically suppressed , and only 11 patients receiving dual therap y (DTG/RPV) met virologic failure criteria. No integrase inhibitor resistance was identified.15 More A Es were repor ted, and more AEs led to treatment discontinuation in the DTG /RPV arm during the comparative randomized phase . In a subgroup of SWORD study patients whose original ARV regimen contained TDF , small but statistically significant increases in hip and spine bone mineral density were observed.16 Although DTG /RPV as Juluca is not approved for use in adolescents, t he doses of both component drugs that make up Juluca are approved for use in adolescents . This product may be appropriate for certain adolescents ; however, because the strategy of treatment simplification has not been evaluated in adolescents , who may have difficulties adhering to therapy, the Panel does not recommend using Juluca in adolescents and children until more data are ava ilable . Long -Acting Injectable Rilpivirine A long-acting approved for coadmini stration with long-acting injectable CAB as a complete ARV regimen for children and adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg and adults with HIV RNA levels <50 copies/ mL, on a stable ARV regimen, with no history of treatment failure, and no known or suspected resistance to CAB or RPV.17 This formulation has been evaluated in adults as monthly or every- 2 month intramuscular injections following an initial oral , lead-in daily dose for 4 weeks to assess toxicity.18-20 These studies in adult patients demonstrated non -inferior efficacy to standard oral therapy and good participant satisfaction and tolerability through 96 weeks. A follow -on study demonstrated that dos ing IM CAB and RPV every 2 months in virally suppressed participants provided similar safety and efficacy to monthly injections through 48 weeks.21 IMPAACT study 2017 , More Options for Children and Adolescents (MOCHA), is currently evaluating the safety, tolerability, acceptability, and PK profile of this injectabl e regimen in adolescents weighing 35 kg (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03497676 ). See the Cabotegravir section for more information about this regimen. Toxicity In the PAINT study, the observed AEs were similar to those reported in adults (e.g., somnolence, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache ). The incidence of depressive disorders was Guidelines for the Use of Ant iretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-88 19.4% (7 of 36 participants ) compared to 9% in the Phase 3 trials in adults. The incidence of G rade 3 and 4 depressive disorders was 5.6% (2 of 36 participants ). 3 Six out of 30 adolescents (20%) with a normal ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed an abnormal test during the trial. N o serious AE s, deaths, or treatment discontinuations were attributed to adrenal insufficiency. The clinical significance of abnormal ACTH stimulation tests is not known, but this finding warrant s further evaluation. 3 Crushi ng Tablets for Enteral Administration Some case s report DTG/RPV tablets ' being crushed and successfully administered via an enteral tube.22 If DTG/RPV is administered via enteral tube, care should be taken to disperse the tablets completely and flush the tube to avoid clogging.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-89Protease Inhibitors of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-90 Atazanavir (ATV, Reyataz) Updated: Ap r.11, 2022 2022 Formulations Powder Packet: 50 mg/packet Capsules: 150 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg Generic Formulations 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg capsules Fixed -Dose Combination Tablets [Evotaz ] Atazanavir 300 mg/ cobicistat 150 mg Capsules and p owder packets are not interchangeable. For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate Dose Atazanavir (ATV) is not approved for use in neonates and infants aged < 3 months. A TV should not be administered to neonates because of risks associated with hyperbilirubinemia ( e.g., bilirubin -induced neurologic dysfunction). Infant and Child Dose Powder Formulation of Atazanavira The powder formulation of ATV must be administered with ritonavir (RTV) . The powder formulation is not approved for use in infants aged < 3 months or weighing <5 kg. Atazanavir Powder Dosing Table for Infants and Children Aged 3 Months and Weighing 5 kga Weight Once -Daily Dose 5 kg to <15 kg ATV 200 mg ( four packets) plus RTV 80 mg ( 1 mL oral solution) with food 15 kg to <25 kgb ATV 250 mg ( five packets) plus RTV 80 mg ( 1 mL oral solution) with food Indirect hyperbilirubinemia Prolonged electrocardiogram PR interval, first -degree symptomatic atrioventricular block in some patients Nephrolithiasis Increased serum transaminases Hyperlipidemia ( occurs primarily with RTV boosting) Special Instructions Administer ATV with food to enhance absorption. Capsules and powder packets are not interchangeable. Do not open capsules. Because ATV can prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram , use ATV with caution in patients with preexisting cardiac conduction system disease or with other drugs that are known to prolong the PR interval (e.g., calcium channel blockers, beta- blockers, digoxin, verapamil). ATV absorption is dependent on low gastric pH; therefore, when ATV is administered with medications that alter gastric pH, dosing adjustments may be indicated (see the Drug Interactions section in the ATV package insert ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-91 Capsule Formulation of Atazanavira ATV c apsules are not approved for use in children aged <6 years or weighing <15 kg. Atazanavir /Ritonavir Capsule Dosing Table for Children and Adolescents Aged 6 Years and Weighing 15 kg Weight Once -Daily Dose <15 kg Capsules not recommended 15 kg to <35 kg ATV/r 200 mg/100 mg, both with foodc 35 kg ATV/r 300 mg/100 mg, both with foodc ART-Naive Patients Who Are Unable to Tolerate Ritonavir Child and Adolescent (Aged 13 Years and Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose ATV 400 mg (capsule formulation only) once daily with food ATV powder is not an option, because it must be administered with RTV . For the capsule formulation, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) does not recommend the use of unboosted ATV in children aged <13 years , adolescen ts aged 13 years and weighing 40 kg may be prescribed unboosted ATV if they are not concurrently taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) . To achieve target drug concentrations, adolescents may require doses of ATV that are higher than those recommended for use in adults (see Pediatric Use below). The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV does not recommend the use of unboosted ATV. ART-Naive and ART-Experienced Patients Child and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose Atazanavir/ritonavir ( ATV/r ) 300 Atazanavir/ cobicistat (ATV/c) 300 mg/150 mg once daily with food, administered as single agents simultaneously or as the coformulated drug Evotaz .e Both ATV/r and ATV/c must be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. [Evotaz] Atazanavir /Cobicistat Child and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily with food The plasma concentration and , therefore , the therapeutic effect of ATV can be expected to decrease substantially when ATV is coadminis tered with proton- pump inhibitors (PPIs) . Antiretroviral therapy (ART) - naive patients who are receiving any PPI should receive a dose of that PPI that is equivalent to no more than a 20-mg dose of omeprazole. PPIs should be taken approximately 12 hours bef ore taking boosted ATV. Coadministration of ATV with PPIs is not recommended in ART-experienced patients. Patients with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections and patients who had marked elevations in transaminase levels before treatment may hav e an increased risk of further elevations in transaminase levels or hepatic decompensation. ATV oral powder contains phenylalanine, which can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria. Each packet of oral powder contains 35 mg of phenylalanine. Powder Administration Mix ATV oral powder with at least 1 tablespoon of soft food (e.g., applesauce, yogurt). Oral powder mixed with a bever age (at least 30 mL of milk or water) may be used for older infants who can drink from a cup. For young infants (aged <6 months) who cannot eat solid food or drink from a cup, oral powder should be mixed with at least 10 mL of infant formula and administer ed using an oral dosing syringe. Administer RTV immediately following powder administration. Administer the entire dose of oral powder within 1 hour of preparation. Metabolism /Elimination ATV is a substrate and inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) with Hepatic Impairment ATV should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment . Consult the manufacturer's prescribing information for the dose adjustment in patients with moderate impairment. ATV should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Atazanavir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-92 ATV should not be given to ART-experienced patients with end- stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis. a mg/kg dosing is higher for the ATV powder packets than for the capsules. In P1020A, children of similar age and size who were taking ATV powder had lower exposures than those who were taking ATV capsules. b Children weighing 25 kg who cannot swallow ATV capsules may receive ATV 300 mg oral powder (six packets) plus RTV 100 mg oral solution, both administered once daily with food. c Either RTV capsules or RTV oral solution can be used. d Adult patients who cannot swallow capsules may take ATV oral powder once daily with food using the adult dose for the capsules. ATV oral powder should be administered with RTV. e See the Cobicistat section for important information about toxicity, drug interactions, and monitoring of patients who receive cobicistat (COBI) and the combination of COBI and TDF. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism : Atazanavir (ATV) is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cyt ochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system and has significant interactions with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism. A TV also competitively inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. A TV is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8. A diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1). Because of the potential for multiple drug interactions with ATV, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions before administering ATV . ) or atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/c) should be with TDF . The effect of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) on is unknown; thus , only ATV/r or ATV/c plasma concentrations significantly. N VP and ETR should not be administered to patients who are receiving ATV (with or without a booster ). Although the combination of EFV and ATV/r is not commonly used in clinical practice, EFV may be used in combination with ritonavir (RTV )-boosted ATV 400 mg in antiretroviral therapy (ART )-naive patients . ATV/r should be taken with food, and EFV should be t aken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. Coadministering ATV/r and EFV in ART -experienced patients is not recommended , because this combination is expected to result in suboptimal ATV exposure in these patients. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors : ATV is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir (RAL). This interaction may not be clinically significant. Absorption: A TV absorption is dependent on low gastric pH. The dose for ATV should be adjusted when it is administered with medications that alter gastric pH. Guidelines for the appropriate dos es of ATV to use with antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and proton-pump inhibitors in adults are complex and can be found in the package insert for ATV . No information is available on the appropriate doses of ATV to use in children when the drug is coadministered with medications that alte r gastric pH. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-93 Coadministering cobicistat (COBI)\u2014a CYP3A4 inhibitor \u2014and medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may increase the plasma concentrations of these medications. This may increase the risk of clinically significant adverse reactions (including life -threatening or fatal reactions) that are associated with the concomitant medications. Coadministration of COBI, ATV, and CYP3A 4 inducers may lead to lower exposure s of COBI and ATV, a loss of efficacy of ATV, and possible development of resistance.1 Coadminist ering COBI and ATV with some (e.g., with ETR , with EFV in ART -experienced patients, or with another ARV drug that requires pharmacokinetic [PK] enhancement, such as another protease inhibitor [PI] or elvitegravir) may result in decreased plasma concentrations of that agent, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and the development of resistance. Major Toxicities More common: Indirect hyperbilirubinemia that can result in jaundice or icterus but is not a marker of hepatic toxicity. Headache, fever, arthralgia, depres sion, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and paresthesia. Less common: Prolongation of the electrocardiogram PR interval. Abnormalities in atrioventricular (AV) conduction are generally limited to first -degree AV block, but second - degree AV block has been reported. Rash is generally mild or moderate, but in rare cases includes life -threatening Stevens -Johnson syndrome. Fat maldistribution and lipid abnormalities may be less comm on than with other PIs. The use of ATV/r is associated with lipid abnormalities , but to a lesser extent than with other boosted PIs. Rare: New-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, and elevation in serum transaminases. Chronic kidney disease , including biopsy-proven cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis that were associated with the deposition of ATV drug crystals in the renal parenchyma have occurre d. Nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis have been reported. Hepatotoxicity (patients with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections are at increased risk of hepatotoxicity). Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval ATV is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in infants (age d 3 months and weighing 5 kg), children, and adolescents. ATV coformulated with COBI (as Evotaz) has been approved by the FDA for use in pediatr ic patients weighing 35 kg. Efficacy Studies in ART -naive adults have shown that ATV/r is as effective as EFV and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) when these drugs are administered with two NRTIs .2-5 In AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5257, compared to darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r ) or RAL , each administered Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-94 with a TDF/emtricitab ine backbone. Although all three regimens had equal virologic efficacy, the regimen that contained ATV/r was discontinued more frequently than the other regimens because of toxicity but most often because of hyperbilirubinemia or gastrointestinal complaints.6 International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT)/ Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG ) P1020 enrol led 195 ART -naive and ART -experienced patients with HIV aged 3 months to 21 years. Capsule and powder formulations of ATV given with and without RTV boosting were investigated in this open-label study; area under the curve (AUC) targeting was used to direc t dose finding. Of the 195 patients enrolled, 142 patients received ATV-based treatment at the final recommended dose. Among the se patients , 58% were ART -naive. At Week 48, 69.5% of the ART -naive patients and 43.3% of the ART -experienced patients had HIV viral loads 400 copies/mL.7,8 Two open- label clinical trials in infants and children , PRINCE -1 and PRINCE -2, studied a powder formulation of ATV that was administered once daily and boosted with liquid RTV .9-11 In total, 134 infants and children aged 3 months and weighing between 5 kg and 35 kg were evaluated. Using a modified intent -to-treat analysis, 28 of 52 ARV -naive patients (54%) and 41 of 82 ART - experienced patients (50%) had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48. The median increase from baseline in absolute CD4 T lymphocyte cell count at 48 weeks of therapy was 215 cells/mm 3 (a 6% increase) in ARV -naive patients and 133 cells/mm3 (a 4% increase) in ARV -experienced patients. Pharmacokinetics and Dosing Oral Capsule The results of the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A trial in children and adolescents indicate that, in the absence of RTV boosting, ATV can achieve protocol -defined PK targets \u2014but only when used at higher doses (on a mg per kg body weight or mg per m2 of body surface area basis) than the doses that are currently recommended in adults. In IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A, children aged >6 years to <13 years required a dose of 520 mg per m2 of body surface area per day of the ATV capsule formulation to achieve PK targets .8 Unboosted ATV at this dose was well tolerated in those aged <13 years who were able to swallow capsules .12 The approved dose for adults is ATV 400 mg once daily without RTV boosting; however, adolescents aged >13 years required a dose of ATV 620 mg per m2 of body surface area per day.8 In this study, the AUCs for the unboosted arms were similar to those seen in the ATV/r arms, but the maximum plasma concentration (C max) was higher and the minimum plasma concentration (C min) was lower in the unboosted arms. Median doses of ATV, both with and without RTV boosting, from IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A are outlined in the table below . When administering unboosted ATV to pediatric patients, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to ensure th at adequate ATV plasma concentrations have been achieved. A minimum target trough concentration for ATV is 150 m g/mL.13 Higher target trough concentrations may be required in PI- experienced patients. IMPAACT P1058, a study of unboosted ATV PKs in ART - experienced children, concluded that once -daily ATV 400 mg provided suboptimal exposure and that administering higher, unboosted doses or splitting the daily dose into twice -daily doses warranted investigation in ART -experienced children, adolescents , and young adults .14 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-95 Table A.

Key: ATV = atazanavir ; RTV = ritonavir In the report of the IMPAA CT/PACTG P1020A data, ATV satisfied PK criteria at a dose of 205 mg per m2 of body surface area in pediatric subjects when administered with RTV .12 A study of a model - based approach that us ed ATV concentration-time data from three adult studies and one pediatric study (P1020A),15 along with subsequent additional adjusted modeling ,16 informed the use of the following weight -based ATV/r doses that are listed in the current FDA -approved product label for children aged 6 years to <18 years: Weighing 15 kg to <35 kg: ATV/r Weighing 35 as a Pharmacokinetic Enhancer COBI (as Tybost) is approved by the FDA at the 150 -mg dose for use with ATV 300 mg in children and adolescents weighing 35 kg. A study of 14 adolescents, age d 12 to 18 years, showed that COBI is a safe and effective PK enhancer when used in combination with ATV and two NRTIs in adolescent patients.17 PK findings from this study are summarized in T able B below .

For the IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A trial, AUC targets (30,000 ng\u00b7hr/mL to 90,000 ng\u00b7hr/mL) were established based on exposures in adults in early studies of unboosted ATV . In IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A, children aged 3 months to 2 years who were i n the boosted ATV powder cohorts and who received a daily dose of ATV 310 mg per m2 of body surface area achieved average ATV exposures that approached, but did not meet , protocol targets. Variability in exposures was high, especially among the very young children of 3 months to 2 years in this study.8 Assessment of the PK s, safety, tolerability, and virologic response of ATV oral powder for FDA approval was based on data from two open- label, multicenter clinical trials: PRINCE -1, which enrolled pediatric patients aged 3 months to <6 years ;9 and PRINCE -2, which enrolled pediatric patients aged 3 months to <11 years .10 In total, 134 treated patients (weighing 5 kg to <35 kg) from both studies were evaluated during the FDA approval process . All patients in the PRINCE trials were treated with boosted ATV and two NRTIs . Children received an oral solution that contained ATV and RTV . Doses were assigned according to the child's weight: Weighing 5 kg to <10 kg: A TV 150 mg or ATV 200 mg and RTV 80 mg Weighing 10 kg to <15 kg: A TV 200 mg and RTV 80 mg Weighing 15 kg to <25 kg: A TV 250 mg and RTV 80 mg Weighing 25 kg to <35 kg: A TV 300 mg and RTV 100 mg Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-97 No new safety concerns were identified during these trials.

Transitioning from Powder to Capsules For children who reach a weight 25 kg while taking the powder, ATV 300 mg powder (six packets) plus RTV 100 mg oral solution, both administered once daily with food, may be used. A TV capsules should be used for children who can swallow pills. Bioavailability is higher for the capsules than for the powder; therefore, a lower mg/kg dose is recommended when using capsules . Opened capsules have not been studied and should not be used.

See also Appendix A, Table 2. Antiretroviral Fixed- Dose Combination Tablets: Minimum Body Weights and Considerations for Use in Children and Adolescents . For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Note : Darunavir (DRV) should not be used without a pharmacokinetic enhancer (boosting agent) . Ritonavir (RTV) may be used boosting agent in children and adults . Cobicistat (COBI) may be used as a boosting agent with DRV in children weighing 40 kg and in adults . Neonate/Infant Dose DRV is not approved for use in neonates/infants. Child Dose Aged <3 Y ears Do not use DRV in children aged <3 years or weighing 10 kg . In juvenile rats, DRV caused convulsions and death; these events have been attributed to immaturity of the blood- brain barrier and liver metabolic pathways. Aged 3 Years to <12 Y ears Dosing recommendations in the table below are for children aged 3 years to <12 years and weighing 10 kg who are antiretroviral therapy -naive or treatment -experienced and with or without resistance testing results that demonstrat e that they have at least one mutation that is associated with DRV resistance . Skin rash, including Stevens -Johnson syndrome and multiforme Diarrhea, nausea Headache maldistribution Special Instructions Once -daily DRV is not generally recommended for use in children aged <12 years or weighing <40 kg. Dosing estimates for these patients were based on limited data, and limited clinical experience exists with this dosing schedule in this age group. Once -daily DRV should not be used if any one of the following resistance- associated mutations is administered with food, which increases DRV plasma concentrations by about 30%. DRV contains a sulfonamide moiety. Use DRV with caution in patients with known sulfonamide allergies . Pediatric dosing requires coadministration of tablets of different strengths to achieve the recommended dose for each weight band.

Store DRV tablets and oral suspension at room temperature (25\u00baC or 77\u00baF). The s uspension must be shaken well before dosing. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before using FDC tablets that contain emtricitabine (FTC) or tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF). Severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection can occur when FTC or TAF are discontinued; therefore, liver function should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking FTC or TAF. Metabolism /Elimination Cytochr ome P450 3A4 substrate Patients with Hepatic Impairment DRV is primarily metabolized by the liver. C aution should be used when administering DRV to patients with hepatic impairment . DRV is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Darunavir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment No DRV dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-60 mL/min). The FDC Symtuza is not recommended for use in patients with an estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-101 a Once -daily dosing of DRV is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug A dministration (FDA) , but the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) does not generally recommend using this dosing schedule in children (see Frequency of Administration below ). b Note that the dose in children weighing 10 kg to 15 kg is DRV 20 mg/kg plus RTV 3 mg/kg of body weight per dose, which is higher than the weight -adjusted dose in children with higher body weight s. c RTV 80 g/mL oral solution. d The volumes for the 375- mg and 450- mg DRV doses are rounded for suspension- dose convenience. e Some Panel members recommend using the FDA -approved dose of once- daily DRV 675 mg ( administered using a combination of tablets) plus RTV 100 mg once daily for adolescents weighing 30 kg to <40 kg (see Table B below) . f See the Cobicistat section for important information about toxicity, drug interactions, and monitoring in patients who receive COBI . Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Darunavir (DRV) is primarily ritonavir (RTV) and cobicistat (COBI) are inhibitors CYP3A4, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of DRV. Coadministration plus RTV (DRV/r) or DRV plus (DRV/c) with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A clearance create s potential for multiple drug-drug interactions and may be associated with suboptimal efficacy or serious and/or life - threatening events. Coadministration of several drugs , including other protease inhibitors , is contraindicated with DRV/r and DRV/c . A study involving adults with HIV suggest ed that etravirine (ETR) may reduce serum DRV concentrations by induction of CYP3A5, which is more commonly expressed in individuals of African descent.1 Before administ ering agent), a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. The use of COBI is not recommended with DRV 600 mg twice daily. [Prezcobix] Darunavir/ Cobicistat Child and Adolescent (Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose for Treatment -Naive or T reatment -Experienced Patients with N o Mutations Associated with Darunavir Resistance One tablet once daily with food [Symtuza] Darunavir /Emtricitabine /Tenofovir Alafenamide ( TAF) Child and Adolescent ( Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily with food in ARV -naive patients or in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies /mL) for at least 6 months with no known mutations associated with resistance to DRV or tenofovir. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-102 When twice -daily DRV/r was used in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in 13 patients with HIV aged 13 to 16 years, both TDF and DRV exposures were lower than those found in adults treated with the same combination.2 No dose adjustment is recommended when using DRV/r with TDF, but caution is advised and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be useful . Data from the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT ) protocol P1058A indicate that coadministe ring with once -daily or twice -daily ETR in children, adolescents, and young adults aged 9 years to <24 years did not have a significant effect on DRV plasma concentrations .3 When DRV/r was coadministered with ETR twice daily in pediatric patients, target concentrations for both DRV and ETR were achieved.4 DRV PKs DRV was coadministered with rilpivirine (RPV) in a study of adolescents and young adults .5 DRV/r coadministration increased RPV exposure twofold to threefold ; clos e monitoring for RPV -related adverse events is advisable. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and fatigue . Less common: Skin rash, including erythema multiforme and Stevens -Johnson syndrome , fever and elevated spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs. Hepatic dysfunction, particularly in patients with underlying risk factors , such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus coinfection. Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval DRV/r is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a component of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in treatment -naive and treatment -experienced children aged 3 years. DRV is approved by the FDA t o be administered with COBI (Tybost) boosting in pediatric patients weighing 40 kg. The combinations (FDCs ) DRV/c (Prezcobix) and Symtuza (DRV/c/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) are also approved by the FDA for use in pediatric patients weighing 40 kg. Efficacy in Clinical Trials In an international, multisite clinical trial ( TMC114- TiDP29 -C228 ) that enrolled treatment- experienced 3 years to <6 years, 17 (81% ) of 21 children who received DRV/r twice daily had viral loads <50 copies/mL at Week 48.6-8 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-103 A randomized, open- label, multicenter pediatric trial8 that evaluated twice -daily DRV/r among 80 treatment -experienced children aged 6 years to <18 years reported that 66% of patients had plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 51% had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24. Once -daily D RV/r has been investigated in a small stud y involving 12 treatment -experienced children aged 6 to 12 year s who had maintained HIV viral loads <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months.9 All but one child continued to have undetectable viral loads during a median of 11.6 months of follow -up (range 0.5 -14.2 months). The remaining child had detectable viral load measurements between 20 copies/mL and 200 copies/ mL on three occasions during a 3- month period before , again , becoming undetectable without a change in regimen. In one study, 12 participants aged 12 to 17 year s received DRV/r once daily.10 After 48 weeks, all but one participan t had viral loads <50 copies/m L. Pharmacokinetics and Dosing Pharmacokinetics in Children Aged 3 Years to <6 Years Twenty -one children aged 3 years to <6 years and weighing 10 kg to <20 kg received twice -daily DRV/r oral suspension. These children had experienced virologic failure on their previous ARV regimens and had fewer than three DRV resistance mutations , confirm ed by genotypic testing .6,7,11 The DRV area under the curve (AUC 0-12h), measured as a percent of the adult AUC value,6,7,11 was 128% overall : 140% in children wei ghing 10 kg to <15 kg and 122% in children weigh ing 15 kg to <20 kg. Pharmacokinetics in Children Aged >6 Years Initial pediatric PK evaluation of DRV tablets and RTV oral solution or tablets was based on a Phase 2 randomized, open -label, multicenter study that enrolled 80 treatment -experienced children and adolescents aged 6 years to <18 years and weighing 20 kg.12 Part 1 of the trial used a weight - adjusted dose of DRV (9 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg) and RTV (1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg) twice daily, approximating the standard adult dose of DRV/r 600 mg/100 mg twice daily on a per-weight basis . This dose resulted in inadequate drug exposure in the pediatric population studied, with a 24-hour AUC (AUC 24h) that was 81% of the AUC 24h observed in adults and a pre -dose concentration (C 0h) that was 91% of the C 0h observed in adults . A pediatric dose that was 20% to 33% higher than the directly scaled adult dose was needed to achieve a drug exposure that was similar to that found in adult s, and this was the dose selected for Part 2 of the study. The higher dose used for the safety and efficacy evaluation was DRV 11 mg/kg to 19 mg/kg and RTV 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg twice daily. This dose resulted in representing 102% and 114% of the respective values in adults. Doses were given twice daily and were stratified into body-weight bands of 20 kg to <30 kg and 30 kg to <40 kg. The current weight -band doses of twice -daily DRV/r for treatment -experienced pediatric patients weighing >20 kg to <40 kg were selected using the findings from the safety and efficacy portion of this study (see Table A below ). A small study that involved 12 treatment -experienced children aged 6 to 12 years examined the PK s and efficacy of DRV/r once daily administered in combination with abacavir and lamivudine .9 All participants had maintained HIV plasma viral loads <50 copies/m L for at least 6 months prior to beginning this regimen. The weight -based doses use d for once -daily DRV/r were based on a prior Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-104 modeling study :13 600 mg/100 mg for patients weighing 15 kg to 30 kg, 675 mg/100 mg for patients weighing 30 kg to 40 kg, and 800 mg /100 mg for patients weighing >40 kg. The geometric mean AUC 0-24h was below the study target of 80% of the value seen in adults (63.1 mg\u00b7h/L vs. 71.8 mg \u00b7h/L), but the trough values that were observed at 23.1 hours to 25.1 hour s after the previous dose exceed ed the trough plasma concentration recommended for treatment-experienced adult s (0.55 mg/L) .14 One child d eveloped neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety and hallucinations) and was removed from study. T his child did not have an excessive exposure to DRV; the AUC 0-24 was 47.8 mg \u00b7h/L.

Key: AUC 12h = 12-hour Pharmacokinetic used without a PK enhancer (boosting agent). R TV may be used as a boosting agent in children and adults. COBI may be used as a boosting agent in children weighing 40 kg and adults. A study that enrolled 19 Thai children used the RTV 100-mg capsule twice daily as the boosting dose for twice -daily DRV 375 mg (in children weighing 20 kg to <30 kg), 450 mg (in children weighing 30 kg to 40 kg), and 600 mg (in children weighing 40 kg).15 The DRV exposures with RTV 100 mg Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-105 twice daily were similar to those obtained in the studies with lower (<100 mg) doses of liquid RTV .12,15 The tolerability and PK data from this small study support the use of RTV 100 mg for boosting using either the powder or tablet formulation in children weighing 20 kg, particularly in instances where the lower -dose formulations are unavailable or a child does not tolerate the liquid RTV formulation. N o data are available on the safety and tolerability of using the RTV 100-mg tablet or powder formulation in children weighing < 20 kg. Data on the dosing of DRV/c are available primarily for adult patients.16 Data on once -daily use of the FDC tablet DRV/c 800 mg/150 mg (Prezcobix) showed bioavailability that was comparable to the bioavailability observed with the use of DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily.14 In an open -label switch study, eight adolescent patie nts with a median age of 14 years (range 12-17 years ) who receiv ed DRV/c had DRV exposures (AUC tau) that were similar to those observed in adults, except for a lower trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval (C tau). The median DRV C tau (494 ng/mL) was above the protein binding-adjusted -maximal inhibitory concentration for wild-type virus (55 ng/mL). Adoles cent patients in this study received the adult dose of COBI 150 mg daily. DRV dosing was based on weight , with patients who weighed 40 kg receiving DRV 800 mg once daily and patients who weighed 30 kg to <40 kg receiving DRV 675 mg once daily. In this sma ll sample, 95.5% of patients had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 12. COBI appeared to be well tolerated with no discontinuations due to adverse events .17 Frequency of Administration In February 2013, the FDA approved the use of once -daily DRV for treatment -naive children and for treatment -experienced children without DRV resistance -associated mutations ( see Table B below ). Population PK modeling and simulation were used t o develop recommendations for once -daily dosing in younger pediatric subjects aged 3 years to <12 years and we ighing 10 kg to <40 kg.7,18 Currently, l imited data exist on the efficacy of once -daily DRV/r dosing in treatment-na ive or treatment -experienced children aged < 6 years. Therefore, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) generally recommends dosing DRV/r twice daily in children aged 3 years to <12 years (see Once -Daily Administration in Children Aged <12 Years and Weighing <40 kg below ). The Panel recommends that once -daily DRV/r be used only in treatment-na ive and treatment -experienced adolescents weighing 40 kg who do not have mutations that are associated with DRV resistance. If DRV and RTV are used once daily in children aged <12 years, the Panel recommends conducting a PK evaluation of plasma concentrations of DRV and close ly monitoring viral load.

Key: DRV = darunavir; RTV = ritonavir Once- in Children Aged <12 Years and Weighing <40 kg During the TMC114-C228 trial, the researchers investigated once -daily dosing of DRV for 2 weeks; DRV PKs were evaluated in treatment -experienced children aged 3 years to <12 years as part of a substudy. After the conclusion of the substudy, the participant s switched back to a twice-daily regimen.18,19 The DRV/r dose for once -daily use , which was based on PK simulation and which did not include a relative bioavailability factor , was DRV 40 mg/kg coadministered with approximately 7 mg/kg of RTV for children weighing <15 kg and DRV/r 600 mg /100 mg once daily for children weighing 15 kg.18,19 The PK data obtained from 10 children aged 3 to 6 years in this substudy (see Table C below ) were included as part of the population PK modeling and simulation that was used to determine the FDA -approved dose for once -daily DRV/r in children aged 3 years to <12 years. In a small study in which DRV/r was administered once daily to 12 treatment -experienced children aged 6 to 12 years,9 the geometric mean AUC 0-24h achieved was below the study target of 80% of the value seen in adults (63.1 mg\u00b7h/L vs. 71.8 mg \u00b7h/L). Trough values exceeded the plasma concentration that is recommended for treatment -experienced patients (0.55 mg/L). Despite the FDA dosing guidelines, the Panel generally recommends dosing DRV/r twice daily in children aged Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-107 3 years to <12 years. The Panel makes this recommendation because of the small data set used for once -daily DRV/r PK modeling and the limited amount of data on the use of once -daily DR V/r in children aged <12 years.

D RV exposure s were found to be similar to those observed in adults with once -daily dosing in another study in which a single dose of DRV 800 mg with RTV 100 mg was administered to 24 subjects with a median age of 19.5 years (range 14-23 years).21 However, DRV exposures were slightly below the lower target concentrations in adolescent patients age d 14 to 17 years (n = 7) within the cohort, suggesting that higher doses may be needed in younger adolescents. A single case report involving a highly treatment -experienced adolescen t patient suggests that using an increased DRV dose with standard RTV boosting and employing TDM can lead to virologic suppression.

For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonat e (Aged <14 Days) Dose Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in neonates before a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days. Dosing for Individuals Who Are Not Receiving Concomitant Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Fosamprenavir, or Nelfinavir Infant (Aged 14 Days -12 Months) Dose Once -daily dosing is not recommended . LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily. This approximates LPV/r 16 mg/4 mg (both per kg body weight ) twice daily. Use of t his dose in infants aged <12 months is associated with lower LPV trough levels than those found in adults; LPV dosing should be adjusted for growth at frequent intervals (see Pharmacokinetics and Dosing bel ow). Child and Adolescent (Aged >12 Months to 18 Years) Dose Once -daily dosing is not recommended . LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (maximum dose LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg twice daily , except as noted below) . For patients weighing <15 kg, this dose approximates LPV/r 13 mg/3.25 mg (both per kg body weight ) Gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, alteration of taste Hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia Elevated transaminases Hyperglycemia PR interval prolongation QT interval prolongation and T orsades de P ointes Risk of toxicity \u2014including life -threatening cardiotoxicity \u2014is increased in premature infants (see Major Toxicities below) Special Instructions LPV/r tablets can be administered without regard to food; administration with or after meals may enhance GI tolerability. LPV/r tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush or split tablets. LPV/r oral solution should be administered with food, because a high- fat meal increases absorption. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-109 twice daily . For patients weighing 15 kg to 45 kg, this dose approximates LPV/r 11 mg/2.75 mg (both per kg body weight ) twice daily. This dose is routinely used by many clinicians and is the preferred dose for antiretroviral therapy (ART) -experienced patients who could harbor virus with decreased LPV susceptibility ( see Pharmacokinetics and Dosing). LPV/r 230 mg/57.5 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily can be used in antiretroviral (ARV) -naive patients aged >1 year . For patients weighing <15 kg, this dose approximates LPV/r 12 mg/3 mg per kg body weight given twice daily. For patients weighing 15 kg to 40 kg, this dose approximates LPV/r 10 mg/2.5 mg per kg body weight given twice daily. This lower dose should not be used in treatment - experienced patients who could harbor virus with decreased LPV susceptibility . Weight- Band Dosing for Lopinavir 100-mg/Ritonavir 25-mg Tablets and Adolescents Recommended Number of LPV/r 100 -mg/25 -mg Tablets Given Twice Daily Dosing target 300 mg/m2 per dose given twice daily 230 mg/m2 per dose given twice daily Body Weight 15 kg to 20 kg 2 2 >20 kg to 25 kg 3 2 >25 kg to 30 kg 3 3 >30 kg to 35 kg 4a 3 >35 kg to 45 kg 4a 4a >45 kg 4a or 5b 4a a Two tablets that each contain LPV/r 200 mg/50 mg can be substituted for the four LPV/r 100 -mg/25- mg tablets in children who are capable of swallowing a larger tablet. b In patients who weigh >45 kg and who are dose is LPV/r 500 mg/125 mg twice daily, given as a combination of two tablets of LPV/r 200 mg/50 mg and one tablet of LPV/r 100 mg/25 mg. Alternatively , three tablets of LPV/r 200 mg/50 mg can be used for ease of dosing. Adult (Aged >18 Years) Dose LPV/r 800 mg/200 mg once daily ; or LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg twice daily Do not use once- daily dosing in children; adolescents ; in patients receiving concomitant therapy with NVP , EFV, FPV, or NFV; or in patients with three or more LPV- associated mutations (see Special Instructions for a list of mutations ). The poor palatability of LPV/r oral solution is difficult to mask with flavorings or foods (see Formulations below ). LPV/r oral solution can be kept at room temperature (up to 77\u00baF or 25\u00baC ) if used within 2 months. If to 46\u00baF or 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC) , LPV/r oral solution remains stable until the expiration date printed on the label. Children aged <18 years who receive once- daily dosing of LPV/r have shown considerable variability in plasma concent rations and have a higher incidence of diarrhea. Therefore, once- daily dosing is not recommended for this age group. Use of LPV/r once daily is contraindicated if three or more of the following LPV resistance- because higher LPV trough concentrations may be required to suppress resistant virus. Metabolism /Elimination Cytochrome P 450 3A4 substrate and in Patients with Hepatic Impairment LPV/r is primarily metabolized by the liver. Use caution when administering LPV to patients with hepatic impairment. No dosing information is currently available for children or adults with hepatic insufficiency. In the coformulation of LPV/r , ritonavir a pharmacokinetic enhancer, not as an ARV agent. It does this by inhibiting the metabolism of LPV and increasing LPV plasma concentrations. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-110 Dosing for Individuals with Three or More Lopinavir - Associated Mutations ( See Special Instructions for L ist) LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg twice daily Dosing for Individuals Receiving Concomitant Nevirapine or Efavirenz These drugs induce LPV metabolism and reduce LPV plasma levels . Increased LPV/r dosing is required with concomitant administration of these drugs. Once -daily dosing should not be used in these patients . Child and Adolescent (Aged >12 Months to 18 Years) Dose LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily. See the table above for weight -band dosing when using tablets. Adult (Aged >18 Years) Dose The FDA-approved dose is LPV/r 500 mg/125 mg twice daily, given as a combination of two tablets of LPV/r 200 mg/50 mg and one tablet of LPV/r 100 mg/25 mg . Alternatively, three tablets of LPV/r 200 mg/50 mg can be used for ease of dosing. Once -daily dosing should not be used . Lopinavir/Ritonavir Used in Combination with Maraviroc Maraviroc doses may need modification ( see the Maraviroc section ). Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism : Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r ) is a cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A 4 substrate and inhibitor with the potential for multiple drug interactions. Coadminist ering LPV/r with dr ugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease LPV plasma concentrations , whereas coadministe ring LPV/r with other inhibitors may concentrations. Coadminist ering LPV/r with other CYP3A4 substrates may require dose adjustment s and additional monitoring. Before initiating therapy with LPV/r , a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. In patients treated with LPV/r , fluticasone (a commonly used inhaled and intranasal steroid) should b e avoided , and an alternative steroid should be used. Drug interactions with antituberculous drugs are common ; patients who are receiving both LPV/r and antituberculous drugs may need a dose adjustment for LPV/r, or they may need to switch to an antiretrov iral (ARV) regimen that does not include LPV/r. Major Toxicities More common : Diarrhea, headache, asthenia, nausea and vomiting, rash, insulin resistance .1 Hyperlipidemia, especiall y hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia ,2-4 which may be Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-111 more pronounced in girls than in boys .5 LPV requires a higher dose of ritonavir (RTV) than some other protease inhibitors (PIs) ; this higher dose may exacerbate these adverse events (AEs) . Rare: bleeding in hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, elevation in serum transaminases, hepatitis (which has been life-threatening in rare cases). PR interval prolongation, QT interval prolon gation, and Torsades de P ointes may occur. Special populations \u2014neonates: A n increased risk of toxicity in premature infants has been reported, includ ing cases of transient symptomatic adrenal insufficiency,6,7 life-threatening bradyarrhythmias and cardiac bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy),8-10 lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, central nervous system depression, and respiratory depression. T hese to xicities may be caused by the drug itself and/or by the inactive ingredients in the oral solution,10 which include propylene glycol (15.3%) and ethanol (42.4% ). Transient asymptomatic elevation in 17 -hydroxyprogesterone levels has also been reported6 in term newborns treated at birth with LPV/r . The pharmacokinetics (PKs) and safety of LPV/r studied in IMPAACT P1106, an opportunistic , multi- arm, Phase 4 prospective study in newborns who receiv ed ARV and anti -tuberculosis medicines in clinical care. A total of 25 neonates with HIV were enrolled, with a median birth weight of 2,130 g (interquartile range [IQR] 1,775-2,630 g) and a median gestational age of 35 weeks (IQR 32-37 weeks ). Neonates receiv ed LPV/r solution at a dose of 300 mg /75 mg per m2 twice daily, which was well tolerated and not associated with any treatment -related AEs , even in 13 newborns who initiated therapy prior to 42 weeks postmenstrua l age at a mean postnatal age of 37 days (range 13-61 days).11 Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval LPV/r is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children, including neonates who have attained a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days. The potential benefit of using LPV/r in premature infants who have not met these age thresholds must be carefully balanced with the risk of metabolic and cardiac toxicity. In pediatric patients receiving LPV/r at a dose of 300 mg/75 mg per m2 twice daily, lower LPV exposure has been observed in infants aged < 6 weeks relative to older children.12 Efficacy Clinical trials involving antiretroviral therapy (ART )-naive adults have shown that regimens that contain LPV/r plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs ) are comparable to a variety of that regimens that contain LPV/r plus two NRTIs are superior to regimens that contain nelfinavir (NFV) and inferior to regimens that contain DRV.13-21 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-112 LPV/r has been studied in both ART -naive and ART -experienced children and has demonstrated durable virologic activity and acceptable toxicity .22-30 Pharmacokinetics General Considerations Children have lower drug exposure than adults when treated with doses that are directly scaled for body surface area. The directly scaled dose approximation of the adult dose in children is calculated by dividing the adult dose by the usual adult body surface area of 1.73 m2. For the adult dose of LPV/r 400 mg /100 mg, the scaled pediatric dose would be approximately LPV/r 230 mg /57.5 mg per m2 of body surface area . However, younger children have enhanced LPV clearance and need higher doses to achieve LPV exposures that are similar to those seen in adults treated with standard doses. To achieve a trough c oncentration (C trough) similar to that observed in adults, the pediatric dose needs to be increased 30% greater than the dose that is directly scaled for body surface area. L PV exposures in infants12,24,29 are compared to those in older children22 and adults31 in Table A below. Table A .

The data were provided by Edmund Capparelli, Pharm .D., in a personal communication (April 18, 2012). Note : Values are means; all data come from studies wherein none of the participants received non-nucleoside r everse transcriptase inhibitors as part of their antiretroviral therapy . Key: AUC = area under the curve; C max = maximum concentration; C min = minimum concentration; C trough = trough concentration; LPV = l opinavir ; mcg = microgram; milligram ; mL = milliliter; PK = pharmacokinetic Models suggest that diet, body weight , and postnatal age are important factors in LPV PKs, with improved bioavailability as dietary fat increases during the first year of life32 and with clearance slowing by age 2.3 years.33 A study from the U nited Kingdom and Ireland compared outcomes of LPV/r treatment with either 230 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose or 300 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose in children aged 5.6 to 12.8 years at the time of LPV/r initiation . The findings suggest ed that the higher dose w as associated with improved long-term viral load suppression.34 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-113 Pharmacokinetics and Dosing 14 Days to 12 Months (Without Concurrent Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Fosamprenavir, or Nelfinavir) The PK s of the oral solution at approximately LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily were evaluated in infants aged <6 weeks12 and infants aged 6 weeks to 6 months.24 Even at this higher dose, C trough levels were highly variable , but they were lower in infants than in children aged >6 months. C trough levels were lower in infants aged 6 weeks than in infants aged 6 weeks to 6 months. By age 12 months, LPV area under the curve (AUC) was similar to that found in older children.29 Because infants grow rapidly in the first months of life, it is important to optimize LPV dosing by adjusting the dose at frequent intervals. Given the safety of doses as high as 400 mg per m2 of body surface area in older children and adolescents,25 some practitioners anticipate rapid infant growth and prescribe doses somewhat higher than the 300 mg per m2 of body surface area dose to allow for projected growth between clinic appointments. 12 Months to 12 Years (Without Con current Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Fosamprenavir, or Nelfinavir) Lower trough concentrations have been observed in children receiving LPV/r 230 mg /57.5 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily than in children receiving LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (see T able A above ).21 Therefore, some clinicians choose to initiate therapy in children aged 12 months to 12 years using LPV/r 300 mg /75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (when LPV/r is given -approved dose of LPV/r 230 mg /57.5 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily. For infants receiving LPV/r 300 mg /75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily, immediate dose reduction at age 12 months is not recommended ; many practitioners would allow patients to \"grow into\" the LPV/r 230 mg /57.5 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily dose as they gain wei ght over time. Some practitioners would continue the infant dose (LPV /r 300 mg /75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily) while using the LPV/r liquid formulation. Pharmacokinetics and Dosing with Concurrent Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Fosamprenavi r, or In both children and adults , the LPV Ctrough is reduced by concurrent treatment with non-nucleoside reverse inhibitors (NNRTIs ) or concomitant FPV or NFV . Higher doses of LPV are recommended when the drug is given in combination NVP , EFV , FPV , or who were treated with LPV/r 230 mg /57.5 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily plus NVP ,22 the mean LPV Ctrough was 3.77 \u00b1 3.57 mcg/mL. Not only are these trough plasma concentrations lower than those found in adults treated with standard doses of LPV/r , but the variability in concentration is much higher in children than in adults.22,35 In a study of 15 children with HIV aged 5.7 to 16.3 years who were treated with LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily plus EFV 14 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, there was a 34 -fold interindividual variation in LPV trough concentrations . Five of 15 children (33%) had LPV 12-hour trough concentrations that were < 1.0 mcg/mL, the plasma concentration needed to inhibit wild-type Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-114 HIV.36 A PK study in 20 children age d 10 to 16 years who were treated with LPV/r 300 mg/75 mg per m2 of body surface area twice daily plus EFV 350 mg per m2 of body surface area once daily reported only one patient (6.6%) with subtherapeutic LPV trough concentrations,37 perhaps because the trial used a n EFV dose that was approximately 11 mg/kg body weight37 instead of the 14 mg/kg body weight dose used in the trial discussed above .36 Dosing Once Daily A single daily dose of LPV/r 800 mg /200 mg is approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV in treatment -naive adults aged > 18 years. However, once -daily administration cannot be recommended for use in children in the absence of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) ; once - daily administration may be successful in select, closely monitored children.38 There is high interindividual variability in drug exposure for LPV/r, and trough plasma concentrations may fall below the therapeutic range for wild- type virus, as demonstrated in studies of ARV -naive children and adolescents .39-42 The currently available tablet formulation of LPV/r has lower variability in trough levels than the previously used soft -gel formulation.42,43 An international, randomized, open- label trial attempted to demonstrate that once dosing was noninferior to twice -daily LPV/r dosing in children and adolescents with HIV. This trial was unsuccessful , because a greater number of children and adolescents who received once-daily dos es had viral loads 50 copies/mL within 48 weeks .44 Dosing and Its Relation to Efficacy LPV/r is effective in treatment -experienced patients with severe immune suppression,45,46 although heavily pre -treated patients m ay be slower to reach undetectable viral loads46,47 and may have less- robust CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) percentage response s.48 The relationship between LPV exposure and the susceptibility of the HIV -1 isolate is a key component of successful treatment . The ratio of C trough to half maximal effective concentration ( EC 50) is called the inhibitory quotient (IQ), and in both adults and children treated with LPV/r , viral load reduction is more closely associated with IQ than with either C trough or EC 50 alone.49-51 One study investigated the use of the IQ as a guide for therapy by administering higher doses of LPV/r to children and adolescents until a target IQ of 15 was reached. This study showed that doses of LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (without FPV mg/120 mg per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (with NVP or EFV ) were safe and tolerable.25 Results of a modeling study suggest that standard doses of LPV/r may be inadequate for treatment -experienced children and suggest the potent ial utility of TDM when LPV/r is used in children who were previously treated with PIs.52 An LPV plasma concentration of 1 mcg/mL is cited as a minimum target C trough,53-55 but this trough concentrat ion may not adequately control viremia in patients with multiple LPV resistance mutations .56,57 Formulations Palatability The poor palatability of the LPV/r oral solution can be a significant challenge to medication adherence for some children and families. Numbing the taste buds with ice chips before or after administe ring the solution, masking the taste of the solution by administ ering it with sw eet or tangy Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-115 foods (e.g., chocolate syrup, peanut butter), or having the pharmacist flavor the solution prior to dispensing it are examples of interventions that may improve tolerability. Alternative pediatric formulations are currently being developed.58,59 Do Not Use Crushed Tablets LPV/r tablets must be swallowed whole. Crushed tablets are slowly and erratically absorbed, and result in significantly reduced AUC, maximum concentration ( Cmax), and C trough compared with swallowing the whole tablet. The variability of the reduced exposure with the crushed tablets (5-75% reduction in AUC) means that a dose modification cannot be relied on to overcome the reduced absorption. Crushed tablets cannot be recommended for us e.60 In a PK study that us ed a generic adult formulation of LPV /r manufactured in Thailand, 21 of 54 children were administered cut (not crushed) pills and had adequate LPV Ctrough measurements.43 Toxicity Children treated with LPV/r may have less -robust weight gain and smaller increases in CD4 percentage than children treated with NNRTI-based regimens .27,61-65 However, one study did not observe th is differe nce in the effect of LPV/r on CD4 count ,66 and another study found that the difference did not persist after a year of therapy .30 Some studies found no difference s betw een the weight gain of children treated with LPV/r and those treated with EFV .64,67 Switching to an EFV - based regimen at or after age 3 years removed the risk of LPV -associated metabolic toxicity, with no loss of virologic control (see Table 16 in Modifying Antiretroviral Regimens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy ).64,65 Bone mineral density improved when children were treated with EFV -containing regimens instead of regimens that contained LPV/r .68 Among 212 children randomized to either remain on an LPV/r-based regimen or switch to an EFV -containing regimen, osteocalcin\u2014 a biochemical marker of bone turnover\u2014was higher in the LPV/r group compared with the EFV group at both 8 weeks and 2 years post -randomization. Levels of C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide did not differ between the two groups .69 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-116 References 1.

Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Child and Adolescent (Aged <18 years) Dose The s afety and efficacy of using fostemsavir (FTR) in children and adolescents aged <18 years have not been established. Adult Dose One tablet twice daily QTc (corrected QT) prolongation with higher than recommended dosages Increased hepatic transaminases in patients with h epatitis B or h epatitis C coinfection Special Instructions Can be taken with or without food. Extended- release tablet must be swallowed whole. Do not chew, crush, or split tablets. Should not be co administered with strong cytochrome P450 ( phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Potential for multiple drug interactions. Check concomitant medications before prescribing FTR. Tablets have s light odor similar t o vinegar . Metabolism /Elimination FTR tromethamine converted c pathways of substrate of CYP3A, esterases, P -glycoprotein, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCR P). TMR is an inhibitor of organic anion transporter ( OAT) P1B1 and OATP1B3; TMR and its are inhibitors of BCRP. Fostemsavir Dosing in P atients with H epatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild -to-severe hepatic impairment. Fostemsavir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment or those on hemodialysis. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-122 Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism : Coa dministration with strong cytochrome P450 3A inducers is contraindicated, active metabolite, temsavir ( TMR ), are significantly reduced, which could result in loss of virologic efficacy. Cardiac t oxicity: Caution is required when used in combination with drugs that are associated with prolongation of the QTc interval of the echocardiogram . Oral contraceptives : Do not exceed 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol daily (statins): TMR may increase plasma concentrations of statins. Other antiretroviral agents : Etravirine may decrease TMR plasma concentrations , but when it is used in combination with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (strong inhibitor), the overall effect on TMR metabolism is negligible and does not require dose modification. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea reported in 5% of patients. Less common : QTc prolongation with higher than recommended doses.1 Increased hepatic transaminases in patients with hepatitis B or h epatitis C coinfection. Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA maintains a list of HIV drug resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. TMR sho wed reduced antiviral activity against HIV s ubtype AE ( the predominate subtype found in Southeast Asia but not commonly found elsewhere in the world). Treatment -emergent glycoprotein (gp120) genotypic M475) have been found in evaluable subjects with virologic failure in clinical trials. However, overall frequency of polymorphisms previously associated with the potential to reduce susceptibility to TMR is low and should not be a barrier to its usage in patients with multidrug resistance. 2 Pediatric Use Fostemsavir (FTR) is a HIV -1 gp120-directed attachment inhibitor that is not approved for use in pediatric pati ents. FTR was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2020 for use in adults in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV ) drugs, with approval limited to heavily treatment -experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV failing their current (ARV) regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations .3 A pharmacokinetic and safety study of FTR in children and adolescents 20 kg will soon be open to enroll ment . (PENTA Foundation: NCT04648280) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-123 Efficacy in Clinical Trials The safety and efficacy of FTR in heavily treatment -experienced adults with HIV were evaluated in the BRIGHTE trial , a Phase 3, double -blind placebo -controlled trial . A total of 371 participants were enrolled into two cohorts (randomized and nonrandomized), depending on remaining treatment options . The randomized cohort included 272 participants , with at least one fully active drug in at least one but no more than two ARV classes that could be added to FTR . Participants received either FTR or a placebo twice daily for 8 days, in addition to their failing ARV regimen. On D ay 8, participants treated with FTR had a significantly greater decrease in levels of HIV -RNA than those taking the placebo (0.79 versus 0.17 log 10 copies, respectively).4 After Day 8 , all participants received FTR as part of an optimized regimen. In r esults reported through 48 weeks,4 54% of participants had an HIV viral load of <40 copies/mL. At Week 96, 60% of participants3 had HIV viral loads of <40 copies/mL and a mean increase in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts of 205 cells/mm3. In 51% (27 out of 53) of evaluable subjects with virologic failure, treatment -emergent gp120 genotypic M426, and M475). In the randomized cohort, virologic response rates increased over time, between the 24-week and 96-week analys es. Response rates were associated with better susceptibility scores for new optimized treatment regimens .5 Patients with the lowest CD4 counts at baseline were more likely to experience serious adverse events or death.5 An additional nonrandomized cohort of 99 patients who had no active drugs as treatment options but had FTR added to an optimized ARV regimen was studied . Of these, 38% achieved an HIV viral load of <40 copies/mL at 48 weeks.4 For this cohort , at 96 week s,3 37% of participants had HIV viral loads of <40 copies/mL , and the mean increase in CD4 counts was 119 cells/mm3. Improvements in patient -reported outcomes in health-related quality of life were observed among participants in both cohorts of the BRIGHTE trial at 48 weeks.6 Mechanism of Action FTR tromethamine is a prodrug of TMR, an HIV -1 gp120-directed attachment inhibitor. F TR is rapidly converted to TMR after oral administration. TMR binds directly to the HIV -1 gp120 and prevents viral attachment and subsequent entry of virus into host T cells. F TR has a novel mechanism of action and no in vitro cross -resistance with other ARVs , and it can be used regardless of HIV-1 tropism .2 Pharmacokinetics FTR is pre -systemically metabolized to the active moiety TMR by alkaline phosphatase in the luminal surface of the small intestine , and then TMR is rapidly absorb ed. In healthy adults, the estimated t \u00bd is approximately 11 hours.7 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-124 References 1.

Each single -dose vial contains the following inactive ingredients : L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, and additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Child and Adolescent Dose The s afety and efficacy of using ibalizumab (IBA) in children and adolescents has not been established. Adult Dose A single -loading dose infusion of IBA 2,000 mg administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes is followed by a maintenance dose of IBA 800 mg administered IV over 15 minutes every 2 weeks. U.S. Food and Drug Administration a pproval of IBA is limited to heavily treatment -experienced adults with multidrug -resistant HIV infection who are experiencing treatment failure on their current regimen. IBA is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, rash Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome In studies of cynomolgus macaque monkeys, IBA use during pregnancy was associated with reversible immunosuppression (CD4+ T and B cell lymphopenia) in offspring with IBA exposure in utero.1 Whether this association exists for infants of women treated with IBA during pregnancy is unknown. Potential for immunogenicity in the form of anti -IBA antibodies Special Instructions The solution in the vial must be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and administered by IV infusion. Using aseptic technique, withdraw 1.33 mL from each vial and transfer into a 250- mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for IV injection. Other IV diluents must not be used. Once diluted, the solution should be administered immediately. If not used immediately, the solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours or refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Refrigerated solution should be allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but no more than 4 hours prior to administration. Diluted solution is administered as an IV infusion, not as a bolus or IV push. Metabolism /Elimination Monoclonal antibodies are metabolized to peptides and amino acids .

Base d on IBA 's mechanism of action and target -mediated drug Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-125 disposition, drug-drug interactions are not expected. However, no drug interaction studies have been conducted.1 Major Toxicities More common: Rash , diarrhea , headache, nausea , dizziness , depression1,2 Less common (more severe) : Immune r econstitution i nflammatory s yndrome (IRIS), hypersensitivity reaction1 Resistance HIV has shown reduced susceptibility to IBA, as defined by a decrease in maximum percent inhibition, when HIV loses N -linked glycosylation sites in the V5 loop of glycoprotein 120.1-3 Phenotypic and genotypic test results showed no evidence of cross -resistance between IBA and any U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved classes of antiretroviral ( ARV) drugs .4 IBA exhibits ARV activity against R5 -tropic, X4- tropic, and dual -tropic HIV .4 Pediatric Use Approval IBA is not approved by the FDA for use in pediatric patients. IBA was approved by the FDA in 2018 for use in adults in combination with other ARV drugs, with approval limited to heavily treatment- experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV who are experiencing treatment failure on their current regimen.5 IBA has an orphan drug designation exempt ing the requirement for pediatric studies under the Pediatric Research Equity Act. The FDA reque sted that the company create a registry to collect prospective data in individuals exposed to IBA during pregnancy to monitor maternal and pregnancy outcomes, including adverse effects on the developing fetus, neonate, and infant. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report these adverse events to Theratechnologies by calling 1-833 -23-THERA (1-833-23-4372). Efficacy in Clinical Trials Trial Tai Med Biologics (TMB -301) was conducted in 40 adults aged 23 to 65 years who had body weight s ranging from 50 kg to 130 kg, had resistance to ARV drugs from three classes, had been treated for at least 6 months on stable ARV regimen s, had viral loads >1,000 copies/mL, and had viral sensitivity to at least one ARV drug.3,5 Participants continued their current ARV regimens and recei ved a 2,000- mg loading dose of IBA on D ay 7 of the study. One week after the loading dose, participants optimized their ARV regimens . Participants received IBA 800 mg on Day 21 and every 2 weeks thereafter. A t Week 25, 43% of participants achieved suppressed viral loads1,3 of <50 copies/mL . At Week 48 of an open- label extension study, 24 participa nts were taking IBA and their optimized ARV regimen. Sixteen of 27 participants (59%) had viral loads <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks.6,7 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-126 Mechanism of Action IBA is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks HIV from infecting CD4 cells. It does this by binding to domain 2 of the CD4 receptor, which interferes with the post -attachment steps that allow HIV virus particles to enter host cells and prevent the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion.1,7 IBA does not interfere with CD4- mediated immune functions because it binds to a conformational epitope located primarily in domain 2 of the extracellular portion of the CD4 receptor, away from Major Histocompatibility Complex II molecule binding sites . Embryo -Fetal Toxicity In an enhanced pre - and post -natal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered intravenous doses of IBA and s ignificant changes in infant monkey immune cell levels were found (CD4+ T cell and B cell lymphocytopenia ) that were attributed to in utero IBA exposure .1 The lymphocyte changes correlated with infant monkey IBA serum concentrations and appeared to return to near normal levels when IBA concentrations were nearly undetectable. One treatment -group infant monkey died from a systemic viral infection with secondary superficial bacterial infection that was acquired during the postnatal period. Despite the low incidence of death (1 of 20 infant monkeys), the death may be related to IBA -induced immunosuppression.1 Based on th ese animal data, IBA may cause reversible immunosuppression (CD4+ T cell and B cell lymphocytopenia) in infants born to mothers treated with IBA during pregnancy. Immune phenotyping of the peripheral blood and expert consultation are recommended to provide guidance regard ing monitoring and management of exposed infants based on the degree of immunosuppression observed. Furthermore, t he safety of administering live or live -attenuated vaccines to infants with in utero IBA expos ure and abnormal lymphocyte levels is unknown.

Data are insufficient to make dosing recommendations. Recommended Maraviroc Dose for Adults : Tablets When Coa dministered With Dose Non-interacting concomitant medications, including NRTIs, T -20, NVP, and RAL 300 mg twice daily Metabolism /Elimination MVC is a substrate of CYP3A4 . If a patient is receiving antiretroviral agents or other medications that act as CYP3A inducers or inhibitors, the dose of MVC should be adjusted accordingly. Maraviroc Dosing in P atients with H epatic Impairment Use caution when administering MVC to patients with hepatic impairment ; MVC concentrations may be increased in these patients . Maraviroc Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment No data recommend specific doses of MVC for pediatric patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. M VC is contraindicated for pediatric patients with severe renal impairment or end- stage renal disease who are on regular hemodialysis and who are receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors . Refer to the manufacturer's prescribing information for the appropriate doses to use in adolescent and adult patients with renal impairment. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-128 Potent CYP3A inhibitors (with or without a potent CYP3A inducer) , including all PIs 150 mg twice daily Potent CYP3A inducers (without a potent CYP3A inhibit or), including EFV and ETR 600 mg twice daily Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Absorption: Absorption of maraviroc (MVC) is slightly reduced with ingestion of a high-fat meal. Food restrictions were not part of either the adult trials (which used the tablet formulation) or the pediatric trial ( which used both the tablet and oral solution formulations) that demonstrated the efficacy, antiviral activity, and safety of MVC . Therefore, MVC can be given with or without food. Metabolism : MVC is a cytochrome P 450 (CYP ) 3A and p-glycoprotein (P -gp) substrate and requires dose adjustments when administered with medications that modulate CYP 3A or P -gp. A patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions before MVC is administered ; recommended MVC doses are based on concomitant medications and their anticipated effect on MVC metabolism . Major Toxicities More common: Cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, musculoskeletal symptoms, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Dizziness occurred in 12.2% of adults but only 3.2% of children when MVC was administered twice daily. Less common (more severe): Hepatotoxicity has been reported; some cases were preceded by evidence of a systemic allergi c reaction (including pruritic rash, eosinophilia, or elevated levels of immunoglobulin). Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in < 2% of MVC -treated adult patients and included cardiovascular abnormalities e.g., angina, heart failure, myocardial Action MVC is a CCR5 receptor antagonist that selectively binds to the human chemokine receptor CCR5 on the cell membrane, preventing interaction between HIV -1 gp120 and CCR5 tropic HIV -1, inhibiting viral entry into the cell. Resistance An HIV tropism assay should be performed before MVC is administered to a patient. Clinical failure may also represent the outgrowt h of CXCR4-using (naturally resistant) HIV variants. However, in circumstances when MVC is needed for presumptive HIV therapy for full -term neonates at high risk Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-129 of perinatal HIV transmission , initiation of MVC should not be deferred until assay results are available, and consultation with an HIV expert is recommended. Pediatric Use Approval MVC was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admi nistration (FDA) for treatment in full - term infants weighing 2 kg when used in conjunction with other antiretroviral drugs.1 MVC had previously been approved by the F DA for use in children 2 years and weighing 10 kg, as well as adolescents and adults who have CCR5-tropic HIV -1.2 Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials ( IMPAACT 2007) study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of MVC added to a 6-week prophylactic antiretroviral regimen to prevent perinatal HIV transmission of HIV among infants born to mothers living with HIV.2 Analyses were stratified by exposure to efavirenz (EFV), either in utero or through breastmilk versus non-EFV exposure. The MVC exposure target was average plasma concentration (Cavg) 75 ng/mL, as determined by adult treatment studies. MVC oral solution was dosed at 8 mg/kg twice daily for the first 6 weeks of life. Among 25 infants with evaluable PK data , 12 of whom were EFV -exposed, of the EFV -exposed infants achieved a C avg 75 ng/mL at Week 1, whereas 77% of the EFV -unexposed infants had a C avg 75 ng/mL. At W eek 4, the proportion of infants achieving a C avg 75 ng/mL declined to 42% among EFV -exposed infants and 31% among EFV -unexposed infants. No infants in the study met safety endpoints or discontinue d MVC during the study and no infant s acquired HIV. The F DA recommendation for MVC dosing among children >6 weeks of life but younger than 2 years of age is based on modeling using PK data from the IMPAACT 2007 study. When considering the use of MVC for neonates and infants , a pediatric HIV specialist should be consulted. PK, safety, and efficacy of MVC for treatment -experience d children, ages 2 years to <18 years and weighing 10 kg, who had plasma HIV RNA >1,000 copies/mL, were examined in a n international dose-finding and efficacy study (A4001031). O f the 103 children who participated in the study, 51% had HIV-1 subtype C, 25% had subtype B, and 23% had other subtypes. In this trial, the MVC dose was based on body surface area and the composition of the patient's optimized background therapy. M ost participants , [90 of 103 participants (87%) ], received MVC in combination with potent CYP3A inhibitors ; 10 participants received MVC with noninteracting medications ; and only 3 participants received MVC with CYP3A inducers (without CYP3A inhibitors). The key pharmacologic target (geometric mean C avg of >100 ng/m L) was achieved with both the tablet and oral solution formulation of MVC .3 From a mean baseline plasma HIV RNA concentration of 4.4 log 10 copies/m L, a decrease of 1.5 log 10 occurred in all four age -based cohorts. Only two participants discontinued the study due to AEs. The most common MVC -related AEs through 48 weeks were diarrhea ( which occurr ed in 20.3% of participants ), vomiting (19.8%), and upper respiratory infections (16.2%). At Week 48, 48% of participants had HIV RNA <48 copies/mL.3 The absolute CD4 T lymphocyte cell count and percentage increased in all four subgroups of the study, with overall median increases of 192 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR] 92-352 cells/mm3) and 4% (IQR 1% to 8 %), respectively.

For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed TAF) ged <2 years and Weighing <14 kg No data currently are available on the appropriate dose of Biktarvy in children aged < 2 years and weighing < 14 kg. Studies are being conducted to identify the appropriate dose for this age and weight group. Child (Aged 2 years) , Adolescent, and Adult Dose One tablet once daily with or without food. Body Weight Dose 14 to <25 kg BIC 30 mg/ FTC 120 mg/ TAF 15 mg 25 kg BIC 50 mg/ FTC 200 mg/ TAF 25 mg The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Biktarvy for use in only antiretroviral therapy -naive patients or to replace the current antiretroviral ( ARV) regimen in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen and who have no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy. S ome members on the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) recommend the use of Biktarvy in patients with prior treatment failure and who have virus containing the M184V mutation ( see Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adults below ). Diarrhea , nausea, headache Special Instructions Administer Biktarvy with or without food. See the Drug Interactions section below for guidance when administering Biktarvy with antacids or iron or calcium supplements . For children unable to swallow a whole tablet, the tablet can be split and each part taken separately as long as all parts are swallowed within approximately 10 minutes . Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before us ing FTC or TAF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV can occur when discontinuing FTC or TAF; therefore, monitor hepatic function for several months after halting therapy with FTC or TAF. Metabolism/Elimination BIC is metabolized by diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-132 Biktarvy Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Biktarvy is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Biktarvy Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Biktarvy is not recommended for use in patients with estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. See the product label for use in patients on dialysis. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Bictegravir (BIC) is UGT1A1 . Coadministration : BIC is an inhibitor of organic cation transporter 2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1, so it decreases tubular secretion of creatinine . This increases serum creatinine and reduc es estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with no change in glomerular function. Drugs that decrease renal function could reduce clearance of FTC . Absorption: Administering BIC concurrently with antacids lowers the plasma concentrations of BIC. This occurs because of the formation of complexes in the gastrointestinal tract and not because of changes in gastric pH. Chelation by high concentrations of divalent cations \u2014such as of integrase strand transfer (INSTIs), including elvitegravir and BIC. For this reason, Biktarvy should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids and supplements or multivitamins that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium , and/or zinc3 when Biktarvy is given on an empty stomach. Biktarvy and antacids or supplements that contain calcium or iron can be taken together with food. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, nausea, headache. In two clinical trials, total b ilirubin increase d by up to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal in 12% of patients who received Biktarvy. In general , however, bilirubin increase w as quite mild and did not lead to drug discontinuations in these trials .2 BIC may cause an increase in creatine kinase concentration. One patient out of 201 in a post-marketing observational study in adult s experienced thrombocytopenia,4 and one participant out of 100 in a prospective cohort study in children and adolescents experienced insomnia/anxiety5 lead ing to drug discontinuation. Weight gain has been reported in adults who were receiving Biktarvy (see Table 15h. Lypodystrophies and Weight Gain ). Less common (more severe): Severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may be more common with INSTIs than with other antiretroviral ( ARV) agents . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-133 Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of HIV drug resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval BIC, available as part of the FDC tablet Biktarvy, containing BIC 50 mg/ FTC 200 mg/ TAF 25 mg, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 for use in adults and in 2019 for use in children or adolescents weighing 25 kg. Biktarvy, containing BIC 30 mg/ FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg was approved by the FDA in 2021 for use in children aged 2 years and weighing 14 to <25kg. Biktarvy is FDA approved for patients who have no ARV treatment history or to replace current ARV regimen s in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA < 50 copies /mL) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 3 months , with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of the FDC .2 However, some Panel members recommend the use of Biktarvy in patients with prior treatment failure and who have virus containing the M184V mutation (see Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adults below ). Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adults In a short -term P hase 1 study, BIC monotherapy at doses of BIC 50 mg or BIC 100 mg was well tolerated . Three out of eight participants in both of these dosing groups achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL within 11 days.6 The efficacy (defined as viral load suppression to HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) and safety (as measured by the incidence of study drug discontinuation or death) of Biktarvy were similar to the efficacy and safety of comparator regimens in two Phase 3 randomized trials in treatment-naive adults . Viral load suppression occurred in 89% of participants who received coformulated BIC 50 mg /FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg ( n = 320) and in 93% of participants who received a regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg plus FTC 200 mg plus TAF 25 mg (n = 325). S tudy drug discontinuation occurred in 1% of participants in both groups. In a separate trial, viral load suppression occurred in 92% of participants who received BIC/FTC/TAF (n = 314) and in 93% of participants who received coformulated abacavir 600 mg /dolutegravir 50 mg/ lamivudine 300 mg (ABC/DTG/3TC) (n = 315). S tudy drug discontinuation was not reported for any of the participants who receiv ed BIC/FTC/TAF, al though it did occur in 1% of participants who receiv ed ABC/DTG/3TC .2,7 Studies that randomized virologically suppressed patients who were on stable ARV regimens to either continue their current regimens or switch to coformulated BIC/FTC/TAF have shown that BIC/FTC/TAF has similar safety and efficacy to existing regimens. V iral load suppression occurred in 94% of participants who were randomized to switch to BIC/FTC/TAF (n = 282) and in 95% of participants who continued taking ABC/DTG/3TC ( n = 281). S tudy drug discontinuation was r eported in 2% of participants who received BIC/FTC/TAF and 1% of participants who received ABC/DTG/3TC. Ninety -two percent of participants who were randomized to switch to BIC/FTC/TAF (n = 290) achieved viral load suppression, whereas 89% of participants w ho continued receiving atazanavir- based or darunavir- based combination ARV regimens (n = 287) achieved viral load suppression. S tudy drug discontinuation occurred in 1% of participants in both groups . 2 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-134 Initial s tudies in participants switching to BIC/FTC/TAF from stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) required undetectable viral load for 3 or 6 months and no proven or presumed preexisting resistance to any of the components of BIC/FTC/TAF .2,8,9 Further analysis of data from the se studies used proviral genotyping and showed presence of M184V/I mutat ion in 54 (10%) of 543 BIC/FTC/TAF - treated participants. Presence of this mutation did not affect viral load suppression, with Week 48 HIV RNA <50 copies/mL in 52 (96%) of 54 partic ipants with archived M184V/I mutations compared Week 48 HIV RNA <50 copies/mL in 561 (98%) of 570 participants without the mutation.10 A study to measure the effect of preexisting nucleoside reverse transcriptase inh ibitor (NRTI ) mutations on virologic outcome in participants switching from a stable regimen to BIC/FTC/TAF showed W eek 48 HIV RNA <50 copies/mL in 223 (94%) of 237 participants without M184V/I resistance and in 42 (89%) of 47 partic ipants with M184V/I mut ations at baseline .11,12 At Week 48, HIV RNA <50 copies/mL was maintained in 199 (93%) of 213 participants with no NRTI resistance mutation and in 66 (93%) of 71 participants with any NRTI resistance mutation, including K65R/E/N, any number preenrollment virologic suppression for 6 months in those with suspected NRTI resi stance and 3 months for those without suspected NRTI resistance .11 In practice, P anel members have used BIC/FTC/TAF even in patients with detectab le viral load, prior ARV failure, or preexisting NRTI mutations ; this is based on the premise that the ability to simplify multi-pill or multi -dose regimens to a single small pill, once daily , can overcome potential resistance barriers with definite adhere nce benefits.13 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of Biktarvy contain ing BIC 50 mg, have been performed in adults , adolescents aged 12 years to <18 years who weigh 35 kg, and children aged 6 years to <12 years who weigh 25 kg. PK studies of \"low -dose\" Biktarvy, which contains BIC 30 mg, have been performed in children aged 2 years weighing 14 to <25 kg.14 These studies show a higher BIC maximum serum concentration ( Cmax) in the younger cohorts than in the older cohorts , perhaps because the administered dose is higher on a mg/kg basis (see Table A below ). The lower trough serum concentration (C tau) and higher C max in the younger age/ lower body weight cohorts suggest more rapid clearance in child ren and adolescents than in adults . In the cohorts with body weight1414 to <25 kg and body weight5 35 kg, there is a lower geometric mean ratio when C tau is compared to adult values, and the low er 90% confidence interval suggests that some patients ha ve quite rapid clearance (see Table B below ). Th ese PK observa tions rais e the concern that some of the patients in the youngest age/ lowest body weight cohort s may experience suboptimal trough concentrations , which may lead to less \"pharmacologic forgiveness\" in persons with lower adherence (see Table B below ).15 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-135 Table A.

The drug was we ll tolerated, and was associated with a fall in eGFR similar to that seen in adult s. This decrease in eGFR was considered to be from changes in tubular secretion of creatinine and was not a true change in glomerular function. In comparing cohorts of children (body weight 14 kg to < 25 kg) and adolescents (body weight 35 kg) to adult cohorts the geometric mean ratio of C tau was noted to be lower (see Tables A and B above ). All 50 participants in the study had viral loads <50 copies/mL at Week 24, and 49 of 50 had viral loads <50 copies/mL at week 48.5 BIC 50 mg/FTC 200 mg /TAF 25 mg was administered to children aged 6 years to <12 years who weighed 25 kg and who had had viral loads <50 copies/mL for 6 months on their current ARV regimens.5 Despite a high AUC and C max (see Table A above ), the drug combination was well tolerated, with a fall in eGFR similar to that seen in adult studies . One participant stopped the study drug because of insomnia and anxiety. The geometric mean ratio of Ctau compared with adult values (see Table B above ) showed trough concentrations similar to those seen in adults .5 All 50 participa nts in the study had viral loads <50 copies/mL at Week 24 and 49 of 50 had viral loads <50 copies/mL at Week 48.5 Use of Biktarvy in Children Weighing 14 to <25 kg Biktarvy tablets consisting of BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF15 mg were administered to children aged 2 years weighing 14 to <25 kg and who had viral load < 50 copies/mL on stable ART . PK evaluation showed high AUC and C max, similar to those in patients aged 6 years to <12 years who weighed 25 kg, a similarly low Ctau (see Table A above ), and a lower geometric mean ratio when Ctau was compared with adult values (see Table B above ).14 In general , the low -dose tablet was well tolerated over 55 weeks in the 22 children studied.16 Adverse events considered related to t he study drug included transient neutropenia (n = 2) and abdominal pain (n = 3).16 At 24 weeks , the me dian change in CD4 cell count was 100 cells/L , and the change in CD4 percent age was +0.5%. HIV RNA at <50 copies/mL was maintained in 20 of 22 participants at 24 weeks .16 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-137 References 1.

For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations ( CAB) 600 mg/3 mL for intramuscular ( IM) injection is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as HIV pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in adults and adolescents weighing 35 kg after an oral dosing lead- in period of approximately 1 month. See package insert for additional information about dosing and administration of CAB as PrEP; this indication is not addressed in the Pediatric Antiret roviral Guidelines . [Cabenuva] Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine (IM CAB and RPV) Pediatric Dose CAB tablets and co- packaged cabotegravir and rilpivirine intramuscular injections (IM CAB and RPV) are not FDA approved for the treatment of HIV in children aged < 12 years.

Oral lead-in dosing with CAB and RPV for at least 28 days can be used to assess tolerability prior to initiating IM CAB and RPV injections or patients can proceed directly to IM CAB and RPV on the last day of their current ARV regimen. Refer to the package insert for instructions about changing the frequency of IM injections, i.e., from monthly to every -2 month dosing or from every -2-month to monthly dosing. Oral Lead-In Dosing o CAB 30 mg orally and RPV 25 mg orally once daily with a meal for at least 28 days . Dosing for Monthly Administration of IM CAB and RPV o On the last day of oral lead- in therapy or the current oral ARV regimen, a loading dose of CAB 600 mg (3 mL) and RPV 900 mg (3 mL) should be given as two separ ate IM injections in separate ventrogluteal sites. o Continuation therapy of CAB 400 mg (2 mL) and RPV 600 mg (2 mL) IM is given 1 month after the loading dose and once a month thereafter, with allowance for a \u00b1 7-day administration window. Dosing for Every- 2-Month Administration of IM CAB and RPV o To initiate every -2-month dosing, CAB 600 mg (3 mL) and RPV 900 mg (3 mL) should be given as two separate IM injections in separate ventrogluteal sites on the last day of oral lead- in or the current oral ARV regimen and 1 month after the initial injections. o After these two initiation injections 1 month apart for 2 months, continuation therapy with IM CAB 600 mg (3 mL) and RPV 900 mg (3 mL) is administered every 2 months , with allowance for a \u00b17- day administration window . Patients should be monitored for approximately 10 minutes for post - injection reactions. A 23- gauge, 1.5 -inch IM needle is recommended for the injection and is provided in the packaging. Longer, 2- inch needles (not included with packaging) should be used in patients with a body mass index >30 kg/m2. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommends that providers review instructions available with the package insert prior to beginning IM administr ation of CAB and RPV. I n-person training also may be helpful and can be requested from the manufacturer ( ViiV). Special Instructions Coadministering oral RPV with drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of RPV. Refer to the RPV package insert for specific instructions regarding use of these products during the oral lead- in dosing. If monthly injections are missed or delayed by more than 7 days and oral therapy has not been taken, clinically reassess the patient to determine if resumption of injection dosing remains appropriate. Refer to the package insert for information about managing planned and unplanned missed doses. IM CAB and RPV is a complete regimen. Coadministration with other ARV drugs is not recommended. When IM CAB and RPV injections are stopped, residual concentrations may remain measurable for up to 12 months or longer. It is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive ARV regimen no later than 1 month after the final injections of IM CAB and RPV. Use CAB and RPV with caution when coadminister ing it with a drug that has a known risk of prolonging the QTc interval or causing Torsades de Pointes (for more information, see CredibleMeds ). Metabolism /Elimination CAB P atients with H epatic Impairment No dose adjustment of CAB or IM CAB and RPV is necessary in patients w ith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Dosing in P atients with R enal Impairment RPV decreases tubular secretion of creatinine and slightly in creases measured serum creatinine, but it does not affect glomerular filtration. No dose adjustment of CAB or IM CAB and RPV is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, IM CAB and RPV should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or end- stage renal disease. These patients should be monitored more frequently for adverse events . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-139 Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Cabotegravir (CAB) is metabolized primarily by (UGT)1A1. Drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 may decrease CAB concentrations and decrease effectiveness. (RPV) a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A admini stered with CYP3A -modulating medications. A patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions before CAB plus RPV is administered . CAB and RPV are both highly protein bound and unlikely to be removed by hemodialysis. Coadminist ering oral RPV with drugs that i ncrease gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of RPV . o Antacids should not be taken less than 2 hours before or less than 4 hours after oral RPV . o H2 receptor antagonists should not be administered less than 12 hours before or less than 4 hours after oral RPV . o Do not use oral RPV with proton pump inhibitors. Rifamycin drugs significantly reduce CAB and RPV plasma concentrations . For patients who are concomitantly receiving rifabutin and RPV , the dose of RPV should be doubled to 50 mg once daily and taken with a meal. Coadministration of the following drugs is contraindicated : o Rifampin and RPV o Rifampin or rifapentine and CAB o Rifabutin and intramuscular (IM) CAB and RPV Major Toxicities More common: Injection site reactions, i nsomnia, rash , elevated creatine phosphokinase serum concentrations More common: In studies of adults, 7.3% of patients who were treated with RPV showed a change in adrenal function characterized by an abnormal 250-microgram adrenocorticotropic hormone st imulation test (peak cortisol level <18.1 micrograms/dL). In a study of adolescents, 6 out of 30 patients (20%) developed this abnormality.1 The clinical significance of these results is unknown. Less common (more severe): Depression or mood changes , suicidal ideation Rare: post -injection reactions including dyspnea, agitation, abdominal cramping, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, and changes in blood pressure Rare: RPV drug-induced liver injury has been reported.2 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-140 Resistance The International A ntiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval CAB oral tablets (Vocabria) and co-packaged CAB and RPV for injection (Cabenuva) were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV in children or adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg and adults . They are not approved for use in children aged<1 2 years. CAB tablets were approved by the F DA in 2021 for use in adults as part of the oral lead -in prior to beginning injectable IM CAB and RPV or as an oral interim treatment when patients will miss planned injections.1,3 CAB and RPV co-packaged extended -release injectable suspensions for IM use are approved for use in patients (monthly or every 2 months ) who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral (ARV) regimen with no history of virologic failure or known resistance affecting either of the component drugs.1 In December 2021, the FDA approved CAB IM (Apretude) for HIV pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg; injections are started after an oral lead-in period of approximately 1 month . Refer to the package insert for additional information about dosing and administration ,4 and s ee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline s for Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV in the United States for further information about the use of CAB for PrEP. Efficacy in Clinical Trials The safety and efficacy of CAB , an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, given in transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI ), have been evaluated in a series of clinical trials conducted in adult s. To date, all studies have included a 4-week oral lead -in period to assess for toxicity prior to initiating the IM CAB and RPV regimen . The Phase 3 Antiretroviral Therapy as Long-Acting Suppression (ATLAS ) study randomized stable, virologically suppressed adults to receive either CAB and RPV (n = 308) or continue their oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 308). Patients assigned to CAB and RPV initiated therapy with an oral regimen for 4 weeks prior to beginning monthly IM injections. The initial assessment at 48 weeks demonstrated that switching to monthly IM CAB and RPV was noninferior to continuing a three -drug oral therapy. After 48 weeks, participants were allowed to transition to injections every 2 months in a follow -up study (ATLAS -2M, see below ); 52 patients remaining on the original ATLAS study were included in the 96-week analysis . One -hundred percent of patients continuing monthly IM CAB and RPV maintained HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL compared to 97% of those switching to IM CAB and RPV from their initial oral ART. Adverse events were more common among patients receiving injectable ART ; injection site reactions were common , but only 1% withdrew from the study because of these events.5 The ATLAS -2M trial randomized participants to monthly IM CAB 400 mg and RPV 600 mg (n = 523) or every -2-month injections of CAB 600 mg and RPV 900 mg (n = 522) ; it enrolled both new patients and those continuing from the ATLAS trial. After 48 weeks, the every -2-month injections were noninferior to monthly injections , with eight confirmed virologic failures in the every 2-month injection group and two in the monthly injection Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-141 group. Of those failing the every 2- month injection regimen, 5 of 8 had archived NNRTI resistance - associated mutations at baseline.6 The First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen (FLAIR ) study enrolled 631 treatment -naive adults and initiated treatment with a standard oral ARV regimen consisting of dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/ 3TC) for 20 weeks. Those patients with documented HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL after 16 weeks were randomized to either continue oral DTG/ABC/3TC (n = 283) or switch to oral CAB and RPV for 4 weeks , followed by monthly injections of CAB and RPV (n = 283). After 96 weeks of randomized therapy, nine participants in each arm had HIV RNA >50 copies /mL. Adverse events were common in both treatment groups , but adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study were observed in only 14 (5%) participants in the IM CAB and RPV group and 4 (1%) in the oral standard care group. Injection site reactions were the most common adverse event s, reported by 245 (88%) participants in the IM CAB and RPV group, and lasted a median of 3 days .7 These studies demonstrated noninferiority of switching to monthly IM CAB and RPV compared to continuing oral ART. In all studies, adult patients expressed a high degree of treatment satisfaction and preference for the IM CAB and RPV regimen. International Maternal Pediatric Adol escent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT ) Study 2017, More Opt ions for Children and Adolescents (MOCHA), is currently in progress to evaluate the safety, tolerability, acceptability, and pharmacokinetic s of this injectable regimen in adolescents (NCT03497676 ). Pharmacokinetics IM CAB reaches its maximum plasma concentration in adults in about 7 days and has a mean half - life of 5.6 to 11.5 weeks. Measurable levels of CAB can be detected in plasma for up to a year or longer. Due to this prolonged drug exposure, it is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive ARV regimen no later than 1 month after the final injections of CAB and RPV to minimize the potential risk of developing viral resistance.1 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-142 References 1.

Some infants may have received raltegravir as presumptive HIV therapy prior to diagnosis. These infants and other infants and children with HIV who have received INSTIs are candidates to switch to once- daily DTG if they are virologically suppressed or have no mutations associated with resistance to INSTIs. Adult Dose One 50- mg DTG film -coated tablet once daily If certain UGT1A or CYP3A inducers are coadministered, administer DTG 50 mg twice daily (see the Drug Interactions section below ). Adults who are INSTI -experienc ed with certain INSTI - associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected INSTI resistance should receive 50 mg DTG twice daily. [Dovato] Dolutegravir/Lamivudine Adult Dose One tablet once daily with or without food as a complete regimen in antiretroviral ( ARV) -naive adults with no known ensure the child takes the full dose and no medication remains in the dosing cup. DTG dispersible tablets may be swallowed whole. If more than one tablet is required, swallow one tablet at a time to reduce the risk of choking. No data exist regarding dispersion in breast milk or any vehicle s other than water. In patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets whole, 50-mg tablets may be either split into halves followed by immediate ingestion of both halves of the tablet, or crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which should be consumed immediately .1 The efficacy of DTG 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with certain combinations of INSTI -resistance mutations (see the Resistance section below). Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before using FDC tablets that contain l amivudine (3TC) . Severe acute exacerbations of HBV can discontinuation of 3TC. P atients with HBV/HIV coinfection who receive Dovato will require additional treatment f or chronic HBV infection. Metabolism /Elimination UGT1A1 and CYP3A substrate \u2014Drugs that induce th ese enzymes and transporters may decrease plasma concentrations of DTG . Drugs that inhibit these enzymes may increase DTG plasma concentrations. Dolutegravir Dosing in P atients with H epatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients w ith mild or moderate hepatic im pairment. Due to the lack of data, DTG is not reco mmended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. FDC tablets containing ABC or 3TC should not be used in patients with impaired hepatic function. Dolutegravir Dosing in P atients with R enal Impairment DTG tubular secretion of creatinine and increases measured serum creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration. No dose adjustment is required in INSTI -naive patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment , or in INSTI -experienced patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Use DTG with caution in INSTI -experienced patients with severe (creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min) , because DTG concentrations will be decreased. The cause of this decrease is u nknown. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-144 mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Dovato Dovato is not approved by the FDA or recommended by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel) for use in children or adolescents as a complete regimen. However, it could be used as part of a three- drug regimen in patients who meet the minimum body weight requirements for each component drug (see the Simplification of Treatment section below ). [Juluca] Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine Adult Dose One tablet once daily with a meal as a complete regimen to replace the current ARV regimen in patients who have been virologically su ppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months , with no history of treatment failure, and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Juluca Juluca is not approved by the FDA or recommended by the Panel for use in children or adolescents as a complete regimen (see the Simplification of Treatment section below ). [Triumeq] Abacavir /Dolutegravir /Lamivudine Child and Adolescent (Weighing 25 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily with or without food For use in patients who are ARV naive or ARV experienced (but INSTI naive) and who are not being treated with UGT1A1 or CYP3A inducers See the Abacavir section for special instructions about testing for abacavir (ABC) hypersensitivity. The FDA -approved dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg is one tablet once daily , but the Panel recommends use of this FDC for patients weighing 25 kg. FDC tablets containing 3TC or ABC should not be used in patients who have C rCl <50 mL/min or who are on dialysis. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . dose adjustments administered with UGT1A-modulating or CYP3A -modulating medications. DTG dosing should be adjusted to twice daily (i.e., twice the usual dose) for drugs such as efavirenz, rifampin, and some ritonavir- concentrations should not be administered with on DTG concentrations . DTG should not be administered with nevirapine because of Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-145 insufficient data on interactions between these drugs . See the product label for a full listing of significant drug-drug interactions. ATV is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. In a recent pharmacologic survey of adult patients who were receiving DTG , patients who also received ATV had plasma concentrations of DTG that were twofold to fourfold higher than those of patients who receiv ed other antiretroviral ( ARV) drugs.2 Before administering DTG , clinicians should carefully review a patient's medication profile for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities More common: Insomnia and headache . Weight gain and increased body mass index (BMI ) have been reported in adults who received DTG in clinical trials (see Table 15h. Ly podyst rophies and Weight Gain ) and in some pediatric and adolescent cohorts .3-6 Less common (more severe): Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional symptoms , and sometimes organ dysfunction ; neuropsychiatric symptoms , especially in patients with a history of psychiatric illness . Multiple post -marketing reports note that neuropsychiatric adverse e ffects (AEs) have occurred after initiation of DTG-based therapy in adults.7,8 Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) : In retrospective observational studies, severe cases of IRIS that requir ed hospitalization appear ed to be more frequent in patients who present ed with advanced HIV disease and who initiat ed treatment with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), particularly DTG .9,10 This phenomenon is presumed to be linked to the rapid decline in HIV RNA observed in patients receiving INSTI -based therapy. Rare: Hepatotoxicity has been reported; two cases of liver injury were presumed to be related to the use of DTG . One of these cases required liver transplantation .11,12 Rare: A single case of drug reaction (or rash) with e osinophilia and systemic s ymptoms (DRESS) has been reported.13 Rare: Early data from a prospective surveillance study of birth outcomes among pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Botswana showed a very small significant increase in the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) among infants born to women who were receiving DTG at the time of conception that has declined over time .14,15 In the most recent analysis of data through March 2021, the prevalence of NTDs among infants born to women on DTG at conception did not differ significantly from those born to women receiving non-DTG regimens.16 Although t he U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cautions that DTG should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy because of potential teratogenicity, after a review of updated evidence regarding teratogenicity risks, the Perinatal Guidelines do not restrict use of DTG in female adolescents and adults who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. (S ee Appendix C. Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health C are Providers , Teratogenicity , and Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States in the Perinatal Guidelines ). Resistance The International A ntiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance D atabase offers a discussion of each mutation . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-146 The efficacy of DTG 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with the INSTI -resistance Q148 substitution plus two or more additional INSTI-resistance mutations. Pediatric Use Approval DTG is approved by the FDA for use , in combination with other ARV drugs , in pediatric patients at least 4 weeks of age AND weighing at least 3 kg who are treatment naive or treatment experienced but INSTI naive (see Appendix A , Table 2 ). Pediatric patients weighing 20 kg may take the DTG 50-mg film -coated tablets if they are able to swallow tablets. The combination tablet abacavir/dolutegravir/lamiv udine (ABC/DTG/3TC; Triumeq) is approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents weighing 40 kg, although the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Panel ) recommends using it in children and adolescents weighing 25 kg (see Appendix A, Table 2 ). The combination (DTG /3TC; Dovato) are not approved by the FDA for use in children or adolescents at the time of this review , and the Panel does not recommend using these drugs . Formulation Differences: Film -Coated Tablet Compared to D ispersible Tablet DTG is currently available as either film -coated tablet s or dispersible tablet s (tablet s for oral suspension). The dispersible tablet has 60% to 80% greater bioavailability in adults than the film - coated tablet,17 so recommended doses using the dispersible tablet cannot be directly compared to those using the film -coated tablet s. The drug exposure provided by the 50- mg film- coated tablet is approximately equal to that of DTG 30 mg administered as dispersible tablet s. Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients 4 Weeks to <18 years IMPAACT P1093 is an ongoing, multinational, open -label trial of DTG in children with HIV. Results of pharmacokinetic (PK ), safety, and efficacy assessments have been report ed sequentially for different age and weight cohorts as data became available; similarly , dosing recommendations have been revised sequentiall y.18-20 Dosing recommendations that previously include d the 25-mg film- coated tablets have been replaced with other formulations . Data from IMPAACT P1093 Cohort 1 (aged 12 years to <18 years) and Cohort 2 (6 years to <12 years ) provide support for use of DTG film -coated tablets in pediatric patients weighing 14 kg; Cohort 3 (2 to < 6 years), Cohort 4 (6 months to <2 years), and Cohort 5 (4 weeks to <6 months) provide evidence support ing the use of DTG 5 -mg dispersible tablets . Seventy -five study participants ranging in age from 1 month to 214 months received the currently approved dose (determined by weight and age) of DTG film -coated tablets or dispersible tablets. Eighty percent of participants were treatment -experienced, but all were INSTI naive. Among the se 75 patients who received either DTG film- coated tablets or DTG dispersible tablets , according to the approved dosing recommendations for their weight band, 42 received DTG for at least 48 weeks. At Week 48, 69% of participants achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL , and 79% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/ mL. The median CD4 T lymphocyte count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 141 cells /mm3 (7%). Overall, the safety profile in P1093 participants was comparable to that observed in adults , and both Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-147 formulations were well tolerated by pediatric patients. The effectiveness observed in the trial was comparable to that of treatment -experienced adult subjects.21 Sixteen adolescents in Cohort 1 have remained on P1093 through 144 weeks, with 43% and 35% of participants achieving and maintaining HIV RNA levels <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL, respectively. Genotypic testing was ava ilable at the time of treatment failure for 6 of the 13 participants experiencing treatment failure; one of these adolescents developed DTG resistance.22 The Once -daily DTG based ART in Young people vS Standard thErapY (ODYSSEY ) trial, conducted by the Pediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS (PENTA), enrolled both treatment -naive and treatment -experienced pediatric patients from the European Union, Thailand, and several African countries; this trial initially evaluated doses approved by the European Medicines Agency at the time the trial started. A total of 707 children aged <18 years were enrolled; 311 children started DTG as first -line therapy, and 396 started DTG as second -line therapy.23 Nested PK substudies within ODYSSEY also evaluated simplified pediatric dosing that aligned with the World H ealth O rganization's recommended weight bands. PK data are available from a cohort of children weighing >25 kg who switched to the DTG 50-mg film -coated tablet. Data from another ODYSSEY cohort reported on children weighing 20 kg to <25 kg who received either the DTG 50- mg film -coated tablet or DTG 30 mg administered as six 5 -mg dispersible tablets. Both of these doses achieved area-under -the-curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) values that were higher than adult PK reference values but still acceptable . Both doses achieved trough plasma concentrations (C trough) values that were slightly lower than adult reference values and exhi bited greater variability but were determined to be acceptable .24,25 Long- term safety and effectiveness assessments in the ODYSSEY trial are ongoing. Combined PK data from P1093 and ODYSSEY across all age/weight cohorts form the basis for the current FDA dose recommendations and are summarized in Table A below . These data support the administration of either 30 mg as dispersible tablets or 50 mg as a film-coated tablet in pa tients weighing 20 kg. In addition, modeling and simulations that included UGT1A1 maturation in infants were used to support the dose of DTG in infants at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg. Dosing in neonates is under investigation.

Additional long-term efficacy and safety data for this age/weight group come from a retrospective, multicenter French cohort study that evaluated 50 adolescents who swi tched to DTG- based ART. Of 17 adolescents who were virologically suppressed at the time of DTG -based treatment, 14 (82%) maintained suppression, and 3 had transient viral rebound prior to re -achieving a plasma viral load <50 copies/mL. Of the 33 viremic adolescents who initiated DTG, 19 (58%) achieved sustained virologic success. Overall, 66% of patients achieved sustained virologic suppression, and 78% had undetectable plasma viral loads by the last study visit. Adolescents with virologic failure were more likely to be from sub-Saharan Africa and were more likely to have had detectable viremia in the 6 months prior to DTG initiation. No resistance mutations emerged in patients with virologic failure, and only one patient discontinued DTG -based treatment because of a significant AE (dizziness and sleep disturbance). 26 Another cohort of adolescents in Barcelona, Spain, received the fixed -dose combination (FDC) product ABC 600 mg/DTG 50 mg/3TC 300 mg (Triumeq). Of the 12 patients described, one received Triumeq for initial ART, six recei ved Triumeq for treatment simplification, and five received Triumeq because of previous treatment failure. Nine of the 12 patients achieved or maintained viral suppression after switching to Triumeq; three patients failed to achieve suppression because of suboptimal adherence. Of note, patients complained about the size of the tablet, and six patients reported having to crush or split the tablet to swallow it (see Appendix A, Table 2). 27 The Baylor Tanzania Centres of Exc ellence program began rolling out DTG to children and adolescents in 2019 and recently reported on their experience.28 Of the 1 ,703 children and adolescents initiating DTG between March 2019 and November reported no severe toxicity and no discontinuations of DTG. By the end of the study period, 92.4% of pati ents on DTG had documented viral suppression, including 85.6% (149 of 174 patients ) of those not previously suppressed on their original regimen. A dispersible tablet formulation of Triumeq (ABC 60 mg /DTG 5 mg/3TC 30 mg) is currently being studied in IMPAACT P2019 to confirm dosing of the three -drug FDC in pediatric patients younger Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-149 than 12 years (NCT03760458). In P2019, children are dosed in five weight bands: > 25 kg (one film - coated Truimeq tablet) , 20 kg to <25 kg (six dispersible tablets), 14 kg to <20 kg (five dispersible tablets) , 10 kg to <14 kg ( four dispersible tablets) , and 6 kg to <10 kg ( three dispersible tablets). Results of the initial PK and safety assessments for 21 participants in weight bands > 14 kg demonstrated acceptable PK parameters and tolerability for the three cohorts . No Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported , and no participant discontinued the study drug because of adverse events . The study is continuing to enroll the lower weight cohorts and will collect safety and efficacy data through 48 weeks.29 Pediatric Postmarketing Safety Studies As long-term data are analyzed from the ODYSSEY trial , additional comparative safety information has been repor ted. The investigators reported a small number of neuropsychiatric AE s in the 707 children and adolescents randomized to DTG , not significantly different from those reported in study participants receiving standard care. However, participants receiving DTG were more likely to have suicidal ideation than those receiving standard care. Suicidal thoughts were reported by 13 partici pants receiving DTG , but none were reported among those receiving standard care; however, these symptoms were described as transient and did not lead to changes in ART.30 In a subset of OD YSSEY participants aged 6 to <18 years, vitamin B12 and folate levels were measured to investigate a potential mechanism of reported neural tube defects among pregnant women receiving DTG. No differences were identified in vitamin B12 levels across study a rms, although plasma and RBC folate levels were lower among participants receiving standard care.31 Reports of weight gain among adults enrolled in clinical trials prompted similar studies to investigate metabolic effects of DTG in adolescents. A group of investigators in Eswatini analyzed BMI measurements retrospectively from a cohort of 460 virally suppressed adolescents switching to a DTG-based regimen (either ABC/DTG/3TC or TDF/3TC/DTG). In this cohort, both weight -for-age z-score and BMI-for- age z -score decreas ed slightly before transition to DTG but increased during the year after DTG was initiated . The rate of BMI increase per year was calculated to be about twofold greater than the normal rate in the full cohort , and about 2.8-fold greater among female adolescents.4 Another group measured multiple body fat parameters and cholesterol /lipid profile s in Italian adolescents switched from a PI- or non-nucl eoside reverse DTG/3TC ). Although BMI, body fat percentage, and limb fat percentage remained the same, trunk fat and trunk fat/total body fat ratio increased significantly. Total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins decreased, while serum triglycerides decreased early in the study and then increased by the end of the study.3 A small, single -center cohort in Australia identified similar increases in BMI among adolescents switched to either DTG - or TAF -containing regimens.5 Another retrospective analysis of a cohort of children and adolescents in the District of Columbia who were initiated on INSTIs also identified a pattern of increasing BMI-for-age z-scores, with a mean rate of change of +0.19 z -score units per year.6 The ODYSSEY investigators also assessed weight, height, and BMI over the course of their prospective, randomized study. At Week 96, they found that weight, height, and BMI-for -age z-score increased in children receiving DTG compared with those receiving standard care , with the adjusted difference in means of 1 kg, 0.8 cm, and 0.14 z -score units , respectively. The investigators noted that the differences between treatment groups were relatively small, emerged early, and stabilized within the 2- year study period.32 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-150 Simplification of T reatment Two trials in adults (Regimen Switch to Dolutegravir + Rilpivirine from Current Antiretroviral Regimen in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infected and Virologically Suppressed Adults, SWORD -1 and SWORD -2) supported the approval of a DTG 50-mg /RPV 25-mg FDC tablet as a complete regimen for treatment simplification or maintenance therapy in selected patients. The two identical SWORD trials enrolled 1,024 virologically suppressed patients who had been on stable ART for at least 6 months and who had no history of treatment failure or evidence of resistance mutations . The participants were randomized either to receive DTG/ RPV or to continue their suppressive ARV regimen. After 48 weeks of treatment, 95% of patients in both arms maintained HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL.33 After 52 weeks, the participants who had been randomized to continue their suppressive ARV regimen were switched to DTG/RPV. At 148 weeks, 84% of the early -switch patients and 90% of the late -switch patients remained virologically suppressed, and only 11 patients receiving dual therapy met virologic failure criteria. No INSTI resistance was ident ified.34 During the comparative randomized phase of the study, m ore AEs were reported and led to discontinuation in the DTG /RPV arm. In a subgroup of the SWORD study, small but statistically significant increase s in hip and spine bone mineral density and bone turnover markers w ere observed in patients whose original ARV regimen contained TDF .35 The approval of DTG 50 mg/ 3TC 300 mg as a complete regimen was supported by data from two randomized, double -blind, controlled trials (Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerabili ty Study Comparing Dolutegravir Plus Lamivudine With Dolutegravir Plus in , GEMINI -1 GEMINI -1 and GEMINI-2 are identica l 148-week trials that enroll ed a total of 1,433 adults with HIV who had plasma HIV RNA levels between 1,000 copies/mL and 500,000 copies/mL at screening and no evidence of major resistance mutations or hepatitis B virus infection. Participants were randomized to receive either DTG plus 3TC or DTG plus 3TC/ TDF. During 96 weeks of treatment, 86% of patients who receiv ed DTG plus 3TC and of patients who receiv ed receiv ed DTG plus had a lower rate of adverse drug reactions (19.6%) than those who received DTG plus 3TC/TDF (25%).36 Although neither Juluca nor Dovato is approved by the FDA for use in adolescents, the doses of the component drugs that make up these FDC tablets are approved for use in adolescents. The Panel usually endorses the u se of adult formulations in adolescents, and these product s may be appropriate for use in certain adolescents. However, because the strategy of treatment simplification has not been evaluated in adolescents who may have difficult y adhering to therapy, the Panel does not currently recommend using two -drug simplification regimens in adolescents and children until more data are available. Crushing Film-Coated Tablets for Administration Dispersible tablets are now considered the preferred formulation for pediatric patients weighing <20 kg, and film -coated tablets should not be used in children weighing <14 kg . In patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets and in children weighi ng >14 kg, when the preferred dispersible tablets are not available, the 10-mg and 50- mg tablets either may be split into halves followed by immediate ingestion of both halves of the tablet , or crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which should be consumed immediately. 1 Crushing and mixing film- coated tablets would not be expected to adversely impact the product's pharmaceutical quality and, therefore , would not be expected to alter the intended clinical effect. This conclusion is based on the physi cochemical and PK characteristics of the active ingredient and the in vitro dissolution behavior Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-151 of the film -coated tablets in water . In healthy adults, the use of crushed tablets resulted in slightly higher exposures than the use of whole tablets .37 No information exists on the impact of splitting or crushing film -coated tablets on palatability. Some case reports describe DTG-containing film -coated tablets ' being crushed and successfully administered via orogastric tube38 or nasogastric tube ,39 and it is expected that the dispersible tablets also may be administered similarly. If DTG is administered via enteral tube, care should be taken to disperse the tablets com pletely and flush the tube to avoid clogging.

This dose of Stribild also can be used to replace the current ARV regimen in patients who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable AR T regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Stribild. Administer both Genvoya and Stribild with food. Genvoya and Stribild should be administered at least 4 hours before or after antacids and supplements or multivitamins that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, and/or magnesium. When us ing Stribild, which contai ns TDF, monitor estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl), urine glucose, and urine protein at baseline and every 3 to 6 months while on therapy . In patients who are at risk of renal impairment, also monitor serum phosphate. Patients with an increase in serum creatinine levels >0.4 mg/dL should be closely monitored for renal safety. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before us ing FTC, TDF, or TAF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV can occur when FTC , TDF, or TAF are disconti nued; therefore, monitor hepatic function for several months after stopping therapy with FTC , TDF, or TAF. For information on crushing and cutting tablets, see this table from Toronto General Hospital . Metabolism/Elimination EVG is metabolized by cytochrome P 450 and is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. EVG is available only in combination with pharmacokinetic enhancer (boosting agent) cobicistat the Cobicistat , TDF, and TAF sections for further details on these components . Elvitegravir Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Stribild and Genvoya should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Elvitegravir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Stribild should not be initiated in patients with estimated CrCl <70 mL/min, and it should be discontinued in patients with estimated CrCl <50 mL/min . FTC and TDF require dose adjustments in these patients, and these adjustments cannot be achieved with an FDC tablet. Genvoya is not recommended in patients with estimated CrCl <30 mL/min. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-153 Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Absorption: Elvitegravir (EVG) plasma concentrations are lower with concurrent administration of divalent cations due to the formation of complexes in the gastrointestinal tract and not due to changes in gastric pH. Therefore , Stribild and Genvoya should be administered at least 4 hours before or after administering antacids and supplements or multivitamins that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, and/or magnesium .1 Metabolism: and Genvoya contain EVG metabolized erate CYP2C9. COBI is a strong inhibitor of and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. the adenosine triphosphate -dependent transporters , P-glycoprotein and the breast cancer resistance protein , and the organic anion- transporting polypeptides OAT P1B1 and OAT P1B3. See the Cobicistat section for a more detailed summary of drug interactions. M ultiple drug interactions are possible when using both EVG and COBI. Neither Stribild nor Genvoya should be administered concurrently with products or regimens that contain ritonavir (RTV) , because of the similar effects of COBI and RTV on CYP3A4 metabolism. Coadministration of medications that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may respectively decrease or increase exposures of EVG and COBI. Coadministration of medications that are CYP3A4 substrates may result in clinically significant adverse reac tions that are severe, life -threatening, or fatal, or may result in loss of therapeutic effect if dependent on conversion to an active metabolite due to CYP3A4 inhibition by COBI. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion could reduce clearance of tenofovir, in the form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF ), or emtricitabine (FTC). Concomitant use nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided when using Stribild. COBI inhibits MATE1, which increases serum creatinine levels up to 0.4 mg/dL from baseline in adults . Creatinine -based calculations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be altered, but the actual GFR might be only minimally changed.2 Significant increases in serum creatinine levels >0.4 mg/dL from baseline may represent renal toxicity and should be evaluated. People who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored for renal toxicity; cli nicians should monitor creatinine levels for further increases and perform a urinalysis to look for evidence of proteinuria or glycosuria.3 Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, diarrhea, , Less (more severe): Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors , including TDF and FTC . TDF caused bone toxicity (osteomalacia and reduced bone mineral density [BMD]) in animals when given in high doses. Decreases in BMD have been reported in both adults and children who were taking TDF; the clinical significance of these changes is not yet known. Evide nce of renal toxicity has been observed in patients taking TDF, including a higher incidence of glycosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia, and/or calciuria; increases in the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-154 nitrogen; and decreases in serum phosphate l evels . Numerous case reports of renal tubular dysfunction have been reported in patients receiving TDF; patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction should be closely monitored if they are being treated with Stribild. This nephrotoxicity may be more pronounced in patients with preexisting renal disease.3 Genvoya , which contain s tenofovir alafenamide (TAF ), has an improved bone and renal safety profile when compar ed to Stribild , which conta ins TDF , in children and adults .4,5 However, Genvoya is associated with greater increases in lipid levels than Stribild, according to findings from large -scale clinical trials in adults .6 Resistance The International Antiviral Society -USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. There is phenotypic cross -resistance between EVG lafenamide [EVG/c/FTC/TAF ]) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for use in antiretroviral ( ARV)-naive children and adolescents with HIV weighing 25 kg with any sexual ma turity rating (SMR ). It also can be used to replace the current ARV regimen in those who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components is approved by the FDA as a complete regimen for use in children and adolescents aged 12 years and weigh ing 35 kg. However, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Mana gement of Children Living with HIV recommends limiting the use of Stribild to adolescents with SMR s of 4 or 5 due to concerns about decreased BMD in pre -pubertal patients. It can also be used to replace the current ARV regimen in those who have been virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known mutations associated with resista nce to the individual components of Stribild.3 Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adults EVG/c/FTC/TDF was found to be noninferior to a regimen of efavirenz /emtricitabine/TDF (EFV atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) plus FTC /TDF in adults through 144 weeks of treatment .11-13 In two studies , 1,733 adults were randomly assigned to receive either EVG/c/FTC/TDF or EVG/c/FTC /TAF.5 After 48 weeks, those receiving EVG/c/FTC /TAF had significantly smaller mean serum creatinine increases (0.08 vs. 0.12 mg/dL; P < 0.0001), significantly less proteinuria (median percent change in protein 3% vs . +20%; P < 0.0001), and a significantly smaller decrease in BMD at the spine (mean percent change 1.30% vs. 2.86%; P < 0.0001) and hip (0.66% vs. 2.95% ; P < 0.0001). Larger increases in fasting lipid levels were observed with EVG/c/FTC/TAF than with EVG/c/FTC/TDF; the med ian increases in levels of total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were all higher in patients who received EVG/c/FTC/TAF . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-155 Use of Elvitegravir as Stribild or Genvoya in Adolescents Aged 12 to 18 Years and Weighing 35 kg Studies of the use of Stribild and Genvoya in children with HIV aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg have demonstrated safety and efficacy similar to that seen in adults through 24 weeks and 48 weeks of study, respectively; these formulations are approved by the FDA for use in this age/weight group.14,15 Stribild is not approved to treat children weighing <35 kg. Genvoya is preferred over Stribild when treating children with SMRs 1 to 3, because Genvoya carries a lower risk of renal and bone toxicity than Stribild . 6Long -term bone safety data with Genvoya through 96 weeks revealed no concerns for toxicity in this age group16 on the basis of BMD (median change from baseline spine BMD height -age [HA] z -score +0.14 and total body less head [ TBLH ] HA z -score of 0.07) and serum biomarkers of bone formation and resorption.16 Use of Elvitegravir as Genvoya in Children Weighing 25 kg Genvoya is approved by the FDA to treat children with any SMR who weigh 25 kg; this approval was based on 24 weeks of data in 23 children. 17 In this study, children who had been virologicall y suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months were switched from their current regimens to Genvoya . No study discontinuations occurred due to medication toxicity, but a concerning decline in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts was observed in a ll 23 children over the first 24 weeks of Genvoya treatment. CD4 counts declined by a median of 130 cells/mm3 (with a range of 472 cells/mm3 to 266 cells/mm3) from baseline. However, after enrolling additional children (for a total of 52 participants), the median CD4 count decline at 48 weeks18 was 25 cells/mm3 and at 96 weeks was 45 cells/mm3. Additionally, t he CD4 percentage did not significantly change19 across Weeks 24, 48, and 96. The mechanism for the reduction in CD4 count is unclear, and this reduction has only been reported in this study. Plasma exposures of all four drugs were higher in these children than the plasma exposures seen in historical data from adults, but no association was identified between plasma exposures of the four components of Genvoya and CD4 counts.20 Long- term bone safety data with Genvoya through 96 weeks revealed no concerns for toxicity in this cohor t on the basis of BMD (median change from baseline spine BMD HA z -score 0.2 and TBLH HA z-score of 0.32) and serum biomarkers of bone formation and resorption.19 Use of Elvitegravir as Genvoya in Children Weighing 14 to <25 kg EVG/c/FTC/TAF is not approved to treat children weighing <25 kg.3,6 A pharmacokinetic (PK ), safety, and efficacy study with a low -dose tablet in children aged 2 years and weighing 14 kg to <25 kg is ongoing.21 In this study, children had to be virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months prior to entry. Virologic suppression was maintained19 in 27 (100%) of 27 children at W eek 16, 26 (96%) of 27 children at Week 24, and 26 (96%) of 27 children at Week 48. No participant discontinued the study drug because of adverse events or met criteria for resistance analyses through Week 48 . CD4 counts decreased19 by a mean of 187 cells/mm3 between baseline and W eek 48, although the CD4 percentage did not differ (mean [standard deviation (SD )] change of 0.0 [<5.0]). At least 90% of children reported that swallowing the low-dose tablet was \"easy\" or \"super easy\" and perceived the tablet size when swallowing as \"okay\" at baseline, Week 4, and Week 24.21 Long-term bone safety data with the low -dose formulation through 48 weeks revealed no concerns for bone safety in this cohort16 on the basis of BMD (median change from baseline in spine BMD HA z -score +0.14 and TBLH HA z -score 0.06) and serum biomarkers of bone formation and resorption.

However, an unfavorable drug interaction between EVG/c and DRV is possible , and the available data on the magnitude of the interaction are conflicting. D ata on the effic acy of the combination in adults also are conflicting .23-29 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-160 The most rigorous drug interaction study, performed in HIV -seronegative adults, found 21% lower DRV trough concentrations (Ctrough) and 52% lower EVG C trough with DRV 800 mg plus EVG/c 150 mg/150 mg once daily compared to the administration of either darunavir/cobicistat 800 mg/150 mg once daily or EVG/c 150 mg/150 mg once daily alone .23 The a ctual Ctrough were 1 ,050 ng/mL for DRV and 243 ng/mL for EVG. Despite the findings of the aforementioned drug interaction study in HIV-seronegative adults, t he most rigorous efficacy evaluation found that among 89 treatment -experienced adults who were receiving five- tablet ARV regimens, 96.6% achieved virologic suppress ion (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) 24 weeks after simplif ying their regim ens to a two -tablet regimen of Genvoya plus DRV 800 mg once daily.27 Intensive PK sampling was performed in 15 of the se patients (17%) . Mean DRV and EVG Ctrough were 1 ,250 ng/mL and 464 ng/mL, respectively. Given the uncertain ty around the true magnitude of the drug interaction and the absence of data in children, this combination should be used with caution in children.

Coadministration or staggered administration of aluminum -containing and magnesium -containing antacids is not recommended with any RAL formulations . Significant drug interactions are more likely to occur when the RAL HD formulation is used once daily . The following drugs should not be c oadministered with once -daily RAL HD rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, and etravirine. Chewable tablets can be chewed, crushed (before administration) , or swallowed whole. Film-coated tablets , including HD tablets , must be swallowed whole.

The chewable tablets should be stored in the original package with a desiccant to protect them from moisture. Instructio ns for preparing and administering the chewable tablet as a crushed tablet are as follows: Place the tablet(s) in a small, clean cup. For each tablet, add a teaspoon (~5 mL) of liquid ( e.g., water, juice, or breast milk). Within 2 minutes, the tablet(s) wi ll absorb the liquid and fall apart. Using a spoon, crush any remaining pieces of the tablet(s). Immediately administer the entire dose orally. If any portion of the dose is left in the cup, add another teaspoon (~5 mL) of liquid, swirl, and administer imm ediately. The c hewable tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria, and the necessary dietary adjustments should be made in consultation with a metabolic specialist. The oral suspension comes in a kit that includes instructions for use, mixing cups, oral dosing syringes, and 60 foil packets. Detailed instructions for preparation are provided in the Instructions for Use document. Each single -use foil packet contains 100 mg of RAL, which will be suspended in 10 mL of water for a final concentration of RAL 10 mg/mL. Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder into a uniform suspension. Do not shake the oral suspension. Dose should be administered within 30 minutes of mixing; unused solution should be discarded as directed in the Instructions for Use document. For neonates, most of the prepared oral suspension will be discarded, because the volume for the required dose is much smaller than 10 mL. Metabolism/Elimination UGT1A1 -mediated glucuronidation Raltegravir Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients w ith mild- to-moderate hepatic insufficiency who are receiving RAL twice daily . No studies have been conducted on the use of RAL HD in patients with hepatic impairment. T herefore, administ ering RAL HD is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on RAL pharmacokinetics has not been studied.

Raltegravir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment . Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: The major route of raltegravir (RAL) elimination as rifampin and tipranavir\u2014 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of RAL . Inhibitors of UGT1A1\u2014such as atazanavir (ATV)\u2014 may increase plasma concentrations of RAL . No dosing modifications are recommended when RAL is coadminister ed with atazanavir /ritonavir (ATV/r) or tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r). However, RAL high tablets should not be coadministered with TPV/r . In adults, an increased dose of RAL is recommended when it is coadministered with rifampin. For adults receiving rifampin, the recommended RAL dose is 800 mg twice daily. Do not coadminister rifampin with o nce-daily RAL HD tablets. In children aged 4 weeks to <12 years who had tuberculosis (TB) /HIV coinfection and were taking rifampin, RAL 12 mg/kg per dose twice daily of the chewable tablet formulation safe ly RAL plasma concentrations and should not be coadministered with RAL . Significant drug interactions may be more likely to occur with RAL HD once daily . Trough concentration (C trough) in adults is approximately 30% lower with RAL HD 1, 200 mg once daily than with RAL 400 mg twice daily. A lower C trough increases the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with interfering drugs that decrease RAL exposure and further lower Ctrough. In addition to aluminum -containing and magnesium -containing antacids, the following drugs should not be coadministered with the RAL HD formulation : calcium carbonate antacids , rifampin, TPV/r , and of drug- metabolizing enzymes on RAL is unknown; phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine is not recommended . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-164 Before administ ering RAL , clinicians should carefully review a patient's medication profile for potential drug interactions with RAL . Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, itching, insomnia . Less common: Abdominal pain, vomiting. Patients with chronic active hepatitis B virus infection and/or hepatitis C virus infection are more likely to experience a worsening adverse events (AEs) grade from baseline for laboratory abnormalities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin than patients who are not coinfected. Rare: Moderate -to-severe increase in creatine phosphokinase levels . Use RAL with caution in patients who are receiving medications that are associated with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis . Anxiety, depression, and paranoia , especially in those with a history of the se conditions . Rash (including Stevens -Johnson syndrome failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) in patients with underlying liver disea se and/or concomitant medications. Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance D atabase offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval RAL is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for the treatment of HIV in pediatric patients weighing 2 kg. The current pediatric FDA approval and dose recommendations are based on evaluations of 122 patients aged 4 weeks to 18 years who particip ated in IMPAACT P1066 and 42 full -term neonates who were treated for 6 weeks starting from birth and followed for a total of 24 weeks during IMPAACT P1110 .3 The FDA has approved RAL HD, which allows once -daily dosing, for use in children and adolescents weighing 40 kg. Efficacy in Clinical Trials RAL has been evaluated in adults in three large , randomized clinical trials : STARTMRK, SPRING -2, and ACTG A5257. STARTMRK compared the safety and efficacy of a RAL -containing regimen and an efavirenz (EFV) -containing regimen. At 48 weeks, RAL was noninferior to EFV . However, more patients discontinued EFV during the longer follow -up periods of 4 and 5 years , and RAL was found to be virologically and immunologically superior to EFV .4-6 Results from the SPRING -2 study in treatment -naive adults showed that RAL and dolutegravir (DTG) were equally effective and had similar safety profiles .7 ACTG A5257 compared RAL to ATV/r and darunavir/ritonavir ; all regimens had equivalent virologic efficacy , but RAL had better tolerability.8 The ONCEMRK study compared RAL 1,200 mg once daily (taken as two 600 -mg RAL HD tablets) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-165 to RAL 400 mg twice daily in treatment -naive adults (see the results for the ONCEMRK study in the following section). Once -daily dosing of RAL using the HD tablets was approved by the FDA for adults and children weighing 40 kg who are either treatment naive or virologically suppressed on a twice -daily RAL regimen. RAL was studied in infants, children, and adolescents in IMPAACT P1066, an open-label trial that evaluated PK s, safety, tolerability, and efficacy. In 96 participants aged 2 to 18 years who were mostly antiretroviral therapy (ART ) experienced, 79.1% of the patients achieved a favorable viral load response (i.e., viral load s <400 copies/mL or 1 log 10 decline in viral load) while receiving the currently recommended dose of RAL . Infants and toddlers aged 4 weeks to <2 years also were enrolled in IMPAACT P1066 and received treatment with RAL oral suspension. At Weeks 24 and 48, 61% of the participants (14 of 23 infants and toddlers ) had HIV viral loads9-11 <400 copies/mL. Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Once -Daily Dosing in Children and Adults RAL PKs exhibit considerable intrasubject and intersubject variability.12,13 Current PK targets are based on results from a clinical trial in adults (QDMRK) in which treatment- naive patients with HIV were randomized to receive RAL 800 mg once daily or RAL 400 mg twice daily. After 48 weeks of treatment, the percent of patients who achiev ed HIV RNA viral loads <50 copies/mL was 83% in the once -daily group, compared with 89% in the twice -daily group. Patients in the once -daily arm with Ctrough concentrations < 45 nM (20 ng/mL) were at greater risk of experiencing treatment failure.12,13 Overall drug exposures were similar in both groups , but the association between higher risk of treatment failure and lower C trough concentrations suggests that maintaining RAL trough plasma concentrations > 45 nM (20 ng/mL) is important for efficacy.12,13 Once-daily dos ing with RAL 1,200 mg was found to be as effective as dosing with RAL 400 mg twice daily. In the ONCEMRK study, 797 treatment -naive adults were randomized to receive either RAL 1,200 mg once daily (taken as two 600- mg tablets) or RAL 400 mg twice daily plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine . After 48 weeks, 89% of participants on the once -daily dose and 88% of participants on the twice -daily dose reached viral loads of <40 copies /mL. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were not different between the two groups .14 In May 2017, once - daily dosing of RAL using the HD tablets was approved by the FDA for adults and children weighing 40 kg who are either treatment na ive or virologicall y suppressed on a twice -daily RAL regimen. The use of once -daily dosing with the HD tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients. Population PK modeling and simulations of once -daily dosing with RAL HD tablets predict that this dosing schedule will produce drug exposures similar to those observed in adult patients during ONCEMRK.3,15 Dosing with three 400-mg RAL tablets once daily and dosing with two 600-mg RAL HD tablets once daily are expected to produce similar PK profiles. In adults enrolled in ONCEMRK, the C trough concentrations were approximately 30% lower in participants taking once -daily RAL HD tablets than in those taking RAL 400 mg twice daily. Because of this, onc e-daily dosing of RAL has a greater potential for significant drug interactions ; coadministering once -daily RAL with drugs that decrease drug exposure may further decrease C trough. The highest concentration ( Cmax) is approximately six times higher in patients receiving RAL 1,200 mg once daily than in those receiving RAL 400 mg twice daily , with a twofold higher area under the curve (AUC). Although modeling and simulations for pediatric patients indicate that PK targets are met using the once -daily RAL 1,200- mg dose, no clinical data exist on the use of this dose in children weighing Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-166 <50 kg. S ix children in IMPAACT P1066 had drug exposures that were similar to those observed in ONCEMRK, but all six children weighed > 50 kg. D ose-related c entral nervous system toxicities \u2014 such as insomnia or hyperactivity\u2014m ay occur in children who are exposed to very high concentrations of RAL .3 Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics in Children IMPAACT P1066 evaluate d the PK s, safety, and efficacy of RAL in treatment -experienced children aged 4 weeks to 18 years.

In IMPAACT P1066, the initial dose -finding stage include d an intensive PK evaluation in various age cohorts (Cohort 1: 12 years to <19 years ; Cohort 2: 6 years to <12 years ; Cohort 3 : 2 years to <6 years). Dose s were select ed with the aim of achieving target PK parameters that were similar to those seen in adults: PK targets were a geometric mean (GM) AUC 0-12h of 14 \u00b5M \u00b7h to 25 GM 12 -hour concentration (C12h) >33 nM.

Only treatment -experienced patients were eligible to enroll, and the optimized regimen was determined by the site investigators. Adolescents tended to be more treatment experienced and have more advanced disease than those in the younger cohorts , with 75% having the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention Category B or C classification of HIV infection. Ninety - six participants completed 48 weeks of treatment . Seventy-nine percent of participants achiev ed HIV RNA <400 copies/mL , and achiev a of 156 cells/ mm3 (4.6%). Among 36 subjects who experienced virologic failure, the development of drug resistance and/or poor adherence were contributing factors. Genotypic resistance data w ere available for 34 patients w ho experienced virologic failure , and RAL -associated mutations were detected in 12 out of 34 of those patients . The frequency, type, and severity of AEs through W eek 48 were comparable to those observed in adult studies. A Es were commonly reported, but few serious AE s were considered to be drug related. Patients with A Es that were considered to be drug related included one patient with Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior, and insomnia , as well as one patient with a G rade 2 allergic rash on D ay 17 and G rade 3 ALT and G rade 4 AST laboratory elevations after D ay 122. There were no discontinuations due to AE s and no drug-related deaths.11 Overall, RAL was well tolerated when administered as a film -coated tablet twice daily in subjects age d 6 years to <19 years and as chewable tablets at a dose of approximately 6 mg/kg twice daily in subjects aged 2 years to <12 years , with favorable virologic and immunologic responses .17 Children Aged 4 Weeks to <2 Years IMPAACT P1066 studied 26 infants and toddlers aged 4 weeks to <2 years who were administered the granules for RAL oral suspension in combination with an optimized background ARV regimen. All subjects had previously received ARV drugs to prevent perinatal transmission and/or treat HIV, and 69% had baseline plasma HIV RNA exceeding 100,000 copies/mL. PK targets for Cohort IV (6 months to <2 years ) and Cohort V (4 weeks to <6 months ) were modified to a GM AUC 0-12h of 14 \u00b5M \u00b7h to 45 \u00b5M a GM C 12h 75 nM (33.3 ng/mL). These targets were modified so that an estimated >90% of patients would have C 12h above the 45 nM threshold. By Week 48, two subjects experienced AE s that were thought to be related to the study drug: one patient experienced a serious erythematous rash that resulted in permanent discontinuation of RAL , and one patient experienced immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Virologic success , defined as 1 log 10 decline in HIV RNA or <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks , was achieved in >87% of participants . At 48 weeks of follow up, 45.5% of subjects had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and mean CD4 count increase s of 527.6 cells/mm3 (7.3%). F our subjects in Cohort 4 experienced virologic failure by Week 48, and one participant had a RAL -associated resista nce mutation . Overall, the granules for oral suspension, at a dose of approximately RAL 6 mg/kg twice daily , were well tolerated and had good efficacy.10 Long- Term Follow Up in Children The IMPAACT P1066 study team reported results regarding the safety and efficacy of different RAL formulations at 240 weeks in children enrolled in this multicenter trial.18 Eligible participants were children aged 4 weeks to 18 years who had previously been treated with ART and who were experiencing virologic failure at the time of enrollment. RAL was added to an optimized AR V regimen in all participants. RAL was well tolerated , and few serious clinical or laboratory safety events were noted during the study.18 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-168 The proportion of participants who achieved v irologic success at 240 weeks varied by the RAL formulation used : 19 of 43 children (44.2%) who receiv ed RAL 400- mg tablets ; 24 of 31 children (77.4%) who receiv ed chewable tablets; and 13 of 15 children (86.7%) who receiv ed the oral granules for suspension. R AL resistance was documented in 19 of 50 pa tients (38%) who experienced virologic rebound after initial suppression. These results suggest that younger children with less treatment experience are more likely to have sustained virologic suppression, whereas older children with an extensive treatment history are more likely to experience treatment failure and develop resistance to RAL . Poor adherence among adolescents may have contributed to the lower efficacy observed in older children who receiv ed the RAL 400-mg tablets.18 Neonates Aged <4 Weeks RAL is metabolized by UGT1A1, the same enzyme that is responsible for the elimination of bilirubin. UGT enzyme activity is low at birth, and RAL elimination is prolonged in neonates. Washout PK s of RAL in neonates born to pregnant women with HIV were studied in IMPAACT P1097 .19 The neonatal plasma half -life of RAL was highly variable, ranging from 9.3 to 184 hours . This suggests that neonatal development may impact UGT1A1 enzyme activi ty, redistribution, and/or recirculation RAL competes with unconjugated bilirubin for albumin binding sites. When RAL plasma concentrations are extremely high, unconjugated bilirubin may be displaced from albumin by RAL and cross the blood -brain barrier, leading to bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction. The effect of RAL on neonatal bilirubin binding is unlikely to be clinically significant , unless concentrations that are 50-fold to 100-fold higher than typical peak concentrations are reached ( approximately 5,000 ng/mL).20 IMPAACT P1110 was a Phase 1, multicenter trial that enrolled full -term neonates with or without in utero RAL exposure at risk of acquiring HIV. RA L-exposed neonates were those whose mothers received RAL within 2 to 24 hours of delivery. For RAL -exposed neonates, the initial dose of RAL was delayed until 12 to 60 hours after delivery. The s tudy design included two cohorts : Cohort 1 infants received two RAL doses that were administered 1 week apart , and Cohort 2 infants received daily RAL doses for the first 6 weeks of life. PK data from Cohort 1 and from older infants and children were combined in a population PK model , and s imulations were used to select th e following RAL dosing regimen for evaluation in infants in Cohort 2: RAL 1.5 mg/kg daily, starting within 48 hours of life and continuing through D ay 7; RAL 3 mg/kg twice daily on D ays 8 to 28 of life; and RAL 6 mg/kg twic e daily after 4 weeks of age.21 Protocol exposure targets for each subject were AUC 0-24hr 12 mg\u00b7h/L to 40 mg\u00b7h/L, AUC 0-12hr \u00b7h/L to C 12h or C 24h >33 ng/mL. Safety was assessed using clinical and laboratory evaluations.19,22,23 Twenty -six RAL -naive infants and 10 RAL -exposed infants were enrolled in Cohort 2; 25 RAL - naive infants and 10 RAL -exposed infants had evaluable PK results and safety data. Results for the RAL -naive infants and RAL -exposed infants who were enrolled in Cohort 2 are contained in Table B below.23 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-169 Table B . Raltegravir Pharmacokinetic P arameters RAL mg/kg Once (n = 25)d Initial Dose: RAL 1.5 mg/kg Once Daily RAL-Exposed (n = 10) Days 15- 18: RAL 3.0 mg/kg Twice Daily RAL-Naive (n = Days 15- 18: RAL 3.0 mg/kg Daily concentration >33 ng/mL. For initial dose, C last collected at 24 hours was used. For Days 15- 18, C 12h was estimated when the 12 hours post -dose sample was collected earlier than 12 hours after dosing (the protocol specified a sample collection time of 8 -12 hours post dose) . c Cmax <8,724 ng/mL d AUC 0-24h could not estimated for one infant. e AUC 0-12h and Ctrough could not be estimated for one infant with delayed absorption. f AUC 0-12h and C max could not be estimated for one infant with incomplete sample collection. Key: AUC = area under the curve; AUC 0-12h = AUC from time zero to 12 hours after drug administration; AUC 0-24h = AUC from time zero to 24 hours after drug administration; C last = last measurable plasma concentration; Cmax = maximum concentration; Ctrough = trough pharmacokinetic; RAL = raltegravir; T1/2 = half -life; T max = time to reach maximum concentration Daily RAL was safe and well tolerated during the first 6 weeks of life . Infants were treated for up to 6 weeks from birth and followed for a total of 24 weeks. All GM protocol exposure targets were met. In some infants , AUC 0-24h following the initial dose was slightly above the target range , but this is considered acceptable given the rapid increase in RAL metabolism during the first week of life. The PK targets and the safety guidelines were met for both RAL -naive and RAL -exposed infants in Cohort 2 using the specified dosing regimen. N o drug-related clinical AEs were observed. T hree laboratory AEs were reported among the RAL -naive infants : Grade 4 transient neutropenia occurred in one infant who receiv ed a zidovudine -containing regimen; two bi lirubin elevations (one Grade 1 and one Grade 2) were considered nonserious and did not require specific therapy.3 Among the RAL - exposed infants, four infants exhibited G rade 3 or 4 toxicities: anemia in one infant , neutropenia in one infant , and hyperbilirubinemia in two infants . No specific therapy was required to treat these toxicities , and no infants required phototherapy or exchange transfusion for hyperbilirubinemia. Results from IMPAACT P1110 confirmed the PK modeling and simulation submitted for FDA approval and labeling. Neonates born to mothers who received RAL 2 to 24 hours prior to delivery Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-170 should have their first dose of RAL delayed until 24 to 48 hours after birth.22,23 RAL can be safely administered to full -term infants using the daily dosing regimen that w as studied in IMPAACT P1110. This regimen is not recommended for use in preterm infants. RAL elimination kinetics in preterm and low-birth after maternal dosing was studied in IMPAACT Sixteen mothers and their 18 low -birth -weight neonates (< 2.5 kg) were enrolled . Median (range) RAL elimination half -life was 24.4 hours (10.1 -83) hours (n = 17). A PK model incorporating slower clearance in preterm neonates demonstrated that a reduction in RAL dosing is required in this population.24 Two case reports of preterm infants who received RAL to prevent perinatal transmission have been published.25,26 These case reports involved one infant born at a gestational age of 24 weeks and 6 days who weigh ed 800 g and another infant born at 33 weeks gestation who weigh ed 1,910 g. In both infants, intermittent dosing of RAL was done using real -time therapeutic drug monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit.25,26 Less frequent dosing was required because RAL elimination was significantly delayed in these preterm infants . RAL PKs and safety must be studied in preterm infants before RAL can be safely used without real -time PK monitoring in this population. Formulations The PK s of RAL in adult patients with HIV who swallowed intact 400- mg tablets were compared with those observed in patients who chewed the 400 -mg, film -coated t ablets because of swallowing difficulties. Drug absorption was significantly higher among patients who chewed the tablets, although the palatability was rated as poor.27 In adult volunteers, the PK s of RAL 800 mg taken once daily by chewing was compared with the PKs of two doses of RAL 400 mg taken every 12 hours by swallowing . Participant s who took RAL by chewing had significantly higher drug exposure and reduced PK variability than those who swallow ed whole tablets a ccording to current recommendations .28 According to the manufacturer, the film -coated tablets must be swallowed whole. The RAL chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability than the 400- mg, film - coated tablet , according to a comparative study in health y adult volunteers.29 Compared with the RAL 400-mg tablet formulation, the RAL 600- mg tablet has higher relative bioavailability.3,30 Interpatient and intrapatient variability for PK parameters of RAL are considerable, especially with the film -coated tablets.3,31 Because of differences in the bioavailability of various formulations , the dosing recommendations for each formulation differ, and the formulations are not interchangeable . When prescribing RAL , clinicians should refer to the appropriate dosing table for the chosen formulation. The use of RAL chewable tablets as dispersible tablets in children aged <2 years has been studied in IMPAACT P1101 for infants and toddlers with TB/HIV coinfection who received rifampin as part of their TB treatment. The use of RAL chewable tablets dispersed in water at a dose of RAL 12 mg/kg per dose twice daily safely achieved PK targets.1,32 The RAL chewable tablets are now approved for use in infants and young children 4 weeks of age and older and weighing at least 2 kg.33 An in vitro evaluation demonstrat ed that the chewable tablets are stable in various liquids , including water, apple juice, and breast milk.33 The chewable tablets may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of liquid to facilitate administration (see S pecial Instructions above ). Palatability was evaluated as part of IMPAACT P1066. Both chewable tablets and oral granules for suspension were thought t o have acceptable palatability. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed reported no problems with chewable tablets ; 82.6% reported no problems with administering the oral Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-171 granules.10,11 The a cceptability and feasibility of administering RAL granules for oral suspension in a low-resource setting has been studied in a clinic in South Africa. With proper training by health care personnel, caregivers were able to prepare the suspension safely and accurately.34 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-172 References 1.

For additional information, see Drugs@FDA or DailyMed . Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Cobicistat a Pharmacokinetic Enhancer The only use of is pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer integrase strand transfer s. COBI is not interchangeable with ritonavir (RTV ) and has no antiviral activity. Child and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose COBI 150 mg with atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg administered at the same time with food Child and Adolescent (Weighing 40 kg) and Adult Dose COBI 150 mg with darunavir (DRV) 800 mg administered at the same time with food [Evotaz] Atazanavir/ Cobicistat Child and Adolescent (Weighing 35 kg) and Adult Dose One tablet once daily with food Use in combination with other antiretroviral ( ARV) drugs . COBI is an inhibitor of renal tubular transporters of creatinine. This increases serum creatinine and reduces estimated glomerular filtration rate , with no change in glomerular function. Special Instructions COBI 150 mg is not interchangeable with RTV, but it has a PK boosting effect that is comparable to RTV 100 mg. Drug interactions may differ between RTV and COBI , because COBI is a stronger P -glycoprotein inhibitor and lacks some of the induction effects of RTV . Do not administer COBI with or with FDC tablets that contain COBI . COBI is not recommended for use with more than one ARV drug that requires PK enhancement (e.g., elvitegravir used in combination with a PI) . Using COBI with PIs other than once -daily ATV 300 mg or DRV 800 mg is not recommended. Patients with a confirmed increase in serum creatinine >0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. When us ing COBI in combination with TDF, monitor serum creatinine, urine protein, and urine glucose at baseline and every 3 to 6 months while the patient is receiving therapy (see Table 15i .

In patients who are at risk of renal impairment, serum phosphate also should be monitored. For information on crushing and cutting tablets, see this table from Toronto General Hospital . Metabolism/Elimination COBI is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome and a Cobicistat Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment COBI does not require dose adjustment in patients with mild -to- moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. D osing recommendations for medications that are coadministered COBI should be followed.1 Genvoya, Prezcobix, Stribild, and recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.1 Evotaz is not recommended in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. Cobicistat Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment COBI does not require a dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment, including those with severe renal impairm ent. Dosing recommendations for medications that are coadministered with COBI should be followed.1 The use of COBI plus TDF is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance ( CrCl) <70 mL/min. Dose adjustments required for patients with CrCl <50 mL/min, and the necessary dose adjustments for TDF when this drug is used with COBI have not been established in this group of patients .1 Stribild2 should not be initiated in patients with estimated CrCl <70 mL/min and should be discontinued in patients with estimated CrCl <50 mL/min . The dose adjustments required for emtricitabine and TDF in these patients cannot be achieved with an FDC tablet. Genvoya 3 and Symtuza4 are not recommended in patients with estimated CrCl <30 mL/min. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Metabolism of cobicistat (COBI) is mainly via cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A4 and, to a lesser degree, CYP2D6. COBI is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. COBI also inhibits breast cancer resistance protein , (P -gp), the organic OAT does not demonstrate any enzyme -inducing effects. The potential exists for multiple drug interactions when using COBI. Before COBI is administered, a patient's medication Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-176 profile should be carefully reviewed for potential interactions and overlapping toxicities with other drugs . Coadministration of medica tions that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may respectively decrease or increase exposures of COBI and coformulated antiretroviral medications. Coadministration of medications that are CYP3A4 substrates may result in clinically significant adverse reactions that are severe, life -threatening, or fatal, or may result in loss of therapeutic effect if dependent on conversion to an active metabolite due to CYP3A4 inhibition by COBI.1 dose of 10 mg combined with COBI produces tenofovir (TFV) exposures that are similar to those produced by TAF 25 mg without COBI.5 COBI increases plasma TFV exposures by 23% when it is coadministered with TDF; thus , renal safety should be monitored in patients who are receiving this combination.1,6 Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Efavirenz, used with COBI. Protease inhibitors : Using COBI as a dual booster for elvitegravir (EVG) and darunavir (DRV) has been studied in people with HIV and people without HIV, and the evidence is conflicting. W hen EVG plus COBI plus DRV was administered to people without HIV , the trough concentration ( Ctrough) of EVG was 50% lower than the C trough seen in people who received elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/c/FTC/ TDF) with DRV to patients with HIV , both DRV and EVG concentrations were comparable to those seen in historic controls.8 Integrase inhibitors : In one small study, dolutegravir (DTG) Ctrough was 107% higher when DTG was administered with darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c) than when it was administered with darunavir/ritonavir.9 Bictegravir (BIC) area under the curve increases 74% when BIC is administered with DRV/c .10 Corticosteroids: Increased serum concentrations of corticosteroids can occur when corticosteroids and COBI are coadministered; this can lead to clinically significant adrenal suppression. Adrenal suppression occurs regardless of whether the corticosteroids are administered orally or by some other route (e.g., intranasal, inhaled, interlaminar , intraarticular ) and regardless of whether the corticosteroids are administered routinely or intermittently . A possible exception is beclomethasone, which appears to be a relatively safe option with inhaled or intranasal administration.11,12 Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia Less common (more severe): New onset renal impairment or worsening of renal impairment when used with TDF. Rhabdomyolysis; increased amylase and lipase levels . Resistance Not applicable because C OBI has no antiviral activity. Pediatric Use Approval COBI is a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer of antiretroviral drugs that is available as a single agent or a component of fixed -dose combination (FDC) products. COBI , as a component of Stribild, is approved by the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-177 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) at the adult dose for use in children and adolescents aged 12 years and weighing 35 kg. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommends limiting the use of Stribild to those with a sexual maturity rating of 4 or 5. COBI , as a component of Genvoya, is approved by the FDA at the adult dose for use in children weighing 25 kg. The FDA has not approved COBI as a component of Genvoya for use in children <25 kg, but an ongoing PK , safety , and efficacy study is underway with a low -dose tablet in children weighing 14 kg to <25 kg (see the Elvitegravir section). COBI alone (as Tybost) is approved by the FDA at the adult dose for use in children weighing 35 kg when used in combination with ATV, and in children weighing 40 kg when used in combination with DRV. COBI, coformulated with ATV (as Evotaz) ,13 is approved by the FDA at the adult dose for use in children and adolescents weighing 35 kg. COBI, coformulated with DRV (as Prezcobix)14 and as a component of Symtuza ,4 is approved by the FDA at the adult dose in children and adolescents weighing 40 kg.

The recommended dose of RTV varies and is specific to the drug combination selected. See other sections of Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for information about the recommended doses of RTV to use with specific PIs. RTV has antiviral activity, but it is not used as an antiviral agent; instead, it is used as a PK enhancer of other PIs. Formulation Considerations The RTV oral solution contains propylene glycol and ethanol . The oral powder is prefer red over the oral solution for children who cannot swallow the tablets and who need a dose of at least RTV 100 mg because the oral powder does not contain propylene glycol or ethanol . RTV oral powder should be used only for dosing incr ements of 100 mg and cannot be used for doses <100 mg. Gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia Hepatitis Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Special Instructions Administer RTV with food to increase absorption and reduce the likelihood and severity of GI adverse events . Do not administer RTV with cobicistat (COBI) to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Shake the solution well before use. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-179 [Kaletra ] Lopinavir /Ritonavir Infant , Child See the Lopinavir /Ritonavir section of Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Informati on for information. RTV oral powder should be mixed with a soft food (e.g., applesauce, vanilla pudding ) or a liquid (e.g., water, chocolate milk, infant formula) to help mitigate the bitter taste . Administer or discard the mixture within 2 hours of mixing. To Increase Tolerability of Ritonavir Oral Solution or Oral Powder in Children Mix the solution or powder with milk, chocolate milk, ice cream, or vanilla or chocolate pudding. Before administ ering RTV, give a child ice chips, a Popsicle , or spoonfuls of partially frozen orange or grape juice concentrate to dull the taste buds . Another option is to give a nonallergic child peanut butter or hazelnut chocolate spread to coat the mouth.1 After administration, give foods with strong tastes (e.g., maple syrup, cheese) . Check a child 's food allergy history before making these recommendations. Counsel caregivers or patients that the bad taste will not be completely masked. Metabolism Dosing in Patients with H epatic Impairment RTV is primarily metabolized by the liver. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data exist on RTV dosing for adult or pediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment. Use caution when administering RTV to patients with moderate- to-severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions Additional information about drug interactions is available in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker . Metabolism: Ritonavir (RTV) is extensively metabolized by ( and is one of the most potent inhibitors of) hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A. inhibits the intestinal transporter P -glycoprotein. There is potential for multiple drug interactions with RTV . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-180 Before RTV is administered, a patient's medication profile should be reviewed carefully for potential interactions with RTV and overlapping toxicities with other drugs. RTV and cobicistat are not interchangeable . The potential drug interactions for these drugs are different .2 Avoid concomitant use of corticosteroids , including intranasal or inhaled fluticasone or inhaled budesonide . Reduced elimination of steroids can increase steroid effects, leading to adrenal insufficiency.3,4 Use caution when prescribing RTV with other inhaled steroids. Limited data suggest that beclomethasone may be a suitable alternative to fluticasone when a patient who is taking RTV requires an in haled or intranasal corticosteroid.5,6 Iatrogenic Cushing 's syndrome and suppression of the hypothalamic -pituitary axis secondary to the drug interaction between RTV and local injection of triamcinolone has occurred .7,8 See Drug Interactions Between Protease Inhibitors and Other Drugs in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for additional information. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, circumoral paresthesia, abnormal lipid levels Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic liver Cases of hepatitis , including life -threatening cases , have been reported. Allergic reactions, including bronchospasm, urticaria, and angioedema. Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens -Johnson syndrome have occurred. 9 Resistance Resistance to RTV is not clinically relevant when the drug is used as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer of other antiretroviral (ARV) medications. Pediatric Use Approval RTV has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the pediatric population. Effectiveness in Practice Use of RTV as the sole protease inhibitor (PI) in ARV therapy in children is not recommended . In both children and adults, RTV is recommended as a PK enhancer for use with other PIs. RTV is a CYP3A inhibitor and functions as a PK enhancer by slowing the metabolism of the PI. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-181 Dosing (LPV/ r) are available for pediatric patients. For more information about individual PIs, see other sections of Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . Toxicity Full-dose RTV has been shown to prolong the PR interval in a study of healthy adults who were given RTV 400 mg twice daily.9 Potentiall y life -threatening arrhythmias have been reported in premature infants who were treated with LPV/r ; therefore, the use of LPV/r is generally not recomm ended before a gestational age of 42 weeks (see Lopinavir /Ritonavir ).10,11 Coadministration of RTV with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (e.g., macrolides, quinolones, methadone) should be undertaken with caution because it is unknown how coadministering any of these drugs with RTV will affect the PR interval. In addition, RTV should be used wi th caution in patients who may be at increased risk of developing cardiac conduction abnormalities, such as patients who have underlying structural heart disease, conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy.

For children weighing 35 kg, FTC/TAF (Descovy) can be used in com bination with an INSTI or NNRTI, but not with a protease inhibitor; this restriction does not apply to regimens containing ZDV or ABC. The fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet DOR/3TC/TDF is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for children and adolescents weighing 35 kg who are antiretroviral (ARV) naive or virologically suppressed on a stable ARV regimen (see the Doravirine section) . Rilpivirine (RPV ) has low potency at high viral load s, a low barrier to resistance, and requires a high-fat meal for optimal absorption, so EFV or an INSTI are favored over RPV . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-186 The possibility of planned and unplanned pregnancy should be considered when selecting an antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimen for a n adolescent. When discussing ART options with adolescents of childbearing potential and their caregivers, it is important to consider the benefits and risks of all ARV drugs and to provide the information and counseling needed to support informed decision-making (see Table 5 . Situation - Specific Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant People and Nonpregnant People Who Are Trying to Conceive and Appendix C : Antiretroviral Counseling Guide for Health Care Providers ).

Pancreatitis (less common in children than in adults, more common when didanosine is used in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or stavudine) Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension Retinal neuritis Insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus Special Instructions Administer didanosine on an empty stomach (30 minutes before or 2 hours after a meal). To improve adherence, some practitioners administer didanosine without regard to timing of meals (see text below). Didanosine powder for oral solution contains antacids that may interfere with the absorption of other medications, including protease inhibitors (PIs). See individual PI for instructions on timing of administration. Shake didanosine oral solution well before use. Keep refrigerated; solution is stable for 30 days .

Neonate/Infant Dose (Aged 2 Weeks to <3 Months): 50 mg/m2 of body surface area every 12 hours. See dosing section below for justification of this dose. Infant Dose (Aged 3 Months to 8 Months): 100 mg/m2 body surface area every 12 hours Pediatric Dose of Oral Solution (Age >8 Months): 120 mg/m2 body surface area every 12 hours Dose range: 90-150 mg/m2 body surface area every 12 hours. Do not exceed maximum adult dose; see table below. In treatment-naive children ages 3 years to 21 years, 240 mg/m2 body surface area once daily (oral solution or capsules) has resulted in viral suppression.

Avoid giving other medications concurrently with didanosine oral solution. Mechanism unknown: Didanosine serum concentrations tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). This combination should be avoided. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function can decrease didanosine clearance. Overlapping toxicities: The combination of stavudine with didanosine may result in enhanced toxicity. This combination should be avoided (see the Major Toxicities section below). Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and hyperuricemia. Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported, and are more common when didanosine is used in combination with stavudine. Pancreatitis (less common in children than in adults, more common when didanosine is used in combination with TDF or stavudine) can occur. Increased liver enzymes, retinal depigmentation, and optic neuritis have been reported. Decreases in CD4 T lymphocyte counts have been reported when didanosine is used in combination with TDF. Rare: Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, presenting clinically with hematemesis, esophageal varices, ascites, and splenomegaly, and associated with increased transaminases, increased alkaline phosphatase, and thrombocytopenia, has been associated with long-term didanosine use. 1 Possible risk of cancer after in-utero exposure: In a study of 15,163 children without HIV infection who were exposed to at least one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) in utero, 21 cancers were identified. Didanosine accounted for only 10% of prescriptions but was associated with one-third of identified cancers, and, in multivariate analysis, didanosine was associated with a 5.5-fold (95% CI, 2.1-14.4) increased risk of cancer with first-trimester exposure. 2 Pregnant adolescents or sexually active female adolescents on didanosine should be cautioned about this risk. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use ApprovalAlthough didanosine is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NRTI for use in children as part of antiretroviral therapy, it is not recommended for use in children due to its significant toxicity and the Decrease dosage in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribing information for adjustment of dosage in accordance with creatinine clearance.Pediatric and Adolescent Dose of Didanosine when Combined with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: This combination should be avoided because of enhanced didanosine toxicity, reports of immunologic nonresponse, high rates of early virologic failure, and rapid selection of resistance mutations (see the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-192 availability of safer agents. Dosing Standard Dose in Children Aged >8 MonthsThe standard dose of didanosine oral solution in children aged >8 months is 120 mg/m 2 of body surface area twice daily.3,4 Doses higher than 180 mg/m2 of body surface area twice daily are associated with increased toxicity.5 Special Considerations for Children Aged 2 Weeks to <8 MonthsFor infants aged 2 weeks to 8 months, the FDA recommends 100 mg/m 2 of body surface area per dose twice daily. However, because pharmacokinetic (PK) differences in younger infants (aged 2 weeks-3 months) compared with older children raise concerns for increased toxicity in this younger age group, the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV recommends a dose of 50 mg/m 2 of body surface area twice daily for infants aged 2 weeks to 3 months, with an increase to 100 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily at 3 months, and finally increasing to 120 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily at age 8 months (as discussed above). Frequency of Administration (Once Daily or Twice Daily) In those aged >3 years, a once-daily dosing regimen may be preferable to promote adherence, and multiple studies support the favorable PKs and efficacy of once-daily dosing of 240 mg/m2 of body surface area.6 Food Restrictions Although the prescribing information recommends taking didanosine on an empty stomach, this is impractical for infants who must be fed frequently, and it may decrease medication adherence by increasing regimen complexity. A comparison showed that systemic exposure measured by area under the curve was similar whether didanosine oral solution was given to children with or without food; absorption of didanosine administered with food was slower and elimination more prolonged. 7 To improve adherence, some practitioners administer didanosine without regard to timing of meals. Studies in adults suggest that didanosine can be given without regard to food. 8,9 A European study dosed didanosine oral solution as part of a four-drug regimen either 1 hour before or 1 hour after meals, but allowed the extended-release formulation to be given without food restriction. The study showed good virologic outcome with up to 96 weeks of follow-up. 10 References 1. Scherpbier HJ, T erpstra V , Pajkrt D, et al.

Increased rate of bacterial pneumonia (unclear association). Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR)\u2014symptoms may include rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, or elevated serum transaminases. Rechallenge is not recommended . Special Instructions Carefully instruct patient or caregiver in proper technique for drug reconstitution and administration of SQ injections. Enfuvirtide injection instructions are provided with convenience kits. Allow reconstituted vial to stand until the powder goes completely into solution, which could take up to 45 minutes. Do not shake. Once reconstituted, inject enfuvirtide immediately or keep refrigerated in the original vial until use. Reconstituted enfuvirtide must be used within 24 hours. Enfuvirtide must be given SQ; severity of reactions increases if given intramuscularly. Give each injection at a site different from the preceding injection site; do not inject into moles, scar tissue, bruises, or the navel. Both the patient/caregiver and health care provider should carefully monitor for signs and symptoms of local infection or cellulitis. To minimize local reactions, apply ice or heat after injection or gently massage injection Enfuvirtide (T-20, Fuzeon) (Last updated May 22, 2018; last reviewed May 22, 2018) For additional information, see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/ Formulations Lyophilized Powder for Injection: 108-mg vial of enfuvirtide. Reconstitution with 1.1 mL sterile water will deliver 90 mg/mL. Convenience Kit: 60 single-use vials as 90 mg/mL), vials of sterile water for injection, 60 reconstitution syringes (3 mL), 60 administration syringes (1 mL), alcohol wipes.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-195 Drug Interactions (see also the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines and HIV Drug Interaction Checker ) There are no known significant drug interactions with enfuvirtide. Major Toxicities More common: Almost all patients (87% to 98%) experience local injection site reactions including pain and discomfort, induration, erythema, nodules and cysts, pruritus, and ecchymosis. Reactions are usually mild to moderate in severity but can be more severe. Average duration of local injection site reaction is 3 to 7 days but was >7 days in 24% of patients. Less common (more severe): Increased rate of bacterial pneumonia (unclear association).1 Pediatric studies have lacked the statistical power to answer questions concerning enfuvirtide use and increased risk of pneumonia. Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (<1%) including fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, and elevated liver transaminases; immune-mediated reactions including primary immune complex reaction, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patients experiencing HSRs should seek immediate medical attention. Therapy should not be restarted in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with HSRs. Pediatric specific: Local site cellulitis requiring antimicrobial therapy (up to 11% in certain subgroups of patients in pediatric studies).2 Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Resistance testing must be ordered specifically for fusion inhibitors, as it is not performed on routine genotypic or phenotypic assays. Pediatric Use ApprovalAlthough enfuvirtide is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children, it is not commonly used because of its high cost, need for twice-daily subcutaneous (SQ) injections, and high rate of injection site reactions. Use in deep salvage regimens 3 has also declined with the availability of integrase inhibitors and other entry inhibitors (such as maraviroc).site to better disperse the dose. There are reports of injection-associated neuralgia and paresthesia when alternative delivery systems, such as needle-free injection devices, are used. Advise patients/caregivers of the possibility of a HSR; instruct them to discontinue treatment and seek immediate medical attention if a patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with a HSR. Metabolism/Elimination Catabolism to constituent amino acids.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-196 Pharmacokinetics A single-dose pharmacokinetic evaluation study of enfuvirtide, given SQ to 14 children with HIV aged 4 years to 12 years (PACTG 1005), identified that enfuvirtide 60 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose resulted in a target trough concentration that approximated the equivalent of a 90-mg dose delivered SQ to an adult (1000 mg/mL). 4 In a second pediatric study of 25 children aged 5 years to 16 years, a 2-mg/kg dose (maximum 90 mg) of enfuvirtide given twice daily yielded drug concentrations similar to 60 mg/m2 of body surface area dose independent of age group, body weight, body surface area, and sexual maturation.5 The FDA-recommended dose of enfuvirtide for children aged 6 years to 16 years is 2 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) administered SQ twice daily. Further data are needed for dosing in children aged <6 years. Efficacy The safety and antiretroviral (ARV) activity of twice-daily SQ enfuvirtide administration at 60 mg/m 2 per dose plus optimized background therapy (OBT) was evaluated over 96 weeks in 14 children aged 4 to 12 years who had failed to achieve viral suppression on multiple prior ARV regimens (PACTG 1005). At 24 weeks 71% of the children had a >1.0log reduction in viral load; 43% and 21% had HIV RNA levels suppressed to <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL, respectively. However, only 36% of children maintained virologic suppression (>1.0log decrease in HIV RNA) at Week 96. Most children had local injection site reactions. 6 Significant improvements in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell percentages and height z scores were observed in children receiving enfuvirtide for 48 and 96 weeks. T20-310, a Phase 1/2 study of enfuvirtide (2.0 mg/kg SQ, maximum 90 mg, twice daily) plus OBT , enrolled 52 treatment-experienced children aged 3 to 16 years for 48 weeks. Only 64% of the children completed 48 weeks of therapy. The median decrease in HIV RNA was -1.17 log10 copies/mL (n = 32) and increase in CD4 cell count was 106 cells/mm3 (n = 25). At Week 8, treatment responses as measured by several plasma HIV RNA parameters were superior in younger children (aged <11 years) compared with adolescents. Median increases in CD4 cell count were 257 cells/mm 3 in children and 84 cells/mm3 in adolescents. Local skin reactions were common in all age groups (87% of study participants). The observed dif ferential responses between children and adolescents probably reflect unique challenges to adherence with the prescribed regimen. 2 References 1.

Boosted fosamprenavir (with ritonavir) is FDA-approved for ARV-naive infants 4 weeks and for treatment-experienced infants 6 months; however, the Panel does not recommend use in infants aged <6 months because of similarly low exposures (see text below). If used in infants as young as 4 weeks, it should only be administered to infants born at 38 weeks' gestation or greater. Note: Once-daily dosing is not recommended for any pediatric patient. Pediatric Dose (Aged 6 Months to 18 Years): Twice-Daily Dose Regimens by Weight for Pediatric Patients 6 Months Using Fosamprenavir Oral Suspension with Ritonavirr a Not to exceed the adult dose of fosamprenavir 700 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.WeightDose (Both Drugs Twice Dailya with Food) <11 kg Fosamprenavir 45 mg/kg/dose plus kgFosamprenavir 18 mg/kg/dose plus ritonavir 3 mg/kg/doseSelected Adverse Events Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting Skin rash (fosamprenavir has a sulfonamide moiety. Stevens-Johnson syndrome hyperglycemia Nephrolithiasis Transaminase elevation Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Special Instructions Fosamprenavir tablets with ritonavir should be taken with food. Children should take the suspension with food. Patients taking antacids should take fosamprenavir at least 1 hour before or after antacid use. Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross sensitivity between fosamprenavir and other drugs in the sulfonamide class is unknown. Fosamprenavir should be used with caution in patients with sulfonamide allergy. Shake oral suspension well before use. Refrigeration is not required. Metabolism/Elimination The prodrug fosamprenavir is rapidly and almost completely hydrolyzed to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the gut as it is absorbed. Amprenavir is a cytochrome (Last updated May 22, 2018; last reviewed May 22, 2018) For additional information, see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/ Formulations Tablets: 700 mg Oral Suspension: 50 mg/mLGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-198Drug Interactions (see also the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines and HIV Drug Interaction Checker ) Fosamprenavir may interact with a number of other drugs, and using ritonavir as a boosting agent increases the potential for drug interactions. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with fosamprenavir. Major Toxicities More common: V omiting, nausea, diarrhea, perioral paresthesia, headache, rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Life-threatening rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in <1% angioedema, and nephrolithiasis. Pediatric-specific: V omiting was more frequent in children than in adults during clinical trials of fosamprenavir with ritonavir (20% to 36% vs. 10%, respectively) fosamprenavir without ritonavir (60% vs. 16%, respectively). Neutropenia was also more common in children across all the trials (15% vs. 3%, respectively). 1 Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric UseApproval Fosamprenavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children as young as age 4 weeks, but the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV (the Fosamprenavir Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Specific dose adjustments are recommended for adults with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment. However, there are no data to support dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. Please refer to the package insert. Fosamprenavir Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.Note: When administered with ritonavir, the adult regimen of 700 mg fosamprenavir tablets plus 100 mg ritonavir, both given twice daily, can be used in patients weighing 39 kg. Ritonavir tablets can be used in patients weighing 33 kg. Adolescent and Adult Dose: Dosing regimen depends on whether the patient is ARV-naive or ARV-experienced. ARV-Naive Patients Fosamprenavir 700 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, both twice daily Fosamprenavir 1400 mg plus ritonavir 100- 200 mg, both once daily Protease-Inhibitor-Experienced Patients: Fosamprenavir 700 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, both twice daily Note: Once-daily administration of fosamprenavir plus ritonavir is not recommended.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-199Panel) recommends use only in children aged 6 months. While unboosted fosamprenavir has been approved by the FDA for antiretroviral-naive children aged 2 to 5 years, the Panel does not recommend unboosted fosamprenavir for this\u2014or any other\u2014age group because of low exposures and also because unboosted fosamprenavir may select for mutations associated with resistance to darunavir. 2 Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Dosing recommendations for fosamprenavir are based on three pediatric studies that enrolled more than 200 children aged 4 weeks to 18 years. In two, open-label trials in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive children aged 2 to 18 years, 3,4 fosamprenavir was well-tolerated and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 T lymphocyte count. However, data were insufficient to support a once-daily dosing regimen of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in children; therefore, once-daily dosing is not recommended for pediatric patients. Pharmacokinetics in Infants In a study of infants, higher doses of both fosamprenavir and ritonavir were used in treatment-naive infants as young as age 4 weeks and in treatment-experienced infants as young as age 6 months. 1,5 Exposures in those aged <6 months were much lower than those achieved in older children and adults and comparable to those seen with unboosted fosamprenavir (see table below). Given these low exposures, limited data, large dosing volumes, unpleasant taste, and the availability of alternatives for infants and young children, the Panel does not recommend fosamprenavir use in infants aged <6 months.

Adolescent and Adult Dose: 800 mg indinavir plus 100 or 200 mg ritonavir every 12 hours The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV does not recommend the use of indinavir in adolescents.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-202Drug Interactions (see also the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker ) Metabolism: Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism. There is potential for multiple drug interactions with indinavir. Avoid other drugs that cause hyperbilirubinemia, such as atazanavir. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with indinavir. Major Toxicities More common: Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis with indinavir crystal deposit is reported more frequently in children (29%) than in adults (12.4%).1 Interstitial nephritis and urothelial inflammation has been commonly reported in adults.2 Nausea, abdominal pain, headache, metallic taste, dizziness, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia (10%), lipid abnormalities, pruritus, and rash. hemophiliacs, acute hemolytic anemia, and hepatitis (life-threatening in rare cases). Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric UseApproval Indinavir has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the pediatric population. Although indinavir was one of the first protease inhibitors to be studied in children, its use in pediatrics has never been common and is currently very rare. 3 Indinavir is not recommended by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV for use in children and adolescents because of its unfavorable toxicity profile, limited efficacy data, and uncertain pharmacokinetics. Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Both unboosted and ritonavir-boosted indinavir have been studied in children with HIV . In children, an unboosted indinavir dose of 500 to 600 mg/m 2 body surface area given every 8 hours results in peak blood concentrations and area under the curve that are slightly higher than those in adults, but trough concentrations are considerably lower. A significant proportion of children have trough indinavir concentrations less than the 0.1 mg/L value associated with virologic efficacy in adults. 4-7 Studies that investigated a range of indinavir/ritonavir doses in small groups of children have shown that indinavir 500 mg/m 2 body surface area plus ritonavir 100 mg/m2 body surface area twice daily is probably too high,8 that indinavir 234 to 250 mg/m2 body surface area plus low-dose ritonavir twice daily is too low,9,10 and that indinavir 400 mg/m2 body surface area plus ritonavir 100 to 125 mg/m2 body surface area twice daily results in exposures approximating those seen with indinavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in adults, albeit with considerable inter-individual variability and high rates of toxicity. 10-12 References 1.

Metabolism/Elimination Cytochrome P (CYP) metabolite CYP3A4 inhibitorDosing Recommendations Note: The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV no longer recommends nelfinavir-based regimens for use in children due to inferior potency compared to other regimens. Neonate and Infant Dose: Nelfinavir should not be used for treatment in children aged <2 years. Pediatric Dose (Aged 2 Years): 45-55 mg/kg twice daily Adolescent and Adult Dose: 1250 mg (five 250-mg tablets or two 625-mg tablets) twice dailyGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-205 Rare: New-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation mellitus, spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia, and elevations in transaminases. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval Nelfinavir is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children aged 2 years. Given the higher variability of nelfinavir plasma concentrations in infants and younger children,1,2 nelfinavir is not approved for children aged <2 years. Despite being FDA-approved for pediatric use, nelfinavir is not recommended for use in children and adolescents by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV , due to its limited efficacy and uncertain pharmacokinetics (PK). Efficacy in Pediatric Clinical Trials Nelfinavir used in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs has been extensively studied in children with HIV infection. 3-10 In randomized trials of children aged 2 to 13 years receiving nelfinavir as part of triple combination therapy, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL through 48 weeks of therapy has been quite variable, ranging from 26% to 69%. The antiviral response to nelfinavir is significantly less in children aged <2 years than in older children. 8,10,11 In clinical studies, virologic and immunologic response to nelfinavir-based therapy has varied according to the patient's age or prior treatment history, the number of drugs included in the combination regimen, and the dose of nelfinavir used. Pharmacokinetics: Exposure-Response Relationships Nelfinavir's relatively poor ability to control plasma viremia in infants and children in clinical trials may be related to its lower potency when compared with other ARV drugs, as well as highly variable drug exposure, metabolism, and poor palatability. 12-14 The bioavailability of dissolved nelfinavir tablets is comparable to that of tablets swallowed whole.3,15 Administration of nelfinavir with food increases nelfinavir exposure (area under the curve increases by up to five-fold) and decreases PK variability when compared to the fasted state. Nelfinavir plasma exposure may be even more unpredictable in pediatric patients than in adults due to the increased clearance of nelfinavir observed in children and difficulties in taking nelfinavir with sufficient food to improve bioavailability. Nelfinavir is metabolized by multiple CYP450 enzymes, including CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. The variability of drug exposure at any given dose is much higher for children than for adults, 16 which has been attributed\u2014at least in part\u2014to differences in the diets of children and adults. Two population PK studies of nelfinavir and its active metabolite, M8, describe large intersubject variability observed in children.17,18 CYP2C19 genotype has been shown to affect nelfinavir PK and the virologic responses in children with HIV . 12 Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between nelfinavir trough concentrations and virologic response. In both children and adults, an increased risk of virologic failure was associated with low nelfinavir drug exposure, particularly with a nelfinavir minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) <1.0 mcg/mL. 19-21 In a study of 32 children treated with a high dose of nelfinavir (a two-fold increase of the recommended dose), 80% of children with morning trough nelfinavir plasma concentration >0.8 mcg/mL had HIV RNA concentrations <50 copies/mL at Week 48, compared with only 29% of those with morning trough <0.8 mcg/mL. 22 Children in the group with Ctrough <0.8 mcg/mL were younger than the children in the group with Ctrough >0.8 mcg/mL (median ages in these groups were 3.8 years and 8.3 years, respectively).22 Therapeutic drug monitoring of nelfinavir plasma concentrations, with appropriate adjustments for low drug exposure, has been shown to improve virologic response in adults and children. 18,19,23,24 Pediatric and Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-206 adolescent patients may require doses higher than those recommended in adults to achieve higher plasma nelfinavir exposure.

Available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17609682 .Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-208Drug Interactions (see also the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines and the HIV Drug Interaction Checker ) Saquinavir is both a substrate and inhibitor of the cytochrome P 450 3A4 (CYP3A4) system. Potential exists for multiple drug interactions. Saquinavir should not be coadministered with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A clearance, especially in cases where elevated plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug can cause serious or life-threatening events. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, headache, nausea, paresthesia, skin rash, and lipid Dosing Recommendations Pediatric Dose: Not approved for use in infants, children, and adolescents aged <16 years. Adolescent and Adult Dose: Saquinavir should only be used in combination with ritonavir. Saquinavir 1000 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice dailySelected Adverse Events Gastrointestinal intolerance, nausea, and diarrhea Elevated transaminases Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution PR interval prolongation, QT inter val prolongation, and ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes) Special Instructions Administer within 2 hours after a full meal. Sun exposure can cause photosensitivity reactions; advise patients to use sunscreen or protective clothing. Pre-therapy electrocardiogram is recommended; saquinavir is contraindicated in 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolized in the liver Use saquinavir with caution in patients who have hepatic impairment; no dose adjustment recommended .Saquinavir (SQV, Invirase) (Last updated May 22, 2018; last reviewed May 22, 2018) For additional information, see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf Formulations Capsules: 200 mg Tablets: 500 mgGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-209abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of ketoacidosis, exacerbation spontaneous bleeding with hemophilia, pancreatitis, and elevation in serum transaminases. Saquinavir administered with ritonavir can lead to prolonged QT and/or PR intervals with potential for heart block and ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes). Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric UseApproval Saquinavir is not approved for use in children or adolescents aged <16 years. 1 EfficacySaquinavir has been studied with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and other protease inhibitors in children a dual-protease inhibitor saquinavir/lopinavir/ ritonavir regimen were considered for salvage therapy in children prior to the emergence of the new classes of antiretroviral medications; these regimens are no longer recommended. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from children who received SQV/r showed prohibitively low exposure in children younger than 2 years. 10 In children aged 2 years, a dose of saquinavir 50 mg/kg twice daily in combination with ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in steady-state plasma trough concentrations (C trough ) similar to those seen adults.9,11 No clinical trials have collected data on the efficacy of saquinavir doses <50 mg/kg in children. Toxicity In healthy adult volunteers, SQV/r dose and exposure were associated with increases in both QT and PR intervals.1,12 Rare cases of Torsades de Pointes and complete heart block have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. SQV/r is not recommended for adolescent and adult patients with any of the following conditions: documented congenital or acquired hypomagnesemia, complete atrioventricular block without implanted pacemakers, at risk of complete atrioventricular block, or the use of other drugs that prolong QT interval. An electrocardiogram (EKG) is recommended before initiation of therapy with saquinavir and repeat EKGs should be considered during therapy. Steady-state saquinavir exposures observed in one pediatric trial (NV2091 1) were substantially higher than those seen in historical data from adults with QT and PR prolongation. 1,12 Although no EKG abnormalities have been reported among the small number of subjects in pediatric trials, pediatric PK/pharmacodynamics modeling suggests that reducing the saquinavir dose in order to minimize the risk of QT prolongation would decrease saquinavir efficacy in children. Pediatric saquinavir dose recommendations that were both reliably effective and below the thresholds of concern for QT and PR prolongation were not determined. References 1.

Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): Stavudine should not be administered in combination with zidovudine because of virologic antagonism. Overlapping toxicities: The combination of stavudine and didanosine is not recommended because of overlapping toxicities. Reported toxicities occur more frequently in adults and include serious, even fatal, cases of lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis with or women. Ribavirin and interferon: Hepatic decompensation (sometimes fatal) has occurred in patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus co-infection who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), interferon, and ribavirin. Doxorubicin: Simultaneous use of doxorubicin and stavudine should be avoided. Doxorubicin may inhibit the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active form. Major Toxicities More common: Headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rashes, hyperlipidemia, and fat maldistribution. Less common (more severe): Peripheral sensory neuropathy is dose-related. It occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, a prior history of peripheral neuropathy, and in patients receiving other drugs associated with neuropathy. Pancreatitis. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with hepatic steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. 1-3 The combination of stavudine and didanosine may result in enhanced toxicity (increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cases of lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatotoxicity), particularly in adults, including pregnant women\u2014this combination should not be used . Risk factors found to be associated with lactic acidosis in adults include female sex, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure. 4 Rare: Increased liver enzymes and hepatic toxicity, which may be severe or fatal. Neurologic symptoms, including rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular weakness, are most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis. Noncirrhotic portal hypertension with prolonged exposure. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations , and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric Use Approval Although stavudine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in infants aged 14 days and children, it is no longer recommended for use by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV because it carries a higher risk of adverse effects associated with mitochondrial toxicity and a higher incidence of lipoatrophy than other NRTIs. Efficacy Data from multiple pediatric studies of stavudine administered alone or in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents demonstrate that stavudine is associated with clinical and virologic response. 5-11 In resource-limited countries, stavudine is frequently a component of initial ART in children, given with lamivudine and nevirapine. Stavudine is often a component of fixed-dose combinations that are not available in the United States. In this setting, reported outcomes from observational studies are good; data show substantial increases in the CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and complete viral suppression in 50% to 80% of treatment-naive children. 12-15 In such a setting, where pediatric patients are already predisposed to anemia because of malnutrition, parasitic infestations, or sickle cell anemia, stavudine carries a lower risk of Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-213hematologic toxicity than zidovudine, especially in patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP- SMX) prophylaxis.16 Short-term use of stavudine in certain settings where access to other ARVs may be limited remains an important strategy for treating HIV in children.17,18 Toxicity Stavudine is associated with a higher rate of adverse events than zidovudine in adults and children receiving ART. 19,20 In a large pediatric natural history study (PACTG 219C), stavudine-containing regimens had a modest\u2014but significantly toxicities than regimens zidovudine, with pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy (fat maldistribution) associated more often with stavudine use. 20 Lipodystrophy and Metabolic Abnormalities Lipodystrophy syndrome (LS), and specifically lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat), are toxicities associated with NRTIs, particularly stavudine, in adults and children.21-24 Stavudine use has consistently been associated with a higher risk of lipodystrophy and other metabolic abnormalities (e.g., insulin resistance) in multiple pediatric studies involving children. 25-33 Improvements in (or resolution of) lipodystrophy were reported in 22.9% to 73% of cases after discontinuation of stavudine in two separate studies.30,34 Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, including fatal cases, has been reported with use of nucleoside analogues, including stavudine, alone or in combination with didanosine. 1-3 Mechanism Many of the stavudine-related adverse events are believed to be due to mitochondrial toxicity resulting from inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, with depletion of mitochondrial DNA in fat, muscle, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other tissues. 1,35-37 In a recent analysis involving a large cohort of pediatric patients (PACTG protocols 219 and 219C), possible mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with NRTI use, especially in children receiving stavudine and/or lamivudine. 38 World Health Organization Recommendations The World Health Organization (WHO) cautions against using doses of stavudine that exceed 30 mg twice daily. This is in contrast to the FDA-recommended dose of 40 mg twice daily in patients weighing 60 kg or more. 39,40 Studies comparing the efficacy and toxicity of the two doses have consistently shown that both doses have similar efficacy. However, while the 30-mg dose shows lower toxicity than the 40-mg dose, the overall incidence of toxicity with the 30-mg dose is considered to be unacceptably high. 41-45 WHO recommends that stavudine be phased out of use in all patients because of concerns about unacceptable toxicity, even at the lower dose. Safer alternative agents can be prescribed. Pharmacokinetics Current pediatric dosing recommendations are based on early pharmacokinetic (PK) studies designed to achieve exposure (area under the curve) in children similar to that found in adults receiving a dose with proven efficacy. 46 Although WHO has recommended using a reduced dose in adults, a similar dose reduction has not been suggested in children. A reduced pediatric dose has been proposed based on PK modeling, but clinical data on intracellular concentrations of the active stavudine triphosphate are lacking. 47,48 Intracellular stavudine triphosphate concentrations have been measured in neonates. FormulationsThe pediatric formulation for stavudine oral solution requires refrigeration and has limited stability once reconstituted. As an alternative dosing method for children, capsules can be opened and dispersed in a small amount of water, with the appropriate dose drawn up into an oral syringe and administered immediately. Because plasma exposure of stavudine is equivalent whether the drug is administered in an intact or a dispersed capsule, dosing with the dispersal method can be used as an alternative to the oral solution. 49Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-214References 1.

The ritonavir boosting dose used for tipranavir is higher than the doses used for other protease inhibitors. Pediatric (Aged <2 Years) Dose: Not approved for use in children aged <2 years Pediatric (Aged 2-18 Years) Dose: Note: Not recommended for treatment-naive Area Dosing: Tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2, both twice daily (maximum dose is TPV/r 500 mg/200 mg, both twice daily) Weight-Based Dosing: TPV/r 14 mg/kg/6 mg/kg, both twice daily (maximum dose is TPV/r 500 mg/200 mg, both twice daily) Adult Dose: TPV/r 500 mg (as two 250-mg capsules)/200 mg, both daily Note: Not recommended for treatment-naive patientsTipranavir (TPV, Aptivus) (Last updated May 22, 2018; last reviewed May 22, 2018) For additional information, see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/ Formulations Oral Solution: 100 mg tipranavir/mL, with 116 International Units (IU) vitamin E/mL Capsules: 250 mg Selected Adverse Events Rare cases of fatal and non-fatal intracranial hemorrhage Skin rash (more common in children than adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Hepatotoxicity: elevated transaminases; clinical hepatitis Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Elevated creatine phosphokinase Special Instructions Administer tipranavir and ritonavir together and with food. Tipranavir oral solution contains 116 IU vitamin E per mL, which is significantly higher than the reference daily intake for vitamin E. Patients taking the oral solution should avoid taking any form of supplemental vitamin E that contains more vitamin E than found in a standard multivitamin. Tipranavir contains a sulfonamide moiety and should be used with caution in patients with sulfonamide allergy. Store tipranavir oral solution at room temperature, 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F); do not refrigerate or freeze. Oral solution must be used within 60 days after the bottle is first opened. Store unopened bottles of oral tipranavir capsules in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Once the bottle has been opened, capsules can be kept at room temperature (maximum of 77\u00b0F or 25\u00b0C) if used within 60 days. Use tipranavir with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, including individuals with brain Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-218 Drug Interactions (see also the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines and HIV Drug Interaction Checker ) Tipranavir has the potential for multiple drug interactions. Co-administration of tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) with drugs that are highly dependent on cytochrome P (CYP) 3A for clearance or are potent CYP3A inducers is contraindicated. Before tipranavir is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. TPV/r is a potent enzyme inducer and has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of other antiretroviral drugs. TPV/r significantly decreases plasma concentrations of etravirine. Etravirine and TPV/r should not be co-administered. TPV/r has been shown to decrease raltegravir concentrations. TPV/r dose adjustment is not currently recommended when raltegravir is administered twice daily. However, TPV/r should not be co-administered with raltegravir HD once daily because significantly lower raltegravir concentrations are likely to occur. Tipranavir should be used with caution in patients who are receiving medications known to increase the risk of bleeding, such as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, or high doses of supplemental vitamin E. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, rash (which is more frequent in children than in adults), and vomiting. Elevated transaminases, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Elevated creatine phosphokinase. Less common (more severe): Lipodystrophy. Hepatotoxicity: clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C coinfection or elevations in transaminases are at increased risk of developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic lesion, head trauma, recent neurosurgery, coagulopathy, hypertension, or alcoholism, or who use anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents (including vitamin E). Use of tipranavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate in Patients with Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is required. Tipranavir Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is required for mild hepatic impairment. Use of tipranavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-219 decompensation (approximately 2.5-fold risk). Epistaxis, which is more common with oral solution than capsule formulation. Rare: New-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, Increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Tipranavir should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, sur gery, or other medical conditions. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation. Pediatric UseApproval and General Considerations Tipranavir is approved for use in children aged as young as 2 years and is available in a liquid formulation. Its indication is limited to those patients who are treatment-experienced and who have HIV strains that are resistant to more than one protease inhibitor (PI). 1 Tipranavir imposes a high pill burden on patients taking tipranavir capsules and requires a higher dose of boosting ritonavir than the doses used with other PIs. This increased dose of ritonavir is associated with a greater potential for drug interactions and increased toxicity. In addition, tipranavir is associated with serious adverse events (AEs) that limit its use to patients with few treatment options. EfficacyThe Food and Drug Administration's approval of tipranavir was based on a multicenter, pediatric study of the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of TPV/r in children with HIV (PACTG 1051/BI-1182.14). 2 This study enrolled 110 treatment-experienced children (with the exception of three treatment-naive patients) aged 2 years to 18 years (with a median age of 11.7 years). Patients were randomized to receive two different dosing regimens. The higher dose of TPV/r (375 mg/150 mg/m 2 body surface area [BSA] twice daily) plus optimized background therapy was associated with better virologic responses at 48 weeks, particularly in the older, more heavily pretreated patients, when compared to the lower dose that was studied. A follow-up study of PACTG 1051 participants evaluated the long-term safety, efficacy, and tolerability of TPV/r in pediatric patients. 3 At Week 288, most children were no longer receiving TPV/r. Reasons for discontinuation included AEs, virologic failure, and nonadherence. The youngest patients who were stable at Week 48 were more likely to still be on treatment after 5 years with continued efficacy. 3 Pharmacokinetics PK evaluation of the liquid formulation at steady state in children was assessed.4 In children aged 2 to <12 years, a dose of TPV/r 290 mg/115 mg/m2 BSA achieved tipranavir trough concentrations that were consistent with those achieved in adults receiving standard TPV/r 500 mg/200 mg dosing. However, children aged 12 to 18 years required a higher dose (375 mg/150 mg/m2 BSA, 30% higher than the directly scaled adult dose) to achieve drug exposure similar to that seen in adults receiving the standard TPV/r dose. Based on available data, a dose of TPV/r 375 mg/150 mg/m 2 BSA twice daily is recommended. Toxicity AEs were similar between treatment groups in the multicenter, pediatric study.2 Twenty-five percent of children experienced a drug-related serious AE, and 9% of patients discontinued study drugs because of AEs. The most common AEs were gastrointestinal disturbances: 37% of participants had vomiting and 24% had diarrhea. The most common Grade 3 through 4 laboratory abnormalities were increases in the levels of creatine phosphokinase (11% of participants), alanine aminotransferase (6.5% of amylase (7.5% of participants). In the long-term follow-up report for PACTG 1051, incidence of AEs defined as drug-related was 55% to 65% regardless of age at entry, with higher discontinuation rates due to AEs in the older age groups. 3 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-220Vitamin E is an excipient in the tipranavir oral solution, with a concentration of 116 international units (IU) of vitamin E and 100 mg tipranavir per mL of solution. The recommended dose of tipranavir (14 mg/kg body weight) results in a vitamin E dose of 16 IU/kg body weight per day , significantly higher than the reference daily intake for vitamin E (which is 30 IU for adults and approximately 6-22 IU for children and adolescents, depending on age of the child or adolescent) and close to the upper limit of tolerability for children. In PACTG 1051, bleeding events were reported more commonly in children receiving tipranavir oral capsules (14.3%) than in children taking tipranavir oral solution (5.75%). 2 Overall, the incidence of bleeding episodes (primarily epistaxis) in pediatric patients observed in clinical trials was 7.5%.5 References 1.
