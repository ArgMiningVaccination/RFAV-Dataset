The program became operational in September 2011. The PDMP is an electronic Web -based data system that collect s data on the controlled prescription medications dispensed in the state by retail pharmacies . Controlled substance prescription information collected by the PDMP include s opioids, drugs are the most frequently prescribed controlled substance. Opioids are prescribed to control pain - pain that is the result of injury, ambulatory surgery, inpatient surgery, cancer care, pain that is a chronic problem, and end-of-life care. It is helpful to keep in mind the variety of conditions that these medicines are prescribed for when examining the PDMP data because the PDMP data do not include clinical diagnostic information. The following information can provide the reader with a frame of reference to use when considering the magnitude of medically necessary prescr iption of controlled substances : Twenty percent of Oregonians (about 760,000 people ) live with chronic pain, 1 More than 100,000 injuries are treated in emergency departments each year ,2 About 5.5 percent of Oregonians ( 213,000 people ) had surgical visits ,3 An estimated 18 percent of adults ages 18 and older (about 500,000 people ) have an anxiety disorder ,4 and About 8,000 Oregonians die due to cancer each year and about 20,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed among Oregonians each year .5 The statewide PDMP data provided below - and additional 36 county -level reports - are the first to examine the dispensing of the most -often prescribed controlled substances and selected prescription drugs. Statewide Findings Between Oct. 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012: More than 3.4 million prescriptions for Schedul es II-IV controlled substances were dispensed by retail pharmacies to Oregonians; of these , more than 1.8 million prescriptions were for opioids. 1 Institute of Medicine, 2011.

Archives of General Psychiatry , 2005 Jun;62(6):617 -27. 5 Oregon Cancer Registry 4 Statewide PDMP Data Report, October 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012 More than 600,000 Oregonians received at least one prescription opiate. These patients received an average of th ree opiate prescriptions -- 159 people per 1,000 residents received an opiate prescription (Table 2) . More than 975,000 prescriptions for benzodiazepines were dispensed by retail pharmacies to more than 300,000 people (Table 9 ). Almost 109,000 Oregonians received prescriptions for both an opiate and a benzodiazepine (Table 21). Sixty percent of the total Schedule II -IV controlled substance prescriptions dispensed were prescribed by 2,000 prescribers (Figure 1). Among those 2,000 prescribers , 55 percent are registered PDMP system users. Threshold measures that indicate potential drug seeking indicate: 1,746 patients filled prescriptions from at least 5 different prescribers and at 5 different pharmacies; 69 patients filled prescriptions fro m at least 10 different prescribers and at 10 different pharmacies; and 18 patients filled prescriptions from at least 15 different prescribers and at 15 different pharmacies (Table 25). Background Oregon -licensed retail pharmacies are required to submi t prescription information to the PDMP system for all Schedule II - IV controlled substances dispensed. Prescribers are permitted to access PDMP information on their patients. Pharmacists are permitted to access PDMP information on their customers. The int ent of the PDMP is to help health care providers improve care for their patients and prevent some of the problems associated with controlled substances . The Oregon PDMP provides authenticated system users who are licensed to prescribe schedule II, III, and IV drugs electronic 24 -hour, seven -day-a-week access to patient level data on controlled substances dispensed to the patient by licensed pharmacies. The PDMP data allow a health care pr ovider to see a report of the medicines that are dispensed to his o r her pati ent and prescribed by any additional health care providers who serve his or her patient. Health care providers can e xamine the purchasing history of a patient to monitor and discuss controlled substance use as part of pain management and screen for substance misuse and abuse. Opioids are the class of medicines that has the highest potential for overdose, misuse, dependence, and ab use. Other classes of controlled substance medicines are commonly prescribed in combination with opioids . The PDMP is a useful tool for health care providers who prescribe controlled substances as part of a patient treatment plan. The evaluation results of health care provider use of the system in the early implementation of the PDMP are not the topic of this report. Information on hea lth care provider system use is the topic of an upcoming report. 5 Statewide PDMP Data Report, October 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012 Introduction Patient use of controlled prescr ibed medications is an important part of medically necessary treatment plan s for many health problems. Patient use is monitored by health care providers because these medicines place patients at risk for overdose, side effects , potentiation when combined with alcohol and/ or other drugs, risk for physical dependence, and risk for developing patterns of drug abuse. Controlled substance prescription information collected by the PDMP includes opioids, sedative hypnotics, benzodiazepines , stimulants, and other Opioids are the most frequently prescribed controlled substance. Opioids are prescribed to control pain - pain that is the result of injury, ambulatory surgery, inpatient surgery, cancer care, pain tha t is a chronic problem, and end-of-life care. It is helpful to keep in mind the variety of conditions that these medicines are prescribed for when examining the PDMP data because the PDMP data do not include diagnostic information. The following information can provide the reader with a frame of reference to use when considering the magnitude of medically necessary prescribing of controlled substances : Twenty percent of Oregonians (about 760,000 people) live with chronic pain, 6 More than 100,000 injuries are treated in emergency departments each year,7 About 5.5 percent of Oregonians (213,000 people ) had surgical visits,8 About 18 percent of adults ages 18 and older (about 500,000 people ) have an anxiety disorder ,9 and About 8,000 Oregonians die due to cancer each year and about 20,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed among Oregonians each year .10 Certainly , not all of the individuals experiencing these and other conditions receive controlled subst ances throughout an entire year. H owever, many patients rely on controlled substances to heal from i njury and surgery, to endure cancer and end -of-life pain, to mitigate symptoms of mental disorders, and to control chronic pain. The st atewide aggregated data report - and 36 county level reports - can be used to inform, develop, and implement population- based prevention approaches to reduce prescription drug overdose, such as public information campaigns and clinical guidance. 6 Institute of Medicine, 2011.

Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of twelve -month DSM -IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS -R). Archives of General Psychiatry , 2005 Jun;62(6):617 -27. 10 Oregon Cancer Registry 6 Statewide PDMP Data Report, October 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012 Data Limitat ions Diagnosis information is not included with the prescription information in the PDMP data. This limits any conclusions that could be drawn with respect to the underlying problems that medicines are prescribed to address. The PDMP s tatute directs retail ph armacies dispensing schedule II -IV drugs to submit prescription data to the Oregon Health Authority within seven days of dispensing. Pharmacies began submitting data in June 2011. By October 2011, 76 percent of all pharmacies were submitting data. The compliance with data submission increased to 97 percent by the end of March 2012. Data submitted by ph armacies can contain errors. Each data submission is checked for errors and if the data contains errors it is sent back to the pharmacy to be corrected and resubmitted . Howev er, not all errors are found or corrected. The sex of the patient, method of payment, diagno sis, days supplied, and refill information are not collected as they are not included in the data variables allowed in statute. The system is not a ble to convert prescriptions to morphine equivalent doses (MEDs), so dosage information is omitted from these reports to avoid possible confusion. Data in table cells containing counts of less than ten are suppressed. This is done to protect the privacy of individuals when reporting county -specific data for each of Oregon's 36 counties. Discussion Prescription drug overdose, dependence, and addiction are serious public health problems. The PDMP provides health care providers with a tool to identify and address these problems. The PDMP mission is to use data to improve health care by offering health care providers and pharmacists information about prescription controlled substances, reduce prescription overdose, decrease \"doctor shopping\" - a patient obtaining controlled substances from multiple health care providers without the prescribers' knowledge of the other prescriptions - and decrease misuse of prescription controlled substances. A balanced approach to this work includes an understanding of the need to preserve access to medicines for the management of pain while decreasing the misuse of prescr iption controlled substances. The PDMP data group welcomes input and questions. Recommendations Assure that the top 2,000 prescribers have system accounts. Produce and disseminate a tool for system users on how to use a PDMP report with a patient. Disseminate information about the PDMP system and helpful resources through licensing boards and health care provider associations. 7 Statewide PDMP Data Report, October 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012 Data Statewide Population Table 1.

Methadone Methadone is used to relieve moderate to severe pain that has not been relieved by non-narcotic pain relievers. It also is used to prevent withdrawal symptoms in patients who were addicted to opiate drugs and are enrolled in treatment programs in order to stop taking or continue not taking the drugs. Methadone is in a class of medications called opiate narcotic analgesics. Methadone works to treat pain by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. It also works as a substitute for opiate drugs of abuse by producing similar effects and preventing withdrawal symptoms in people who have stopped using these drugs.

The PDMP provides health care providers with a tool to identify and address these problems. The PDMP mission is to use data to improve health care by offering health care providers and pharmacists information about prescription controlled substances, reduce prescription overdose, decrease \"doctor shopping\" - a patient obtaining controlled substances from multiple health care providers without the prescribers' knowledge of the other prescriptions - and decrease misuse of prescription controlled substances. A balanced approach to this work includes an understanding of the need to preserve access to medicines for the management of pain while decreasing the misuse of prescr iption controlled substances. The PDMP data group welcomes input and questions. Recommendations Assure that the top 2,000 prescribers have system accounts. Produce and disseminate a tool for system users on how to use a PDMP report with a patient. Disseminate information about the PDMP system and helpful resources through licensing boards and health care provider associations. 34 Statewide PDMP Data Report, October 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012 Glossary of Terms Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and to reduce fever.
