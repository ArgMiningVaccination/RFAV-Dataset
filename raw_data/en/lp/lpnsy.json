FAQs What is homeopathy? As a complementary medicine, homeopathy uses diluted natural substances from plants and minerals to promote the body's self-healing. Homeopaths follow the idea \"like cures like\", triggering the body's natural defense mechanism with a substance that can induce the symptom. Homeopathy is often used on chronic illnesses like allergies, migraines, as well as minor discomforts such as muscle strains, bruises, cold and cough. Who can use homeopathy? Homeopathy can be beneficial to people of all ages and in particular pregnant women and babies. However, some homeopathic products may contain heavy metals as the active ingredients. You should consult your doctor to check if the alternative treatment is suitable for you. Nevertheless, you should not replace conventional medicine or delay treatments with homeopathy. Can homeopathic products cause side effects? As homeopathic medicines are mostly prescribed in high dilutions, it is unlikely for them to cause any side effects. The exception is some homeopathic medicines that use a high dosage of heavy metals as active ingredients, which can cause adverse effects or drug interactions.
