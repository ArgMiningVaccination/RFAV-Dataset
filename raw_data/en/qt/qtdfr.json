This is a record -high quarterly order intake for us. The development was strong in the capital business, where orders received totaled EUR 697 million and almost doubled from the comparison period. Orders received in the stable business1 increased 12 percent (4% without the acquired businesses) . Our order backlog increased to a record high of EUR 3,557 million. Net sales and Comp arable EBITA increased as well. The main global news headline of the first quarter was the COVID -19 pandemic.

Valmet has a solid foundation to cope with the virus and our long -term growth drivers have not changed. However, the spread of the coronavirus has increased uncertainty for the rest of the year. Due to the increased uncertainty, Valmet has withdrawn its guidance for 2020 .\" Key figures2 EUR million Q1/2020 Q1/2019 Change 2019 20% Comparable earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (Comparable EBITA) 52 47 9% 316 % of net sales 6.3% 6.9% 8.9% Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) 51 49 3% 315 % of net sales 6.2% 7.1% 8.9% Operating profit (EBIT) 42 43 -1% 281 % of net sales 5.1% 6.2% 7.9% Profit before taxes 40 41 -3% 269 Profit for the period 30 31 -5% 202 Earnings per share, EUR 0.20 0.21 -4% 1.35 Earnings per share, diluted, EUR 0.20 0.21 -4% 1.35 Equity per share, EUR3 6.72 5.82 15% 6.95 Cash flow provided by operating activities 173 30 >100% 295 Cash flow after investments 156 13 >100% 58 Return on equity (ROE) (annualized) 12% 14% 20% Return on capita l employed (ROCE) before -9% 2 The calculation of key figures is presented on page 37. 3 At the end of period 1 Including internal orders received for t he Automation business line.

The authorizations shall remain in force until the next Annual General Meeting, and they cancel the authorizations granted in the Annual General Meeting of March 21, 2018. Use of the authorizations In its meeting on December 19, 2019, the Board of Directors of Valmet decided to use the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting held on March 21, 2019 to acquire the Company's own shares. Based on the authorization, the Board decided to initiate a fixed -term share buy -back program for the purpose of acquiring the Company's own shares to meet part of the obligations arising from the LTI Plan and the Restricted Shares Po ol incentive plans. The share acquisitions began on February 10, 2020 and ended on February 2 4, 2020. The total number of acquired shares was 270,000. The shares were acquired at market price in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. In its meeting on Dece mber 19, 2019, Valmet's Board of Directors also decided to use the authorization to issue shares . In a directed share issue on March 16, 2020 , a total of 152,122 Valmet's treasury shares were conveyed without consideration to the participants of the long -term share -based incentive plan for the discretionary period 2019, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan. As at March 31, 20 20, Valmet's Board of Directors had not used the other authorizations given by the Annual General meeting on March 21, 2019. Valmet's Interim Review, January -March 2020| 17 Share -based incentive plans Valmet's share -based incentive plans are part of the remuneration program for Valmet's key personnel. The purpose of the plans is to align the goals of shareholders and management to increase the value of the Company, to ensure management commitment, and to offer them a competitive, ownership -based reward scheme. Any shares to be potentially awarded are, or have been, acquired through public trading, and therefore the incentive plans have no diluting effect on the share value. Long -term incentive plan 2018 -2020 In December 2017, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj approved a long -term share -based incentive plan for Valmet's key employees. The plan includes three performance periods, which are the calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Valmet's Board of Directors decided on the performance criteria and targets in the beginning of each discretionary period. The LTI Plan is directed to approximately 130 p articipants (including Executive Team members, key employees and management talents). The Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj approved in December 2017 a share ownership recommendation for Valmet's Executive Team members. All members of the Executive Team are recommended to own and hold an amount of Company shares equaling to their gross annual base salary (100 percent ownership recommendation). In the end of the reporting period, the Company held 365,593 treasury shares related to the share -based incentive programs. More information about share -based incentive plans can be found in Valmet's Remuneration Report , which is available at www.valmet.com/governance . Resolutions of Valmet's Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting 2019 was he ld in Helsinki on March 21, 2019 . The Annual General Meeting adopted t he Financial Statements for 2018 and discharged the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the 2018 financial year.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, authorized public accountants, was appointed as the Company's auditor for a term expiring at the end of the next Annual General Meeting. Valmet published a stock ex change release on March 21, 2019 concerning the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting and the organizing meeting of the Board of Directors. The stock exchange release and an introduction of the new Chairman can be viewed on Valmet's website at www.valmet.com/agm . In compliance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, on April 4, 2019 Valmet paid out dividends of EUR 97 million for 2018, corresponding to EUR 0.65 per share. Annual General Meeting 2020 cancelled and postponed to a later date On March 17,2020, following the development of the coronavirus situation and the announcement by the Finnish Government on March 16, 2020, the Board of Directors of Valmet decided to cancel the Annual General Meeting from March 19, 2020. Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunit ies and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, f inancial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long - and short -term goals. The t ask of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overa ll risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening finan cial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable bu siness (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long -term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10 -30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Valmet's Interim Review, January -March 2020| 19 Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effect s, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices o f raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity price s and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment pr ograms, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project -specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, proje ct risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution ph ase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be ch anges in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost -effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer servi ce and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non -current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 3.7 years. Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increa se in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well -positioned to keep capital expenditure at the level of total depreciation. Valmet's Interim Review, January -March 2020| 20 Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Excha nge rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency ex posures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at March 31, 2020, Valmet had EUR 687 million (EUR 618 million) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that a risk of impairment exists. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. COVID -19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID -19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be prolonged, there could be adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing f or both Valmet and its customers. Valmet currently has a large order backlog , strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with a flexible organization. This will aid Valmet in mitigat ing the global challenges caused by COVID -19. Events after the reporting period On April 16, 2020, Valmet announced that it withdraws the guidance fo r 2020 due to increased uncertainty caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. The impacts of the pandemic on Valmet's operations and business environment depend on the duration and severity of the crisis. On April 21, 2020, Valmet announced that due to financial an d production related reasons, especially because of the decreasing workload and in order to prepare for the potential widening of the business impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic, the company started co -determination negotiations on April 21, 2020 for tempo rary lay -offs. The employees under negotiations are the Services business line employees in Finland and EMEA area organization in Finland. The planned lay -offs are temporary and they last up to 90 days at maximum. At the time of the announcement, it was es timated that the need for lay -offs concerns around 200 employees. The targeting of the lay -offs and the number of impacted employees will be finalized during the co -determination negotiations. On April 23, 2020, Valmet published notice convening the Annual General Meeting. The meeting will take place on June 16, 2020 in Helsinki . The notice and related materials and instructions can be found on Valmet's website at www.valmet .com/agm . Guidance for 2020 Valmet announced on April 16, 2020 that the company withdraws its guidance for 2020 due to increased uncertainty related to the COVID -19 pandemic . Valmet's Interim Review, January -March 2020| 21 Short -term outlook General economic outlook As a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by 3 percent in 2020, much worse than during the 2008 -09 financial crisis. In a baseline scenario , which assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 an d containment efforts can be gradually unwoun d, the global economy is projected to grow by 5.8 percent in 2021 as economic activity normalizes, helped by policy support. The risks for even more severe outcomes, however, are substantial. (International Mone tary Fund, April 14, 2020) Short -term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short -term market outlook in services has decreased to a satisfactory /weak level (previously good level) and the short -term market outlook in automation has decreased to a good/satisfactory level (previously good level) . Valmet reiterates the good short -term market outlook for pulp, and board and paper, and the satisfactory short -term market outlook for energy, and tissue. Board of Director's proposal for the distribution of profit Valmet Oyj's distributable funds on December 31, 2019 totaled EUR 1,165,761,301.98 of which the net profit for 2019 was EUR 196,078,447.45 (according to Finnish Generally Accepted Accounting Standards). The Board of Directors proposes that a divide nd of EUR 0.80 per share be paid based on the statement of financial position to be adopted for the financial year which ended December 31, 2019, and that the remaining part of the profit be retained and carried further in the Company's unrestricted equity .

Key exchange rates Average rates Period -end rates Q1/2020 Interim Review , January -March 2020| 29 Reporting segment and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment wit h the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. One key indicator of performance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA e xcluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial info rmation to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as r estructuring costs and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non -current assets , income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and gains or losses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g. penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to close d law suits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g. customs or other tariffs imposed by aut horities on Valmet's products).

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long -term capital projects , for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost -to-cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short -term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long -term contracts and short -term service contracts. The nature of l ong-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short -term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified bef ore entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non - payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re -evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non -collect ability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not ye t invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customer in long -term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts.
