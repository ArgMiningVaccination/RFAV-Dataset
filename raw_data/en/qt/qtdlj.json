For centuries people around the world have understood and loved essential oils and utilized their amazing health and healing properties for many different purposes. Most, however, have never directly asked the body for specifics related to the why, when, how and where of energetically resonating oil use. Kelley has used oils in her personal life and practice for over 15 years and has found broad use of essential oils to be extremely beneficial with her clients. However, her love for Chinese Medicine and understanding of the meridian and chakra systems, as well as her extensive years practicing varying applied kinesiology type systems, led her to create this system of assessing an individual's BioEnergetic resonance with specific essential oils and their specific uses, combinations, and application for each unique individual assessed. A BioEnergetic Aromatherapy consultation is done with the client dressed comfortably and resting on a massage table or can even be done sitting in a chair. Through the simple use of muscle response testing (MRT) a practitioner of this system can flow through a series of very specifically designed and organized questions with their client in order to quickly yet deeply understand where an essential oil or oils could best serve a breakthrough within an emotional, spiritual or physical block. Application is then intricately detailed instead of a generalized aromatherapy use and the times per day and duration of use per custom oil blend is also specifically assessed. If you love the healing properties, aroma and broad base use of essential oils, or just have a general use relationship with oils, please go many steps further into the medicinal and therapeutic use of natures great gift by experiencing a BIOENERGETIC aromatherapy consultation. It is amazing to see how specific your body can be with regards to this system and the results are \"essentially\" profound.
