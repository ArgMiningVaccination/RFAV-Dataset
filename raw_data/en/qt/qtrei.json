Background: The Economic Development Strategy, adopted by Council in August 2000, established priority actions related to economic cluster development and the need to foster innovation. The Strategyhighlighted a little known fact that the Bio-Medical economic cluster in Toronto is the largest inNorth America and a key contributor to recent economic growth. This report proposes a numberof actions intended to implement the Economic Development Strategy's recommendationsrelated to supporting the growth of the cluster and a culture of innovation that will lead to thefurther commercialization of medical and biotechnology research resulting in new businessesand high quality jobs. In June 2000, Council endorsed the establishment of the Toronto Biotechnology Commercialization Centre and the efforts of the Board of Directors to implement the project.Staff was also requested to assess the feasibility of providing City funding. This report outlinessome of the options being examined with respect to supporting the creation of the Centre. Comments: Bio-Medical Cluster Overview:Health care is the fastest growing economic sector in the world. The international market for pharmaceuticals and medical devices reached approximately $500 billion in the year 2000. Themedical industry in the Toronto area is also huge, providing annual revenues in excess of$4 billion and jobs for more than 80,000 people. Add in health care delivery and the medicalsector provides more than 140,000 jobs. The Bio-Medical cluster in Toronto is composed of a number of industry segments; medical devices and new technologies, pharmaceutical products and medical biotechnology, as well asprivate health care services including diagnostic laboratories, consulting, information systemsand hospital medical/surgical supplies. The main research oriented segment of this cluster is thebiotechnology sector described below:Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 23 Biotechnology: During the 1990's the number of biotechnology companies in the City of Toronto and surrounding region multiplied dramatically, thanks to new sources of investment capital,entrepreneurial drive from academia, support from Toronto's diversified business communityand the municipal governments. More than anything else, this growth and development hasoccurred because the Bio-Medical research community in Toronto, and our research scientists,truly are world class. The biotechnology sector in Toronto has been in existence for only 15 to 20 years, with dramatic growth having been demonstrated over the last five years as the sector has begun to mature.Toronto is Canada's leading region in industrial biotechnology with the largest cluster ofcompanies, now in excess of 100 and representing approximately 40 percent of the industry. Ofthe 100+ companies in the Toronto area, more than 25 percent are listed on public stockexchanges, providing an indication of their pending maturity as business entities. It should alsobe acknowledged that Canada is the second largest biotechnology nation, world-wide, in terms ofnumber of companies and revenues generated from this technology. After years of research, a number of Toronto companies will soon be ready to move into full scale commercial production, generating significant revenues and creating a large number ofpermanent high paying career jobs. The biotechnology sector of the Bio-Medical cluster in the Toronto area ranks in the top seven in North America and in the top 10 in the world. Growth is of the order of 10 to 15 percentannually. The table, shown below, will provide a snapshot of the biotech industry's revenue andemployment situation at this time: Table 1: Biotechnology Revenues and Employment Global Market Revenues $10 to 12 Billion Canadian Market Revenues $1.9 Billion Ontario Revenues $700 Million Employment - Canada 12,000 jobs Employment - Toronto Area 6,000 jobs Biomedical research in Toronto is predominantly in the application of human health care and diagnostics, however the community is large and diverse. Our researchers have made greatadvances in such new areas as Proteomics, Genomics and Bio-Informatics. Within the Toronto area are companies representing both the brand name/research oriented companies and the generic drug manufacturers. Together they make a huge contribution to thehealth and wealth of the area and make Toronto a major international centre for pharmaceuticalresearch and development. More than half of Canada's brand name industry is located in theToronto area, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Astra Pharmaceuticals and Ortho Pharma to name buta few. Eighty percent of Canada's expanding generic drug businesses also call Toronto home,including Apotex and Novopharm.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 24 The last eight years has seen R&D spending increase by more than 200 percent injecting more than $1.5 billion into the Ontario economy. In 1999, alone, Ontario received $382 million inresearch funding from the brand name pharma companies, representing 45 percent of the totalspent in Canada. The vast majority of the research is taking place in the Toronto Area. Theexistence of major pharmaceutical companies in Toronto is critical to the successful developmentof the Bio-Medical cluster. Strategic Priorities for Bio-Medical Cluster:In order for Toronto and in fact Canada to continue to play a significant role in the global market place in one of the world's fastest growing sectors a concentrated and focused effort by all levelsof government, institutions, and private sector must be undertaken. The City of Toronto has anopportunity to be a key player and a major beneficiary in putting Canada on the radar screen as'the' most innovative and leading edge Bio-Medical community in the world. There are four areas that need support within a co-ordinated action plan:(1) Branding/Marketing Opportunities: Raising awareness of the concentration of the Bio-Medical cluster within the City; (2) Commercialization of Research Biotechnology Incubator: Supporting entrepreneurship;(3) Support Research and Invest in Innovation in Toronto: Attract and grow Research Institutions and businesses; and (4) Bio-Medical - Team Toronto: Establish a Team Toronto to advocate, action and implement. (1) Increase Awareness of Concentration of Bio-Medical Cluster Toronto is a major world class centre for health care research. World-renowned senior scientists are found at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine, and at researchinstitutes at Mount Sinai Hospital (The Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute), TheHospital for Sick Children, The Ontario Cancer Institute (Princess Margaret Hospital),Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, St. Michael's Hospital, Women's College Hospital,The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and at other hospitals and health institutionsin the area. Altogether more than 7,000 people are employed directly by the medicalresearch community in Toronto as researchers, technicians and support staff. The University of Toronto anchors the R&D infrastructure with the largest medical faculty in North America and national centres of excellence in neurobiology,cardiovascular disease and biomaterials. A highly developed research structureencompasses five health science centres working closely with specialized institutes,centres and groups closely affiliated with the university. Together they pursue adiversified range of research in cancer, immunology, cardiology, bone diseases anddiabetes.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 25 The hospitals and University are highly concentrated and form what can truly be called a medical Discovery District. The area roughly bound by Bloor, Bay, Dundas West andSpadina has been the location for numerous research breakthroughs and medical \"firsts\".Toronto has a history of pioneering achievements including the discovery of insulin, thedevelopment of the original heart pacemaker, the world's first single lung transplant in1981 the development of anti-rabies vaccines and Pablum, the world's first baby food.Attachment No. 1 provides a glimpse into some of the spectacular medical discoveriesthat Toronto's principal medical researchers have achieved during the last 50 years. The medical research community in Toronto spends more than $400 million dollars in medical research activities annually. Many of the institutions have now indicated theneed to physically expand to accommodate additional research capacity. Branding the Discovery District may be one marketing initiative to increase the profile of research and innovation that is occurring in the City. Toronto is home to some of themost creative and advanced research and development communities in the world. Someof the most outstanding scientists are right here working on new techniques andinnovative technologies. Identified below, are two suggestions whereby recognitioncould be given to the ground-breaking discoveries that have taken place in our centres ofresearch. It would be appropriate to identify the downtown area bounded by Bloor Street and Dundas Street and from Bay Street and Spadina Avenue as the \"Discovery District\".This could involve placing specialized street signs or banners at appropriate intersectionsidentifying the area as such. Also, there may be an opportunity to establish a \"walk offame\" on University Avenue, by placing medallions in the sidewalk that will identify andprofile Toronto's scientists who have made significant contributions to scientific researchand the pursuit of knowledge, thereby bringing much increase to Toronto's competitiveposition. It is recommended that City staff review with the University of Toronto, themajor hospitals, research institutions and property owners within the \"DiscoveryDistrict\", and with Bio-Medical companies who invest in and benefit from medicalresearch programs, the development of joint marketing opportunities, including thepossibility of establishing a medical discovery \"walk of fame\". (2) Commercialization of Research through supporting Biotech Incubator In spite of Toronto's advantageous standing in the biotechnology industry, both nationally and world-wide, it is currently one of the last major urban centres without aninnovation centre devoted to this sector. Without such a facility, Toronto - poised to leadthe wave of biotechnology - could miss the biotechnology revolution and the associatedeconomic boom. Canada's biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have recently experienced unprecedented growth. Toronto has the opportunity to sustain global competitiveness inbiotechnology innovation by establishing a cluster of biotech companies which will drawtheir creative strength from the nation's largest, and most successful, centre of academicand hospital based Bio-Medical research.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 26 Though no formal biotechnology business incubation facilities have been available for these fledgling companies, incubation space has been provided by academic institutionssuch as the University of Toronto, York University and the teaching hospitals andresearch centres located on University Avenue. Most recently, however, researchprograms at these centres have also dramatically increased to the extent that they are nolonger able to provide this critical support to companies that are being formed aroundtheir emerging scientific discoveries. This pressure is causing one of two situations tooccur; either the entrepreneurial scientists are not forming the spin-off companies todevelop the commercial opportunity of their science or the companies are being pushed\"out of the nest\" prematurely thus increasing the risk of business failure. The Toronto Biotechnology Commercialization Centre (TBCC) is a non-profit corporation formed by a consortium of all of the life sciences funded institutions,including the University of Toronto, seven of Toronto's leading teaching hospitals, theCity of Toronto and the HRDC ministry of the Government of Canada. These researchinstitutions spend over $400 million on R&D each year and comprise the fourth largestmedical research community in North America. Their objective is to establish a 100,000square foot incubator facility for up to 70 start-up biotechnology companies in Toronto.In addition to supporting 70 companies by providing wet laboratory research space andgeneral office facilities, additional space would be made available to eight to 10 supportservice providers, including law firms, consultancies, marketing firms and venture capitalcompanies who need to maintain a storefront at the commercialization centre. This incubator would make Toronto the place to be in biotechnology for the foreseeable future. It will create thousands of new jobs, turning the \"brain drain\" into a \"brain gain\".With the establishment of the commercialization centre, the City will increase the numberof spin-off companies emerging from its universities, hospitals and research institutes andsignificantly enhance the probability of their success. Conversely without thecommercialization centre, Toronto would be hard-pressed to keep up with the advancingwave of thriving biotech development. On June 19, 2000, the TBCC received a $9 million commitment, in matching funds, by the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technology of the Government of Ontario, to beused towards the creation of this business incubator. The cities of London and Ottawaalso received commitments totalling $10 million towards the creation of biotechcommercialization centres in their communities. Access to these funds is assured forLondon and Ottawa as matching amounts have been committed by their municipalgovernments. Until similar matching funds are found by the initiative in Toronto accessto the $9 million commitment is not possible, and could be lost. Because of the City's present budget difficulties it has not yet been possible to secure matching funds. Staff is now exploring alternatives with respect to providing therequired matching contribution. One option could be offered under Section 28 of the\"Community Improvement Section\" of the Planning Act which would allow the City of Toronto to provide tax equivalent grants to the commercialization centre. Under thislegislation the City would adopt a community improvement plan that includes support forthe centre as a stated policy. This would allow the City to forego a portion of theToronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 27 municipal taxes that it would collect on the property. This would make centre's business plan more financially viable by reducing its costs related to the property taxes and allowthe TBCC a means to access the $9 million commitment in matching funds from theMinistry of Energy, Science and Technology. Staff is also exploring the use of the Share Capital Corporations provisions of the Municipal Act whereby the City can provide facilities and services to assist for-profit small business start-ups at lower than market value rents. Other municipalities in Ontarioare using these provisions to provide direct, or in-kind, support to their incubatorfacilities. It is recommended that City staff review alternative financing opportunitieswhereby financial support could be provided towards the establishment of aninnovation/commercialization centre in Toronto using such mechanisms as those notedabove. (3) Support Research and Invest in Innovation in Toronto: Attract and Grow Research Institutions and Businesses There is a constant need for innovation in the Bio-Medical field. Industry Canada, in their report, \"Pathways to Growth: Opportunities in Biotechnology\", advised that mostcountries have targeted biotechnology as vital for the 21st century and are pouringenormous resources into research, development and financing infrastructure. To ensureCanada's future success, government at all levels must work with industry to support thegrowth of this dynamic, highly productive sector, which has the potential to provide thewages, employment and other spillovers into the overall economy. The Government of Ontario's Ministry of Energy Science and Technology confirms that Canada's health science sector, particularly biotechnology, is in the same position todayas the telecommunications sector was 10 to 15 years ago - poised to take off to a degreethat is hard to imagine. It is increasingly apparent, that technological advancement is emerging at the heart of economic progress. For Toronto to compete, and win, in this new economy we need toensure and facilitate the transition by fostering technological innovation. StatisticsCanada notes that of all industries, high tech or otherwise, the biotechnology sectorgenerates the highest number of spin off companies and secondary jobs. Toronto's history of pioneering achievements includes the discovery of insulin and the development of the original heart pacemaker, from anti-rabies vaccines to Pablum, theworld's first baby food. Toronto's scientists have indeed made their mark. Today, thelist of breakthroughs include the isolation of the T-Cell and dopomine receptors, theRyanodine Myotonic Dystrophy, FanconiAnaemia, Alzheimer's Disease, Breast Cancer and most recently Prostate Cancer. Thisrecord of scientific achievement drives the medical industry in Toronto to the veryforefront of technical innovation and discovery.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 28 Another key strategy will be to continue to pursue key medical research institutions and the attraction of researchers to Toronto. Project MARS (Medical and Related Sciences)and Genome Ontario are two initiatives that increase the City's research capabilities. (a) Project MARS (Medical and Related Sciences)A group of leaders in the Bio field have developed a vision called Project MARS. This will establish, adjacent to the University of Toronto, a large complex of researchinstitutes and business facilities, banks, venture capital companies and other specialservices required by research intensive businesses. Their goal is to see the College andUniversity area as the largest complex in Canada and in North America. The complexwould include a wide range of special services for knowledge based companies and evenaffordable housing for young researchers. MARS will be the fusion point for invention, investment, development and marketing of medical discoveries. It will bring together the ideas, the organizations and the finances togenerate a multi-disciplinary medical \"knowledge factory\". The short range plans (threeto five years) for MARS call for more than 2 million square feet of additional researchfacilities in Toronto and five to seven million square feet in seven to ten years. Though they do not have a formal relationship with the MARS project at this time, the TBCC do support the MARS vision. The biotechnology commercialization centre is alogical first building block for the concept of a high technology complex of this type.The Economic Development Division will be contacting the MARS leaders as focal pointto facilitate the Bio-Medical Cluster action plan. (b) Genome OntarioOntario's scientists have contributed strongly to establishing Canadian involvement and leadership in genomic science over the last two decades. Toronto's scientists have hadmajor success in cloning disease genes and establishing world class protein structuralgroups. Following the establishment and re-funding of Genome Canada in early 2000, a group of researchers in Ontario formed Genome Ontario to promote the establishment and fundingof a genome centre in Ontario. Applications for grants in the order of $200 million weremade in January 2001. Toronto based researchers have already received $37 Millionfrom this funding source. Ensuring this centre is located in Toronto's Discovery Districtis of major importance. (4) Bio-Medical - Team Toronto: Establish a Team Toronto to advocate, action and implement a cluster action plan. In addition to the City, there are a number of key stakeholders that support the advancement of the Bio-Medical cluster. They include the University of Toronto, themajor hospitals, research institutions, property owners within the \"Discovery District\",Bio-Medical companies and the senior levels of government.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 29 In order to strategically align the intentions and activities of these players it is proposed that the City convene a round table focus group to develop an action plan to advanceToronto's competitive position as a biotechnology leader in North America. An actionplan would further refine the issues noted above, develop and implement strategies toresolve problematic issues and capitalize on research and growth opportunities. Ideally,an action plan would also develop a communications campaign to increase awarenessabout the Bio-Medical cluster and advocate for its support from senior levels ofgovernment. Conclusions: The Bio-Medical economic cluster in Toronto is the largest in North America and a key contributor to the City's recent economic growth. Toronto has the largest cluster of companiesin Canada representing approximately 40 percent of the nation's industry. In order for Torontoto maintain its leadership position and to continue to play a significant role in the global marketplace, a concentrated and focused effort by all levels of government, institutions, and privatesector must be undertaken. To secure the City's place as one of the most innovative and leading edge Bio-Medical communities in the world there is a need for the stakeholders to develop an action plan toadvance Toronto's competitive position. It is proposed that the City convene a round table focusgroup with the University of Toronto, the major hospitals, research institutions, Bio-Medicalcompanies and property owners to create and implement strategies that raise the awareness of theimportance of the Bio-Medical cluster through branding and marketing, support the furthercommercialization of biotechnology research including the creation of a biotech incubator,support new research, investment and innovation activities in Toronto, attract and grow researchinstitutions and businesses and that establish a Team Toronto to advocate for and implementinitiatives benefiting both the cluster and the City.

Philip Seeman, Hyman Niznik and Hubert Van Tol are the recipients of the 1994 Prix Galien for Research in recognition for their illumination of the receptor basis fortherapy of schizophrenia and of Parkinson's disease and their discoveries and cloning offour dopamine receptors. 1995 Dr. Peter St. George-Hyslop in collaboration with Dr. Joanna Rommens and international colleagues identified and cloned the mutations on the gene that causes early onsetAlzheimer's disease. This is a rare but extremely aggressive form of Alzheimer'sdisease, which affects individuals aged 30 to 60. 1995 Dr. Peter St. George-Hyslop and his colleagues identified a second gene responsible for early onset Alzheimer's Disease within two months of the first discovery. The secondgene, located on chromosome one is associated with a less severe form of familialAlzheimer's. 1996 Dr. Bibudhendra Sarkar developed an effective treatment of Menkes disease which is a genetic neurological disorder that kills children with the disorder before the age of three.The disease is caused by a defect in the transport of copper, which is required for theactivity of many life-sustaining enzymes. The effectiveness of this treatment has beenproven in two Canadian patients who are still living at age 20 and 10. 1996 Dr. Jeff Wrana and Dr. Liliana Attisano identified a gene, which can lead to colon cancer.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 212 1996 Dr. Don Low lead a network of laboratories in Ontario to study the severe invasive group A streptococcal disease (flesh-eating disease). This study has made it possible to identifythose that are at the greatest risk of developing the disease, thus enabling thedevelopment and implementation of control and prevention of this disease. 1996 Dr. Brenda Gallie and co-workers developed a new therapy for retinoblastoma, a cancer of the eye that leads to blindness. The new therapy has revolutionized the saving of eyesand prevention of blindness. It represents the first major change in the management ofthis disease in 35 years. 1996 Dr. James Rini using x-ray crystallography solved a crucial part of the structure of a cell membrane protein called e-cadherin. This protein suppresses cancer cell invasion, andtumours, which have lost the function of this protein through mutations of this part of thestructure, are much more diffuse and metastatic. 1996 Dr. Robert Salter discovered an effective method of regenerating joint cartilage in a severely damaged knee joint in patients. Joint cartilage normally has little ability toregenerate. This new method will greatly enhance the recovery and repair of damagejoint cartilage. 1996 Dr. Michael Moran and colleagues discovered that a protein called GRB2 found inside a cell functions as a kind of On-Off switch responsible for turning on or off the signallingfor cell growth and division elicited by growth factors. This discovery lays thegroundwork for the development of drugs targeting this protein to prevent cancer cellsfrom responding to growth factors to grow and divide. 1996 Dr. Dan Drucker and his co-workers discovered that the peptide hormone called GLP-2 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 2), normally found in the body, can powerfully stimulate thegrowth of the lining of the small intestine which is vital to digesting food. This discoverymay well result in major benefits for patients with severely compromised intestinalfunction, allowing treatment that will grow new cells in the lining of the small intestine. 1996 Dr. Shoukat Dedhar and his colleagues have discovered ILK, a protein kinase, which has revealed new ways in which cell adhesion via integrins can signal. It has alsodemonstrated for the first time that an integrin associated protein can behave as anoncogene when overexpressed or when expressed inappropriately. ILK is overexpressedin the human breast and prostate carcinomas. 1997 Dr. Tirone David and colleagues culminated fifteen years of research, that studied ways to improve the hemodynamic performance and durability of porcine aortic valves, withthe approval of the Federal Drug Administration. The valve had previously beenapproved in Canada and most of Europe. The research process, from animal modelthrough clinical trials to patient care, provides a stentless porcine prosthesis, which is farsuperior to the previous treatment.Toronto City Council Economic Development and Parks Committee May 30, 31 and June 1, 2001 Report No. 5, Clause No. 213 1997 Dr. Ren-Ke Li, a staff scientist with the division of Cardiac Surgery, demonstrated that cell transplantation can improve cardiac function. He demonstrated that transplantedcardiomyocytes survive in myocardial scar tissue and form a cardiac tissue, which limitsscar expansion and improves heart function. In addition cardiomyocytes and vascularendothelial cells stimulate angiogenesis in damaged myocardium. These data suggestthat cell therapy could be a means to repair broken hearts or to treat ischemic heartdiseases. 1997 Dr. Christopher Feindel developed a new technique for preserving hearts for transplantation by using the shed blood from a donor to provide nutrient blood flow to theheart prior to being transplanted into the recipient. The recycling of donor blood canincrease the safe preservation of the heart from four to eight hours in a pig transplantmodel. Clinical trials are underway. _________ Councillor Brian Ashton, Ward 36 Scarborough Southwest, appeared before the Economic Development and Parks Committee in connection with the foregoing matter. "}
