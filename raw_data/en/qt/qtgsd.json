B. Covered Dependents. You are eligible to enroll as a Covered Dependent if: (1) the Subscriber is an Active Employee with the Employer and has enrolled or is enrolling as the Subscriber; and (2) you are legally married to the Subscriber; or (3) you are the Subscriber's child (including a stepchild, legally adopted child, natural child or Child Placed for Adoption) , or have the Subscriber or the Subscriber's spous e as your court-appointed permanent or limited guardian.

NOTE : See Section 2.C for Coverage information for Covered Dependent Children who reside outside of the Service Area. Qualified Medical Child Supp ort Order or \"QMCSO\" The Subscriber's child is eligible to enroll in this plan outside of the Open Enrollment Period if you provide us with a copy of a court or administrative order which requires you to provi de health coverage for the child in accord ance with state and federal law (a \"Quali fied Medical Child Suppor t Order\" or \"QMCSO\"). The QMCSO must name the Subscriber as the participant in order to enroll the child. The child must be otherwise eligible for Coverage as a Covered Dependent. If we receive a copy of the QMCSO but you fail to enroll the child for Coverage, the child may be enrolled by the Friend of the Court or by the Child's other parent or guardian through the Friend of the Court. We will not terminate the Coverage of a child who is enrolled under a QMCSO unless: (a) the child is no longer eligible as a Covered Dependent, (b) Premiums have not been paid as required by the Agreement; or (c) we receive satisfactory written proof that the QMCSO is no longer in effect or that the child has or will have comparable health coverage beginning on or before the date the child's Coverage with us is terminated.

Court-Appo inted Guardianship Special rules apply to a child for whom the Subscriber or the Subscriber's spous e is the court-appoin ted permanent or limited guardian. The child may be enrolled from the moment he or she is in your physical custody. We will not Cover any expenses incurred for the child's care before he or she is in your physical custody. \"Physical custody\" means that the child is legally and physically placed in your home. If we ask for proof that the child meets the above requirements, you must give us acceptable proof , such as a court order, within 31 days. The child is eligible for Coverage until the end of the day on which he or she turns 18 years of age. C. Out-of-Area Residents. If you meet all eligibility requirements described above but you reside outside of the Service Area, you may enroll in this plan. If you reside outside of the United States, you may only enroll in this plan if: (1) You are the Subscriber and you work in the Service Area; or (2) You are a Covered Dependent and you live with the Subscriber who resides outside of the United States.

You must do this even if the additio n or change does not require you to pay a highe r Premium. If you submit the Enrollment or Change Form within 31 days, Coverage will be effective on the date of the marriage, birth, adoptio n or placement for adoption. To enroll with us, you and your dependent(s) must meet the eligibility requirements of your Employe r and Priority Health. This plan Covers a Subscriber's Newbor n child, including necessary care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects and birth abnormalities, for the first 31 days from birth even if you do not submit a Change Form. If you want the Newbor n's Coverage to continue beyond the first 31-day period, fill out and return a Change Form to us within 31 days after the child is born. (2) Loss of Other Coverage.

Obtaini ng Covered Services A. Primary Care Provider (PCP) . Your PCP Your PCP provides your primary health care, orders lab tests and x-rays, prescribes medicines or therapies and arranges hospita lization when necessa ry. Your PCP may be a family practitioner, a general practitioner, an internal medicine specialist, a pediatrician, an obstetrician/gynecologist, a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant. You may choose to seek services from a Participating Provider without referral from your PCP at any time. For example, a woman can see a participating obstetrician/gynecologist without referral from her PCP. However, we recom mend you talk with your PCP about any issues concern ing your medical care, and contact him or her before you receive medical services, except in a Medical Emergency. Work ing with your PCP improve s the coordi nation and continui ty of care you receive. When necessary, your PCP will work with other Participating Providers and Specialist Providers to ensure you receive the care you need. We recommend you receive a physical examination from your PCP within one year of joining Priority Health. Choos ing a PCP When you enroll, select a PCP and let us know who you have chosen by listing it on your Enrollment Form, by calling our Customer Service Department at 800 446-5674 or 616 942-1221 or by visiting the Member Center on our website priorityhealth.com. You can also call Customer Service or visit the Member Center to request a list of Participating Providers from whom you can choose or to ask for help in selecting a PCP. Each member of your family enrolled in this plan may elect a different PCP. If you do not select a PCP, we will assign one to you. Chang ing a PCP You can change your PCP at any time, including one assigned to you, except while you are in the Hospital. You may also change the PCP of a minor or Covered Dependent who is incapable of choosing a PCP. To make a change, fill out and return a Change Form to us, contact our Customer Service Department by phone or go to the Member Center on our website. All changes are effective on the first day of the month after we receive your request unless you are changing a child's pediatrician. Pediatrician changes are effective immediately. B. Referral Care. Referral care is care provi ded by a Health Professional or Physician other than your PCP. This care may be provided by both Participating and Non-Participating Providers, including Specialists. Participating Providers are those listed in our Provider Directory. The Provider Directory is available on our website as part of the Find a Doctor tool or by calling our Customer Service Department. HMO Certificate of Coverage 8 Participating Providers You do not need approva l from your PCP or Priority Health to see a Participating Provider. Your PCP may refer you to another Participating Provider when it would be more appropr iate for you to receive care from a different type of Health Professional or Specialist. Certain services provi ded by your PCP or upon referral to another Provider do require Prior Approval from Priority Health. See Section 5.D for more information on the Prior Approval process and requirements. Non-Participating Provider All Covered Services you receive from Non- Participating Providers must be Prior Appr oved by us. If the standard of care (medically appropr iate treatment) for your conditio n is not available from a Participating Provider, your PCP may ask Priority Health for approval to refer you to a Non- Participating Provider. If you do not receive approva l from Priority Health prior to seeking Covered Services from a Non- Participating Provider, or if we determine the medically appropr iate treatment for your conditio n is available from a Participating Provider, you will be respons ible for payment. A referral from your PCP or another Participating Provider is not enough if you want the services to be Covered. If Priority Health approv es the referral, we will notify your PCP or the Participating Provider who makes the request. A Second Medical Opinion It is often approp riate to ask for a second medical opinion before receiving certain treatments for health conditions and before many proposed surgeries. You may request a second medical opinion from a Participating Specialist Provider who has skills and training substantially similar to those of the Physician making the original treatment recommendation without Prior Approval. If there are no Participating Providers with the skills and training needed to provi de a second opinion on the proposed treatment, we may Cover a second medical opinion from a Non- Participating Specialist Provider. Prior Approval from Priority Health is required before the second opinion is obtain ed. Any tests, procedur es, treatments or surgeries recommended by the consulting Provider must be perform ed by a Participating Provider unless we approve the services in advance. Occasionally, Priority Health may require that you get a second opinion from a Specialist Provider that we have chosen. This second medical opinion is used to assist us in determining whether services or supplies are Medically/Clinically Necessary accord ing to our medical and behavioral health policies or adopted criteria. C. Your Treatment Options. We require your PCP and other Participating Providers to discuss all treatment options available to you whether the treatment or services are Covered or not Covered . Providers are not expected to know when services have limitations or are excluded from Coverage. Your Certificate of Coverage provi des you with this information. Our Customer Service Department can help you with any questions. Your PCP or other Health Professionals may recommend and you may choose treatment options even if they are not Covered or are limited by this Certificate. You are required to pay for any services you receive that are not Covered or that exceed your maximum benefit. D. Prior Approval Require ments. Some services and supplie s require Prior Approva l by Priority Health in order to be Covered under this plan. The complete and detailed list of these services is available by calling our Customer Service Department or on our website at priorityhealth.com. This list may change throughout the Contract Year as new technology and standards of care emerge. Below are the general categories of services and supplies that require Prior Appr oval by Priority Health: (1) All inpatient services. You do not need Prior Appr oval from your PCP or Priority Health to seek care in a Medical Emergency or when Urgent Care is needed. Additi onally, Inpatient Hospi tal stays for a mother and her Newborn of up to 48 hours following a vaginal delivery and 96 hours following a cesarean section do not require Prior Appr oval. Howe ver, we encourage you to notify us at least 60 days before your due date so we are better prepared to assist you at that time. (2) Outpatient services as outlined on our website.

In most cases, we will approve , partially approve , or deny a request for Prior Appr oval within 15 days of receipt. In some cases we may ask you for additional information or additiona l time in which to make our determination. Based on our approval or denial, you and your Provider can decide if you want to go forward with the propos ed services or obtain the supplies. Urgent Requests For urgent requests, we must respond within 72 hours . A request is considered urgent if delaying treatment would put your life in serious danger, interfere with your full recove ry or delay treatment for severe pain. For both urgent and non-urgent requests you may contact our Customer Service Department to find out our decision. You and the Provider recommending the services will receive a letter from us if the services will not be Covered. If you obtain services that we say are not Covered or services in excess of what we say is Covered, you are responsibl e for payment for those services. If you want our decision to be reviewed, you may contact us. Section 11 tells you how to do that. Reeval uation of Decision on Prior Appr oval At any time, your Physician may ask us to reevaluate a Prior Approval decision we have made. Retrospective Review It is important to get Prior Appr oval so you know ahead of time if the services or supplie s you seek will be Covered. If the required Prior Appr oval is not obtain ed, we may review the claim after you receive the services. If we determine that the care received was Medically/Clinically Necessary and provided by a Participating Provider, the care will be Covered. If we determine that the care received was Medically/Clinically Necessary and provided by a Non-Participating Provider, the care may only be Covered if the necess ary care is unavailable from a Participating Provider. If we determine that the care received was not Medically/Clinically Necess ary or the care was provided by a Non-Participating Provider when it could have been provided by a Participating Provider, the services will not be Covered.

HMO Certificate of Coverage 10 E. Termination of Provider's Participation. Participating Providers contract with us to provi de Covered Services to Members. Either the Participating Provider or Priority Health can terminate that contract at any time. We cannot guarantee that you will be able to receive services from a specific Participating Provider while you are Covered under this plan. We will notify you if your PCP is no longer a Participating Provider so you can select another PCP. If your Specialist Provider terminates his or her participation with Priority Health, you can contact your PCP for a recommendation of a new Specialist Provider to visit. Our Customer Service Department is also available to assist you in finding another Participating Provider and in receiving care during the transition to a new Provider. If you have any questions, please call our Customer Service Department. If you are being treated by a Participating Provider whos e contract with us is terminated, you may be allowed to continue seeing that Provider for a limited time. So long as the Provider is able to continue treating you, you can receiv e Covered Services if, at the time of the Provider's contract termination: (1) you are receiving on-going care. You may continue to see this Provider for up to 90 days or until Priority Health makes other arrangements for you to receive the same services from another Participating Provider. (2) you are undergoing treatment for a chroni c or disabling condition, or are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.

Non-Emer gent Care After Regular Office Hour s. If you become Ill or are Injured after regular office hours , call your PCP's office and tell them you are a Member of Priority Health. Your PCP or another Participating Provider acting on his or her behalf must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to help you determine the best place to go for care. G. Medical Emerg ency or Urgent Care. Medical Emergency care and Urgent Care services are Covered under this Certificate. You do not need Prior Approval from your PCP or Priority Health to seek care in a Medical Emergency or when Urgent Care is needed. Prior Appr oval is not required even when this care is provi ded by a Non-Participating Provider. (1) Urgent Care When you have an Illness or Injury that needs immediate attention, such as cuts or sprains, but it is not as serious as a Medical Emergency, call your PCP before you seek any services. Your PCP will help you determine the best place to go for care. If you are out of the Service Area at that time, your PCP will determine if you can wait for those services and supplie s until you could reason ably return to receive them from a Participating Provider. If you cannot reach your PCP's office and your Illness or Injury needs Urgent Care, go to an Urgent Care Center or Hosp ital emergency room. Present your ID Card and be prepared to pay the required Copayment or Deductible. Urgent Care services received from a Non-Participating Provider who is located in our Service Area are not Covered. Urgent Care services received from a Non-Participating Provider who is located outside of our Service Area are Covered. If you receive Urgent Care services from a Non-Participating Provider, contact your PCP's office as soon as possib le so your PCP can arrange follow- up treatment.

Any follow- up care that is provi ded by a Non-Participating Provider must be Prior Appr oved by Priority Health in order to be Covered.

Once your inpatient stay is no longer a Medical Emergency, Priority Health must approv e your continued inpatient stay at any Non-Participating Hosp ital in order for it to be Covered. Once your conditio n has stabilized, Priority Health may require you to be transferred to a Participating Facility to continue to be Covered.

If you lose your Coverage, we can collect from you all costs for Covered Services that you received after your Coverage terminated and we paid for, plus our cost of recovering those charges (including attorney's fees). B. Loss of Eligibility. If you no longer meet the eligibility requirements described in Section 2 of this Certificate or in Riders or amendments to this Certificate, your Coverage will terminate. If there is any conflict between the requirements described in this Certificate and the terms of the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement will govern eligibility. Your Coverage will terminate at 11:59 p.m. on the date you lose your eligibility. That date may be in the past. However, if you did not know that you were no longer eligible or your Employer did not tell you that you were no longer eligible, we will give you 30 days notice before your Coverage terminates so you have the opportunity to find other coverage. C. Termination For Caus e. (1) We can terminate your Coverage for cause 30 days after we notify you in writing if any of the follow ing happens: (a) Multiple Participating Providers ask you to leave their practices due to disruptive behavior. (b) You fail to pay your share of any required Premium. (c) You refuse to cooperate with us as required by the terms of this Certificate or the Agreement. (d) You revoke your consent for us to release information to third parties or to receive information regarding your medical care, if your revocation makes it impossible for us to fulfill our respons ibilities under this Certificate. (2) We can terminate your Coverage for cause immediately if either of the following happens: (a) You commit or attempt to commit fraud against us or you are dishone st with us about some important or material matter. For example, we may terminate your Coverage if: (i.) you give us wrong or misleading information that affects the Coverage we provi de to you and/or your Covered Dependents, (ii.) you allow someone else use your ID card or receive benefits in your place. (iii.) you enroll someone in this plan who is not eligible for Coverage. Termination may be effective the day you committed the fraud or were dishone st with us. We can collect from you the costs for Covered Services that you received after the effective date of termination and we paid for, plus our cost of recove ring those charges (including attorney's fees). We will only rescind your Coverage as permitted by federal law, which allows rescission for fraud or material misrepresentation. Rescission means terminating your Coverage retroactively to your original effective date with us, with the effect that your Coverage never existed; or HMO Certificate of Coverage 38 (b) You act so disruptively that you upset our ordinary operations or those of a Participating Provider, including but not limited to verbally or physically threatening us or a Participating Provider. If we tell you we have terminated or will terminate your Coverage, we will terminate your Coverage on the date stated in the notice . If you file a Grievance within 30 days of the date of the notice, we will reinstate your Coverage until a determination is made under Step 1 in the Grievance Procedur e. If the Grievance Committee determines that your Coverage shoul d be terminated for cause under this Section, we will again terminate your Coverage back to the date stated in the original termination notice. If you file an Appeal under Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure within 30 days of the date of the Grievance is determined, we will reinstate your Coverage until the Appeal Committee makes a final determination. If the Appeal Committee determines that your Coverage shoul d be terminated under this Section, we will again terminate your Coverage back to the date stated in the original termination notice. During both steps of the Grievance Procedur e, we will only reinstate your Coverage if your Premium is paid up to that time. Section 11 provides more information about the Grievance Procedur e. D. Certificate of Creditable Coverage. After your Coverage is terminated for any reason , you and/or your Covered Dependent(s) will receive a Certificate of Creditable Coverage that will provi de proof of the Coverage you had with us. In addition, you have the right to receive a Certificate of Creditable Coverage if you request one for yourself or your dependent(s) at any time within 24 months after the Coverage terminates. If you become covered by other health insurance, a Certificate of Creditable Coverage may help you to receive the new coverage without a pre-existing condition exclusion or with a shorter exclusion period.

Continuation, Conversion or E xtension of Benefits A. Cont inuation of Coverage for Unmarried and Incapacitated Dependents. We will continue to provi de Coverage for your or your spous e's unmarried and Incapacitated Dependent past the age of 26, unless we have issued the dependent Conversion Coverage. For information on the maximum age for dependent children, see Section 2.B(3)(a). A Covered Depende nt is incapacitated if all of the following apply: (1) The Covered Dependent is the child of you or your spous e; (2) The Covered Dependent is not capable of self-sustaining employment and is unable to independently socialize without assistance becaus e of a mental or physical Disability that is incapacitating. Certain diagnose s, including but not limited to attention deficit disorder or depression, by themselves, are not evidence of incapacity. Learning disabilities or the inability to \"hold a job\" alone is not evidence of incapacity. Examples of diagnoses that may constitute an incapacitating condition include Down Syndrome and traumatic brain Injury. (3) The incapacity must have started before age 26; and (4) The Covered Dependent relies on you for more than half of his or her support, as determined under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. You must provide proof to us that the Covered Dependent is incapacitated no more than 31 days after the Covered Dependent reaches the age of 26. If your Covered Dependent is over the age of 26 at the time of enrollment, proof must be provided within 31 days of initial enrollm ent. After the initial proof of incapacitation, you must give us proof when we ask for it, from time to time, but not more often than once each year. Coverage for an Incapacitated Dependent will end if any of the follow ing events occur: (a) The dependent is no longer a dependent of you or your spous e as described in subsection A(4) above; (b) The dependent's incapacity ends; (c) We do not receive proof that the dependent is incapacitated within 31 days of requesting such information; (d) The dependent no longer meets eligibility requirements for any reason other than reaching 26 years of age; or (e) The dependent is married after reaching 26 years of age. B. Extension of Coverage for Family and Medical Leave. If you are on a qualified leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as amended (the \"FMLA\"), you may continue Coverage for yourself and any Covered Dependents during that leave. The Coverage will be the same and at the same Premium as if you were an Active Employee. If you fail to return from FMLA leave for any reason other than the continuation, recurre nce, or onset of a serious health condition (as defined in the FMLA) or other circumstance, determined by your Employer to be beyond your control, your Employer may recove r from you the amount your Employe r paid to maintain Coverage for you during the leave. If you fail to pay your required Premium contribution for Coverage during your FMLA leave, your Coverage will be suspended, but you will have the right to the reinstatement of Coverage when you return to work from FMLA leave. If you do not return to work following FMLA leave, you are eligible for COBRA Coverage if you were Covered under the plan on the day before the FMLA leave began. COBRA Coverage would be effective on the earlier of the day the leave expires or the day you notify your Employer that you are not returning to work. You are eligible for COBRA Coverage following FMLA leave even if you were not Covered under this plan during your FMLA leave. C. Extension of Benefits if You Are Conf ined. If you are confined for medical treatment in a facility, other than your home, at the time the Agreement is terminated or you lose eligibility, we will continue to be respons ible for certain Covered Services. We will only Cover services that are necessa ry to treat the medical condition for which you are confined and which would otherwise be Covered under this Certificate. These services will only be Covered until it is no longer necessary for you to be confined. A move to an alternative care facility, such as a skilled nursing facility, hospic e facility or rehabilitation facility, is not considered a discharge from confinement under this provision. As soon as one of the following happens, you will stop receiving benefits under this subsection C: (1) The confinement is no longer Medically/Clinically Necessary; (2) You reach the maximum benefit limits for the Covered Services available for that confinement or condition; HMO Certificate of Coverage 4 (3) You become eligible for similar coverage from another health plan, whether individual , group or governmental; or (4) 12 months passes from the day your Coverage under the Agreement ended. If you are eligible for Coverage under this subsection C, your Coverage will be COBRA Coverage. If you are not eligible for COBRA, your Coverage will be Conversion Coverage. You must pay the required Premium to maintain your Coverage. As stated in Section 12.D, the 31 day period you have to elect Conversion Coverage begins on the date of termination. The election period will not be extended or delayed because you are Confined. D. Convers ion. Upon termination, you may have the right to obtain coverage under an individual health care plan (\"Conversion Coverage\"). (1) Eligibility for Conversion Coverag e. You only have a right to enroll in Conversion Coverage in the follow ing situations: (a) You are the Subscriber or Covered Dependent under the Agreement and your Coverage terminates becaus e the Subscriber's employme nt terminates or becaus e the Subscriber no longer meets the eligibility requirements for Coverage. (b) You are the Subscriber or Covered Dependent under the Agreement and your Coverage terminates becaus e the Agreement is terminated, unless the terminated Coverage is replaced with other group coverage. (c) You are a Covered Dependent, and although the Subscriber's Coverage under the Agreement continues, your Coverage terminates because you no longer meet the eligibility requirements to be a Covered Dependent. (d) You are a Covered Dependent and your Coverage under the Agreeme nt terminates becaus e of the Subscriber's death. In each circumstance, you have the right to obtain Conversion Coverage without giving us evidence of insurability, such as a Certificate of Creditable Coverage. Conversion Coverage contains no limitations based on health status and does not exclude coverage for a pre-existing condition, unless Coverage is excluded for that condition under the Conversion Coverage plan. If you want Conversion Coverage, you must send to us a completed PriorityHMOSM Conversion Coverage Application. We must receive your application within 31 days after the termination date of Coverage under the Agreement or the date you are notified of termination by your Employer or us, whichever is later. The 31-day period starts runni ng even if you are confined. If we permit you to enroll in Conversion Coverage retroactively, you must pay Premiums back to the day you lost Coverage under the Agreement. There can be no gap in Coverage. You do not have a right to enroll in Conversion Coverage as a Subscriber or Covered Dependent if any of the following applies: (a) Your Coverage under the Agreement terminates becaus e: (i.) You, or if you are a Covered Dependent, the Subscriber, fails to pay any required Premiums; (ii.) Your Coverage under the Agreement is replaced by other group coverage; or (iii.) Your Coverage under the Agreement was terminated for cause. (b) Coverage under the Agreement ends before you have been continuous ly enrolled under any group plan for at least three months; (c) On the termination date, you are covered under, or eligible for any group or governmental health care policy, certificate, contract, benefit plan or program, whether insured or self-insured and that coverage provi des similar benefits to the Conversion Coverage; (d) On the termination date, you are covered under any individual health care policy, certificate, contract, benefit plan or progr am, whether insured or self-insured and that coverage provide s similar benefits to the Conversion Coverage; (e) You are covered under Medicare; or (f) You live outside of our Service Area. HMO Certificate of Coverage 42 (2) Terms of Conversion Coverage. If we issue you Conversion Coverage, it will be our standard HMO Conversion Coverage plan in effect at the time you request to enroll. Your coverage may not contain the same level of Coverage that you have had under the Agreement. The Conv ersion Coverage will cover, at a minimum, all benefits required by any laws. There may be changes to the standard plan from time to time. If you move outside our Service Area, you will only have coverage for Medical Emergencies and Urgent Care. If you want more details about Conversion Coverage, contact our Customer Service Department. We must receive payment of the first Premium for Conversion Coverage along with your enrollment request and authorization for electronic funds transfer (automatic payment). Your Premium for Conversion Coverage will be based on the number of dependents, if any, you enroll for Coverage. If we issue you Conversion Coverage, it will begin on the day after your Coverage under the Agreement ends. E. Cont inuation of Coverage . \"COBRA\" stands for the Consol idated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, which was enacted to provide for continue d coverage for eligible individuals (\"Qualified Beneficiaries\") who would otherwise lose Coverage due to specific circumstances (\"Quali fying Event\"). COBRA applies to employers with 20 or more employees on at least 50% of the employer's typical business days during the prior calenda r year. \"Quali fied Beneficiary\" means the Subscriber and Covered Dependent who is Covered under this plan on the day before a COBRA Quali fying Event takes place (described below) and loses Coverage as a result of the Quali fying Event. A Quali fied Beneficiary also includes any child born to or placed for adoption with, the Subscriber during the period of COBRA continuation coverage. A retiree who is eligible under this plan may be a Qualified Beneficiary only in the event of a Bankruptc y Qualifying Event (as described below). Each individual Qualified Beneficiary has the same rights under the plan as an Active Employee. (1) Eligibility for COBRA Continuation Coverage. If your participation in the plan terminates because you have a Qualifying Event, you may continue Coverage under COBRA for specific periods of time. A \"Qualifying Event\" happens when: (a) 18-Month Quali fying Events. Coverage of the Subscriber or Covered Dependent terminates because the Subscriber terminated employm ent for any reason (except gross misconduct ), or because the Subscriber's hours were reduced below the minimum required for Coverag e (an \"Employee Qualifying Event\"); or (b) 36-Month Quali fying Events. A Covered Dependent's Coverage terminates because any of the following (a \"Dependent Quali fying Event\"): (i.) The Subscriber died; or (ii.) The Subscriber became divorced or legally separated; or (iii.) The Subscriber became entitled to Medicare; or (iv.) A dependent child loses eligibility as a Covered Dependent under the plan. (c) Bankruptc y Qualifying Event. There is a right to COBRA continuation coverage for any retired Subscriber and any Covered Dependents of the Subscriber if Coverage is lost due to the filing of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding with regard to your Employer or if there is a substantial elimination of Coverage within one year before or after commencement of such proceeding (\"Bankruptc y Quali fying Event\"). This only applies if retirees are Covered as Subscribers under the Agreement. You must be Covered under this plan on the day before the Qualifying Event occurs to be eligible for COBRA Coverage. A child who is born to or placed for adoption with a Covered Subscriber during the COBRA coverage period is also a Quali fied Beneficiary eligible for COBRA Coverage from the date of birth or placement for adoption, so long as your Employer is notified of the birth or adoption within 31 days of the event. A Subscriber may be a Qualified Beneficiary only in the event of the Subscriber's termination or reduction in hours of employment. (2) Type of Coverage. COBRA Coverage will be the same as the Coverage provided to Members who have not experienced a Qualifying Event. If Coverage under the plan is changed for Members who have not experienced a Qualifying Event, COBRA Coverage will be changed in the same manner. HMO Certificate of Coverage 4 (3) Duration of COBRA Continuation Coverage. COBRA continuation coverage will extend for a maximum of 18 months for an Employee Qualifying Event and a maximum of 36 months for a Dependent Quali fying Event except as described below: (a) 29-Month Disability. If it is determined that you are Disabled under either Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act at the time of an Employee Qualifying Event, or at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA Coverage following an Employee Qualifying Event, COBRA continuation coverage for you and your Covered Dependents may extend for up to 11 additiona l months (beyond the initial 18 months) for a total continuation period of 29 months if you provi de the required notice and evidence of the Disability determination to your Employer in a timely manner. You must provi de us with written notice of the Disability determination within the 60 day time period described below under \"COBRA Notic e Requirements, Participants Notice\" but no later than the end of the initial 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage. This extended Coverage will terminate on the last day of the calendar month that begins 30 days after the date of a final determination that you are no longer Disabled. (b) Multiple Qualifying Events. If a second Quali fying Event that is a 36-month Dependent Quali fying Event occurs during an 18-month Employe e Qualifying Event, COBRA continuation coverage for Covered Dependents may continue for an additional 18 months. If a Covered Dependent is added after continued Coverage began, the plan will not continue the Covered Dependent's Coverage past the original 18 months (except in the case of a Newbor n or newly adopte d child who becomes Covered as described above). You must notify your Employer of the second Qualifying Event within the 60 day time period described below under \"COBRA Notic e Requirements, Participants Notice\". The multiple Qualifying Event extension is also available where a second Quali fying Event that is a 36-month Dependent Quali fying Event occurs during the additional 11-month Disability extension. The multiple Qualifying Event extension is available only if the second Quali fying Event would have caused a loss of Coverage under the plan if the first Quali fying Event had not occurre d. COBRA continuation coverage will never extend for more than 36 months, measur ed from the date of the original Employee Qualifying Event. (c) 36-Month Medicare Rule. If a Subscriber becomes entitled to Medicare before the occurre nce of an Employee Qualifying Event, the maximum COBRA period for Covered Dependents can extend to the later of 36 months from the date of Medicare entitlement or 18 months (29 months if there has been a Disability extension) from the date of the Employee Quali fying Event. (d) Retiree Coverage. For a Subscriber who is a retiree on the day before a Bankruptc y Qualifying Event, Coverage may continue until death, as long as retirees remain eligible for Coverage under the Agreement. Coverage may also continue until death for a retirees' surviving spous e who is Covered on the day before a Bankruptcy event, as long as retirees are eligible for Coverage under the Agreement. Coverage will continue for 36 months for the Covered Dependent of a Subscriber who is a retiree following the death of that Subscriber. (4) Termination of COBRA. Your COBRA continua tion Coverage will terminate for any of the following reasons: (a) The date you reach the end of the 18, 29 or 36 month maximum coverage period; or (b) The date your Employer no longer offers a group health plan to any of its employees ; or (c) The date as of which your Premium for COBRA continuation Coverage is not timely paid; or (d) The date after your election of COBRA that you first become covered under anothe r group health plan unless the other group health plan contains a limitation or exclusion for any pre-existing conditio n you have, other than a limitation or exclusion that does not apply to you due to the Health Insurance Portability and Accounta bility Act of 1996; or (e) The date after your election of COBRA , on which you first become enrolled in Part A or Part B of Medicare; or (f) The date your Coverage is terminated for cause on the same basis as for similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries, such as for submission of a fraudulent claim. HMO Certificate of Coverage 44 (5) COBRA Notic e Requirements. Your COBRA continua tion coverage will be effective on the date your regular Coverage ends. For COBRA Coverage to be available you must complete the following steps within the time limits specified below: (a) notify your Employer, or its designee who handles COBRA administration, of an event permitting a Dependent Quali fying Event as required below; (b) elect Coverage under this section; and (c) pay all required Premiums. (i.) Member Notice. You must notify your Employer or its designee in writing of a divor ce, legal separation, child ceasing to have Covered Dependent status, or a second Qualifying Event under this plan within 60 days of the occurre nce, or within 60 days after the date Coverage would end because of the Quali fying Event. If you or your Covered Dependent are eligible for a 29-month COBRA continua tion coverage becaus e of Disability, you must notify your Employer or its designee of the Social Security Disability determination within 60 days after the latest of: (a) the date of the Social Security Administration Disability determination; (b) the date of the employee Qualifying Event; or (c) the date Coverage would be lost under the plan becaus e of the employee Quali fying Event; and before the end of the initial 18 months of the COBRA continuation coverage. You must also notify your Employer or its designee within 30 days of any final determination by the Social Security Administration that you (or your Covered Dependent) are no longer Disabled. If you do not make the required notifications in writing within the above time frames, COBRA continua tion coverage will not be available. You must mail or hand-deliver the above notices to your Employer. If mailed, your notice must be post-marked no later than the deadline described above. (ii.) Employer Notice. Within 14 days of receiving notice of a Quali fying Event, your Employer or its designee will send a COBRA election notice to each Member whos e Coverage would be terminated absent the COBRA continuation coverage right. (iii.) Member Election. You must elect COBRA continuatio n coverage within 60 days from the date your Coverage would terminate, or the date that you are sent a COBRA election notice , whichever is later. If you do not elect Coverage within the 60-day period, your Employer will consider this to be a refusal of Coverage. Each Member Covered by the plan on the day before a Quali fying Event has an independent right to COBRA continuation coverage regardless of whether Coverage is elected for any other family member. (6) COBRA Premiums. If you enroll for COBRA continuation coverage, you must pay the applicable Premium for that Cove rage (\"COBRA Premium\"). The COBRA Premium will be equal to 102% (150% for each month of the additional 11-month COBRA continuation coverage for Disability if the Disabled individual is part of the coverage group) of the Premium paid by your Employer to us. (7) Payment of COBRA Premiums. If you enroll for COBRA continuation coverage, your initial COBRA Premium must be paid no more than 45 days after the date you elect Coverage. The initial Premium is the amount necessary to purchase Coverage retroactive to the date your Coverage would have terminated becaus e of a Quali fying Event. Each additional COBRA Premium is due before the first day of each month of Coverage. You are respons ible to insure that your COBRA Premiums are paid timely. If a COBRA Premium is not paid within 30 days after its due date (45 days for the initial COBRA Premium), your COBRA continuation coverage rights will terminate. The termination will be effective as of the last day for which your Employer received a COBRA Premium, and you will have no right to reinstatement. Payment of the Premium is considered to have been made as of the date sent (typically the date postm arked by the Post Office on the mailing envelope). (8) Reimbursement of Reasonable and Customary Charg es. If you are eligible for COBRA continua tion coverage, and you receive Covered Services before you enroll for COBRA continuation coverage and before you pay the required COBRA Premium, you must pay for them yours elf. The plan will reimburse you for those Covered Services accord ing to the terms of the plan, minus any required Deductibles and/or Copayments, if you enroll for COBRA continuation coverage within the required 60-day period, you timely pay the COBRA Premium, and you submit a claim for reimbursement of those charges. (9) Addr ess Changes. To protect your family's rights, you should keep your Employer informed of any changes in the addresses of you and/or your Covered Dependents. HMO Certificate of Coverage 4 F. 2002 Trade Act Informat ion. The Trade Act of 2002 created a health coverage tax credit (HCTC) for certain individuals who become eligible for trade adjustm ent assista nce on account of job loss resulting from increased imports or shifts in producti on outside the U.S. and for certain retired employees who are receiving pension payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpor ation (PBGC). Eligible individuals can either claim a tax credit on their federal tax return or receiv e advance payment of a percentage of premiums paid for qualified health coverage, including COBRA continuation coverage. Eligible individuals may also qualify for a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage for themselves and certain family members (if they did not elect COBRA coverage during the regular COBR A election period following termination of employment). This special second election period lasts for 60 days but may be shorter. It begins on the first day of the month in which an individual becomes eligible for the health coverage tax credit, but the election must in any case be made within six months after group health plan coverage ended. If you qualif y or think you may qualify for these benefits, contact your Employer for additiona l information promptly in order not to lose your special COBRA rights. If you have questions about the Trade Act, you may call the Health Care Tax Credit Customer Contact Center toll-free at 866 628-4282. More information about the Trade Act is also available at doleta .gov/t radeact/2002act _index.cfm. For additional information on the Health Coverage Tax Credit, go to IRS.go v and enter keyword \"HCTC\". G. Cont inuation of Coverage for Military Service. If you are absent from work because of military service, you may elect to continue Coverage under the plan for you and your Covered Dependents. The continua tion of coverage period will extend for the longer of 24 months from the first day of your absence or the day after you apply for or return to your job. Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployme nt Rights Act of 1994 (the \"USERRA\"), your Premium for this Continuation Coverage will be the same as for a COBRA Qualified Beneficiary. If you are absent for 30 days or less, the Premium will be the same as for similarly situated Active Employees. If you do not elect to be Covered during military service, or if your Coverage terminates because the continuation period expires, you may reinstate Coverage when you return to work as required under the USERRA . Coverage will be reinstated without regard to any waiting period except as would have applied if your Coverage had not terminated becaus e of military service. These continuation requirements apply to the extent they provi de you with better Cove rage when you are absent from work because of military service than COBRA continua tion coverage (such as coverage for a longer period of time or less costly coverage). (1) Notic e of Absence for Military Service. You must give your Employer advance written notice of your absence for military service unless provi ding the notice is impossible, unreason able or prevented by military necessity. (2) Election of Continuation Coverage. You must elect Continuation Coverage in writing no later than 60 days after you leave work for military service. If giving notice within 60 days is impossible, unreason able or prevented by military necess ity, then you must give your Employer written notice of your absence within 60 days after doing so is no longer impossib le, unreason able or prevented by military necessity. If you make a timely election of Continuati on Coverage and pay any unpai d Premium amounts due, then your Continua tion Coverage will be retroactive to your date of absence. (3) Termination of Coverage. If you do not give your Employer notice of your absence for military service, your Coverage will end immediately upon your absence. If you provi de your Employer notice of your absence but do not elect Continua tion Coverage as provided above, then your Coverage will end after you have been absent for military service for 30 days. If you elect Continuation Coverage but fail to make timely Premium payments, then your Continuation Coverage will be terminated if you fail to make a payment within 30 days of when the payment is due. SECTION 1 3. Coordination Of Benefi ts A. Purpose of Coor dination of Benefits. Coordi nation of Benefits (COB) is the system used to determine how benefits are paid when you are covered by more than one health plan. The primary plan is respons ible for paying the full benefit amount allowed by that plan. The seconda ry plan is respons ible for paying all or part of the benefit not covered by the primary plan as long as the benefit is covered by the seconda ry plan. The HMO Certificate of Coverage 46 seconda ry plan adjusts the amount of benefits paid so that the total benefits available to the Member for the particular service will not exceed the total Allowe d Amount for that service. The total paid by both plans may provi de payment up to, but not exceeding our Allowe d Amount, which may result in Member liability even after the seconda ry plan's payment. We will coordi nate benefits with the following types of plans: (1) Grou p insurance, or any other arrangement of coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or self-insured basis, including government progr ams such as Medicare and Medicaid. We do not coordinate with specialty plans such as dental, vision or disability insurance, unless your vision plan Coverage is provi ded under a vision Rider to this Certificate; and (2) Individual insurance, including government progr ams such as Medicare and Medicaid. We do not coordi nate with specialty plans such as dental, vision or disability insurance, unless your vision plan Coverage is provi ded under a vision Rider to this Certificate; and (3) Automobile insurance required by law to be purchased and not provided under a group plan, but only to the extent that automobile insurance law requires coverage of medical benefits. Most automobile insurance in Michigan is written on a \"coordi nated\" basis in which the health plan must assume primary respons ibility for covered benefits. Some automobile insurance is written on a \"full medical\" basis, which assumes the automobile insurance carrier is the primary payer. B. Informat ion abou t Coverage from Othe r Plans. You must cooperate to allow us to coordinate our Coverage with coverage from other plans, including provi ding us with copies of court orders and other documents that may determine which plan is primary. All information provi ded to us will be kept confidential. C. Guidelines to Determine Primary Coverage If You Are Cove red by Two or More Plans. (1) A plan without a Coordi nation of Benefits provi sion is always primary. (2) A plan covering you as a Subscriber is always primary. NOTE : The way the primary payer is determined may be different if you also receive Medicare benefits, as required by the Social Security Act of 1965. See Section 14.B for additiona l information. (3) A plan Covering you as an active employee is primary when you are covered as an active employee under one plan and as a retiree under a second plan. (4) A plan that is non-COBRA or non-continuation coverage is primary when you are covered under a non-COBRA or non- continuation plan and a COBRA or other type of continua tion plan. (5) If you have Prescription Drug Coverage under another plan, drugs for cancer therapy and cancer clinical trials are Covered under your prescription drug plan before Coverage under your Priority Health medical plan applies. (6) The Birthday Rule applies when determining which plan is primary for dependent children. The Child's primary plan is the plan of the person (parent, stepparent, etc.) whos e birthday falls earlier in the calendar year (month and day only). If the birthdays of the persons covering the dependent are on the same date, the plan that has covered the child longer is primary. This subsection (6) does not apply if subsection (7) below applies. (7) For dependent children of divorced parents, legally separated parents, or unmarried parents who do not reside in the same household, benefits are coordi nated as follows : (a) If a court order assigns respons ibility for providing healthcare benefits to one parent, that parent's policy is primary. (b) If a court order assigns respons ibility for providing healthcare benefits to both parents, the primary plan will be determined in the following order: (i.) Parent with physical custody (ii.) Stepparent with physical custody (iii.) Parent without physical custody (iv.) Stepparent without physical custody This order above does not apply, howe ver, when parents have joint physical custody. In such cases, the birthday rule in subsection (6) above applies. HMO Certificate of Coverage 4 (c) If a court order fails to assign responsibility for providing health benefits to either parent or if no court order exists, health benefits are determined accord ing to custody, as described in subsection (7)(b). In cases of joint physical custody, the Birthday Rule in subsection (6) applies. You are required to provi de us with a copy of any court order that affects Coverage of your dependents. (8) If none of the above rules can be used to determine the order in which benefits are paid, the plan that has covered you longer is primary. D. Effect on Benefits. We will follow the above rules to determine which plan is the primary plan. If we are the primary plan, you are entitled to Covered Services as outlined in this Certificate. If your other plan is the primary plan, then we are the secondary plan. In that case, the primary plan must pay up to its highest benefit level. If your benefits under the primary plan are reduced becaus e of noncompliance with plan requirements, such as seeking a second surgical opinion, getting prior approv al of admissions or services, or using Participating Providers, this plan's liability will not be increased to Cover the extra costs you will be required to pay. That means you must follow the rules of your primary plan. When we are the seconda ry plan, we will not Cover expenses for inpatient services, drugs Covered as medical benefits, weight loss treatments, or transplants unless all of the requirements for Coverage under this Certificate have been followe d. We will pay for such services only when you follow our rules and procedures, including using Participating Providers and obtain ing any required approva l from us. If our rules conflict with those of your other plan, it may be impossible to receive benefits from both plans. You may only be able to receive benefits from the primary plan. Except as described in subsection (5) below, duplicate coverage will never give you more benefits from us than those available under this Certificate. Additi onal rules for coordination of benefits when we are the secondary plan: (1) A primary plan, as determined above, must provi de its covered benefits without considering our Coverage. (2) If a primary plan does not cover services that we Cover, we will Cover those services as if we are the primary plan. (3) If we Cover services not fully covered by a primary plan, we will coordi nate our Coverage with the primary plan's coverage to pay up to 100% of Allowe d Amount, the primary plan's contracted rate or our contracted rate, whichever is less, for those services. (4) We are not required to pay claims or coordi nate benefits for services that are not provided by Participating Providers or approved by us or that are not Covered Services under this Certificate. (5) We will Cover certain outpatient services, other than prescription drugs , weight loss treatments, and services related to an organ transplant, without prior approval , if you have followed the rules of your primary plan and the services are Covered under this Certificate. NOTE : If we Cover outpatient services received from Non-Participating Providers without Prior Appr oval as described in subpa ragraph (5) above, we may require you to receive any related inpatient services from Participating Providers. For example, if another plan is your primary plan and you receive outpatient physical therapy services while wintering in Florida, we will pay for those services as the seconda ry plan without requiring Prior Approval. If you then require Hospit al Inpatient Care, Prior Approval by us is required in order for that hospitalization to be Covered, even though we are the seconda ry plan. If the inpatient services are available in our Service Area, we may require you to return to our Service Area to receive those services. In addition, if Priority Health becomes the primary plan, you will be required to receive Covered Services from Participating Providers if the services are available within Priority Health's network. See Section 14.B for information on coordination with Medicare. E. Release. We may release to and obtain from any other insurer, plan or party, any information that we consider necessa ry for coordi nation of benefits or recovery of overpayments. You may be required to assist with this process. F. Recovery of Overpay ments ; Cond itional Benefit Payments . A payment made by another plan may include an amount that should have been paid under this Certificate. If it does, we may reimburse that amount directly to the other plan. The amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit we had paid, and we will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes the reason able cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. HMO Certificate of Coverage 48 If the amount of the payments we made is more than we should have paid under this Section 13, or if we have provide d services which should have been paid by a primary plan, we may recove r the excess or the reason able cash value of the services, as applicable, from one or more of: (i) the persons we paid or for whom we have paid a Provider; (ii) insurance companies; or (iii) other organizations. We can recover those amounts as we choose. If you incur medical expenses for which another party is or may be respons ible, we may provi de Coverage subject to our right to reimburs ement. If we ask, you (or your legal guardian) must sign any agreements or other documents and cooperate with us to make sure that we can recover the overpayme nts or obtain the reimbursement described in this paragraph. Reimbursement will be made to the extent of, but not exceeding, the total amount of recove ry payable to or on your behalf (or on behalf of your guardian or estate) from: (i) any policy or contract from any insurance company or carrier (including your insurer); and (ii) any third party, plan or fund as a result of a judgment or settlement. G. Subr ogation and Reimbursement. When you receiv e payment for Covered Services, you assign (or transfer) to us all of your rights of recove ry from any third party, including your Employer. These rights of recove ry include recove ries from tort-feasors, underinsured/uninsured motorist coverage, Work er's Compensation, other substitute coverage, any other group or non-group policy of insurance provi ding health and/or accident coverage, including automobile insurance. Additionally, we have a right: (1) to subrog ation. This means that we can stand in your or your estate's shoes and sue a third party directly for an Illness or Injury that we Covered. (2) of reimbursement. This means that we have a right to be reimbursed out of any recove ries you or your estate receives in the future or may have received in the past from third parties relating to your Illness or Injury that we Covered. (3) to pursue any other right of recove ry, whether based in tort, contract, or any other body of law. This assignment is to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our rights of recove ry shall not be limited to recove ries from third parties designate d for medical expenses, but shall extend to any and all recovered amounts. In the case of both subrogatio n and reimbursement, we will be permitted to pursu e a recove ry amount equal to the total amount paid by us, or the cost of services provi ded by us, as applicable, plus reason able collection costs, because of an Illness or Injury for which you (or your estate or guardian) have or has a cause of action. You are required, when requested, to acknowle dge our rights of recove ry in writing. Our right of recove ry, howe ver, is not dependent upon this acknowle dgement. Tell us immediately, in writing, about any situation that might let us invoke our rights under this section. You are expect ed to cooperate with us to help protect our rights under this section. You agree that these rights will be considered the first priority claim with a first priority lien of 100% of the proceeds of any full or partial recovery against anyone else. Our claim will be paid before any other claims are paid, whether or not you have recove red your total amount of damages. We must be reimbursed in full before any amounts (including attorney's fees incurred by you or your guardian or estate) are deducte d from the policy proceeds, judgm ent or settlement. Neither you, nor anyone acting for you, will do anything to harm our rights under this section. If you settle a claim or action against a third party, you will be considered to have been made whole by the settlement. We expressively reject the application of any \"make whole,\" common fund or other claim or defense to Priority Health's subrogatio n and reimbursement rights. We will then have the right to immediately collect the present value of our right to reimbursement, as described above. Our claim will be the first priority claim from the settlement fund. If you receive any proceeds of settlement or judgment, and if we have a right of reimbursement in those proceeds , you must hold those proceeds in trust for us. Transfer of such funds to a third party does not defeat our right of reimbursement if the funds were or are intended for your benefit. We can recove r from you expenses we incur because you failed to cooperate in enforcing our rights under this section. For purposes of this subsection 13.G, the term \"you\" includes you and any person claiming throug h or on behalf of you, including relatives, heirs, assigns and successors. SECTION 1 4. Medica re And Other Federal O r State Go vernment Programs A. Nonduplic ation of Benefits. Your benefits under this Certificate cannot be doubled up with any benefits you are, or could be, eligible for under Medicare or any other federal or state government progr am. If we Cover a service that is also covered by one of those progr ams, any sums payable under that progr am for that service must be paid to us. We will apply the rules for Coordi nation of Benefits described in Section 13 after your benefits from us have been calculated under the rules in this section. We will reduce the Allowe d Amount by any benefits available for those expenses under Medicare or any other federal or state governmental progr am. Fill out and return to us any documents we ask for to make sure we receive reimbursement by those progr ams. HMO Certificate of Coverage 4 B. Coor dination with Medicare. The following rules apply with respect to coordi nation with Medicare, except as required otherwise by applicable law: (1) Members Age 65 and Over. If you are worki ng full-time and are at least age 65 (or are the spous e of the Subscriber who is working full-time and you are at least age 65): (i.) Medicare will be primary if the Employer who is providing this Coverage has less than 20 employees; and (ii.) this plan will be primary if the Employer who is providing this Coverage has 20 or more employees. Whether the Employer has 20 or more or less employees will be determined by looking at a typical business day during the previous calenda r year. If you are covered by Medicare becaus e of your age and if your Coverage under this plan is not due to your (or your spouse's) current active employment, Medicare will be primary. For example, if your Coverage is under COBRA or a retiree plan, Medicare will be primary. (2) Disabled Members Unde r Age 65. If you are Disabled and your Coverage under this plan is due to the current active employment status of you, your spouse or parent: (i.) this plan will be primary, if this plan is a Large Group Health Plan; and (ii.) Medicare will be primary, if this plan is not a Large Group Health Plan. A \"Large Grou p Health Plan\" is one that had at least 100 employees on a typical business day during the previous calendar year. If you are covered by Medicare becaus e of Disability, and if your Coverage under this plan is not due to the current active employment status of you, your spouse or parent, Medicare will be primary. For example, if your Coverage is under COBRA or a retiree plan, Medicare will be primary. (3) Members Eligible for Medicare ESRD Benefits. Except as provi ded below, if you are entitled to or eligible for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Medicare benefits, this plan will be primary for the first 30 months of eligibility for Medicare ESRD benefits plus any applicable waiting period for those benefits. After that time, Medicare will be primary. If you have primary coverage under Medicare by reason of age or Disability and you later become eligible for Medicare ESRD coverage, Medicare will remain primary. (4) Eligibility for Medicare. In determining benefits payable under Medicare, you will be considered to be enrolled for and covered by both Part A and Part B of Medicare and any other governmental benefits for which you are eligible, whether or not you are actually enrolled. Therefore, you should enroll in and become covered by any of these benefits for which you are eligible. For example, if you are eligible for Medicare Parts A and B, and Medicare is primary, we will pay as if Medicare is primary even if you have not enrolled in both parts of Medicare. By enrolling in Medicare, you will avoid large out of pocket expenses. (5) Statutory and Regulator y Changes. Despite any other provi sion of this Certificate, if the law changes, permitting this plan to be secondary to Medicare in any circumstance not stated above, this plan will be secondary to Medicare as permitted by the new law. C. State Medical Assistance Plan. We will not consider the fact that you may be eligible for medical assistance under the Medicaid progr am when we enroll you or when we determine whether or how to Cover or pay benefits for you. If Medicaid paid a claim that shoul d have been paid by us, we will pay the claim, so the Provider can reimburse the Medicaid progr am. We will pay Providers directly on behalf of Members who are Medicaid enrollees if they have signed an Assign ment of Rights form. D. Coor dination with Children's Health Insurance Plan (CHIP ). This plan will be primary to any CHIP coverage your child may have that suppl ements this plan. HMO Certificate of Coverage 50 SECTION 1 5. Definition s (1) Active Employee.

Priority Health is highly efficient and spends more of every dollar on claims and expenses to improve the health of our members and we are committed to providing you the greatest value possible. Medi cal Loss Ratio Information: The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers in the individual and small group markets to spend at least 80 percent of the premiums they receive on health care services and activities to improve health care quality (in the large group market, this amount is 85 percent). This is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) rule or the 80/20 rule.If a health insurer does not spend at least 80 percent of the premiums it receives on health care services and activities to improve health care quality, the insurer must rebate the difference. A health insurer's Medical Loss Ratio is determined separately for each State's individual, small group and large group markets in which the health insurer offers health insurance . In some States, health insurers must meet a higher or lower Medical Loss Ratio. No later than August 1, 2013, health insurers must send any rebates due for 2012 and information to employers and individuals regarding any rebates due for 2012. You are receiving this notice because your health insurer had a Medical Loss Ratio for 2012 that met or exceeded the required Medical Loss Ratio.
