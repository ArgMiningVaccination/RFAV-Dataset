(2) Specialized therapies: Specialized therapies are non-experimental therapies or techniques that have been proven effective for certain conditions. Experimental or investigational procedures, technologies or therapies and those services covered as a medicaid state plan benefit are excluded. Services in this category include the following therapies: (a) Acupuncture: Acupuncture is a distinct system of primary health care with the goal of prevention, cure, or correction of any disease, illness, injury, pain or other physical or behavioral health condition by controlling and regulating the flow and balance of energy, form and function to restore and maintain physical health and increased mental clarity. Acupuncture may provide effective pain control, decreased symptoms of stress, improved circulation and a stronger immune system, as well as other benefits. See 16.2.1 NMAC. (b) Biofeedback: Biofeedback uses visual, auditory or other monitors to provide eligible recipients with physiological information of which they are normally unaware. This technique enables an eligible recipient to learn how to change physiological, psychological and behavioral responses for the purposes of improving emotional, behavioral, and cognitive health performance. The use of biofeedback may assist in strengthening or gaining conscious control over the above processes in order to self-regulate. Biofeedback therapy is also useful for muscle re-education of specific muscle groups or for treating pathological muscle abnormalities of spasticity, incapacitating muscle spasm, or weakness. (c) Chiropractic: Chiropractic care is designed to locate and remove interference with the transmissions or expression of nerve forces in the human body by the correction of misalignments or subluxations of the vertebral column and pelvis, for the purpose of restoring and maintaining health for treatment of human disease primarily by, but not limited to, adjustment and manipulation of the human structure. Chiropractic therapy may positively affect neurological function, improve certain reflexes and sensations, increase range of motion, and lead to improved general health. See 16.4.1 NMAC. (d) Cognitive rehabilitation therapy: Cognitive rehabilitation therapy services are designed to improve cognitive functioning by reinforcing, strengthening, or reestablishing previously learned patterns of behavior, or establishing new patterns of cognitive activity or compensatory mechanisms for impaired neurological systems. Treatments may be focused on improving a particular cognitive domain such as attention, memory, language, or executive functions. Alternatively, treatments may be skill-based, aimed at improving performance of activities of daily living. The overall goal is to restore function in a cognitive domain or set of domains or to teach compensatory strategies to overcome an eligible recipient's specific cognitive problems. (e) Hippotherapy: Hippotherapy is a physical, occupational, and speech-language therapy treatment strategy that utilizes equine movement as part of an integrated intervention program to achieve functional outcomes. Hippotherapy applies multidimensional movement of a horse for an eligible recipient with movement dysfunction and may increase mobility and range of motion, decrease contractures and aid in normalizing muscle tone. Hippotherapy requires that the eligible recipient use cognitive functioning, especially for sequencing and memory. An eligible recipient with attention deficits and behavior problems are redirecting attention and behaviors by focusing on the activity. Hippotherapy involves therapeutic exercise, neuromuscular education, kinetic activities, therapeutic activities, sensory integration activities, and individual speech therapy. The activities may also help improve respiratory function and assist with improved breathing and speech production. Hippotherapy must be performed by a RLD licensed physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech therapist. (f) Massage therapy: Massage therapy is the assessment and treatment of soft tissues and their dysfunctions for therapeutic purposes primarily for comfort and relief of pain. It includes gliding, kneading, percussion, compression, vibration, friction, nerve strokes, stretching the tissue and exercising the range of motion, and may include the use of oils, salt glows, hot or cold packs or hydrotherapy. Massage increases the circulation, helps loosen contracted, shortened muscles and can stimulate weak muscles to improve posture and movement, improves range of motion and reduces spasticity. Massage therapy may increase, or help sustain, an eligible recipient's ability to be more independent in the performance of activities of daily living; thereby, decreasing dependency upon others to perform or assist with basic daily activities. See 16.7.1 NMAC. (g) Naprapathy: Naprapathy focuses on the evaluation and treatment of neuro-musculoskeletal conditions, and is a system for restoring functionality and reducing pain in muscles and joints. The therapy uses manipulation and mobilization of the spine and other joints, and muscle treatments such as stretching and massage. Based on the concept that constricted connective tissue (ligaments, muscles, and tendons) interfere with nerve, blood, and lymph flow, naprapathy uses manipulation of connective tissue to open these channels of body function. See 16.6.1 NMAC. (h) Native American healers: Native American healing therapies encompass a wide variety of culturally-appropriate therapies that support eligible recipients in their communities by addressing their physical, emotional and spiritual health. Treatments may include prayer, dance, ceremony, song, plant medicines, foods, participation in sweat lodges, and the use of meaningful symbols of healing, such as the medicine wheel or other sacred objects. (i) Play therapy: Play therapy is a variety of play and creative arts techniques utilized to alleviate chronic, mild and moderate psychological and emotional conditions for an eligible recipient that are causing behavioral problems or are preventing the eligible recipient from realizing his or her potential. The play therapist works integratively using a wide range of play and creative arts techniques, mostly responding to the eligible recipient's direction. H. Other supports: (1) Transportation: Payment for transportation is limited to the costs of transportation needed to access waiver services, activities, and resources identified in the recipient's SSP. Transportation services are offered to enable eligible recipients to gain access to services, activities, and resources, as specified by the SSP. Transportation services under the waiver are offered in accordance with the eligible recipient's SSP. Transportation services provided under the waiver are non-medical in nature whereas transportation services provided under the medicaid state plan are to transport eligible recipients to medically necessary physical and behavioral health services. Non-medical transportation services enable recipients to gain access to waiver and non-medical community services, events, activities and resources as specified in the recipient's SSP related to community resources and services, work, volunteer sites, homes of local family or friends, civic organizations or social clubs, public meetings or other civic activities, and spiritual activities or events. Payment for mi via transportation services is made to the eligible recipient's individual transportation employee or to a public or private transportation service vendor. Payment cannot be made to the eligible recipient. Whenever possible, family, neighbors, friends, or community agencies that can provide this service without charge shall be identified in the SSP and utilized. Transportation services for minors cannot be provided by a LRI as these are services a LRI would ordinarily provide for household members of the same age who do not have a disability of chronic illness. (2) Emergency response services: Emergency response services provide an electronic device that enables the eligible recipient to secure help in an emergency at home and avoid institutionalization. The eligible recipient may also wear a portable help button to allow for mobility.

The consultant serves in a supporting role to the eligible recipient, assisting the eligible recipient to understand the mi via program, and with developing and implementing the SSP and the AAB. The SSP and annual budget request are developed and implemented as specified in 8.314.6 NMAC and mi via service standards and submitted to the TPA for final approval. Upon final approval the annual budget request becomes an AAB. A. SSP development process: For development of the participant-centered service plan, the planning meetings are scheduled at times and locations convenient to the eligible recipient. This process obtains information about eligible recipient strengths, capacities, preferences, desired outcomes and risk factors through the LOC assessment and the planning process that is undertaken between the consultant and eligible recipient to develop his or her SSP. If the eligible recipient chooses to purchase personal plan facilitation services, that assessment information would also be used in developing the SSP. (1) Assessments: (a) Assessment activities that occur prior to the SSP meeting assist in the development of an accurate and functional plan. The functional assessments conducted during the LOC determination process address the following needs of a person: medical, behavioral health, adaptive behavior skills, nutritional, functional, community/social and employment; LOC assessments are conducted in person and take place in the eligible recipient's home, or in a HSD approved location.

The consultant provides support during the annual re-determining process to assist with completing medical and financial eligibility in a timely manner. (c) Personal plan facilitators are optional supports. To assist in pre-planning, the eligible recipient is also able to access an approved provider to develop a personal plan. (3) SSP components: The SSP contains: (a) the mi via services that are furnished to the eligible recipient, the projected amount, frequency and duration, and the type of provider who furnishes each service; (i) the SSP must describe in detail how the services or goods relate to the eligible recipient's qualifying condition or disability; (ii) the SSP must describe how the services and goods support the eligible recipient to remain in the community and reduce his or her risk of institutionalization; and (iii) the SSP must specify the hours of services to be provided and payment arrangements; (b) other services needed by the mi via eligible recipient regardless of funding source, including state plan services; (c) informal supports that complement mi via services in meeting the needs of the eligible recipient; (d) methods for coordination with the medicaid state plan services and other public programs; (e) methods for addressing the eligible recipient's health care needs when relevant; (f) quality assurance criteria to be used to determine if the services and goods meet the eligible recipient's needs as related to his or her qualifying condition or disability; (g) information, resources or training needed by the eligible recipient and service providers; (h) methods to address the eligible recipient's health and safety, such as emergency and back-up services; and (i) the IBA. (4) Service and support plan meeting: (a) The eligible recipient receives an LOC assessment and local resource manual prior to the SSP meeting. (b) The eligible recipient may begin planning and drafting the SSP utilizing those tools prior to the SSP meeting. (c) During the SSP meeting, the consultant assists the eligible recipient to ensure that the SSP addresses the eligible recipient's goals, health, safety and risks. The eligible recipient and his or her consultant will assure that the SSP addresses the information and concerns identified through the assessment process. The SSP must address the eligible recipient's health and safety needs before addressing other issues. The consultant ensures that: (i) the planning process addresses the eligible recipient's needs and goals in the following areas: health and wellness and accommodations or supports needed at home and in the community; (ii) services selected address the eligible recipient's needs as identified during the assessment process; needs not addressed in the SSP will be addressed outside the mi via program; (iii) the outcome of the assessment process for assuring health and safety is considered in the plan; (iv) services do not duplicate or supplant those available to the eligible recipient through the medicaid state plan or other programs; (v) services are not duplicated in more than one service code; (vi) job descriptions are complete for each provider and employee in the plan; a job description will include frequency, intensity and expected outcomes for the service; (vii) the quality assurance section of the SSP is complete and specifies the roles of the eligible recipient, consultant and any others listed in this section; (viii) the responsibilities are assigned for implementing the plan; (ix) the emergency and back-up plans are complete; and (x) the SSP is submitted to the TPA after the SSP meeting, in compliance with mi via rules and service standards. B. Individual budgetary allotment (IBA): Each eligible recipient's annual IBA is determined by MAD or its designee as follows. (1) Budgetary allotments are based on calculations developed by MAD for each mi via population group, utilizing historical traditional waiver care plan authorized budgets within the population, minus the case management costs, and minus a ten percent discount. (2) The determination of each eligible recipient's sub-group is based on a comprehensive assessment. The eligible recipient then receives the IBA available to that category of need, according to the eligible recipient's age. (3) An eligible recipient has the authority to expend the IBA through an AAB that is to be expended on a monthly basis and in accordance with the mi via rules and program service standards. (a) The state and CMS approves a range of rates, as applicable, for mi via services wherein each recipient or EOR can self-direct and establish his or her own rate with a particular provider of a service. The current rate schedule is available on the HSD and DOH websites. Mi via recipients, or EORs, are required to negotiate and determine the rate for their employees and services within the range of rates established by the state. Justification for paying more than the established rates must be submitted, in writing, to the TPA for consideration. The established rate may not be exceeded in order to pay for additional services the employee or provider may provide which are outside the scope of the specific service for which the employee or provider is approved; nor can a rate exception be approved for credentials that exceed those required to provide the service unless the credentials specifically meet criteria below. To exceed the established range of rates the following criteria must be met: (i) behavioral conditions: the recipient's behaviors are of a severity that pose considerable risk to the eligible recipient, caregivers or the community; and require a frequency and intensity of assistance to ensure the eligible recipient's health and safety in the home or the community or supervision or consultation requiring specialized or unique behavioral supports; these services cannot be accessed through other services; or (ii) medical conditions: the recipient has ongoing need for intense medical supports including oxygen monitoring, diabetic monitoring, skin breakdown, J and G tube feedings, ostomy and urology care, catheter insertion, digital extractions, suctioning, nebulizer treatments, routine order treatments in the prevention of infections, and responsive awareness to severe allergic reactions; or (iii) specialized supports: in order to support the recipient's inclusion in the community the recipient requires specialized support that can enhance communicative or functional skills such as american sign language or programming of adaptive communication devices; or (iv) location: the recipient lives in a geographic location, within New Mexico, with limited providers. The recipient, or guardian, has researched multiple providers and has been unable to identify another provider in the geographic location available to provide the service within the range of rates. The service goal must specify the recipient's need for this service and contact with available local provider within six months of the date of request including reason why alternate providers are not available. (b) The AAB shall contain goods and services necessary for health and safety (i.e., direct care services and medically related goods) which will be given priority over goods and services that are non-medical or not directly related to health and safety. This prioritization applies to the IBA, AAB, and any subsequent modifications. C. SSP review criteria: Services and related goods identified in the eligible recipient's requested SSP may be considered for approval if the following requirements are met: (1) the services or goods must be responsive to the eligible recipient's qualifying condition or disability and must address the eligible recipient's clinical, functional, medical or habilitative needs; and (2) the services or goods must accommodate the eligible recipient in managing his or her household; or (3) the services or goods must facilitate activities of daily living; or (4) the services or goods must promote the eligible recipient's personal health and safety; and (5) the services or goods must afford the eligible recipient an accommodation for greater independence; and (6) the services or goods must support the eligible recipient to remain in the community and reduce his/her risk for institutionalization; and (7) the services or goods must be documented in the SSP and advance the desired outcomes in the eligible recipient's SSP; and (8) the SSP contains the quality assurance criteria to be used to determine if the service or goods meet the eligible recipient's need as related to the qualifying condition or disability; and (9) the services or goods must decrease the need for other MAD services; and (10) the eligible recipient receiving the services or goods does not have the funds to purchase the services or goods; or (11) the services or goods are not available through another source; the eligible recipient must submit documentation that the services or goods are not available through another source, such as the medicaid state plan or medicare; and (12) the service or good is not prohibited by federal regulations, NMAC rules, billing instructions, standards, and manuals; and (13) each service or good must be listed as an individual line item whenever possible; however, when a service or a good are 'bundled' the SSP must document why bundling is necessary and appropriate. D. Budget review criteria: The eligible recipient's proposed annual budget request may be considered for approval, if all of the following requirements are met: (1) the proposed annual budget request is within the eligible recipient's IBA; and (2) the proposed rate for each service is within the mi via range of rates for that chosen service; and (3) the proposed cost for each good is reasonable, appropriate and reflects the lowest available cost for that chosen good; and (4) the estimated cost of the service or good is specifically documented in the eligible recipient's budget worksheets; and (5) no employee exceeds 40 hours paid work in a consecutive seven-day work week. E. Modification of the SSP: (1) The SSP may be modified based upon a change in the eligible recipient's needs or circumstances, such as a change in the eligible recipient's health status or condition or a change in the eligible recipient's support system, such as the death or disabling condition of a family member or other individual who was providing services. (2) If the modification is to provide new or additional services than originally included in the SSP, these services must not be able to be acquired through other programs or sources. The eligible recipient must document the fact that the services are not available through another source. (3) The eligible recipient must provide written documentation of the change in needs or circumstances as specified in the mi via service standards. The eligible recipient submits the documentation to the consultant. The consultant initiates the process to modify the SSP by forwarding the request for modification to the TPA for review. (4) The SSP must be modified before there is any change in the AAB. (5) The SSP may be modified once the original SSP has been submitted and approved. Only one SSP revision may be submitted at a time, e.g., a SSP revision may not be submitted if an initial SSP request or prior SSP revision request is under initial review by the TPA. This requirement also applies to any re-consideration of the same revision request. Other than for critical health and safety reasons, neither the SSP nor the AAB may be modified within 60 calendar days of expiration of the current SSP. F. Modifications to the eligible recipient's annual budget: Revisions to the AAB may occur within the SSP year, and the eligible recipient is responsible for assuring that all expenditures are in compliance with the most current AAB in effect. The SSP must be amended first to reflect a change in the eligible recipient's needs or circumstances before any revisions to the AAB can be requested. (1) Budget revisions involve requests to add new goods or services to a budget or to reallocate funds from any line item to another approved line item. Budget revisions must be submitted to the TPA for review and approval. Other than for critical health and safety reasons for the eligible recipient, budget revisions may not be submitted to the TPA for review within the last 60 calendar days of the budget year. (2) The amount of the AAB cannot exceed the eligible recipient's annual IBA. The rare exception would be the eligible recipient whose assessed or documented needs, based on his or her qualifying condition, cannot be met within the annual IBA, in which case the eligible recipient would initiate a request for an adjustment through his or her consultant. (3) Mi via budgets are developed by service. A recipient may request an increase to his or her budget above his or her annual IBA, or AAB, as applicable if services necessary for health and safety cannot be met within the IBA, or AAB. Prioritization, as described in Subparagraph (b) of Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of 8.314.6.17 NMAC applies. Requests for additional funding are built in the annual budget and are specific to the service that is being requested. If the eligible recipient requests an increase in his or her budget above his or her annual IBA, or AAB, as applicable, the eligible recipient must show at least one of the following four circumstances related to the specific service for which an increase to the additional funding is being requested: (a) chronic physical condition: the eligible recipient has one or more chronic physical conditions, which are identified during the initial or reevaluation of the LOC, that result in a prolonged dependency on medical services or care, for which daily intervention is medically necessary; and the eligible recipient's needs cannot be met within the assigned IBA or other current resources, including natural supports, medicaid state plan services, medicare or other sources; the eligible recipient must submit a written, dated, and signed evaluation or letter from a medical doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), a certified nurse practitioner (CNP) or a physician assistant (PA) that documents the chronic physical condition in the eligible recipient's health status relevant to the criteria; the evaluation or letter must have been completed after the last LOC assessment or less than one year from the date the request is submitted, whichever is most recent; the chronic physical conditions are characterized by at least one of the following: (i) a life-threatening condition with frequent or constant periods of acute exacerbation that places the eligible recipient at risk for institutionalization; that could result in the eligible recipient's inability to remember to self-administer medications accurately even with the use of assistive technology devices; or that requires a frequency and intensity of assistance, supervision, or consultation to ensure the eligible recipient's health and safety in the home or in the community; or which, in the absence of such skilled intervention, assistance, medical supervision or consultation, would require hospitalization or admission to a NF or ICF-IID; (ii) the need for administration of specialized medications, enteral feeding or treatments that are ordered by a medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, certified nurse practitioner or physician's assistant; which require frequent and ongoing management or monitoring or oversight of medical technology; (b) change in physical status: the eligible recipient has experienced a deterioration or permanent change in his or her health status such that the eligible recipient's needs for services and supports can no longer be met within the IBA, current AAB or other current resources, including natural supports, medicaid state plan services, medicare or other sources; the eligible recipient must submit a written, dated, and signed evaluation or letter from a MD, OD, CNP, or PA that documents the change in the eligible recipient's health status relevant to the criteria; the evaluation or letter must have been completed after the last LOC assessment or less than one year from the date the request is submitted, whichever is most recent; the eligible recipient may submit additional supportive documentation by others involved in the eligible recipient's care, such as a current individual service plan (ISP) if the eligible recipient is transferring from another waiver, a recent evaluation from a specialist or therapist, a recent discharge plan, relevant medical records or other documentation or recent statements from family members, friends or other support individuals; types of physical health status changes that may necessitate an increase in the IBA or current AAB are as follows: (i) the eligible recipient now requires the administration of medications via intravenous or injections on a daily or weekly basis; (ii) the eligible recipient has experienced recent onset or increase in aspiration of saliva, foods or liquids; (iii) the eligible recipient now requires external feedings, e.g. naso-gastric, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, gastric-tube or jejunostomy-tube; (iv) the eligible recipient is newly dependent on a ventilator; (v) the eligible recipient now requires suctioning every two hours, or more frequently, as needed; (vi) the eligible recipient now has seizure activity that requires continuous monitoring for injury and aspiration, despite anti-convulsant therapy; or (vii) the eligible recipient now requires increased assistance with activities of daily living as a result of a deterioration or permanent changes in his or her physical health status; (c) chronic or intermittent behavioral conditions or cognitive difficulties: the eligible recipient has chronic or intermittent behavioral conditions or cognitive difficulties, which are identified during the initial or reevaluation LOC assessment, or the eligible recipient has experienced a change in his or her behavioral health status, for which the eligible recipient requires additional services, supports, assistance, or supervision to address the behaviors or cognitive difficulties in order to keep the eligible recipient safe; these behaviors or cognitive difficulties are so severe and intense that they result in considerable risk to the eligible recipient, caregivers or the community; and require a frequency and intensity of assistance, supervision or consultation to ensure the eligible recipient's health and safety in the home or the community; in addition, these behaviors are likely to lead to incarceration or admission to a hospital, nursing facility or ICF-IID; require intensive intervention or medication management by a doctor or behavioral health practitioner or care practitioner which cannot be effectively addressed within the IBA, current AAB or other resources, including natural supports, the medicaid state plan services, medicare or other sources; (i) examples of chronic or intermittent behaviors or cognitive difficulties are such that the eligible recipient injures him or herself frequently or seriously; has uncontrolled physical aggression toward others; disrupts most activities to the extent that his or her SSP cannot be implemented or routine activities of daily living cannot be carried out; withdraws personally from contact with most others; or leaves or wanders away from the home, work or service delivery environment in a way that puts him or herself or others at risk; (ii) the eligible recipient must submit a written, dated, and signed evaluation or letter from a licensed MD, doctor of osteopathy (DO), CNP, physician assistant (PA), psychiatrist, or RLD licensed psychologist that documents the change in the eligible recipient's behavioral health status relevant to the criteria; the evaluation or letter must have been completed after the last LOC assessment or less than one year from the date the request is submitted, whichever is most recent; the eligible recipient may submit additional supportive documentation including a current ISP if the eligible recipient is transferring from another waiver, a positive behavioral support plan or assessment, recent notes, a summary or letter from a behavioral health practitioner or professional with expertise in intellectual or developmental disabilities, recent discharge plan, recent recommendations from a rehabilitation facility, any other relevant documentation or recent statements from family members, friends or other support individuals involved with the eligible recipient. (d) change in natural supports: the eligible recipient has experienced a loss, as a result of situations such as death, illness, or disabling condition, of his or her natural supports, such as family members or other community resources that were providing direct care or services, whether paid or not. This absence of natural supports or other resources is expected to continue throughout the period for which supplemental funds are requested. The type, intensity or amount of care or services previously provided by natural supports or other resources cannot be acquired within the IBA and are not available through the medicaid state plan services, medicare, other programs or sources in order for the eligible recipient to live in a home and community-based setting. (4) The eligible recipient is responsible for tracking all budget expenditures and assuring that all expenditures are within the AAB. The eligible recipient must not exceed the AAB within any SSP year. The eligible recipient's failure to properly allocate the expenditures within the SSP year resulting in the depletion of the AAB, due to mismanagement of or failure to track the funds, prior to the calendared expiration date does not substantiate a claim for a budget increase (i.e., if all of the AAB is expended within the first three months of the SSP year, it is not justification for an increase in the annual budget for that SSP year). Amendments to the AAB may occur within the SSP year and the eligible recipient is responsible for assuring that all expenditures are in compliance with the most current AAB in effect. Amendments to the AAB must be preceded by an amendment to the SSP. (5) The AAB may be revised once the original annual budget request has been submitted and approved. Only one annual budget revision request may be submitted at a time, e.g., an annual budget revision request may not be submitted if a prior annual budget revision request is under initial review by the TPA. The same requirement also applies to any reconsideration of the same revision request. G. SSP and annual budget supports: As specified in 8.314.6 NMAC and its service standards, the eligible recipient is assisted by his or her consultant in development and implementation of the SSP and AAB. The FMA assists the eligible recipient with implementation of the AAB. H. Submission for approval: The TPA must approve the SSP and associated annual budget request (resulting in an AAB). The TPA must approve certain changes in the SSP and annual budget request, as specified in 8.314.6 NMAC and mi via service standards and in accordance with 8.302.5 NMAC. (1) At any point during the SSP and associated annual budget utilization review process, the TPA may request additional documentation from the eligible recipient. This request must be in writing and submitted to both the eligible recipient and the consultant provider. The eligible recipient has seven working days from the date of the initial request to respond with additional documentation. The TPA will issue a second request for information on the seventh day if information was not received and issue a final request for information 14 working days after the initial request. The eligible recipient has a total of 21 working days to respond with additional documentation. Failure by the eligible recipient to submit the requested information may subject the SSP and annual budget request to denial. (2) Services cannot begin and goods may not be purchased before the start date of the approved SSP and AAB or approved revised SSP and revised AAB. (3) Any revisions requested for other than critical health or safety reasons within 60 calendar days of expiration of the SSP and AAB are subject to denial for that reason.

Reconsideration must be requested within 30-calendar days of the date on the denial notice, must be in writing and provide additional documentation or clarifying information regarding the eligible recipient's request for the denied services or goods. D. Denial of payment: If a service, support, or good is not covered under the mi via program, the claim for payment may be denied by MAD or its designee. If it is determined that a service is not covered before the claim is paid, the claim is denied. If this determination is made after payment, the payment amount is subject to recoupment or repayment.

C. The FMA must submit claims that have been paid by the FMA on behalf of eligible recipient to the MAD fiscal contractor for processing. D. Reimbursement may not be made directly to the eligible recipient, either to reimburse him or her for expenses incurred or to enable the eligible recipient to pay a service provider directly.
