Medical specialty practice. A medical practice other than primary care, general practice, or family medicine. Negative pressure. A relative air pressure difference between two areas. The pressure in a containment room or area that is under negative pressure is lower than adjacent areas, which keeps air from flowing out of the containment facility and into adjacent rooms or areas. NIOSH. The Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC, or his or her designated representative. Non-medical transport. The transportation by employees other than health care providers or emergency medical personnel during which no medical services are reasonably anticipated to be provided. Novel or unknown ATP. A pathogen capable of causing serious human disease meeting the following criteria: (1) There is credible evidence that the pathogen is transmissible to humans by aerosols; and (2) The disease agent is: (a) A newly recognized pathogen, or (b) A newly recognized variant of a known pathogen and there is reason to believe that the variant differs significantly from the known pathogen in virulence or transmissibility, or (c) A recognized pathogen that has been recently introduced into the human population, or (d) A not yet identified pathogen. NOTE: Variants of the human influenza virus that typically occur from season to season are not considered novel or unknown ATPs if they do not differ significantly in virulence or transmissibility from existing seasonal variants. Pandemic influenza strains that have not been fully characterized are novel pathogens. Occupational exposure. Exposure from work activity or working conditions that is reasonably anticipated to create an elevated risk of contracting any disease caused by ATPs or ATPs-L if protective measures are not in place. In this context, elevated means higher than what is considered ordinary for employees having direct contact with the general public outside of the facilities, service categories and operations listed in subsection (a)(1) of this standard. Occupational exposure is presumed to exist to some extent in each of the facilities, services and operations listed in subsection (a)(1)(A) through (a)(1)(I). Whether a particular employee has occupational exposure depends on the tasks, activities, and environment of the employee, and therefore, some employees of a covered employer may have no occupational exposure. For example, occupational exposure typically does not exist where a hospital employee works only in an office environment separated from patient care facilities, or works only in other areas separate from those where the risk of ATD transmission, whether from patients or contaminated items, would be elevated without protective measures. It is the task of employers covered by this standard to identify those employees who have occupational exposure so that appropriate protective measures can be implemented to protect them as required. Employee activities that involve having contact with, or being within exposure range of cases or suspected cases of ATD, are always considered to cause occupational exposure. Similarly, employee activities that involve contact with, or routinely being within exposure range of, populations served by facilities identified in subsection (a)(1)(E) are considered to cause occupational exposure. Employees working in laboratory areas in which ATPs-L are handled or reasonably anticipated to be present are also considered to have occupational exposure. Physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) means an individual whose legally permitted scope or practice (i.e., license, registration, or certification) allows him or her to independently provide, or be delegated the responsibility to provide, some or all of the health care services required by this section.

NOTE to subsection (g)(2): The respiratory protection program may be incorporated into the ATD Exposure Control Plan or the Biosafety Plan. (3) Respirator selection. (A) Where respirator use is required for protection against potentially infectious aerosols and is not required to meet the requirements of subsections (g)(3)(B) or (g)(3)(C), the employer shall provide a respirator that is at least as effective as an N95 filtering facepiece respirator, unless the employer's evaluation of respiratory hazards determines that a more protective respirator is necessary, in which case the more protective respirator shall be provided. (B) Effective September 1, 2010, the employer shall provide a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) with a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter(s), or a respirator providing equivalent or greater protection, to employees who perform high hazard procedures on AirID cases or suspected cases and to employees who perform high hazard procedures on cadavers potentially infected with ATPs, unless the employer determines that this use would interfere with the successful performance of the required task or tasks. This determination shall be documented in accordance with the ATD Plan and shall be reviewed by the employer and employees at least annually in accordance with subsection (d)(3). EXCEPTION 1 to subsection (g)(3)(B): Where a high hazard procedure is performed by placing the patient in a booth, hood or other ventilated enclosure that effectively contains and removes the aerosols resulting from the procedure, and the employee remains outside of the enclosure, the employee may use a respirator meeting the requirements of subsection (g)(3)(A). EXCEPTION 2 to subsection (g)(3)(B): Paramedics and other emergency medical personnel in field operations may use a P100, R100 or N100 respirator in lieu of a PAPR, providing that the respirator is used in accordance with its NIOSH approval. If an employer selects N100 respirators for use under this subsection, the employer's respiratory protection program and employee training must address how an environment will be assessed for the presence of oil aerosols and how alternate respiratory protection will be made available to employees who must use respirators under conditions for which N materials are not suitable. (C) Respirators used in laboratory operations to protect against infectious aerosols shall be selected in accordance with the risk assessment and biosafety plan, in accordance with subsection (f). (D) Where respirators are necessary to protect the user from other hazards, including the uncontrolled release of microbiological spores, or exposure to chemical or radiologic agents, respirator selection shall also be made in accordance with Sections 5144, Respiratory Protection, and 5192, Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response Operations, of these orders, as applicable. (4) The employer shall provide, and ensure that employees use, a respirator selected in accordance with subsection (g)(3) and Section 5144 when the employee: (A) Enters an AII room or area in use for AII; (B) Is present during the performance of procedures or services for an AirID case or suspected case; (C) Repairs, replaces, or maintains air systems or equipment that may contain or generate aerosolized pathogens; (D) Is working in an area occupied by an AirID case or suspected case, during decontamination procedures after the person has left the area and as required by subsection (e)(5)(D)9; (E) Is working in a residence where an AirID case or suspected case is known to be present; (F) Is present during the performance of aerosol generating procedures on cadavers that are suspected of, or confirmed as, being infected with aerosol transmissible pathogens; (G) Is performing a task for which the Biosafety Plan or Exposure Control Plan requires the use of respirators; or (H) Transports an AirID case or suspected case within the facility or in an enclosed vehicle (e.g., van, car, ambulance or helicopter) when the patient is not masked. EXCEPTIONS to subsection (g)(4)(H): (1) The employer shall not require or permit respirator use when an employee is operating a helicopter or other vehicle and the respirator may interfere with the safe operation of that vehicle. When employees do not use respirators, the employer shall provide other means of protection such as barriers or source control measures, where feasible. (2) Law enforcement or corrections personnel who transport an airborne infectious disease case or suspected case in a vehicle need not use respiratory protection if all of the following conditions are met: i. A solid partition separates the passenger area from the area where employees are located; ii. The employer implements written procedures that specify the conditions of operation, including the operation of windows and fans; iii. The employer tests (for example by the use of smoke tubes) the airflow in a representative vehicle (of the same model, year of manufacture, and partition design) under the specified conditions of operation, and finds that there is no detectable airflow from the passenger compartment to the employee area; iv.

(5) Medical evaluation: The employer shall provide a medical evaluation, in accordance with Section 5144(e) of these orders, to determine the employee's ability to use a respirator before the employee is fit tested or required to use the respirator. For employees who use respirators solely for compliance with subsections (g)(3)(A) and (g)(3)(B), the alternate questionnaire in Appendix B may be used. (6) Fit testing. (A) The employer shall perform either quantitative or qualitative fit tests in accordance with the procedures outlined in Appendix A of Section 5144, Respiratory Protection, of these orders. The fit test shall be performed on the same size, make, model and style of respirator as the employee will use. When quantitative fit testing is performed, the employer shall not permit an employee to wear a filtering facepiece respirator or other half-facepiece respirator, unless a minimum fit factor of one hundred (100) is obtained. When fit testing single use respirators, a new respirator shall be used for each employee. (B) The employer shall ensure that each employee who is assigned to use a filtering facepiece or other tight-fitting respirator passes a fit test: 1. At the time of initial fitting; 2. When a different size, make, model or style of respirator is used; and 3. At least annually thereafter. EXCEPTION to subsection (g)(6)(B)3: Until January 1, 2014, employers may increase the interval for repeat fit testing to no more than two years for employees who do not perform high hazard procedures and are not using respirators for protection against laboratory generated aerosols. Employers shall provide to each employee who is not fit-tested within the previous 12 months a respirator fit-test screening that includes the information in Appendix G, and that obtains a response to the questions included in Appendix G. As of January 1, 2015, an employee who uses a respirator under this section shall have been fit-tested within the previous 12 months. (C) The employer shall conduct an additional fit test when the employee reports, or the employer, PLHCP, supervisor, or program administrator makes visual observations of changes in the employee's physical condition that could affect respirator fit. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, facial scarring, dental changes, cosmetic surgery, or an obvious change in body weight. (D) If, after passing a fit test, the employee subsequently notifies the employer, program administrator, supervisor, or PLHCP that the fit of the respirator is unacceptable, the employee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to select a different respirator facepiece and to be retested. (7) The employer shall ensure that each respirator user is provided with initial and annual training in accordance with Section 5144, Respiratory Protection of these orders. (h) Medical Services. (1) Each employer who has any employee with occupational exposure shall provide the employee with medical services for tuberculosis and other ATDs, and infection with ATPs and ATPs-L, in accordance with applicable public health guidelines, for the type of work setting and disease. When an employer is also acting as the evaluating health care professional, the employer shall advise the employee following an exposure incident that the employee may refuse to consent to vaccination, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up from the employer-health care professional. When consent is refused, the employer immediately shall make available a confidential vaccination, medical evaluation or follow-up from a PLHCP other than the exposed employee's employer.

The employer shall request that the PLHCP, with the employee's consent, perform any necessary diagnostic tests and inform the employee about appropriate treatment options. 3. The employer shall request that the PLHCP determine if the employee is a TB case or suspected case, and to do all of the following, if the employee is a case or suspected case: a. Inform the employee and the local health officer in accordance with Title 17. b. Consult with the local health officer and inform the employer of any infection control recommendations related to the employee's activity in the workplace. c. Make a recommendation to the employer regarding precautionary removal due to suspect active disease, in accordance with subsection (h)(8), and provide the employer with a written opinion in accordance with subsection (h)(9). (C) TB conversions shall be recorded in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 14300 et seq. (D) Unless it is determined that the TB test conversion is not occupational, the employer shall investigate the circumstances of the conversion, and correct any deficiencies found during the investigation. The investigation shall be documented in accordance with subsection (j). EXCEPTION to subsection (h)(3): Research and production laboratories in which M. tuberculosis containing materials are not reasonably anticipated to be present, need not provide assessment for LTBI infection. (4) Laboratory tests shall be conducted by an accredited laboratory. (5) The employer shall make available to all susceptible health care workers with occupational exposure all vaccine doses listed in Appendix E. Employees in laboratory operations outside of health care settings, and within the scope of subsection (f), shall be provided with vaccines in accordance with the BMBL for the specific laboratory operations. The requirements in subsection (h)(5) will become effective on September 1, 2010. (A) Recommended vaccinations shall be made available to all employees who have occupational exposure after the employee has received the training required in subsection (c) or (i) and within 10 working days of initial assignment unless: 1. The employee has previously received the recommended vaccination(s) and is not due to receive another vaccination dose; or 2. A PLHCP has determined that the employee is immune in accordance with applicable public health guidelines; or 3. The vaccine(s) is contraindicated for medical reasons. (B) The employer shall make additional vaccine doses available to employees within 120 days of the issuance of new applicable public health guidelines recommending the additional dose. (C) The employer shall not make participation in a prescreening serology program a prerequisite for receiving a vaccine, unless applicable public health guidelines recommend this prescreening prior to administration of the vaccine. (D) If the employee initially declines a vaccination but at a later date, while still covered under the standard, decides to accept the vaccination, the employer shall make the vaccination available in accordance with subsection (h)(5)(A) within 10 working days of receiving a written request from the employee. (E) The employer shall ensure that employees who decline to accept a recommended and offered vaccination sign the statement in Appendix C1 for each declined vaccine. (F) The employer shall request the PLHCP administering a vaccination or determining immunity to provide only the following information to the employer: 1. The employee's name and employee identifier. 2. The date of the vaccine dose or determination of immunity. 3. Whether the employee is immune to the disease, and whether there are any specific restrictions on the employee's exposure or ability to receive vaccine. 4. Whether an additional vaccination dose is required, and if so, the date the additional vaccination dose should be provided. EXCEPTION to subsection (h)(5): Where the employer cannot implement these procedures because of the lack of availability of vaccine, the employer shall document efforts made to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner and inform employees of the status of the vaccine availability, including when the vaccine is likely to become available. The employer shall check on the availability of the vaccine at least every 60 calendar days and inform employees when the vaccine becomes available. (6) Exposure Incidents. (A) A health care provider, or the employer of a health care provider who determines that a person is an RATD case or suspected case shall report, or ensure that the health care provider reports, the case to the local health officer, in accordance with Title 17. (B) In addition to the report required in subsection (h)(6)(A), the employer in the facility, service or operation that originates the report shall determine, to the extent that the information is available in the employer's records, whether the employee(s) of any other employer(s) may have had contact with the case or suspected case while performing activities within the scope of this section. The employer shall notify the other employer(s) within a timeframe that will both provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate time for the employee to receive effective medical intervention to prevent disease or mitigate the disease course, and will also permit the prompt initiation of an investigation to identify exposed employees. In no case, shall the notification be longer than 72 hours after the report to the local health officer. The notification shall include the date, time, and nature of the potential exposure, and provide any other information that is necessary for the other employer(s) to evaluate the potential exposure of his or her employees. The notifying employer shall not provide the identity of the source patient to the other employers. NOTE 1 to subsection (h)(6)(B): These employees may include, but are not limited to, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, emergency responders, home health care personnel, homeless shelter personnel, personnel at referring health care facilities or agencies, and corrections personnel. NOTE 2 to subsection (h)(6)(B): Some diseases, such as meningococcal disease, require prompt prophylaxis of exposed individuals to prevent disease. Some diseases, such as varicella, have a limited window in which to administer vaccine to non-immune contacts. Exposure to some diseases may create a need to temporarily remove an employee from certain duties during a potential period of communicability. For other diseases such as tuberculosis there may not be a need for immediate medical intervention, however prompt follow up is important to the success of identifying exposed employees. (C) Each employer who becomes aware that his or her employees may have been exposed to an RATD case or suspected case, or to an exposure incident involving an ATP-L shall do all of the following: 1. Within a timeframe that is reasonable for the specific disease, as described in subsection (h)(6)(B), but in no case later than 72 hours following, as applicable, the employer's report to the local health officer or the receipt of notification from another employer or the local health officer, conduct an analysis of the exposure scenario to determine which employees had significant exposures. This analysis shall be conducted by an individual knowledgeable in the mechanisms of exposure to ATPs or ATPs-L, and shall record the names and any other employee identifier used in the workplace of persons who were included in the analysis. The analysis shall also record the basis for any determination that an employee need not be included in post-exposure follow-up because the employee did not have a significant exposure or because a PLHCP determined that the employee is immune to the infection in accordance with applicable public health guidelines. The exposure analysis shall be made available to the local health officer upon request. The name of the person making the determination, and the identity of any PLHCP or local health officer consulted in making the determination shall be recorded. 2. Within a timeframe that is reasonable for the specific disease, as described in subsection (h)(6)(B), but in no case later than 96 hours of becoming aware of the potential exposure, notify employees who had significant exposures of the date, time, and nature of the exposure. 3. As soon as feasible, provide post-exposure medical evaluation to all employees who had a significant exposure.
