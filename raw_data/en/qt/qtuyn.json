The color change and sediment you see in the water is produced by the ionization interaction of the current flow; the metal in the array and the toxins in the water and body. Negative and positive ions attract toxins and are released from the body via osmosis. This is a very effective way of cleansing the body of toxins. The benefits of the Aqua Detox system are detoxification, stimulation and balancing of the body's energy meridians, and ATP production. ATP has natural body chemicals that extracts energy from your food and makes it available for numerous physiologic functions in the body. Conditions that Benefit from Ionic Body Detox Many conditions have improved, including reduction of pain and discomfort after chemotherapy, relief from allergic reactions, calming of eczema, low energy levels, arthritic pain in the joints and ionic detox also seems to work very well in curing hangovers. One therapist reported dramatic improvements when the system was used on a drug addict who was still suffering from the effects of crack cocaine. Another reported that it can be used to benefit those who are recovering from IBS symptoms. Research by Dr. Chaudhury into the Aqua Detox System. Scientist Dr Sanjay Chaudhuri MBBS BSc was commissioned to study the effects of ionic detoxification Using a range of monitoring equipment, six people were tested with the genuine Aqua Detox unit while three people were tested with a placebo treatment. Blood tests were taken before and after treatment and vital signs were monitored. Dr Chaudhury reported that blood flow increased and both pulse rates and blood pressure fell in the subjects that had a real treatment. Photographs of the blood before and after treatment seemed to indicate that there was less clumping together of blood cells after the 30 minute session. The treatment \"was seen to contribute to negative red cell surface charge which in turn heightens the body's ability to maintain free-flowing blood cells. Arterial stiffness was reduced and physical stress levels in the body fell appreciably. No obvious differences were noted in the placebo group.\" Testimonial If you need a body detox in St. George UT, please give us a call. We are here to help. Holistic Healthcare St. George "}
