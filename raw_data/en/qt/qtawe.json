December 22, SELYA,Circuit Judge . This interlocutory appeal arises out of the chaotic early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Defendant-appellee Janet T. Mills, the Governor of Maine, responded to the growing threat of contagion by issuing a series of executive orders limiting all \"non-essential\" activities and gatherings, arguably including those by religious organizations. In the court below, plaintiff-appellant Calvary Chapel of Bangor (the Chapel) contended that these orders violated several federal and state constitutional and statutory provisions, including, principally, the Free Speech, Free Exercise, Assembly, and Establishment protections of the First Amendment. See U.S. Const. amend. I. The district court found the Chapel's contentions wanting and refused its request for a temporary restraining order. See Calvary Chapel of Bangor v. Mills, 459 F. Supp. 3d 273, 283- 288 (D. Me. 2020). In this venue, the Chapel renews its substantive claims and asserts that the district court abused its discretion by denying the Chapel's request for immediate relief. But a jurisdictional barrier looms at the threshold, which prevents us from reaching the substance of the Chapel's contentions. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Case: 20-1507 6390389- 4 - I. BACKGROUND We draw the facts from the limited record available in the district court, including the Chapel's verified complaint and accompanying motion, the Governor's response, and the various exhibits proffered by the parties. The Chapel is a nonprofit religious organization that operates an approximately 10,000-square-foot church facility in Orrington, Maine. By all accounts, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 significantly disrupted the Chapel's usual routine of staging weekly worship services and other in-person activities for its congregants. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel (and highly transmissible) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The first outbreak of the disease was identified in Wuhan City, China, during December of 2019. The virus spread worldwide with alarming speed. The United States Department of Health and Human Services declared the coronavirus a national public health emergency on January 31, 2020, retroactive to January 27. Governor Mills proclaimed a corresponding state of civil emergency in Maine on March 15. The Governor's emergency proclamation was the first in a rapid-fire series of executive actions designed to prevent and/or slow the spread of the virus among Maine residents. Early on, in-person gatherings (particularly those involving dense crowds or extended exposure to other persons) were identified as a major Case: 20-1507 6390389- 5 - vector of transmission. Citing the need to limit the propagation of the virus through such gatherings, Governor Mills issued a series of four executive orders between March 18 and April 29, 2020, which imposed emergency regulations on assembly within the state. We chronicle them briefly: xExecutive Order 14, issued on March 18, prohibited gatherings of more than ten people for any \"social, personal, [or] discretionary events,\" including \"faith-based events.\" xExecutive Order 19, issued on March 24, authorized \"Essential Businesses and Operations\" to exceed the ten-person gathering limit; subject, however, to social distancing and sanitation guidelines. xExecutive Order 28, issued on March 31, directed all persons residing in Maine to \"stay at their homes or places of residence,\" except as needed to engage in \"essential\" employment or activities. This exception captured tasks deemed critical for resident health and safety, including (as illustrated in the order) accessing childcare, shopping for household supplies, and obtaining physical or behavioral medical treatment. xExecutive Order 49, issued on April 29, provided for implementation of Governor Mills's plan to Case: - restart Maine's economy \u2014 a staggered (four-phase) relaxation of the earlier restrictions. For ease in exposition, we refer to this quartet of executive orders as the \"gathering orders\" and to the April 29 order as promulgating \"the re-opening plan.\" The dispute between the parties erupted at 8:30 p.m. on May 4, at which time the Chapel e-mailed a communique to Governor Mills, insisting that the gathering orders be revoked by 1:00 p.m. the following day. Receiving no response within the stipulated time frame, the Chapel sued Governor Mills in Maine's federal district court on May 5. Its verified complaint alleged that the gathering orders transgressed ten different provisions of federal and state law, both constitutional and statutory. 1 On the heels of this filing, the Chapel moved for a temporary restraining order or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction. Two days later, the district court convened a telephone conference with the parties. We have no transcript of that 1 The Chapel claimed violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment (Count I); the First Amendment right to peaceful assembly (Count II); the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment (Count III); the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment (Count IV); the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count V); the Guarantee Clause of Article IV (Count VI); the Maine Constitution's guarantee of free exercise of religion (Count VII); the Maine Constitution's freedom of speech guarantee (Count VIII); legislative prerogatives (Count IX); and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons 6390389- 7 - conference, but Governor Mills apparently agreed to file an expedited response to the Chapel's request for some sort of interim injunctive relief. The Governor submitted an opposition to the Chapel's motion at the close of business the following day. On May 9, the district court issued a thoughtful rescript, in which it denied the Chapel's request for a temporary restraining order.See Calvary Chapel, 459 F. Supp. 3d at 288. The Chapel did not press for a hearing on preliminary injunction but, rather, filed this appeal.II. ANALYSIS \"[F]ederal courts have an omnipresent duty to take notice of jurisdictional defects, on their own initiative if necessary.\" Whitfield v. Mun. of Fajardo, 564 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2009). We start \u2014 and end \u2014 there. The denial of a temporary restraining order is not ordinarily appealable, save for certain \"narrow exceptions.\" Mass. Air Pollution & Noise Abatement Comm. v. Brinegar, 499 F.2d 125, 126 (1st Cir. 1974). The parties \u2014 who agree on little else \u2014 urge us to find that the district court's denial of the temporary restraining order in this case qualifies under one such exception. In other words, they stand united in asking us to hold that we have appellate jurisdiction. We are not so sanguine. It is common ground that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a federal court by the parties' agreement Case: - alone. See Espinal-Dom\u00ednguez v. Puerto Rico, 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir. 2003). We must, therefore, mount an independent inquiry into the existence vel non of appellate jurisdiction. As a general rule, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals is limited to \"appeals from . . . final decisions of the district courts.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Of course, this general rule \u2014 like most general rules \u2014 admits of exceptions. As relevant here, Congress has fashioned an exception that gives the courts of appeals immediate appellate jurisdiction over appeals from non-final district court orders \"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.\" Id. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The parties identify this exception as the hook upon which appellate jurisdiction may be hung. This is a heavy lift: the denial of a temporary restraining order does not normally fall within the compass of section 1292(a)(1). See S.F. Real Est. Inv'rs. v. Real Est. Inv. Tr. of Am., 692 F.2d 814, 816 (1st Cir. 1982) (explaining that \"the term 'injunction' is understood not to encompass temporary restraining orders\"). Even so, if an appellant can make a three-part showing \u2014 demonstrating that the refusal of a temporary restraining order had the practical effect of denying injunctive relief, will likely cause serious (if not irreparable) harm, and can only be effectually challenged by means of an immediate appeal \u2014 section 1292(a)(1) may be invoked. See Watchtower Bible & Soc'y of N.Y., Inc. v. Colombani, 712 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2013); Ca\u00f1o Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a v. 582 F.3d 131, 133 (1st Cir. 2009) (per curiam). We examine the Chapel's showing on each of these three parts separately, mindful that it is the Chapel's burden to carry the devoir of persuasion on each of them and that a failure to do so on any one part is fatal. See Watchtower Bible, 712 F.3d at 12; Nwaubani v. Grossman, 806 F.3d 677, 680 (1st Cir. 2015). The Chapel contends that the district court's decision to deny it a temporary restraining order functionally precluded any possibility of a preliminary injunction. This contention elevates hope over reason. We previously have held that we will deem a ruling to have had the practical effect of denying injunctive relief either if it was issued after a full adversarial hearing or if no further interlocutory relief is available in the absence of immediate review. See Fideicomiso De La Tierra, 582 F.3d at 133. It strains credulity to call what happened below a \"full adversarial hearing.\" The district court heard the parties only in a telephone conference of indeterminate length; no verbatim record was kept of what was said during the conference; no discovery was conducted in advance of the conference; no witnesses were called during the conference; and the court did not ask to hear from the Chapel after the Governor filed her opposition. To say that what happened was a \"full\" Case: 10 - adversarial hearing would be like saying that a CliffsNotes version of War and Peace was a \"full\" account of Tolstoy's original work. What walks like a duck and squawks like a duck usually is a duck, and we see no reason to disregard the district court's unambiguous description of itself as adjudicating only the Chapel's motion for a temporary restraining order. 2 See, e.g., Calvary Chapel, 459 F. Supp. 3d at 277 (describing issue sub judice as \"[the Chapel's] Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, which seeks emergency relief before Sunday, May 10, 2020\"). Indeed, we think that the district court's cautious choice to limit its order solely to the denial of a temporary restraint accurately reflected the absence of a full adversarial hearing. In addition, the sparseness of the record argues powerfully in favor of a finding that pathways for further interlocutory relief remained available in the district court. See, e.g., id. at 281 n.11 (noting that record lacks \"any information about the number of members Calvary Chapel has or the number of members who regularly attend its worship services\"); id. at 277 n.2 (declining to consider amicus brief \"[b]ecause of the tight timelines, and because [the Chapel] has not had time to file 2 Even if these circumstances qualified as a close call \u2014 and we do not believe that they do \u2014 our settled practice when confronted with borderline cases is to \"resolve[] against immediate appealability.\" Morales Feliciano v. Rullan, - any opposition to the amicus motion\"); id. at 287 (noting that the Chapel failed to develop its argument \"that the orders foster government entanglement with religion\"). These comments and gaps in the record suggest that a preliminary injunction hearing would not have been either a redundancy or an exercise in futility. And whether or not a better-informed proceeding would have yielded a different outcome \u2014 a matter that is left entirely to speculation on this truncated record \u2014 the intervening development of the record would have facilitated subsequent appellate review. As matters now stand, the parties dispute key factual questions \u2014 including whether Maine classified religious gatherings as essential activity for purposes of Executive Order 28 or would have permitted gatherings at essential businesses \u2014 that the district court has not yet assessed. Finally, the denial of a preliminary injunction would have been immediately appealable under section 1292(a)(1), thus affording the Chapel an avenue for timely appellate review. To say more about the first requirement for immediate appealability would be to paint the lily. The record makes manifest that this case, in its present posture, does not display the criteria that we previously have identified as characterizing a de facto denial of injunctive relief. See Fideicomiso 12 - The fact that the Chapel stumbles at the first step of the tripartite inquiry is sufficient to defeat its claim of appellate jurisdiction. See Watchtower Bible, 712 F.3d at 12; Nwaubani, 806 F.3d at 680. For the sake of completeness, though, we note that the remaining requirements for appealability are not satisfied here. To begin, we do not believe that the lack of immediate appealability can be said to cause serious harm. Although we do not gainsay that even a temporary restriction of traditional in-person worship opportunities may represent a tangible hardship for religious organizations and their members, the seriousness of any given harm can only be assessed in context. Jumping from a second- story window undoubtedly entails a risk of serious harm, but the harm may seem less serious if the jumper's only other choice is to remain in a burning building. Here, the need for context requires that a significant countervailing factor must be included in the mix: the harm of which the Chapel complains has its origins in the extraordinary epidemiological crisis that has engulfed Maine and every other part of the United States. This countervailing factor necessarily informs our assessment of the severity of the harm that the Chapel faced as a result of the district court's denial of its motion for a temporary restraining order. See Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 86 (1981).Case: 20-1507 13 - Let us be perfectly clear: public officials do not have free rein to curtail individual constitutional liberties during a public health emergency. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, No. 20A87, 2020 WL 6948354, at *3 (U.S. Nov. 25, 2020) (per curiam) (stating that \"even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten\"); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 31 (1905) (discussing courts' duty to intervene when legislative action lacks \"real or substantial relation\" to public health outcomes, or otherwise represents a \"plain, palpable invasion\" of constitutional rights). Even so, the public interest demands that public officials be accorded considerable latitude to grapple with the \"dynamic and fact-intensive\" considerations involved in mounting an effective response. S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Carefully balancing these considerations against the encroachment on the rights of the Chapel and its members, the district court determined that the gathering restrictions would not inflict irreparable harm. See Calvary Chapel, 459 F. Supp. 3d at 288. This supportable determination helps to clarify that the absence of immediate appealability \u2014 like the denial of the temporary restraining order itself \u2014 will not cause serious harm.Given the gravity of the situation and the fact that events remained in flux, we discern no sufficient basis for finding that Case: 20-1507 6390389- 14 - the Chapel can satisfy the second of the three requirements for immediate appealability of a temporary restraining order. In this regard, we deem it important that the Chapel retained other means to organize worship services for its congregants, including the sponsorship of online worship services, the holding of drive-in services, and the hosting of gatherings of ten or fewer people. See id. at 285. While these options are less than ideal, their availability mitigated the harm to the Chapel and its worship community during the short run. Nor has the Chapel demonstrated that effective appellate review of the constitutionality of the gathering orders, as those orders affect the Chapel, will be thwarted if the Chapel's ability to challenge them is confined to traditional litigation channels. See, e.g., Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 956 F.2d 348, 350 (1st Cir. 1992). We recognize, of course, that idiosyncratic circumstances can render an attempted challenge to an interlocutory order \"insusceptible of effective vindication\" when subject to appreciable delay. Quiros Lopez v. Unanue Casal (In re Unanue Casal), 998 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1993). Examples of such circumstances include an interlocutory order that would cause \"trade secrets [to] F.2d 1031 (1st Cir. 1990), or one that would \"irretrievably\" deprive a party of \"an important - litigation advantage,\" Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 687 F.2d 543, 552 (1st Cir. 1982). The case at hand is woven from quite different cloth. The district court's denial of the temporary restraining order did not herald an irreversible or meaningful shift in the relationship between the parties. Instead, the denial merely kept in place the same gathering restrictions under which the Chapel already was operating. Cf. Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 317, 322-23 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (vacating injunctive order because it imposed new obligations on a litigant that \"[were] not correctable at the end of the litigation\"). Here, moreover, the effect of the denial was of modest temporal duration. The Chapel had available to it the option of pressing for a hearing on preliminary injunction \u2014 and there is every reason to believe, especially given the district court's prompt attention to the Chapel's request for a temporary restraining order \u2014 that such a hearing would have been held expeditiously. Had the Chapel prevailed in its quest for a preliminary injunction, the harm of which it complains would have been abated; and had the Chapel not prevailed, the order denying a preliminary injunction would have been immediately reviewable. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Either way, the Chapel has failed to make the third showing required for immediate appealability of the denial of a temporary restraining order.Case: 16 - We need go no further. \"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\" Rhode Island v. EPA, 378 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2004). Thus, jurisdictional boundaries must be scrupulously observed. See Sierra Club v. Marsh, 907 F.2d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1990); In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1006 (1st Cir. 1988). As a general rule, the denial of a temporary restraining order is not immediately appealable, see S.F. Real Est. Inv'rs, 692 F.2d at 816, and thus falls outside the boundaries of our appellate jurisdiction. This appeal comes within the sweep of the general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it. Although we appreciate the importance of the issues that the Chapel seeks to raise, its appeal is premature, and there is no principled way for us to reach the merits of the appeal. III. CONCLUSION For the reasons elucidated above, the Chapel's appeal is dismissed without prejudice for lack of appellate jurisdiction. The parties shall bear their own costs. So Ordered. \u2014 Concurring Opinion Follows \u2014 Case: Judge , concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I agree that the denial of the temporary restraining order in this case did not have the practical effect of denying a preliminary injunction. Because that conclusion suffices to explain why the denial of the temporary restraining order in this case is not appealable, I would not go on to address the counterfactual question of whether the denial would have been appealable if it did have the practical effect of denying a preliminary injunction. Especially when we are explaining why we lack jurisdiction over an appeal from an order denying relief from an alleged violation of constitutional rights brought about by emergency legislation, I see little reason to speak more broadly than necessary.

Maine's Response Governor Mills declared a \"state of emergency\" in Maine on March 15, 2020. Proclamation of State of Civil Emergenc y to Further Protect Public Health (\"Emergency Proclamation \") (ECF No. 1-1). In that Emergency Proclamation, Governor Mills stated that COVID-19 \"poses an imminent threat of substantial harm to our citizens\" and directed various state agencies to im plement certain restrictions and orders to facilitate the State's response. Emergency Proclamation at 1. Over the last two months, Governor Mills has issu ed numerous executive orders addressing the COVID-19 health crisis. The orders at issue in this case, which I refer to collectively as the \"Gathering Orders,\" impose restrictions on assembly. First, on March 18, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 14 stating that \"[g]atherings of more than 10 people are prohibited throughout the State,\" and declared that such a prohibition was mainly aimed at \"social, personal, and discretionary events,\" including thos e gatherings that are \"faith-based.\"6 Executive Order 14 at 1 (ECF No. 1-2). 6 Governor Mills's Order is consistent with the recommendations of President Trump and the U.S. CDC that all people avoid social gatherings of more than ten people; work and attend school from home whenever possible; avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts; avoid discretionary travel, shopping, or social visits; and practice good hygiene. The federal guidance advises Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 4 of 23 PageID #: 3095 Then, on March 24, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 19. (ECF No. 1-3.) This Order continued th e prohibition of all gatherings of more than ten people but carved out an exemption for businesses deemed \"essential.\" Businesses deemed \"essential\" are permitted to continue operat ions subject to the requirement that they adhere to social distancing guidelines \u2014maintaining a six-foot distance between individuals\u2014and other \"social distancing requirements.\" Under the Order, essential businesses include \"grocery and household goods\" stores, \"gas stations,\" and \"home repair, hardware and auto repair\" stores. Executive Order 19 at 2. Executive Order 19 ordered \"non-essential\" businesses to cease activities at public-facing sites, but it permitted them to conduct limited acti vities that \"do not allow customer, vendor or other visitor in-p erson contact;\" \"do not require more than 10 workers to convene in space where social distancing is not possible;\" and \"are facilitated to the maximum extent practicable by employees working remotely.\" Non- essential businesses may engage in acti vities such as taking remote orders, maintaining the value of inventory, and pr ocessing payroll. These non-essential businesses include \"shopping malls, theaters , casinos, fitness and exercise gyms . . ., and similar personal care and treatment facilities.\" Executive Order 19 at 3. Executive Order 19 may be enforced thro ugh Maine departments or officials that issue business licenses. Executive Order 19 at 4. governors of states with evidence of community tr ansmission to close schools, businesses, and other indoor and outdoor venues where groups of people congregate. See Lighthouse Fellowship Church v. Northam , No. 2:20-cv-204, 2020 WL 2110416, at *2 (E.D. Va. May 1, 2020). Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 5 of 23 PageID #: 3106 On March 31, 2020, Governor Mills next issued Executive Order 28, which stated: \"[a]ll persons living in the State of Maine are hereby ordered, effective as of 12:01 AM on April 2, 2020 to stay at thei r homes or places of residence.\" Executive Order 28 at 2 (ECF No. 1-4). Executive Order 28 only permitted residents to travel out of their homes if they were conducting \"e ssential\" activities or traveling to work at a business allowed to continue operat ions. Depending on the square footage of an essential business, Executive Order 28 pl aced limits on the number of customers permitted inside at any one time\u2014permitting 5 people for buildings of less than 7,500 square feet, 15 people for buildings betwee n 7,500 and 25,000 square feet, 50 people for buildings between 25,000 and 50,000 squa re feet, 75 people for buildings between 50,000 and 75,000 square feet, and 100 people for buildings larger than 75,000 square feet. Executive Order 28 states that vi olations constitute a class E crime.7 Executive Order 28 stated that its prohibitions were in effect until April 30, 2020. On April 3, 2020, Governor Mills issued a list further explaining what businesses were considered \"essential\" and \"non-essential.\" Essential Business Operations Definition (ECF No. 1-5). The list of \"essential\" businesses included grocery stores, household good s stores, gas stations, hardware stores, home repair stores, garden centers and stores, chil d care services, and medical marijuana dispensaries. 7 On April 2, 2020, the Maine State Police issu ed a statement indicating that it would enforce Governor Mills's Executive Order but that it was \"a sking for voluntary compli ance\" with the Executive Order. As a \"last course of action and reserved for only the most egregious violators,\" the State Police indicated that they would \"[i]ssu[e] summonses or ma k[e] physical arrests.\" State Police Enforcement Practices Regarding Governor's Executive Order 1 (ECF No. 1-9). Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 6 of 23 PageID #: 3117 On April 14, 2020, Governor Mills issued a Proclamation to Renew the State of Civil Emergency in Maine, which contin ued the civil emergency and extended the previously issued orders for another 30 days . Proclamation to Renew the State of Civil Emergency (ECF No. 1-6). III. Maine's Plan for Reopening On April 28, 2020, Governor Mills released the \"Restarting Maine's Economy\" plan. Restarting Maine's Economy (\" Restarting Plan \") (ECF No. 1-8). This plan contemplates a four-phased approach to re opening businesses and activities. \"Stage 1\" contemplates \"a continued prohibition on gatherings of more than 10 people,\" but explicitly provides for th e opening of categories of businesses \"per checklist standards.\" Restarting Plan at 10. With respect to religious gatherings, Stage 1 provides for \"[l]imited drive-in, stay-in-your -vehicle church servic es.\" Restarting Plan at 11. Thereafter, Stage 2, scheduled to begin in June, contemplates increasing the number of people allowed at gatherings to 50. Restarting Plan at 12. On April 29, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 49, which extended her prior Orders until May 31, 2020, and provided for the implementation of the Restarting Plan. Executive Order 49 (ECF No. 1-7). Governor Mills reiterated that the \"[p]rotection of public health and our he alth care delivery system shall remain the first priority.\" Executive Order 49 at 2. As part of that approach, Governor Mills directed state agencies to continue to moni tor various metrics to guide the timing and scope of easing restrictions.8 Executive Order 49 at 2. 8 Specifically, Executive Order 49 provides: Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 7 of 23 PageID #: 3128 The Order further states that, \"[s]tarting May 1, 2020, . . . the Commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) shall implement the Restarting Plan and identify businesses and activities where current restrictions may be adjusted to safely allow for more economic and personal activity.\" Executive Order 49 at 2. Any loosening of re strictions must be consistent with the guidelines stated in the Restarting Plan. As part of the reopenin g process, Governor Mills charged DECD with developing specif ic reopening checklists and standards for categories of businesses. DECD is work ing with industry representatives and businesses to develop industrywide checklists that will inform individual businesses and other entities about safe reopening standards.9 In addition to providing stability and efficiency, the primary go al of this approach is \"to establish uniform standards, restrictions and guidance that are capable of broad, baseline application.\" Decl. of Derek P. Langhauser \u00b6 7 (\" Langhauser Decl. \") (ECF No. 21). The Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Director of the Maine Center for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC) shall continue to advise on COVID-19 trends and metrics to guide the timing, pace and scope of any easing of current restrictions. Maine CDC currently tracks, subject to change, three primary metrics: A. a downward trajectory of reported influenza-like illnesses and COVID-like syndromic cases; B. a downward trajectory of documented cases and newly hospitalized patients; and C. the capacity of Maine's hospital systems to treat all patients without crisis care and the ability of the State to engage in a robust testing program. Executive Order 49 at 2. 9 DECD has taken an organized approach to restarting by \"identifying approximately 70 categories of the tens of thousands of Maine's business, social and other entities whose operations have been seriously affected by COVID-19.\" Decl. of Derek P. Langhauser \u00b6 6 (\" Langhauser Decl. \") (ECF No. 21).

See DECD, COVID-19 Prevention Checklists, https://www.maine.gov/decd/covi d-19-prevention-checklists (last visited May 9, 2020). Each industry-specific checkl ist identifies best practices for items related to physical distancing, hygiene, pe rsonal protection, and maintenance of clean business environment, which are necessary for the safe reopening and operation of that category of business.

IV. Calvary Chapel Plaintiff Calvary Chapel is located and hosts services in Orrington, Maine. 11 Due to the Gathering Orders, the Plaintif f is prohibited from holding in-person services within its church building for mo re than ten people, a restriction that the Plaintiff contends violates its constitution al and statutory rights. Plaintiff's counsel represented to me during a teleconference on May 7, 2020, that Calvary Chapel did not contact DECD for guidance prior to fili ng suit. Instead, the Plaintiff emailed a letter to Governor Mills and her counsel, de manding written confirmation within less 11 The record does not provide any information about the number of members Calvary Chapel has or the number of members who regu larly attend its worship services. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 10 of 23 PageID . . prohibiting churches from meetings of more than 10 people have been rescinded.\"12 Demand Letter 1 (ECF No. 1-19). When no response was received, the Plai ntiff filed a Verified Complaint on May 5, 2020, asserting ten causes of action: Violation of Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (Count I); Violation of Right to Peaceably Assembly under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count II); Violation of Free Speech Clause of First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count III); Violation of Establishment Clause of Firs t Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count IV); Violation of Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count V); Violation of Republican form of Government under the Guarantee Clause of Article IV, \u00a7 4 of the U.S. Constitution (Count VI); Violation of Free Exercise of Religion under Art. 1, \u00a7 3 of the Maine Constitution (Count VII); Violation of Freedom of Speech under Art. 1, \u00a7 4 of the Maine Constitution (Count VIII); Violation of right to have laws suspended only by the Maine Legislature (Count IX); and Violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc\u20142000cc-5 (Count X). Upon conclusion of my May 7, 2020 teleconference with counsel, and at my urging, Plaintiff's counsel communicated wi th counsel for the Governor asking how it might \"secure permission, accommodation or conditional waiver to host parking lot, drive-in, and/or in-person religious services\" in conformance with the Restarting 12 Although the Complaint states that the Plaint iff gave the Governor until 5:00 p.m. on May 5 to respond, the demand letter itself lists a deadline of 1:00 p.m. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 11 of 23 15) (\" Mihet Decl .\"). Plaintiff's counsel states that he was informed by the Governor's counsel \"that there is no mechanism or procedure under the [Restarting Plan] by which Calvary Chapel could seek or obtain any certification, permission, and/or exemption to permit parking lot, drive-in and/or in-person religious services.\" Mihet Decl. \u00b6 4. While it may well be true that there is no permitting process in place, counsel for the Governor has averred that faith-based entities are allowed to hold dr ive-in services pursuant to the standards posted on the DECD website. Langhauser Decl. \u00b6 11. Plaintiff has not stated that it has ever reached out to the DECD. LEGAL STANDARD \"[Injunctive relief] is an extraordin ary and drastic remedy that is never awarded as of right.\" Monga v. Nat'l Endowment for the Arts , 323 F. Supp. 3d 75, 82 (D. Me. 2018) (quoting Peoples Fed. Sav. Bank v. People's United Bank , 672 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2012)). In deciding whether to issue a temporary restraining order, I apply the same four-factor analysis that is used to evaluate a motion for a preliminary injunction. Id. These factors are: (1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the movant] if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of relevant impositions, i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues; and (4) the effect (if any) of the court's ruling on the public interest. Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Monroig-Zayas , 445 F.3d 13, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2006). The moving party \"bears the burd en of establishing that these four factors weigh in its Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 12 of 23 PageID #: 31713 favor,\" id. at 18, but the likelihood of success on the merits is the most important. New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc. , 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002). If the movant \"cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.\" Id. DISCUSSION I. Plaintiff's Likelihood of Success A. Free Exercise Clause The Free Exercise Clause, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, holds that governments \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .\" U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added). The Plaintiff contends that the Gather ing Orders violate this rule because they \"plainly impose significant burdens on Calvary Chapel's religious beliefs.\" Pl.'s Mot. 5. Over the last several weeks, the majority of courts that have considered similar executive orders in other states have conc luded that a state does not violate the Free Exercise Clause when it limits in-person relig ious services to ten people, at least as long as the state permits drive-in services.13 See Cassell v. Snyders , No. 20-cv-50153, 13 The Plaintiff repeatedly cites to a few case s in which courts did enjoin the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions. All are distinguishable. First, in On Fire Christian Center, Inc. v. Fischer , the plaintiffs challenged a ban on drive-in church services. No. 3:20-cv-264-JRW, 2020 WL 1820249 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020). In granting the temporary restra ining order to enjoin the mayor from enforcing the ban, the court noted that the city \"targeted religi ous worship by prohibiting drive-in church services, while not prohibiting a multitude of other non-reli gious drive-ins and drive- throughs - including, for liquor stores.\" Id. at *6. Likewise, in Maryville Baptist Church v. Beshear , the Sixth Circuit criticized Kentucky's restrictions on re ligious activities but ultimately limited its decision by only enjoining the enforcement of the state's ban on drive-in services. No. 20-5427, -- F.3d --, 2020 WL 2111316, at *4-*5 (6th Cir. Ma y 2, 2020) (slip opinion). Although the court stated that the in- person limitations \"should give pause,\" it explained that, \"[i]n view of the fast-moving pace of this Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 13 of 23 PageID #: 31814 2020 WL 2112374, at *6 (N.D. (D.N.M. Apr. 17, 2020). The Plaintiff has offered no reason why Maine's orders are distinguishable. For those reasons and for the reasons set forth below, I conclude th at the Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on its free exercise claims. 1. Government Power During a Health Emergency Although a government cannot use a he alth crisis as a pretext for trampling constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ha s long recognized that \"a community has the right to protect itself against an ep idemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.\" Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Mass. , 197 U.S. 11, 27 (1905). And while such an epidemic is ongoing, the \"tradition al tiers of constitutional scrutiny do not apply.\" Cassell , 2020 WL 2112374, at *6 (citing Jacobson , 197 at 27; In re Abbott , 954 F.3d 772, 784 (5th Cir. 2020)). During that temporary time and in those narrow litigation and in view of the lack of additional inpu t from the district court, whether of a fact-finding dimension or not, we are inclined not to extend th e injunction to in-person se rvices at this point.\" See id. at *5. driv e-in, stay-in-your-vehicle services. See Langhauser Decl. \u00b6 11. Days after the Sixth Circuit decided Maryville Baptist , the district court extended the injunction to prevent enforcement of Kentucky's ba n on \"mass gatherings\" as it applied to religious services. See Maryville Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear , No. 3:20-cv-00278-DJH-RSE (W.D. Ky. May 8, 2020) . On the same day, another district court in Kent ucky entered a similar state-wide injunction. See Tabernacle Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear , No. 3:20-cv-00033-GFVT (E.D. Ky. May 8, 2020). But those courts based their decisions on determinat ions that Kentucky's order was not neutral or generally applicable and that it was not narrowly ta ilored. Those courts were reviewing a different order than I have before me today. See Maryville Baptist , No. 3:20-cv-00278-DJH-RSE, at *2, *4 (noting that Kentucky's order bans \"any event or conv ening that brings together groups of individuals\" and stating the governor failed to consider simply limiting the number of people who could attend service at a time); Tabernacle Baptist , No. 3:20-cv-00033-GFVT, at *10 (finding order not narrowly tailored because \"many of the serial exemptions for secular activities [such as law firms and laundromats] pose comparable public health risks to worship services\"); see also Roberts v. Neace , No. 20-5465 (6th Cir. May 9, 2020). Here, Maine does allo w groups of up to ten people to gather, and, as previously discussed, Maine's orders target both religious and secular conduct that poses similar health risks. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 14 of 23 PageID #: 31915 contexts, Jacobson instructs that courts should only overturn state action when it lacks a \"real or substantial relation to the protection of the public health\" or represents \"a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\" Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 31. Calling upon this rule, courts across this country have repeatedly upheld orders meant to curb th e spread of COVID-19, including rules that restrict in-person religious serv ices to ten or fewer persons. See Cross Culture Christian Ctr. v. Newsom , No. 2:20-cv-00832-JAM, 2020 WL , 2020 WL 1905586, at *25; see also In re Abbott , 954 F.3d at 783-84 (admonishing district court for failing to apply Jacobson standard in reviewing state's restriction of non- essential medical procedures, incl uding non-essential abortions). Maine's Gathering Orders are likely to surv ive this test too. The orders are in place to protect Maine residents from the spread of a virus that can cause serious illness and death. Given what we know ab out how COVID-19 spreads, the nature of the orders\u2014in permitting drive-in services , online services, and small gatherings, while restricting large assemblies of people \u2014demonstrates a substantial relation to the interest of protecting public health. For these reasons, I conclude that the Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on its clai m that the Gathering Orders violate the Free Exercise Clause. 2. Traditional Free Exercise Clause Analysis Even if the Jacobson standard was inapplicable, the Gathering Orders would likely still survive the Plaintiff's free exerci se challenge. Under traditional analysis Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 15 of 23 PageID #: 32016 of the Free Exercise Clause, \"neutral, gene rally applicable laws\" are subject to rational basis review, even where they are applied to religious practice. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , 573 U.S. 682, 694 (2014). A law is not neutral if its object is to \"infringe upon or rest rict practices because of their religious motivation.\" Church of the Lukumi Baba lu Aye v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993). A lack of neutrality can be clear from the face of the law if it \"refers to a religious practice withou t a secular meaning discernable from the language or context.\" Id.; see also Perrier-Bilbo v. United States , 954 F.3d 413, 429 (1st Cir. 2020). But the Free Exercise Clau se also forbids \"subtle departures from neutrality,\" including evidence of bias that might not be reflected in the law's text. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1731 (2018). In determining if a law's object is neutral, courts consider \"the effect of [the] law in its real operation\" and often call upon principles developed in equal protection cases. Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 535, 540. Thus, a law will be found to violate the Free Exercise Clause if it was enacted \"because of ,\" not merely \"in spite of,\" its restrictions on religious practice. Id. at 540. Relevant evidence on this point can include a proscription of religious activity in a way not applied to comparable secular activity; a \"pattern\" of \"animosity\" towards the re ligious group by the drafters; and the suppression of \"much more religious conduc t than is necessary\" to achieve the asserted, legitimate purposes. Id. at 536, 542, 543. Here, the Gathering Orders are plainly ne utral. They prohibit all non-essential gatherings of more than ten people. There are no facts suggesting that Governor Mills Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 16 of 23 PageID #: 32117 has any animus towards relig ious organizations. And und er the Gathering Orders, churches remain free to conduct drive-in services, online programs, and in-person assemblies of up to ten people.14 The Gathering Orders are thus designed to restrict only the aspects of the religious conduc t\u2014the large, in-person gatherings\u2014that undermine the secular purpose of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff asserts that the Gathering Orders are not neutral because religious organizations have been targeted and restricted in ways that secular entities have not. In particular, th e Plaintiff notes that there is an exemption from the ten-person limit for \"liquor stor es, warehouse clubs, supercenter stores, [and] marijuana dispensaries.\"15 Pl.'s Mot. 6. But, in this free exercise analysis, the question is not whether any secular entity faces fewer restrictions than any religious one. To be comparable, the secular conduct must \"endanger[ ] [the government's] 14 The Plaintiff contends that the Gathering Orders are not neutral on their face because they \"expressly target 'religious' or 'faith-based' gatherin gs for disparate treatment.\" Pl.'s Mot. 6. To be sure, the orders do include those terms in listing the types of gathering that are limited to ten or fewer people. See, e.g. , Exec. Order 14 (ECF No. 1-2) (\"Such gatherings include, without limitation, community, civic, public, leisure, and faith-based even ts . . . .\"). But the mere reference to religious activity as part of a list of broader activities covere d by the orders does not show that the order's \"object or purpose\" was to target religiou s activity for harsher treatment. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah , 508 (1993); Maryville Baptist Church , 2020 WL 2111316, at *3 (noting that mentioning religious gathering \"by na me\" does not establish \"that the Governor singled out faith groups\"); Cassell v. Snyders , No. 20-cv-50153, 2020 WL 2112374, at *10 (N.D. Ill. May 3, 2020). 15 In multiple places, the Plaintiff asserts th at the Governor has exempted casinos from the restrictions that churches face, and it implies th at casinos are permitted to continue operations. See, e.g., Pl.'s Mot. 7 (\"large numbers of people may gather at . . 12 (\"the State has created carveouts for gatherings of more than 10 individuals at . . . casinos\"). I have reviewed the executive or ders contained in the record, and I cannot find any support for th is proposition. Executive Order 19 permits casinos to engage in certain activities\u2014including taking remote orders , ensuring security, and processing payroll\u2014but prohibits them from engaging in \"customer, vendor or other visitor in-person contact.\" Executive Order 19 at 3 (ECF No. 1-3) (also stating that activities are only permitted if they \"do not require more than 10 workers to convene in space where social distancing is not possible\" and \"are facilitated to the maximum extent practicable by employees working remotely\").

The Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed in establishing that the conduct at the secular businesses that it identifies is comparable to the co nduct at religious gatherings. \"In other parts of the country, ho uses of worship have been linked to the spread of COVID-19.\"16 Shah Decl. \u00b6 29. \"Gatherings in houses of worship present a greater risk to the public health than shoppi ng at a grocery store or other retail outlet. Shoppers, particularly in the current environment, enter a store, gather the items they need as quickly as possible, check out, and promptly leave. Shah Decl. \u00b6 25. In contrast, the Plaintiff seeks to hold worship service for \"no more than a few hours twice per week.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 16-17. Several other courts have distingu ished churches from places where individuals shop, noting that the purp ose of shopping\u2014unlike the purpose of community-centered religious organizations\u2014 is not to congregate and converse but instead to find and purchase items with limited contact with others. See Cassell , 2020 WL at *6. Religious gatherings, on the other hand, are more akin to restaurants, entertainment venues, movie theaters, and schools, all of which face the same restrictions as the Plaintiff. See id. 16 \"[T]he Director of the Sacr amento County Department of Health Services announced last month that at least 70 members of a local church were infected with COVID-19. The Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment anno unced that of the eleven coronavirus clusters in Kansas recorded at the time, three were tied to ch urch gathers. . . . Recent epidemiological studies suggest that singing may release additional coronav irus into the air, increasing the likelihood of infection. For example, a recent investigation traced a COVID-19 outbreak to a choir practice session.\" Shah Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document Page 18 of 23 PageID #: 32319 The Gathering Orders are also genera lly applicable. As the Supreme Court explained in Lukumi , although \"[a]ll laws are selective to some extent, . . . categories of selection are of paramount concern wh en a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice.\" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 542. Even \"in pursuit of legitimate interests,\" the government \"cannot in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.\" Id. at 543 (noting that this principle \"has parallels in our First Amendment jurisprudence\"). The Plaintiff asserts that the Gathering Orders are not generally applicable because they exempt \"large crowds and ma sses of people gath ered at numerous businesses and other non-religious entities.\" Pl.'s Mot. 7. But, again, these exempted entities do not foster the same type of as sembly as the entities\u2014both religious and secular\u2014that are subject to the Gatherin g Orders' restrictions. Schools, movie theaters, concert halls, sports venues, sy nagogues, mosques, and churches all fall under the Gathering Orders' um brella and are all burdened by the ten-person limit. The places covered by the General Orders are places where \"people sit together in an enclosed space to share a communal experience.\" Gish , 2020 WL 1979970, at *6. The Governor has thus not selectively \"impose[d] burdens only on\" religious conduct, but rather equally on all types of conduct that are likely to spread COVID-19. See Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 543. Because I conclude that the Gathering Orders are neutral and generally applicable, the Plaintiff would have to show that they are unsupported by a rational basis in order to prevail. Given the Govern or's interest in limiting the spread of Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 19 of 23 PageID #: 32420 COVID-19, a highly contagious illness that spreads more easily through close contact, the Plaintiff is likely unable to make such a showing. B. Establishment Clause The Plaintiff also contends that the Gathering Orders violate the Establishment Clause. This cl aim appears to rest on the same allegations as the free exercise claim, namely that the Governor has targeted religious gatherings and has subjected religious organizations to stricter limitations than she has imposed on secular ones. As noted above, the First Amendment prohibits governments from making any law \"respecting an establishment of religio n.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. The \"clearest command\" of this provision is that \"one re ligious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another, . . . nor can the Perrier-Bilbo , 954 F.3d at 422 (internal quotations omitted). Under the test developed in Lemon v. Kurtzman , government action survives an Establishment Clause challenge if (1) it has \"a secula r legislative purpose,\" (2) its \" principal or primary \" effect \"neither advances nor i nhibits religion,\" and (3) it does \"not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\" Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added); see also Freedom From Religion Found. v. Hanover Sch. Dist. , 626 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2010). The Gathering Orders are likely to pass this test. As di scussed above, the orders have the secular purpose of slowing the spread of COVID-19; they have the primary effect of limiting gatherings\u2014both secular and religious\u2014which has been shown to slow the spread of COVID-19; and the Plaintiff develops no argument that the orders foster government Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 20 of 23 PageID #: 32521 entanglement with religion. As such, I conclude that the Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on its Establishment Clause claim. C. Free Speech and Assembly Finally, the Plaintiff asserts that the Gathering Orders impermissibly infringe on its First Amendment rights to free speec h and assembly. Specifically, the Plaintiff contends that the Gathering Orders \"discri minate against Calvary Chapel's free speech rights and rights to assemble on the basis of content.\" Pl.'s Mot. 11. Both of these claims, however, are premised on the Plaintiff's assertion that the Gathering Orders unconstitutionally targ et and restrict its religious exercise. Because I have already concluded that th e Gathering Orders do not impermissibly restrict the Plaintiff's free exercise of religi on, the Plaintiff is un likely to prevail on these claims as well.17 See Gish , 2020 WL 1979970, at *7. 17 I also doubt that the Plaintiff will succeed in showing that the Gathering Orders are \"content based on their face,\" as the Plaintiff asserts, whic h would subject the orders to strict scrutiny. Pl.'s Mot. 11. Even if the orders were subject to heighten ed scrutiny, the Governor would likely be able to show that they serve a compelling government inte rest (preventing the spread of COVID-19) and that they are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest , particularly because they do not restrict drive-in or streamed services and because, as discussed abov e, they do not impermissi bly single out religious groups. In denying similar motions for temporary rest raining orders, other courts have recently concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their freedom of speech and assembly claims. See Lighthouse Fellowship Church , 2020 WL 2110416, at *10-*13 (finding that no expressive conduct or speech was targeted by the governor's order, but conc luding that, even if there was, governor's order served a substantial interest unrelated to the suppression of expression, was narrowly tailored, and left open ample alternative channels for communication); Legacy Church, Inc. v. 2020) (find ing that New Mexico's order was \"reasonably related to the demands of the public health crisis\" and that, even if the order \"was subject to a strict scrutiny analysis, the Court would conclude that it meets strict scrutiny\"). Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 21 of 23 PageID #: 32622 II. Remaining Factors While the likelihood of success on the merits is the most important of the four factors used in evaluating a motion for a te mporary restraining order, I will touch on the remaining factors briefly. First, I consider the potential irreparabl e harm to the Plaintiff if I decline to enter a temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of the Gathering Orders. Importantly, as the Plaintiff made clear in the telephonic conference of counsel, the relief that it is seeking in this litigation is to be treated in the same fashion as an essential business. In its supplemental filing, the Plaintiff stated that Calvary Chapel is approximately 10,000 square feet. Mihet De cl. \u00b6 6. Essential businesses of that size that are open to the public may only have 15 people inside at one time. See Executive Order 28 at 4. Accordingly, the harm to Calva ry Chapel if no injunction issues is that it will only be able to hold in-person servic es for ten participants rather than fifteen participants. This harm is further undercut by the availability of alternate ways to congregate in the form of \"drive-in, stay -in-your-vehicle church services.\" Next, I consider the bala nce of the relevant impositio ns. The hardship to the Plaintiff outlined above must be balanced against the hardship to the State if the temporary restraining order is entered. The harm to the State that would come from an order requiring it to exempt religious in stitutions from gathering restrictions is profound. If the prevalence of COVID-19 pulses up within a community, it puts lives, and particularly the lives of our most vuln erable citizens and the health care workers trying to save them, at risk. It also th reatens the precarious steps we are making toward reopening. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 27 Filed 05/09/20 Page 22 of 23 PageID #: 32723 Finally, I consider the effec t of my ruling on the public interest. The State is managing an extraordinary array of issues, and it has responded to the challenges raised by COVID-19 by establishing uniform standards and restrictions that are based on evolving scientific evidence. Governor Mills has laid out a path for organizations to seek to ease restrictions . Upsetting the carefu l balance being drawn by Maine's Governor at this time would have an adverse effect on the public interest. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES the Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order.

Janet T. Gannam, it please the Court.8 Roger Gannam for the appellant. And I would like to9 reserve three minutes for rebuttal. 10 HON. HOWARD: Yes.11 MR. GANNAM: The Court should reverse12 the district court's denial of the preliminary13 injunction because the governor's orders --14 HON. SELYA: Mr. Gannam, excuse me.15 There is no denial of a preliminary injunction.16 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor brings up the17 jurisdictional issue which I plan to cover at the18 front.19 HON. SELYA: Well, yes, but I'd20 appreciate your using the correct terminology. There21 was a denial only of a temporary restraining order.22 MR. GANNAM: Thank you, Your Honor.23 HON. SELYA: And you were notified that24 the jurisdictional issue was going to be on the agenda25 for these arguments. All right? And I suggest thatPage 4 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 you get to it sooner rather than later because, in my 2 view at least, it is a very serious issue.3 MR. GANNAM: Thank you, Your Honor.4 We believe that the district court's5 denial of a temporary restraining order is tantamount6 to the denial of a preliminary injunction under this7 Court's decision in Fideicomiso De La Tierra and the8 decision that it cites, the Levesque case, the earlier9 decision from this Court. And in Levesque -- 10 HON. SELYA: But in both -- excuse me.11 In both of those cases, there was an adversarial12 hearing before the district court. We had a record.13 We had a district court making rulings based on14 documents that were produced, et cetera, in a15 courtroom. Here, we have a TRO that is granted, as I16 understand it, on the basis of a telephone conference.17 And we don't even have, never mind a record, we don't18 even have a transcript of that telephone conference.19 Is that correct?20 MR. GANNAM: I do not know about the21 transcript, Your Honor, but it is --22 HON. SELYA: Well, it's none that I can23 find in the record. Did counsel ever ask to have one24 prepared?25 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, we did notPage 5 Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 request one. And -- 2 HON. SELYA: All right. So how can you3 say our case is talking terms of a TRO can sometimes4 qualify as a preliminary injunction if there has been5 a full and fair adversarial proceeding at the TRO6 stage? That doesn't sound to me like a telephone7 conference with no witnesses, no exhibits and no8 transcript.9 MR. GANNAM: Well, Your Honor, the 10 Fideicomiso De La Tierra case, which I'll call the11 land trust case, makes it clear that it's -- the test12 is an either or. Either there's a full adversary13 hearing or the rec -- in the absence of review further14 interlocutory relief is unavailable. And what the15 Levesque case held --16 HON. SELYA: So let's talk about that.17 Why is further interlocutory review unavailable? Did18 Judge Torresen say anything to indicate that she was19 not open to a hearing at the preliminary injunction20 stage to making independent rulings on a preliminary21 injunction motion as a district court would ordinarily22 do? Did she say anything like, and these rulings will23 carry through all pretrial proceedings, something of24 that sort?25 MR. GANNAM: No, Your Honor. But IPage 6 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 believe that -- 2 HON. SELYA: And -- excuse me, counsel.3 And in your experience with judges, don't you think4 that judges sometimes, just sometimes, are swayed by5 evidence and witnesses?6 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor --7 HON. SELYA: So don't you think --8 don't you think it's fair for us to think that it may9 very well have made a difference to Judge Torresen had 10 there been a preliminary injunction hearing and11 someone had actually brought in some evidence, some12 live witnesses, some information about the size of13 your facility, what the situation was with respect to14 whether or not drive-in worship was feasible, a15 list -- I started to make a list of the possible16 questions that you might have evidentiary submissions17 on. And I stopped when I got past 40. But don't you18 think that might have been helpful to a judge in19 deciding these weighty issues?20 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, if I may21 recount what happened here. After the initial motion22 for a TRO was filed, the judge convened a telephone23 conference and instructed the parties -- counsel for24 the parties to explore the narrowing of issues. And25 the declaration of my colleague, Mr. Mihet, which isPage 7 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 in the record, details those discussions and the 2 issues considered. Then the district court allowed3 the briefing to be concluded and issued a 23-page4 order analyzing --5 HON. SELYA: All of that occurred over6 what time span?7 MR. GANNAM: That occurred over -- it8 was approximately two weeks, Your Honor, something in9 that time frame. 10 HON. SELYA: I thought it was shorter11 than that. But go ahead.12 MR. GANNAM: And I could be corrected13 on that, Your Honor. But I think -14 HON. SELYA: I thought it was under a15 week. But go ahead.16 MR. GANNAM: I think what's important17 here is that the TRO standard and the preliminary18 injunction standard are essentially the same. And19 under the circumstances where the district court20 analyzes the issues and the cases and issues a21 reasoned and lengthy order, like happened here, those22 were the circumstances in the Levesque case where the23 Court said having issued a decision on the merits that24 takes into account all the case law, there's no reason25 to think that the same plaintiff could go back to thePage 8 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 same court and seek relief that had already been 2 denied.3 HON. SELYA: But -- excuse me. But4 Judge Gignoux in Levesque had evidence in front of him5 and did make a ruling on the dispositive issue and6 made it very clear that he was going to stick by that7 ruling. You don't have anything like that here. You8 want us --9 MR. GANNAM: We have -- 10 HON. SELYA: You want us to adopt a11 rule that says any time a district judge decides a TRO12 in a reasoned decision regardless of what that13 decision is based on, regardless of whether there's14 been any sort of adversary proceeding, that we should15 treat that for appeal purposes like a preliminary16 injunction and ignore the distinction that 28 U.S.C.17 1292(a) makes. And I'm not aware of any case that18 holds us or that encourages that sort of compressed19 procedure.20 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, I believe the21 land trust case and Levesque itself both contemplate22 either a full adversary proceeding or circumstances23 such as a lengthy order, like the circumstances in24 this case, where there's a clear indication there25 won't be any change in the decision. And as I saidPage 9 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 before, -- 2 HON. SELYA: What's the clear -- excuse3 me. What's --4 HON. BARRON: Could I --5 HON. SELYA: I missed that. What's the6 clear indication there won't be a change in this case?7 MR. GANNAM: Because the standard for a8 PI --9 HON. SELYA: Yeah. But the evidence -- 10 the evidence --11 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, we have a --12 HON. SELYA: You don't concede that13 evidence may make a difference?14 MR. GANNAM: Well, Your Honor, I15 believe evidence does make a difference. And I also16 would point out we have a verified complaint and we17 have affidavits -- declarations filed by the18 government in this case. So we do have an evidentiary19 record that the district court looked at and relied on20 in reaching the TRO denial.21 And I would also point out that we22 filed a motion for injunction pending appeal in the23 district court which was also denied, again, on the24 same standard as the TRO and the preliminary25 injunction.Page 10 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 So we believe here all indicators, all 2 reasonable indicators, are that the district court3 would not reach another decision on the same issue to4 give us the same relief we've essentially already5 requested and been denied.6 HON. BARRON: What are we to make of --7 in relation to this threshold question, the pretty8 emphatic statements from the district court in9 rejecting the free exercise clause challenge that it's 10 plainly not -- that it's plainly neutral? There's11 nothing about that aspect of the analysis suggests to12 me that further factual development is likely to13 affect her determination on that score.14 MR. GANNAM: I would agree with that,15 Your Honor. And that's why I believe that under the16 same standard, the district court would not reach a17 different decision which justifies under this Court's18 precedence an immediate appeal to this --19 HON. BARRON: Do you know what we're20 supposed to do in a situation in which certain of her21 judgments which are unfavorable to you might seem more22 susceptible of being influenced by further factual23 development and other ones do not?24 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, I believe25 under the preliminary injunction standard being aPage 11 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 likelihood of success on the merits based on the 2 evidence that is currently before the Court, I think3 that the --4 HON. BARRON: Could you pick out those5 statements of hers that seem categorical and say that6 part of it surmise for our review but the other7 portions of it that seem more maybe susceptible of8 changing if further factual, those you can't get9 review on now? I'm just not sure how we're supposed 10 to proceed when the opinion is based on that limited a11 factual record done that quickly and it has parts of12 it which, I agree with you, do sound like they're just13 pure legal determinations about the face of the order14 and whether it sounds in neutrality and it rejects15 your contention and there's nothing that seems like16 factual at all is going to change that. Then there's17 the Jacobson analysis which seems like it might well18 depend on what expert evidence is put forward.19 MR. GANNAM: Well, Your Honor, I would20 say that the standard of review on a preliminary21 injunction case involving the First Amendment is a22 little different than in other contexts where the --23 as we've quoted in our briefs, the court --24 HON. BARRON: I'm asking what we're25 supposed to do with respect to Judge Selya's questionPage 12 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 about whether we have something here you can appeal 2 given that it's a TRO. You say if it's like a3 preliminary injunction then you can appeal it. That's4 obviously correct. So is this like a preliminary5 injunction? Well, the record in the proceedings don't6 make it look like one. Nonetheless, there are, at7 least in my view, some relatively categorical8 statements of law that do sound like you would lose if9 it was now a preliminary injunction. But other 10 aspects of it are much more fact dependent just in11 their nature. So what does that mean with respect to12 whether you have an appealable order here?13 MR. GANNAM: Well, Your Honor, I would14 answer that we have a -- essentially, a facial15 challenge to the language of the orders and the16 disparate treatment that those orders impose on17 religious exercise. And so to the extent our18 challenge is on the face of the orders, I don't19 believe there's any further factual development that20 can assist the Court --21 HON. SELYA: Counsel, you've confused22 me. You keep talking about those orders. I thought23 there was a single order challenged at the TRO stage.24 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, the governor25 issued a series of orders beginning --Page 13 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 HON. SELYA: I know that. But what was 2 before the Court at the TRO stage?3 MR. GANNAM: At the TRO stage, we have4 the emergency declaration itself which enables all --5 HON. SELYA: Right.6 MR. GANNAM: -- all substantive orders.7 SELYA: Got it.8 MR. GANNAM: We have the initial9 gathering order which prohibited religious gatherings. 10 A subsequent order that expanded -- you know, imposed11 the exemption, something like 40 categories of --12 HON. SELYA: That was before the Court13 at preliminary -- at the TRO stage?14 MR. GANNAM: Yes, Your Honor. And also15 the stay-at-home order which succeeded that which we16 believe, on its face, reimposed an absolute ban on17 worship because it said you could only leave your18 house to do an essential business or operation. And19 religious worship was not included in that.20 So all of those orders were before the21 Court as well as the order looking forward at the time22 of the TRO hearing -- or the TRO briefing saying when23 churches might reopen for purposes of parking lot24 services. But at the time we were before the district25 court, the best that can be said is that 10 peoplePage 14 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 could worship in person. But we believe at that time 2 it was actually banned altogether based on the3 stay-at-home order and the fact there had been no4 subsequent relief from that.5 As we sit here today, we still have the6 stay-at-home order, the initial gathering restriction.7 They're only changed by the governor's delegation of a8 power to (indiscernible) and seek to adjust what kind9 of businesses and operations can reopen. And so we 10 have a constantly shifting number of people who are --11 HON. BARRON: The gathering order12 that's before us is the 10-person gathering order or13 is it the 50-person gathering order?14 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, it's -- the15 50-perseon limit was only allowed by the earlier16 orders. I'd go back to Order 49, the implement to17 restart --18 HON. BARRON: Just in terms of -- you19 sought a temporary restraining order against certain20 orders. Right?21 MR. GANNAM: Yes, Your Honor.22 HON. BARRON: What you sought to23 restrain was a 10-person gathering order and a24 stay-at-home order?25 MR. GANNAM: 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 Honor. 2 HON. BARRON: Is there any -- the3 50-person gathering order was not something you sought4 to restrain, correct?5 MR. GANNAM: Yes and no, Your Honor.6 Yes, because we challenged the order that allowed that7 50-person limit to be imposed in the future. And it's8 the same order that would allow the governor now to9 back off of that and take it back down to ten or zero. 10 HON. BARRON: And so what -- emergency11 authorization order? Declaration of emergency order?12 Is that what you're talking about?13 MR. GANNAM: No. The Order 49 which14 adopted the restarting Maine's economy plan which15 essentially opens up all of these decisions to sort of16 cabinet level agencies or the governor, how ever the17 governor wants to proceed. But they are constantly18 changing. As we pointed out in our reply brief,19 there's already now a really inefficient --20 HON. BARRON: Did the district court21 address that challenge to that order?22 MR. GANNAM: I'm sorry. I didn't hear23 you, Your Honor.24 HON. BARRON: Did the district court25 separately address your challenge to that order?Page 16 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 MR. GANNAM: I don't believe the 2 district separated them out, Your Honor. The district3 court analyzed them sort of as a unit imposing either4 a 10-person or absolute ban on worship. The 50-person5 limit did not exist yet when we were in the district6 court.7 HON. BARRON: Okay. So and what you're8 appealing from is an order that denied your attempt to9 get the 10-person and/or stay-at-home ban restrained, 10 correct?11 MR. GANNAM: Yes, Your Honor. But also12 before the district court was our claim that any order13 that treats on its face religious conduct differently14 from nonreligious conduct was also being challenged.15 So it was forward-looking as well because we have the16 exact situation that we have here. The restarting17 Maine's economy plan is a constantly shifting series18 of restrictions and then relaxed restrictions and the19 reimposition of restrictions. That's what's going on.20 And so, all of it as a unit are the governor's orders21 that we're challenging to the extent they disparately22 treat religious conduct as compared to nonreligious23 conduct under the free exercise clause.24 HON. HOWARD: Counsel, before you25 proceed, let me ask. Judge Selya, Judge Barron, doPage 17 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 you have other questions that you would like to get 2 to?3 HON. SELYA: No. That's all.4 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, we pointed in5 our briefs all the reasons --6 HON. HOWARD: Counsel, I'm going to go7 ahead and cut you off there. We've run considerably8 over time. But you have reserved some time for9 rebuttal. 10 MR. GANNAM: Thank you, Your Honor.11 HON. HOWARD: So if you would mute.12 And, Mr. Taub, you may proceed.13 MR. TAUB: Good morning and may it14 please the Court.15 Since the Court is clearly interested16 in this issue of the appealability of the order below,17 I'll start with addressing that. And this is probably18 the only thing that the parties can agree upon in this19 case which is that we think that this order is20 appealable. And there are a couple different points21 that I want to make about that.22 The first point is that the Court, if23 it wants to, doesn't even have to get to the issue of24 whether the order is appealable or not because, under25 Clair International v. Mercedes Benz, there, thisPage 18 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 Court said that it doesn't have to get to 2 jurisdictional issues if the appeal is uncomplicated3 and easily resolved in favor of the party who would4 benefit from a finding of no jurisdiction. So that is5 certainly one avenue that the Court could take.6 But --7 HON. SELYA: But was that word8 uncomplicated?9 MR. TAUB: Uncomplicated, yes, Your 10 Honor.11 HON. SELYA: I thought that was it.12 MR. TAUB: But going to the issue of13 sort of what happened below, for all intents and14 purposes, this case proceeded just like a host of15 other cases that are resolved on PI motions that our16 office is involved in and really got resolved exactly17 the same way the Bayley's Campground case got18 resolved, just on a more expedited fashion.19 But in this case, Calvary, when they20 filed their motion, it was actually a motion for both21 a PI and a TRO. It was combined. And so, the Court22 ordered us to respond to it. We submitted23 declarations. I believe Calvary submitted24 declarations. At least from our perspective, you25 know, we assumed that we were briefing a PI motionPage 19 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 since this wasn't being done on an ex parte basis 2 since the Court had invited us to respond. So we3 submitted declarations. We submitted a brief. And4 so, in our mind at least, we understood that this was5 a PI motion.6 Now also the Court's decision goes well7 beyond what you would expect from a typical TRO order.8 The Court went through all of the different legal and9 factual issues, wrote a 23-page decision. 10 HON. HOWARD: But can I ask you11 something about that, counsel? So what I've been hung12 up on a little bit is not the merits claim but the13 serious or irreparable harm claim. So the complaint14 said they may be subjected to criminal prosecution.15 And I suppose that's all that was in front of the16 district court. But if time went on and there were a17 preliminary injunction proceeding, whether they needed18 to amend or not, it seems to me that that's the kind19 of thing that would be subject to evidence. Am I20 wrong about that? And you really could have, I think,21 a shifting landscape there. So I'm with Judge Selya.22 I'm not so sure we should be so quick to jump into23 this. I'm -- but you tell me.24 MR. TAUB: Well, I mean, I think in25 this case, I mean, yes, there was no evidentiaryPage 20 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 hearing although my recollection is that no party 2 requested one either. I don't think that that was3 ever foreclosed. But what the parties did do is they4 submitted declarations which, at least in the District5 of Maine, it's pretty rare for there to be evidentiary6 hearings on a preliminary injunction motion. So I7 think --8 HON. SELYA: Is it rare for there to be9 transcripts and arguments? 10 MR. TAUB: Well, I don't believe that11 there was an argument in this case. I think that the12 only telephone conference we had -- and again, my13 memory is sort of going back and a lot's happened14 since then. But my memory is that the telephone15 conference was really about seeing if the parties16 could resolve the matter and then also sort of setting17 up a briefing schedule. There was never any oral18 argument. And my memory is there wasn't any oral19 argument on the Bayley Campground case either. You20 know, it's not unusual if no party requests it, for21 the District of Maine at least, to decide preliminary22 injunction motions just based on the briefs and the23 declarations.24 HON. SELYA: Yes. Of course, the25 district court didn't decide a preliminary injunctionPage 21 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 motion here. 2 MR. TAUB: Right. So --3 HON. SELYA: And it's a big difference4 because a TRO, by statute and rule, could only have5 lasted for 10 days. It's just a stop cap.6 MR. TAUB: Right, Your Honor. So I7 guess there are a couple of things I'd like to say8 about that. First, I think that the standard is -- or9 the test that's applied is whether the order has the 10 practical effect of refusing an injunction, whether it11 might have serious or perhaps irreparable consequence12 and whether the order can be effectively challenged13 only by an immediate appeal. And so, I think that14 those elements are probably met here. I mean, for all15 intents and purposes --16 HON. SELYA: Why? What barrier was17 there to -- if there was some barrier to a preliminary18 injunction hearing, I could understand that. But what19 barrier was there?20 MR. TAUB: Well, there was no21 barrier --22 HON. SELYA: I mean, instead of -- you23 could have used the same time you spent sparring about24 an injunction pending appeal to -- the district court25 is obligated to convene a preliminary injunctionPage 22 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 hearing within 10 days. No one asked her to do it. 2 HON. BARRON: But you're suggesting3 that it's because no one thought there was any reason4 to do it since it had already been done. Is that my5 understanding?6 MR. TAUB: I think -- yeah. I mean,7 Your Honor, again, I go back to absolutely -- Judge8 Torresen's order is captioned as an order on a TRO.9 But I -- 10 HON. SELYA: Yes. And it makes it11 clear from its body and from the order that was12 entered that all that she did was deny the TRO.13 MR. TAUB: Right. And the other thing14 we have, of course, is that -- is that Calvary15 appealed like literally hours after she issued it. So16 we don't know --17 HON. SELYA: That's right.18 MR. TAUB: -- whether she was going to19 issue some further order.20 But I think at least the parties21 understood that they were involved in a preliminary22 injunction proceeding. And I guess -- and part of the23 reason that we are taking this position is that we24 understood that what we were doing was preliminary25 injunction briefing. And so we went all out over thePage 23 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 course of a few days to develop all of the evidence, 2 put together the declarations, write up a brief and3 submit it to the district court. And then she issued4 her decision, she analyzed all the issues and the5 Calvary Chapel didn't ask for some further preliminary6 injunction hearing. They immediately appealed.7 And so, in our view, where the parties8 are really treating this as a preliminary injunction9 matter -- and also, I think if you read her opinion 10 fairly, I don't think there are any set of facts that11 would come forward that would really, you know, change12 her ultimate conclusion.13 So I would say that in these14 circumstances, this really was effectively -- despite15 what it was captioned as, this really was an order on16 a preliminary injunction and there really wasn't17 anything left to do in the district court with respect18 to preliminary relief.19 HON. BARRON: You want to just talk20 about the merits?21 MR. TAUB: Sure. So --22 HON. BARRON: Could you explain to me23 what orders you understand that are before us and how24 we're supposed to think about it?25 MR. TAUB: Yes. So let me just startPage 24 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 by saying -- because I just want to sort of address 2 some of the appellant's suggestions in their brief.3 The state of Maine understands how4 important religion is in many people's lives. And5 beyond being important from a spiritual aspect, it's6 also important from a constitutional perspective. And7 we understand that religion has special protection8 under the First Amendment. And so we don't take that9 lightly. But at the same time, the state was facing 10 an unprecedented pandemic and so we had to balance11 that interest in protecting religious freedom against12 the health and safety of Maine's people.13 To answer your question, Judge Barron,14 so the only -- so, first of all, in my view, and I15 think if you look at the complaint and if you look at16 the PI briefing and if you look at the judge's order,17 there's nothing to suggest that the plaintiffs were18 ever arguing that people are prohibited from leaving19 home to attend religious services. That is really an20 argument that they have developed since the21 preliminary injunction proceedings. And it's an22 argument that's just completely factually wrong. I23 mean, yes, the order about staying at home is a little24 ambiguous but we have repeatedly and unequivocally25 said that we consider attending worship services to bePage 25 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 an essential activity and it's one that people can 2 leave home to do.3 So, first of all, I just want to point4 out that this argument that they were also challenging5 a stay-at-home order, I think if you look at the6 complaint and you look at the briefing, you look at7 the order, you're not going to see that.8 But I think sort of the trickier9 question -- and this is a question that I thought a 10 lot about; I'm not sure I have a good answer -- is11 whether at this point the issue is the 50-person12 restriction or the 10-person restriction. And I think13 what I would say to that is this case is a little14 different than the Bayley Campground case where we had15 a fundamental shift in the nature of the restriction.16 Here, really, all we had was an increase in the17 numbers. So we went from 10-person indoor gatherings18 to 50-person indoor gatherings. And in our view, that19 doesn't really affect any of the analysis of the case.20 So we don't think whether it's 10 or 50 --21 HON. BARRON: Well, just humor me,22 though. Which order is it that's being chall --23 suppose -- are we going to restrain -- we're going to24 issue a restraining order. What is restrained?25 MR. TAUB: Well, I mean, the orderPage 26 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 that's in front of the Court is the 10-person 2 gathering restriction.3 HON. BARRON: Ten. Okay.4 HON. SELYA: Which is no longer in5 effect.6 MR. TAUB: Which is no longer in7 effect. And, you know, that's why -- and I recognize8 there's some tension between the position that we're9 taking here and the position that we're taking in the 10 Bayley's case where we're arguing that it's moot; I11 definitely recognize that. But I think the reason12 that that tension is resolved to some extent is,13 again, whether it's 10 or 50 people doesn't really go14 to the Court's evaluation of the case. But you're15 absolutely right, Your Honor. I think if you were to16 issue a decision and you were to enjoin an order, it17 would be the 10-person order that you would be18 enjoining.19 HON. BARRON: With respect to that20 10-person order then, could you just -- for purposes21 of trying to figure out neutrality contention and22 whether this is a generally applicable law neutral23 with respect to religion. As I read the stay-at-home24 order as you describe it and the 10-person gathering25 order, what are the activities that are notPage 27 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 202-803-88301 that 2 MR. TAUB: Well, so --3 HON. BARRON: Almost all of the4 gatherings are swamped by the stay-at-home order. So5 if I understand that all that's left are those6 gatherings that are essential activities that are not7 employment-related -- is that right? Is that what's8 permitted?9 MR. TAUB: Right. So under the 10 stay-at-home order, you can leave home to either work11 at an essential business and operation or to engage in12 an essential activity.13 HON. BARRON: Okay. And what are14 essential activities? You say going to church is one.15 MR. TAUB: Right. So the way the order16 is phrased is it sort of gives kind of a definition of17 what is an essential activity. And then it sort of18 gives specific --19 HON. BARRON: As your understanding is,20 church -- going to church services are treated the21 same way as what?22 MR. TAUB: So --23 HON. BARRON: Other essential24 TAUB: would that 28 Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 treated the same way as obtaining medical or mental 2 health services because we equate spiritual health or3 spiritual well-being as being roughly equivalent to4 physical and emotional health.5 HON. SELYA: But the exception to which6 you point doesn't make any mention of religious7 attendance as such.8 MR. TAUB: Right. I mean, Your9 Honor -- 10 HON. SELYA: You've got to read between11 the lines to get to where you want us to get.12 MR. TAUB: Yes. You know, I mean, Your13 Honor, these orders are being put together as the14 conditions are evolving. And so, yes, it is somewhat15 ambiguous about whether or not going to church or16 religious service is what we consider an essential17 activity. But I think the important thing is that18 both -- the attorney general's office has19 affirmatively stated to this Court that as we20 interpret it, it includes going to religious services.21 And I think our interpretation -- I think this Court22 has historically given our interpretation considerable23 deference.24 But the other thing that I can tell you25 is that even if you think that our interpretationPage 29 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 isn't a reasonable one, I can affirmatively state that 2 there is no threat of enforcement. The state is not3 going to enforce the stay-at-home order for someone4 who leaves home to attend religious services. So to5 that extent, there's not even really any case or6 controversy because there's no threat of prosecution.7 I can't say it any more clearly. People may leave8 home to attend religious services.9 HON. BARRON: So then can you just run 10 through the -- so from your perspective, what we are11 faced with is an order that imposes a gathering12 restriction on nonemployment activities of a13 relatively limited class that includes religious14 worship. And that includes, what, going to a doctor,15 going to a therapist or going to a church? Is that16 about it?17 MR. TAUB: Well, so I will say that --18 I mean, I'm just pulling up the order. But there are19 a host of activities that are included in being -- so,20 for instance, going grocery shopping, obtaining21 medicines --22 HON. BARRON: I see.23 MR. TAUB: -- engaging in outdoor24 exercise. I think getting - you know, getting25 staples. I mean there are all kinds of things thatPage 30 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 are considered essential activities. And so -- I 2 don't have the order right in front of me --3 HON. BARRON: None of those are4 employment-related?5 MR. TAUB: Right. Those are completely6 separate from -- so, for example, you can leave your7 home to go take a run on the Back Bay path. Or you8 can leave your home to, I mean, go grocery shopping9 even though you're not actually working at the grocery 10 store.11 HON. BARRON: But for all those12 activities, the gathering restriction kicks in.13 MR. TAUB: Right. The gathering14 restriction is still on top of it. So, for example --15 HON. BARRON: Got it.16 MR. TAUB: -- you could leave home to17 exercise but you can't exercise -- at least at the18 time, you couldn't exercise in a group of more than 1019 people.20 HON. BARRON: One last question. Does21 the gathering restriction kick in to22 employment-related activities? So if I wanted to have23 a barbecue for all the law clerks of the First Circuit24 during office hours, would I be able to do that or not25 able to do that under the gathering restriction?Page 31 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 MR. TAUB: I mean, so to make sure I 2 understand, so if you wanted to have an in-office3 gathering of court staff --4 HON. BARRON: Correct.5 MR. TAUB: Yeah. So --6 HON. BARRON: For social purposes but7 we're all employees and it's part of your job-related8 function. Is that --9 MR. TAUB: I mean -- 10 HON. BARRON: -- permitted or not11 permitted?12 MR. TAUB: So these orders are13 interpreted by different agencies in the state of14 Maine. And that particular issue, as far as I know,15 hasn't come up. But at least in my view, that would16 be considered a gathering because the point of the17 gathering is -- and I just want to step back a second18 because I think there's maybe a little bit of19 confusion.20 If 50 people are in a grocery store all21 at the same time, that's not considered a gathering.22 That's a completely different set of restrictions23 which applies to how many customers can be in a retail24 operation at a specific time. So what the gathering25 restriction applies to is it applies to sort ofPage 32 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 communal events where people are gathering together 2 for some communal purpose and are standing together3 for that period of time. So while certainly your4 court staff can come work at the court, if you wanted5 to, you know, go in the conference room and have a6 gathering of 50 people and, you know, have sort of a7 social gathering, that would be considered a gathering8 and that would fall within the restrictions.9 Does that answer your question, Your 10 Honor?11 HON. BARRON: Yeah. I guess I'm12 just -- are you saying that is Maine's position or13 that's your view of what might --14 MR. TAUB: Yeah. I mean, I'm not the15 final interpreter of these orders. I mean, they're16 issued by the governor so ultimately it's the17 executive branch that has to interpret these. But I'm18 fairly certain -- I think I can say with pretty good19 certainty -- that basically a party at a place of20 business would be considered a gathering. I mean, it21 wouldn't make any sense to say that everyone could go22 outside to, you know, some park and have the party23 because that clearly would be a gathering. To say24 that you can't do that but it's fine as long as you do25 it within a courthouse conference room? So I thinkPage 33 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 I'm reasonably confident in saying that sort of a 2 social gathering within a business operation would be3 subject to the gathering restrictions.4 HON. HOWARD: Can you gather the 505 employees to give them their instructions for the day?6 Like police departments do with roll calls?7 MR. TAUB: Yeah. I don't -- I don't8 think that would be considered a gathering. I think9 that would just be considered part of sort of the 10 normal employment operations.11 HON. HOWARD: Can you include 1512 minutes of a morale boost or five minutes of a morale13 boost during that gathering -- during that -- sorry.14 I used the wrong word. But --15 MR. TAUB: Yeah. I mean, I was afraid16 this would happen because there are hypotheticals that17 are difficult to address. You know, we are constantly18 --19 HON. HOWARD: I'm just asking you if20 they have been addressed, if you have a --21 MR. TAUB: No.22 HON. HOWARD: -- position on them.23 MR. TAUB: No. As far as I know, they24 haven't. I mean, these always don't come to the25 attorney general's office to sometimes decide it.Page 34 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 But I think sort of the point I want to 2 make also is that this isn't just semantics in terms3 of what's considered a gathering and sort of what's4 considered something else like shopping at a store.5 We presented evidence there's a fundamental difference6 between sort of social and communal gatherings as7 opposed to someone going to a grocery store. And I8 think this has really hit home. And I think it's fair9 to take judicial notice of this because -- 10 HON. HOWARD: Yeah. But you're walking11 away from the closed question that you were asked.12 MR. TAUB: Okay. Well -- and I'm13 sorry, Your Honor. If you want to ask it again.14 HON. BARRON: Before you -- what I'm15 trying to -- as I understand it, there's two different16 components to the inquiry on the free exercise.17 There's the first question of whether we have a law of18 general applicability. And then there's a second19 question of what follows if we don't. If we do have a20 law of general applicability, as I understand it, and21 the state's in a very strong position, and I think22 there's sometimes been a confusion around how much of23 a justification you have to have for a law of general24 applicability. So I'm really trying to get at whether25 you have a law of general applicability. If thePage 35 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 gathering restriction applied even in businesses, that 2 certainly would support the idea that it's a law of3 general applicability. If it does not, and it sounds4 like maybe we have to assume it does not, the next5 question is, is it nonetheless a law of general6 applicability, and, if so, why? And as I understand7 it, your earlier answers to me were suggesting that8 there's a basic divide between the treatment of9 employment-related activities and 10 nonemployment-related activities. And so long as11 you're engaged in a nonemployment-related activity,12 the gathering restriction may apply to you. To the13 extent it doesn't apply to others, it's because14 they're employment-related activities all of which are15 treated differently. And I take it you say that's16 just a neutral criteria and for distinction.17 MR. TAUB: Yes. So I do want to make18 sure I'm answering the Court's question because I'm19 not trying to walk away from anything.20 First of all, it's neutrally applicable21 because it applies to all gatherings of any sort. So22 that's just point one.23 Now point two --24 HON. BARRON: Except for employment.25 MR. TAUB: Well, the hypothetical thatPage 36 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 you gave, Judge Barron, of sort of an office party, as 2 I said, I am almost positive that that would be3 considering a gathering. Now --4 HON. BARRON: Yeah. But just humor me5 for a moment. Let's say because that's unclear, we6 have to assume that there's an exception for7 gatherings in employment settings if all employment8 settings are treated differently than all9 nonemployment settings. If that were so and the 10 gathering restriction applied only to nonemployment11 settings, would it still be a law of general12 applicability?13 MR. TAUB: Yes, it would, Your Honor,14 because it still applies to all manner of gatherings.15 And I think there's a distinction between a gathering16 in an employment context versus other kinds of17 gatherings.18 HON. SELYA: But it doesn't apply to a19 gathering -- it doesn't apply, for example, if you've20 got 75 people inside a supermarket shopping.21 MR. TAUB: And that's because --22 HON. SELYA: Those people --23 MR. TAUB: I'm sorry.24 HON. SELYA: Those people aren't25 engaged in their own employment.Page 37 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 MR. TAUB: Right. And that's because 2 that's not a gathering. And I recognize these terms3 are a little difficult to wrap our arms around. But a4 gathering is something like a wedding, a funeral, a5 concert, a parade where everyone is going for a period6 of time and sort of they're engaged in a communal7 experience. And as Dr. Shah pointed out, there's a8 much different level of risk associated with that kind9 of activity than someone passing someone in the 10 grocery store and saying hi and maybe stopping to chat11 for a few minutes.12 And I think, you know, it's been widely13 reported in the news and I think the Court's probably14 already aware of this, that we had a wedding, which is15 another kind of gathering, in Millinocket with just 6516 people and we're now dealing with over 150 cases --17 HON. HOWARD: Well, I think you're18 getting outside the record.19 HON. SELYA: Yeah.20 MR. TAUB: And just to point out, Your21 Honor, I think the appellants in their brief did point22 to some news articles as well. But point taken.23 HON. HOWARD: So, Judge Selya,24 additional questions of Mr. Taub?25 HON. SELYA: No.Page 38 Legal 202-803-88301 HON. HOWARD: Judge Barron? 2 HON. BARRON: No. I think I'm okay.3 HON. HOWARD: All right. Thank you.4 MR. TAUB: Thank you, Your Honors.5 HON. HOWARD: Mr. Gannam, I believe you6 have reserved three minutes?7 So you'll need to unmute your mic and8 your video.9 THE COURT REPORTER: Judge, it's Dan. 10 He had indicated that he was having a lag when he did11 this and sometimes it takes a minute to clear.12 HON. HOWARD: All right. Mr. Gannam?13 MR. GANNAM: Thank you, Your Honor.14 I want to turn to the merits here and15 point out that the biggest problem that Maine has with16 the general applicability issue is what I'll call the17 same building problem.18 On the face of the orders that we've19 challenged, which we put in paragraph 50 of our20 complaint, which was all of them up to that point in21 time, on the face of those orders, a church can -- it22 was prohibited from worship or, at best, could have23 worship with 10 people in its building. But in the24 same building could host an unlimited number of people25 for providing food, providing shelter, providingPage 39 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 social services such job counseling, drug counseling, 2 whatever the case may be. So in the very same3 building, a church could host an unlimited number of4 people --5 HON. BARRON: Why is that the right6 test for whether it's a law of general applicability?7 As I understand the orders, there is a divide between8 the way employment-related activities are treated and9 nonemployment-related activities. Now why is -- 10 divide itself a neutral one with respect to religion?11 I don't follow.12 MR. GANNAM: I disagree, Your Honor,13 because the essential businesses and operations are14 defined to mean all profit and nonprofit activities15 that are specified in the orders. And it's 4016 something categories. So it's not limited simply to17 employment. We have, for example, the provision of18 social services, nonreligious services, that I've19 pointed out can happen in a church building. But as20 soon as the pastor turns to that same number of people21 in the same building and begins a worship service,22 that would be prohibited under the plain natural23 reading of these orders This issue that --24 HON. BARRON: Because the gathering25 restriction kicks in. Right?Page 40 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 MR. GANNAM: Well, but that's correct, 2 Your Honor. What Lukumi requires --3 HON. BARRON: What distinguishes those4 things that are subject to the gathering restriction5 from those that are not? And as long as that criteria6 is a generally applicable criteria, I don't follow7 what the free exercise challenge is that it's not8 generally applicable. I'm just not getting that.9 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, we disagree 10 that it's generally applicable criteria because the11 same number of people could be assembled for an12 unemployment counseling session, for example, for two13 hours every day of the week, but a one-hour worship14 service for the same people in the same building,15 which that is --16 HON. BARRON: That's not an argument17 that it's not generally applicable. That's just an18 argument you think there's no sense to the19 distinction.20 MR. GANNAM: Well, no. I think --21 HON. BARRON: The first question to ask22 is, is there is a distinction that's being drawn on a23 generally applicable basis.24 MR. GANNAM: Well, Your Honor, we don't25 think -- we think where there's --Page 41 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 HON. BARRON: Someone can smoke a 2 cigarette but they can't smoke Peyote. That may make3 no sense that the law banning the Peyote is a neutral4 law.5 MR. GANNAM: So it --6 HON. BARRON: You see what I'm saying?7 That's just not -- you're not answering that aspect of8 the question for me. So just keep -- by continually9 saying that in the same building similar things can 10 happen doesn't address the concern that I'm trying to11 get you to answer.12 MR. GANNAM: Your Honor, I'm trying to13 answer in accordance with the Supreme Court standard14 set forth in Lukumi which says that when the15 government restricts religious conduct but it doesn't16 restrict similarly risky --17 HON. BARRON: It's doesn't name just18 religious conduct because there's a whole category of19 things like religion that are treated similarly to20 religion. So that -- it can't be a Lukumi case.21 MR. GANNAM: Well, I disagree, Your22 Honor, because --23 HON. BARRON: Well, assume it's not a24 Lukumi case. If you want to say it falls into the25 exception for Employment Division v. Smith on thePage 42 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 ground that this is riddled with exceptions, I'm not 2 seeing how that argument works because the criteria3 that divides it seems not to have exception which is a4 criteria that's treating a gathering restriction as5 applicable to this category of things and not some6 other thing. And it's along a line that I don't see7 how that line is riddled with exceptions.8 MR. GANNAM: Well, the point I'm trying9 to make, Your Honor, is sitting in the same room 10 surrounded by 100 other people for a social services11 counseling session is identical conduct to sitting in12 the same room for a worship service but they are13 treated differently under these orders. And14 therefore, even under Employment Division v. Smith,15 which Lukumi simply built on, we have a law that's not16 of general applicability.17 And we would also point out that18 there's also no religious neutrality here because if19 we go back to the original gathering order, religion20 is treated in the same category as social, personal21 and discretionary events. In other words, unimportant22 and so we can stop it whereas, as we see through the23 development of the orders, hundreds of other things in24 these 40 different categories were permitted.25 And I would additionally point out,Page 43 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 Your Honor, that beyond essential businesses and 2 operations, these orders even allow what are3 considered non-essential businesses and operations,4 literally everything else, to meet without restriction5 or to operate without numeric restriction as long as6 its employees are socially distanced from one another.7 So the exceptions are so huge that they8 swallow the rule and we don't have a generally9 applicable set of restrictions because everyone can 10 get out of them except for churches which were11 expressly prohibited in the original gathering order12 for meeting and then subsequently never pulled out13 from that. And Maine's position that going to14 religious worship is the same as going to get medical15 care --16 HON. BARRON: If I want to get 2517 people together for a book club, I can't do that, can18 I?19 MR. GANNAM: I don't believe so, Your20 Honor.21 HON. BARRON: Well, but that's --22 MR. GANNAM: But you could get 2523 people together for a counseling session on how to24 obtain unemployment benefits.25 HON. BARRON: Right. But that doesn'tPage 44 Veritext Legal Solutions 215-241-1000 ~ 610-434-8588 ~ 302-571-0510 ~ 202-803-88301 have -- you're making a point that the criteria is not 2 singling out religion.3 MR. GANNAM: No, Your Honor, because4 the conduct at issue, the conduct that implicates the5 government's interest, which is people being together6 in the same space for a period of time, the conduct is7 identical. It's just one is motivated by religious8 reasons, going to worship, and the other conduct is9 not motivated by religious reasons. 10 But under the Supreme Court standard,11 what we must look at is, is the state allowing things12 of similar risk -- not things that look just the same13 as on the surface but is the state allowing conduct of14 similar risk to worship while restricting worship.15 And if that's the case, it doesn't meet the free16 exercise standard.17 HON. HOWARD: All right. Thank you21 very much. Thank you to both counsel. And we will22 take this case under advisement.23 MR.

In its Prayer for Relief, infra , and in the contemporaneously filed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), Calvary Cha pel seeks a TRO restraining enforcement against Calvary Chapel of the va rious COVID-19 orders issued by Governor Mills and other State officials purporting to prohibit Calvary Chapel, on pain of criminal sanctions, from gathering in- person at Calvary Chapel for worship services, rega rdless of the number of individuals present or whether Calvary Chapel meets or exceeds the so cial distancing and hygiene guidelines pursuant to which the State disparately and discriminatorily allows so- called \" essential \" commercial and non-religious entities ( e.g., liquor stores, marijuana disp ensaries, warehouse clubs, and 'big box' stores) to accommodate large crowds and masses of persons without scrutiny or numerical limit. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 1 of 45 PageID #: 1 2 2. As shown in the verified allegations below, Governor Mills' Executive Orders relating to COVID-19 have been interpreted, applie d, and enforced, including against the pastor of Calvary Chapel, such that Pastor Ken Graves (\"Pastor Graves\") has been forced not to hold in-person religious services at the Church and to prohibit his members from attending their house of worship. 3. At around the same time as Governor Mills' Executive Orders surrounding COVID-19 were being used to threaten criminal sanctions on Calvary Chapel 's pastor, officials in other jurisdictions had similarly threatened to impose criminal sanctions on other religious gatherings. In Louisville, Kentucky, for example, the government threate ned to use police to impose criminal sanctions on those individuals found in violation of similar COVID-19 orders and threatened to impose various sanctions on indivi duals found in violation of such orders. The United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky found that the mere threat of such criminal sanction warranted a TRO. See On Fire Christian Center, Inc. v. Fischer , No. 3:20-cv- 264-JRW, 2020 WL 1820249 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020) [hereinafter On Fire ]. The On Fire TRO enjoined the Mayor of Louisville from \" enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with any prohibition on drive-in church services at On Fire .\" Id. at *1 (emphasis added). 4. In fact, the Maine State Police \u2014acting under the direction of Governor Mills' orders \u2014have publicly declared that they would enforce the Governor's orders and have threatened to impose criminal sanctions on those found in violation of them. 5. Additionally, the Governor of Kansas had imposed a similar restriction on religious gatherings in Kansas, stati ng that \"gatherings\" of more than 10 individuals are prohibited, including religious gatherings. On April 18, 2020, the United States District for the District of Kansas issued a TRO enjoining Kansas officials from enforcing its disc riminatory prohibition on Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 2 of 45 PageID #: 2 3 religious gatherings and required the government to treat \"religious\" worship services the same as other similar gatherings that are permitted. See First Baptist Church. v. Kelly , No. 20-1102-JWB, 2020 WL 1910021, *6 -7 (D. Kan. Apr. 18, 2020) [hereinafter First Baptist ]. The First Baptist TRO specifically stated that the government's dispar ate treatment of religious gatherings was a violation of the Free Exercise Cl ause because it showed that \" religious activities were specifically targeted for more onerous restrictions than comparable secular activities ,\" and that the churches had shown irreparable harm because they would \" be prevented from gathering for worship at their churches \" during the pendency of the executive order. Id. at *7 -8 (emphasis added). 6. In discussing the Kansas orders \u2014which imposed a 10-person limit on in-person gatherings , which is onerous but still not as restrictive as Governor Mills' orders\u2014 the court said that specifically singling out religious gatheri ngs for disparate treatmen t while permitting other non-religious activities \"show[s] that these executive orders expressly target religious gatherings on a broad scale and are, therefore, not facially neutral ,\" First Baptist , 2020 WL 1910021, at *7, and\u2014much like here \u2014\"churches and religious activities ap pear to have been singled out among essential functions for stricter treatment. It appears to be the only essential function whose core purpose \u2014association for the purpose of worship \u2014had been basically eliminated .\" Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the court found that a TRO was necessary and that Kansas should be enjoined from enforcing its orders' disparate terms against churches. Indeed, \" it goes without saying that the government could not lawfully expressly prohibit individuals from meeting together for religious services .\" Id. at *6 (emphasis added). 7. Additionally, the Sixth Circuit of Appeals has issued an Emergency Injunction Pending Appeal prohibiting the Governor from e nforcing prohibitions on religious worship services. See Maryville Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear , -- F.3d --, No. 20-5427, 2020 WL 2111316 Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 3 of 45 PageID #: 3 4 (6th Cir. May 2, 2020). In that appeal challenging orders similar to Governor Mills' orders here, the Sixth Circuit stated that \"[t]he Governor 's actions substantially burden the congregants' sincerely held religious practices \u2014and plainly so . . . . Orders prohibiting religious gatherings, enforced by police officers telling congregants they violated a criminal law and by officers taking down license plate numbers, amount to a significant burden on worship gatherings .\" 2020 WL 2111316, at *2 (emphasis added). Additionally, \"[t]he way the orders treat comparable religious and non-religious activities suggests that they do not amount to the least restrictive way of regulating the churches.\" Id. \"Outright bans on religious activity alone obviously count. So do general bans that cover religious activity wh en there are exceptions for comparable secular activities.\" Id., at *3. In discussing the prohibitions on religious gatherings, the Sixth Circuit posed several questions of equal import here: Assuming all of the same precautions are taken, why is it safe to wait in a car for a liquor store to open but dangerous to w ait in a car to hear morning prayers? Why can someone safely walk down a grocery store aisle but not a pew? And why can someone safely interact with a brave deliverywoman but not with a stoic minister? The Commonwealth has no good a nswers. While the law may take periodic naps during a pandemic, we will not let it sleep through one. Id., at *4 (emphasis added). 8. Because the prohibition on religious gather ings substantially burdened Maryville Baptist's sincerely held religious beliefs and was not the least restrictive means, the Sixth Circuit concluded the plaintiff church and pastor were lik ely to succeed on the meri ts of their free exercise claims as to both in-person and drive-in services. Id., at *2 -3. Balancing the remaining injunction factors, the court issued an injunction pendi ng appeal enjoining the Governor of Kentucky from enforcing his unconstitutional orders against drive-i n services, and directed the district court to prioritize consideration of enjoining in-person services, with the admonition, \"The breadth of the ban on religious services, together with a haven for numerous secular exceptions, should give pause to anyone who prizes religious freedom .\" Id., at *5. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 4 of 45 PageID #: 4 5 9. Calvary Chapel 's members were also threatened with criminal sanctions and penalties if, at any time, any number of individuals gathered together for in-person worship services at Calvary Chapel, and regardless of whether social distancing, enhanced sanitization, and personal hygiene practices were followed. Because of the government threat of criminal sanction, Calvary Chapel was forced not to host services on Easter Sunday, the most treasured day in Christianity. 10. Absent emergency relief from this Court, Calvary Chapel, its pastor, and all congregants will suffer immedia te and irreparable injury from th e threat of criminal prosecution for the mere act of engaging in the free exercise of religion and going to church. Indeed, if Calvary Chapel, its pastor, or its congregan ts do not subscribe to what Governor Mills' has prescribed as orthodox in a worship service, they risk becoming criminals in the State. A temporary restraining should issue. INTRODUCTION 11. Due to the unprecedented nature of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the indisputable health traged y the disease has wrought on our great Republic and those victims suffering under its yoke, there are th ose who may find it \"tempting to hold that First Amendment rights should acquiesce to national security in this instance.\" Tobey v. Jones , 706 F.3d 379, 393 (4th Cir. 2013). One could be forgive n for hastily reaching such a conclusion in such uncertain tim es, but \"our Forefather Benjamin Fra nklin warned against such a temptation by opining that those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" Id. 12. When the great American experiment was first implemented, our revered Founders took pains to note that the Constitution \u2014and all of the rights it recognized and enshrined \u2014was instituted \"in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 5 of 45 PageID #: 5 6 provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity .\" U.S. Const. Pmbl. (emphasis added). To this very day, \"we continue to strive toward ' [that] more perfect union. '\" Smith v. City of New Smyrna Beach , No. 6:110cv01110-Orl-37KRS, 2013 WL 5230659, *1 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 16, 2013). That work is not easy, and governments acting in good faith can a nd sometimes do miss the mark. This is such a case. 13. Recognizing that times of crisis woul d arise, that such times might lead governments to seek to repress precious freedoms, and that the Republic's survival depended upon defeating such repressive instincts, the genius of our founding document is that it placed explicit protections into the text of the Bill of Rights. And, importantly, \"[o]ur Bill of Rights placed our survival on firmer ground \u2014that of freedom, not repression.\" Konigsberg v. State Bar of California , 366 U.S. 36, 79 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting). 14. During times of national crisis, such as the current uncertainty arising from COVID- 19, \"the fog of public excitement obscures the ancient landmarks set up in our Bill of Rights.\" American Communist Ass'n, C.I.O. v. Douds , 339 U.S. 382, 453 (1950) (Black, J., dissenting). But, where the fog of public excitement is at its apex, \"the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the consti tutional rights of fre e speech, free press and free assembly.\" De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353, 365 (1937). Without doubt, \"[ t]herein lies the security of the Republic, the very f oundation of constitutional government.\" Id. 15. It is beyond cavil that our commitment to our founding principles is most tested and best calculated during times of crisis and uncerta inty. Indeed, \"[t]imes of crisis take the truest measure of our commitment to constitutional values. Constitutional values are only as strong as our willingness to reaffirm them wh en they seem most costly to bear .\" Hartness v. Bush , 919 F.2d 170, 181 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (Edwards, J., dissent ing) (emphasis added). Our willingness to Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 6 of 45 PageID #: 6 7 reaffirm our staunch commitment to our fundamental freedoms is imperative to the very survival of the American experiment. For, \"[h]istory reveals that the initial steps in the erosion of individual rights are usually excused on the basis of an 'emergency' or threat to the public. But the ultimate strength of our constitutional guarantees lies in the unhesitating application in times of crisis and tranquility alike .\" United States v. Bell , 464 F.2d 667, 676 (2d Cir. 1972) (Mansfield, J., concurring) (emphasis added). 16. Calvary Chapel brings this case to rest rain the troubling tr ansgression of its fundamental and cherished liberties wrought by the imposition of Governor Mills' orders surrounding COVID-19. Calvary Chapel seeks not to discredit or discard the gove rnment's unquestionable interest in doing that task for which it was instituted \u2014protecting the citizenry. But, as is often true in times of crisis, Calvary Chapel respectfully submits that in an effort to uphold her sworn duties Governor Mills has stepped over a li ne the Constitution does not permit. Because of that, Calvary Chapel brings this action to ensure that this Court safeguards the cherished liberties for which so many have fought and died. For, \" [i]f the provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when th ey comfort, they may as well be discarded .\" Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell , 290 U.S. 398, 483 (1934) (Suther land, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Calvary Chapel prays un to the Court that it not permit the cherished and fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution to be another tragic casualty of COVID-19. PARTIES 17.

GOVERNOR MILLS' EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND RELATED ORDERS FROM THE STATE OF MAINE. 24. On March 15, 2020, in response to COVID- 19, Governor Mills issued Proclamation of State of Civil Emergency to Further Protect Publ ic Health, which declared a state of emergency Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 8 of 45 PageID #: 8 9 in the State of Maine. A true and correct c opy of the March 15th Emergency Proclamation is attached hereto as EXHIBIT A and incorporated herein. 25. In the Emergency Proclamation, Gove rnor Mills stated that COVID-19 \"poses an imminent threat of substantial harm to our citizens \" and directed various government agencies to implement certain restrictions and orders to facilitate the State 's response. 26. On March 18, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 14 stating that \"[g]atherings of more than 10 people are prohibited throughout t he State,\" and declared that such a prohibition was primarily aimed at \"social, pe rsonal, and discretionary events,\" including those gatherings that are \"faith -based.\" A true and correct copy of Execu tive Order 14 is attached hereto as EXHIBIT B and incorporated herein. 27. On March 24, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 19, which continued to prohibit all gatherings of more than 10 people. A true and correct copy of Executive Order 19 is attached hereto as EXHIBIT C and incorporated herein. 28. Though continuing the pro hibition on \"faith -based\" gatherings ( i.e., church) of more than 10 people, Governor Mills carved out a massive exemption from such prohibitions for businesses deemed \"essential\" and for cer tain businesses deemed \"non -essential.\" Such tial businesses include alia \"grocery and household goods\" stores, gas stations, \"home repair, hardware and auto repair\" stores, and \"convenience stores.\" This exemptio n likewise permitted \"big box\" stores to continue operations. 29. Businesses deemed \"essential \" are permitted to continue operations subject to the requirement \u2014but only \"to maximum extent practicable \"\u2014that they adhere to social distancing recommendations, maintaining a six-foot dist ance between individuals, and other measures recommended by various government agencies. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 9 of 45 PageID #: 9 10 30. Executive Order 19 also permitted \"non -essential\" businesses to continue provided in-person contact with customers is restricted, they do not require more than 10 employees in a space where distancing is not possible, and are facilitated by remote employees to the maximum extent practicable. These non- essential businesses include \"shopping malls ., a nd other personal care and treatment facilities. \" 31. Violation of Executive Order 19 carried with it criminal and business licensing penalties. 32. On March 31, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 28, which stated: \"[a]ll persons living in the State of Maine are hereby ordered, effective as of 12:01 AM on April 2, 2020 to stay at their homes or places of residence.\" A true and correct copy of Executive Order 28 is attached hereto as EXHIBIT D and incorporated herein. 33. Executive Order 28 only permitted residents to travel out of their homes if they were conducting \"essential\" ac tivities or traveling to work at a business allowed to continue operations. 34. Executive Order 28 further restricted the functions of \"essential\" businesses by setting numerical limitations on the number of customers or patrons depending on the square footage of the building in which the business was located, permitting 5 people for buildings of less than 7,500 square feet, 15 people for buildings between 7,500 and 25,000 square feet, 50 people for buildings between 25,000 and 50,000 square f eet, 75 people for buildings between 50,000 and 75,000 square feet, and 100 for buildi ngs larger than 75,000 square feet. 35. The ex emption allowing \"essential\" businesses to operate subject to numerical limitations was not applicable to faith-based gath erings or churches, regardless of the size of the building in which such worship services take place. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 10 of 45 PageID #: 10 11 36. Executive Order 28 stated that violations c onstituted a class E crime subject to up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 37. On April 3, 2020, Governor Mills issued a list further explaining what businesses were considered \"essential\" and those deemed \"non -essential\" under the previous Executive Orders. A true and correct copy of Governor Mills' \"E ssential Business List\" is attached hereto as EXHIBIT E and incorporated herein. 38. The list of \"essential\" businesses included grocery stores, household goods stores, gas stations, hardware stores, home repair stores, garden centers and stores, child care services, and marijuana dispensaries . 39. Executive Order 28 stated that its prohibitions were in effect until April 30, 2020. 40. On April 14, 2020, Governor Mills issued a Proclamation to Renew the State of Civil Emergency in Maine, extending the purported authorities in Maine to continue to order prohibitions on religious gatherings and business closures for another 30 days. A true and correct copy of the Proclamation Extension is attached hereto as EXHIBIT F and incorporated herein. 41. On April 29, 2020, Governor Mills issued Executive Order 49, further extending her stay-at-home orders until at least May 31. A true and correct copy of Executive Order 49 is attached hereto as EXHIBIT G and incorporated herein. 42. Executive Order 49 explicitly states th at all of the prohibitions concerning \"faith - based\" gatherings remain in full effect, and t hat certain guidance documents would be made available concerning the potential re- opening of Maine's economy in the coming days. 43. Executive Order 49 states that the \"Restarting Plan\" would permit certain businesses and operations to reopen subject to the guidelines stated in the Restarting Plan, and that those businesses or activities allowed to open were \"subject to change depending upon the demonstrated efficacy of the conditions imposed\" on those businesses or activities. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 11 of 45 PageID #: 11 12 44. On April 28, 2020, Governor Mill s released the \"Restarting Maine's Economy \" plan, further outlining the Governor's continued prohibi tions on certain gatherings. A true and correct copy of the Restarting Maine's Economy plan is attached hereto as EXHIBIT H and incorporated herein. 45. Restart ing Maine's Economy contemplates th at businesses and activities will be permitted to reopen in phases with \"Stage 1 \" contemplated to begin sometime in May, but the plan states that no concrete decisions have been made and that \"decisions will be determined by public health metrics.\" 46. If Governor Mills does permit Stage 1 to commence sometime in May, although it is not certain based on the plan, certain functio ns at churches and \" religious \" gatherings will be permitted under Governor Mills' proscribed orthodo xy for worship services 47. Stage 1 contemplates \"a continued prohibition on gathering of more than 10 people. \" 48. Restarting Maine's Economy states that churches or religious organizations, if permitted to open during Stage 1, will be \"[l]imited to drive -in, stay-in-your-vehicle church services.\" Otherwise, as contemplat ed in Executive Order 49, the stay -at-home order remains in full effect prohibiting any gathering of individuals. 49. Churches and religious gatherings are not mentioned in any of the subsequent stage s, and thus no further guida nce on the speculative \"drive -in stay-in-your-vehicle church services\" potentially coming sometime in May will continue beyond May or whether different circumstances and prohibitions will continue. 50. Calvary Chapel hereinafter refers to Executive Order 14, Executive Order 19, Executive Order 28, Executive Order 49, and the Restarting Maine's Economy plan (EXHBITS A-H) collectively as the \"GATHERING ORDERS.\" Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 12 of 45 PageID #: 12 13 B. THE STATE 'S ENFORCEMENT OF GOVERNOR MILLS ' GATHERING ORDERS. 51. On April 2, 2020, the Maine State Police issued press statements indicating that it will enforce Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS against churches and individuals found in violation of them. A true and correct copy of th e Maine State Police's Enforcement Practices Memorandum is attached hereto as EXHIBIT I and incorporated herein. 52. The Enforcement Memorandum states that while the Maine State Police is \"asking for voluntary compliance\" with the GATH ERING ORDERS, the State Police will\u2014 in certain circumstances \u2014\"issu[e] summonses or mak[e] physical arrests\" for violating the GATHERING ORDERS. 53. The Enforcement Memorandum explicitly notes that the Maine State Police will be \"ask[ing] questions to ensure compliance\" and th at it hopes residents of Maine will \"not put our officer s in the position of having to enforce the law.\" 54. Through its Enforcement Memorandum, th e Maine State Police has unquestionably demonstrated that it intends to enforce th e GATHERING ORDERS, including against Calvary Chapel and its religious services. C. CALVARY CHAPEL 'S CHURCH SERVICES CAN AND WILL COMPLY WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PERSONAL HYGIENE RECOMMENDATIONS. 55. To comply with the CDC and other governmental social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines imposed by Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS ( i.e., \"to maximum extent practicable \" for exempted businesses) for its worship services, Calvary Chapel can and would practice stringent social distancing and pe rsonal hygiene protocols, including extensive and enhanced sanitizing of common surfaces in Calvary Chapel 's building prior to the service, and Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 13 of 45 PageID #: 13 14 requiring attendees to remain at least six feet ap art and use hand sanitizer prior to entering and during movement inside Calvary Chapel 's building . 56. Calvary Chapel also has the capability to abide by all of the guidelines set out by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and will implement all such guidelines at its in-person religious gatherings. D. GOVERNOR MILLS' UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF NON-RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS. 57. On May 3, 2020, at around the same time as Calvary Chapel was prohibited from hosting its in-person religious worship services , businesses in Bangor and the surrounding area were permitted to and did continue to operate w ithout the onerous restrictions imposed on Calvary Chapel. 58. As accurately depicted in the below photographs, on May 3, 2020, around the same time that Calvary Chapel was prohibited from having a religious gathering, the Walmart in Bangor had hundreds of cars parked in the parking lot, right next to one another without the onerous social distancing mandates forced on Calvary Chapel. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 14 of 45 PageID #: 14 15 59. Similarly, and as accurately depicted in the below photograph, on May 3, 2020, at the Target Store in Bangor, countless cars were present in the parking lot while Calvary Chapel was suffering under the yoke of the GATHERING ORDERS. 60. As accurately depicted in the below phot ographs, on May 3, 2020, the Home Depot in Bangor was similarly permitted to continue operating with large numbers of people while Calvary Chapel was threatened with enforcement under the GATHERING ORDERS. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 15 of 45 PageID #: 15 16 61. As accurately depicted in the below photograph, t he BJ's Wholesale Club similarly had large gatherings on May 3, 2020 without the restrictions imposed on Calvary Chapel's religious services. 62. As accurately depicted in the below photograph, the Sam 's Club in Bangor had similar large gatherings on May 3, 2020, while C alvary Chapel was not permitted to host its religious gatherings of a similar nature. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 16 of 45 PageID #: 16 17 63. Finally, and as accurately depicted in the below photographs, Lowe's H ome Improvement Store's parking lot was filled with cars on May 3, 2020, w hile Calvary Chapel was prohibited from having such gatherings for its religious services. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 17 of 45 PageID #: 17 18 E. LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE TO GOVERNOR MILLS. 64. Despite Governor Mills' insistence that in-person religious gatherings of more than 10 people cannot continue because they would spread COVID-19, the State has failed to consider other, substantially less restrictive alter natives to an absolute prohibition on \"religious \" gatherings. 65. Like the State of Maine, the State of Fl orida has issued stay-at-home executive orders and required the closure of all so- called \"non -essential \" businesses without unnecessarily discriminating against religious gatherings. On April 1, 2020, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued Executive Order 20-91, which included \"religious services conducted in churches, synagogues, and houses of worship\" as essential activities permitted to continue subject to social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines . A true and correct copy of Florida Executive Order 20-91 is attached hereto as EXHIBIT J and incorporated herein. 66. The State of Indiana has likewise issued stay-at-home executive orders and required the closure of all so- called \"non -essential \" businesses without unnecessarily discriminating against religious gatherings. Governor Eric. J. Holcomb's Executive Order 20 -08 declared that \"[r]eligious facilities, entities and groups, and religious gatherings\" are essential and may continue to operate provided they follow appropriate social distanci ng and personal hygiene practices. A true and correct copy of Indiana's Executive Order 20 -08 is attached hereto as EXHIBIT K and incorporated herein. 67. The State of Arizona, in Executive Order 2020-18, classified \"[e]nga ging in constitutionally protected activities such as speech and religion \" as essential activities, subject to a flexible requirement that such engagement be \"conducted in a manner that provides appropriate physical distancing to the extent feasible. \" The Arizona Attorney General, in Opinion I20-008, interpreted such essential activities clearly to incl ude assembling for religious worship. True and Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 18 of 45 PageID #: 18 19 correct copies of Arizona Executive Order 2020-18 and Arizona Attorney General Opinion I20-008 are attached hereto as EXHIBIT L and EXHIBIT M , respectively, and incorporated herein. 68. The State of Alabama, in its final Order of the State Health Officer Suspending Certain Public Gatherings Due to Risk of Infection by COVID-19, issued April 3, 2020, exempts individuals attending religious worship services in person subject to certain requirements and permits \"drive -in\" worship services without limitation. A true a nd correct copy of the Alabama Order is attached hereto as EXHIBIT N and incorporated herein. 69. The State of Arkansas has likewise exempted \"places of worship\" from its Executive Order 20-13 imposing restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, provided that they engage in adequate social distancing and pe rsonal hygiene practices. A true and correct copy of the Arkansas Executive Order is attached hereto as EXHIBIT O and incorporated herein. 70. The State of Connecticut has similarly shown th at other, less restrictive alternatives are available. In Executive Order No. 7N, Governor Ned Lamont permitted religious services to continue to meet, but limited thei r in-person gatherings to 50 peopl e, as opposed to the six-person limit applicable to other gatherings. A true a nd correct copy of the Connecticut Executive Order No. 7N is attached hereto as EXHIBIT P and incorporated herein. 71. The State of Texas has likewise issued certain COVID-19 orders, but has provided explicit protections to religious gatherings and issued directives outlining the protection for religious freedom, even in these times of uncer tainty. A true and corr ect copy of the Texas Guidance for Houses of Worship is attached hereto as EXHIBIT Q and incorporated herein. In that Guidance, Texas notes that religious assemblies and houses of worship are \"essential services\" and that in-person gatherings are permissible if social distancing and personal hygiene practices are followed. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 19 of 45 PageID #: 19 20 72. The State of Ohio has likewise issued certain COVID-19 orders, including the Ohio Department of Health's Stay Safe Ohio Order. A true and correct copy of the Ohio order is attached hereto as EXHIBIT R and incorporated herein. Ohio's order likewise states that the stay at home mandate \"does not apply to religious facilities, entities and groups and religious gatherings.\" 73. Numerous other states have similarly permitted religious gatherings to be treated equally with non-religious gatherings. 74. As these other states have demonstrated, G overnor Mills can continue to pursue the State 's objective of preventing the spread of COVI D-19 without unnecessarily treating religious gatherings in a discriminatory manner, and th e State has numerous other, less restrictive alternatives available to it to do so. 75. Governor Mills has neither tried without success nor considered and ruled out for good reason these less restrictive alternatives . 76. Governor Mills has constitutionally permissible alternatives available, but has failed to attempt to achieve the State 's purported goals without unnece ssarily interfering with constitutionally protected activities. F. IRREPARABLE INJURY TO CALVARY CHAPEL FROM GOVERNOR MILL S' GATHERING ORDERS. 77. Despite being capable of following all social distancing and personal hygiene protocols recommended by the CDC and specified in the GATHERING ORDERS, Calvary Chapel has been explicitly targeted, singled out, and puni shed for participating in an in-person religious gathering when exempted commercial and non -religious entities may accommodate gatherings, crowds, and masses of people without numeric li mitation, and without targeting or punishment by the government. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 20 of 45 PageID #: 20 21 78. As a result of Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS, Calvary Chapel has suffered and is suffering irre parable injury by having Pastor Gr aves and all attendees of future services threatened with criminal sanction. 79. As a result of Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS, Calvary Chapel has suffered and is suffering irreparable inju ry by being prohibited from engaging in its constitutionally and statutorily protected right s of free exercise, assembly, and speech. 80. As a result of Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS, Calvary Chapel has suffered and is suffering irreparable injury by the infringement of its constitutionally protected right to be free from government hostility toward religion. 81. As a result of the Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS and the explicit threats from the Maine State Police, Calvary Chapel has suff ered and is suffering irreparable injury by the continuing threat of criminal sanctions against Calvary Chapel 's Pastor Graves and congregants for merely exercising their cons titutionally protected freedoms. 82. Due to the explicit threats of Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS and the announcements by the Maine State Police, Calvary Chapel has been forced to self-censor, cease its religious worship services, and violat e its sincerely held religious beliefs. G. CALVARY CHAPEL 'S ATTEMPTS TO SECURE RELIEF WITHOUT JUDICIAL INTERVENTION WERE IGNORED AND FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO NOTIFY THE STATE ARE FUTILE AND IMPRACTICAL BEFORE THIS SUNDAY. 83. On May 4, 2020, prior to the commencement of the instant action, Calvary Chapel 's counsel sent by email a demand letter to Governor Mills, with copies to state and local police and other officials, in which Calvary Chapel 's counsel demanded , by 5:00 P.M. on May 5, written confirmation that the State has withdrawn the ba n on religious gatherings embodied in the GATHERING ORDERS, will allow in dividuals to attend church services at Calvary Chapel in an Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 21 of 45 PageID #: 21 22 equal manner with other essential and non-essent ial business permitted to continue provided certain social distancing and personal hygiene practi ces are followed, and will cease enforcement of any church gathering ban against members and/ or attendees of Calvary Chapel church services. A true and correct copy of the dema nd letter is attached hereto as EXHIBIT S . No written response from Governor Mills' office was received by the requeste d deadline, or at any time prior to the filing of this Verified Complaint. 84. The failure of Governor Mills or her offici als to confirm withdrawal or cessation of enforcement of the discriminatory gathering ba n for religious services in the GATHERING ORDERS and applied to Calvary Chapel an d its pastor shows that Calvary Chapel 's irreparable injury to its constitutionally protected freedoms is ongoing. 85. The failure of Governor Mills or her officials to respond to Calvary Chapel 's communication also shows that notice and an opportuni ty to respond to this lawsuit cannot be effectuated, and would be futile, prior to this Sund ay's worship activities at Calvary Chapel, when the State and/or other government officials will ag ain interfere with the constitutional liberties of Calvary Chapel and its congregants absent a temporary restraining order from this Court. CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS COUNT I \u2014THE GATHERING ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT 86. Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. 87. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amen dment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Am endment, prohibits the State from abridging Calvary Chapel 's rights to free exercise of religion. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 22 of 45 PageID #: 22 23 88. Calvary Chapel has sincerely held religious beliefs that Scripture is the infallible, inerrant word of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that it is to follow its teachings. 89. Calvary Chapel has sincerely held religious beliefs, rooted in Scripture's commands ( e.g., Hebrews 10:25), that followers of Jesus Christ are not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, and that they are to do so even more in times of peril and crisis. Indeed, the entire purpose of the Chu rch (in Greek \"ekklesia,\" meaning \"assembly\") i s to assemble together Christians to worship Almighty God. 90. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, target Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs by prohibiting religious gatherings. 91. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, impermissibly burden Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs, compel Calvary Chapel to either change those beliefs or to act in contradiction to them, and force Calvary Chapel to choose between the teachings and requirements of its sincerely held religious b eliefs in the commands of Scripture and the State 's imposed value system. 92. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, place Calvary Chapel in an irresolvable conflict between compliance with the GATHERING ORDE RS and its sincerely held religious beliefs. 93. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, put substantial pressure on Calvary Chapel to violate its sincerely h eld religious beliefs by ignoring the fundamental teachings and tenets of Scripture con cerning the assembling of Believers. 94. The GATHERING ORDERS, on th eir face and as applied, are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but rather specifically and discriminatorily target the religious beliefs, speech, assembly, and viewpoint of Calvary Chapel. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 23 of 45 PageID #: 23 24 95. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, constitute a substantial burden on Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs. 96. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the GATHERING ORDERS' applica tion of different standards for churches and religious gatherings than those applicable to exempted busines ses or non-religious entities. 97. Even if the GATHERING ORDERS' restriction on religious gatherings were supported by a compelling interest, which it is not, they are not the least restrictive means to accomplish the government's purported interest. 98. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, fail to accommodate Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs. 99. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, specifically target Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs and set up a system of individualized exemptions that permits certain other similarly situated businesses or non-religious entities to continue operations under certain guidelines while prohibiting religious gatherings, such as Calvary Chapel 's church and worship services, from operating with similar guidelines. 100. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, constitute an express and overt religious gerrymander. 101. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Calvary Cha pel immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 102. Calvary Chapel has no adequate remedy at law to correct the c ontinuing deprivation of its most cherished liberties. WHEREFORE, Calvary Chapel respectfully prays for relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in its prayer for relief.

Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. 104. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the State from abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemble. 105. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face a nd as applied, are an unconstitutional prior restraint on Calvary Chapel 's right to assemble. 106. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of viewpoint. 107. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of content. 108. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the GATHERING ORDERS' application of differential s tandards for churches and religious gatherings than those applicable to exempted busines ses or non-religious entities. 109. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are not the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissible government purpose sought to be served by the orders. 110. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are not narrowly tailored to serve the government's purported interest. 111. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, do not leave open ample alternative channels of communication for Calvary Chapel.

The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are irrational and unreasonable and impose unjustifiable and unreasonable restrictions on Calvary Chapel 's constitutionally protected right to assemble. 113. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, impermissibly vest unbridled discretion in the hands of government officials, including Governor Mills and her designees, to apply or not apply the GATHERING ORDERS in a manner to restrict free assembly. 114. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are underinclusive by limiting their gathering prohibitions to only ce rtain businesses or organizations deemed \" non- essential .\" 115. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad as they chill and abridge the free assembly rights of Calvary Chapel. 116. On their face and as applied, the GATHERING ORDERS' violation of Calvary Chapel 's right to free assembly have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Calvary Chapel to suffer immediate and irrepara ble injury and undue and actual hardship. 117. Calvary Chapel has no other adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its most cherished liberties. WHEREFORE, Calvary Chapel respectfully prays for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in its prayer for relief. COUNT III - THE GATHE RING ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFF 'S RIGHTS TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT 118. Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 26 of 45 PageID #: 26 27 119. The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendmen t to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Am endment, prohibits the State from abridging Calvary Chapel 's freedom of speech. 120. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face a nd as applied, are an unconstitutional prior restraint on Calvary Chapel 's speech. 121. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of viewpoint. 122. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of content. 123.

The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, do not leave open ample alternative channels of communication for Calvary Chapel. 127. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are irrational and unreasonable and impose unjustifiable and unreasonable restrictions on Calvary Chapel 's constitutionally protected speech. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 27 of 45 PageID #: 27 28 128. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, impermissibly vest unbridled discretion in the hands of government officials, including Governor Mills and her designees, to apply or not appl y the GATHERING ORDERS in a manner to restrict free speech. 129. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, are underinclusive by limiting their prohibitions to only certain entit ies, organizations, or businesses deemed \"non- essential. \" 130. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, are unconstitutionally overbroad as they chill and abridge the free speech rights of Calvary Chapel. 131.

COUNT IV \u2014THE GATHERING ORDERS VIOLATE THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT 133. Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. 134. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the F ourteenth Amendment, prohibits the government from establishing a religion. 135. The Establishment Clause also prohibits excessive government entanglement with religion. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 28 of 45 PageID #: 28 29 136. The Establishment Clause also prohibits the government from showing hostility towards religion and prohibits showing favoritism towards one religious sect over another or between non-religion and religion. 137. The government mandated prohibition on \"faith -base d\" gatherings in the GATHERING ORDERS violates the Establishment Clause because the State of Maine thereby dictates the manner in which Christians and churches must worship or worship online. 138. The Establishment Clause does not perm it the State of Maine to dictate under penalty of criminal sanctions the manner, style, form, practices, or sacraments of religious worship and thereby impose its own version of religious w orship on every church and citizen of the State. 139. In fact, as the Supreme Court has unequivoca lly stated, \"[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith the rein.\" W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) (emphasis added). 140. The State, through Governor Mills' GATHERING ORDERS, is purporting to prescribe what shall be orthodox in matters of r eligious worship, and is thus running roughshod over the Establishment Clause. 141. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, permit the State to display impermissible hostility towards religious gatherings. 142. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, impermissibly show favoritism towards certain non-religious gatherings over religious gatherings. 143. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, violate the Establishment Clause because they excessively entangle the government with religion. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 29 of 45 PageID #: 29 30 144. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their f ace and as applied, purport to inform religious adherents and believers how they may choose to worship, assemble together, or engage in their religious freedoms. 145. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, purport to establish an acceptable method of religious practice and wors hip, place a numerical limi tation on the scope of how such religious practice and worship may occur, and provide a government imprimatur for only certain forms of \"permissible\" worship. 146. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, demonstrate overt hostility to religious practice and worship th at does not conform to government sanctioned religious exercises. 147. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Calvary Cha pel immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 148. Calvary Chapel has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its most cherished constitutional liberties. WHEREFORE, Calvary Chapel respectfully prays for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in their prayer for relief. COUNT V \u2014THE GATHERING ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT 149. Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. 150. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees Calvary Chapel the right to equal protection under the law. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 30 of 45 PageID #: 30 31 151. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face a nd as applied, are an unconstitutional abridgement of Calvary Chapel 's right to equal protection under the law, are not neutral, and specifically target Calvary Chapel 's and other religious gatherings for unequal treatment. 152. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face a nd as applied, are an unconstitutional abridgment of Calvary Chapel 's right to equal protection because they permit the State to treat Calvary Chapel differently from other similarly situated businesses and non-religious entities on the basis of the content and viewpoint of Calvary Chapel 's gatherings. 153. The GATHERING ORDERS create a system of exempt categories that permit essential businesses and gatherings to continue to operate with restriction or threat of sanction, and impose disparate treatment to those categories of businesses and gatherings called \"non -essential.\" 154. The GATHERING ORDERS system of categor ies represents disparate treatment based upon classification in violation equal protection. 155. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, impermissibly discriminate between certain non-religious gatherings and religious gatherings. 156. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the GATHERING ORDE RS' application of different standards for churches and religious gatherings than those applicable to exempted busines ses or non-religious entities. 157. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are not the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissi ble government purpose sought to be served. 158. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, do not have a rational basis. 159. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, are irrational and unjustifiable and impose irrational and unjus tifiable restrictions on Calvary Chapel 's religious gatherings. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 31 of 45 PageID #: 31 32 160. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Calvary Cha pel immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 161. Calvary Chapel has no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing deprivation of its most cherished liberties. WHEREFORE, Calvary Chapel respectfully prays for relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in its prayer for relief. COUNT VI \u2014THE GATHERING ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT UNDER THE GUARANTEE CLAUSE OF ARTICLE IV, \u00a7 4 OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION 162. Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. 163. Article IV, \u00a7 4 of the United States Constit ution requires the United States to guarantee to every citizen in the nation a republican form of government. 164. The Guarantee Clause's distinguishing feat ure is that the republican form of government it guarantees is the right of the people to choose their own governmental administration and pass their own laws. 165. As interpreted by the federal judiciary and prominent scholars, the Guarantee Clause mandates that the federal government guarantee a form of government for all citizens in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and exercised by elected officers responsible to such citizens. 166. The GATHERING ORDERS' express, unilateral, and u nequivocal exercises of purported executive authority over the constitu tional rights of Calvary Chapel deprive Calvary Chapel of the right to select its own government admi nistration, pass its own laws, and maintain a Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 32 of 45 PageID #: 32 33 government administration directly responsible to the people, including by laws that are enacted by the legislature in constitutional recognition of the separation of powers. 167. The impermissible exercise of exclusiv e and unaccountable executive authority violates the Guarantee Clause of the United States Constitution. 168. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Calvary Cha pel immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 169. Calvary Chapel has no adequate remedy at law to correct the c ontinuing deprivation of its most cherished liberties. WHEREFORE, Calvary Chapel respectfully prays for the relief against the State as hereinafter set forth in its prayer for relief. COUNT VII \u2014THE GATHERING ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION UNDER ARTICLE I, SECTION 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF MAINE 170. Calvary Chapel hereby realleges and adopts each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-85 above. 171. Article I, \u00a7 3 of the Constitution of the State of Maine states: All individuals have a natural and una lienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences , and no person shall be hurt, molested or restrained in that person's li berty or estate for wors hipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the d ictates of that person's own conscience, nor for that person's religious professions or sentiments, provided that that person does not disturb the public peace, nor obstruct others in their religious worship ;\u2014and all persons demeaning themselves peaceably, as good members of the State, shall be equally under the protection of the laws . . . . (Emphasis added.) 172. Calvary Chapel has sincerely held religious beliefs that Scripture is the infallible, inerrant word of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that it is to follow its teachings. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 33 of 45 PageID #: 33 34 173. Calvary Chapel has sincerely held religious belief s, rooted in Scripture's commands ( e.g., Hebrews 10:25), that followers of Jesus Christ are not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, and that they are to do so even more in times of peril and crisis. Indeed, the entire purpose of the Church (i n Greek \"ekklesia,\" meaning \"assembly\") is to assemble together Christians to worship Almighty God. 174. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, target Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs by prohibiting religious gatherings. 175. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, impermissibly burden Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs, compel Calvary Chapel to either change those beliefs or to act in contradiction to them, and force Calvary Chapel to choose between the teachings and requirements of its sincerely held religious b eliefs in the commands of Scripture and the State 's imposed value system. 176. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, place Calvary Chapel in an irresolvable conflict between compliance with the GATHERING ORDE RS and its sincerely held religious beliefs. 177. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, put substantial pressure on Calvary Chapel to violate its sincerely h eld religious beliefs by ignoring the fundamental teachings and tenets of Scripture co ncerning the assembling of Believers. 178. The GATHERING ORDERS, on th eir face and as applied, are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but rather specifically and discriminatorily target the religious beliefs, speech, assembly, and viewpoint of Calvary Chapel. 179. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face a nd as applied, constitute a substantial burden on Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1 Filed 05/05/20 Page 34 of 45 PageID #: 34 35 180. The State lacks a compelling, legitimate, or rational interest in the GATHERING ORDER S' application of different standards for churches and religious gatherings than those applicable to exempted busines ses or non-religious entities. 181. Even if the GATHERING ORDERS' restriction on religious gatherings were supported by a compelling interest, which it is not , they are not the least restrictive means to accomplish the government's purported interest. 182. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, fail to accommodate Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs. 183. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, specifically target Calvary Chapel 's sincerely held religious beliefs and set up a system of individualized exemptions that permits certain other similarly situated businesses or non-religious entities to continue operations under certain guidelines while prohibiting religious gatherings, such as Calvary Chapel 's church and religious gatherings, from operating with similar guid elines. 184. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face an d as applied, constitute an express and overt religious gerrymander. 185. The GATHERING ORDERS, on their face and as applied, have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause Calvary Cha pel immediate and irreparable harm, and actual and undue hardship. 186. Calvary Chapel has no adequate remedy at law to correct the c ontinuing deprivation of its most cherished liberties.

If the government does impose such a restriction, it must then demonstrat e that such a burden on the religious assembly is supported by a compelling interest and is the least re strictive means to further that alleged interest. 210. RLUIPA further mandates th at no government \"impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious ass embly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(1). 211.

To facilitate this collaboration, State an d local governments must clearly articulate their directives aimed at mitigating spread of the virus. This updated joint guidance from the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Governor is the official guidance regarding the effect of Executiv e Order GA 16 on religious services conducted in churches, congregati ons, and houses of worship. The government must give special consideration to houses of worship when issuing orders related to the COVID-19 crisis. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I of the Texas Constitution protect the right of Texans to worship and freely exercise their religion according to the dictates of their own consciences. In a ddition, the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") provid es additional protections to faith communities, and government must ensure that it complies with RFRA when it acts, even during a disaster. Thus, when state or local governments issue orders prohibiting people from provid ing or obtaining certain services, they must ensure that these orders do not violate these constitutional and statutory rights. Houses of worship provide \"essential services.\" By executive order, Governor Abbott has defined essential services to include \"religious services conducted in churches , congregations, and houses of worship.\" 1 Institutions providing these essential se rvices can provide them under certain conditions described in Executive Order GA 16 and local orders by counties or municipalities that are consistent with GA 16. To the extent there is conflict between the Governor's Executive Order GA 16 and local orders, GA 16 controls. Local governments may not order houses of worship to close. Houses of worship should conduct as many activities as possible remotely, and should follow federal guidelines when providing services in person. Houses of worship should conduct as many of their activities as possible remotely. Services that houses of worship cannot co nduct remotely should be conducted in accordance with guidance from the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"). 2 For example: 1 Exec. Order No. GA 16 at 3 (Apr. 17, 2020); see also Exec. Order No. GA 14 at 2 (Mar. 31, 2020) (superseded by GA 16). 2 Ctr. for Disease Control, Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Apr. 9, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1-17 Filed 05/05/20 Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 137 2 April 21, 2020 x Instruct sick employees, volunteer s, and guests to stay home; x Practice social distancing by maintaining appropriate distance between people; x Maintain good hygiene by washing your hands frequently, using hand sanitizer, using your elbow to cover co ughs, and not touching your face; x Implement environmental cleanliness and sanitization practices; and x Clean and disinfect work areas frequently. Houses of worship, like provid ers of other essential servic es, are to follow additional guidance from the White House and CDC whenever possible.3 Houses of worship should help slo w the spread of the virus. Texas is a big state and the transmission rate of COVID-19 varies in different communities. Texans also have big hearts and should love their neighbors by evaluating the rate of local community spre ad to determine the appropriate level of mitigation strategies to implement. 4 Houses of worship play an important role in this effort, and can use their creativity to help slow the spread of the virus. For example, a church could hold \"drive -in\" style services. Or because Executive Order GA 16 permits drive-thrus to provide goods and se rvices, a house of worship may, according to their faith practices, provide communion or a blessing through a similar drive-up service. When conducting services, houses of worship may consider implementing the following practices: x Encourage all attendees who are 65 an d above to stay home and watch the services online, or provide a \"senior se rvice\" exclusively for attendees 65 and above to attend in person. x Ask all attendees who have an underlying at-risk health condition to stay home and watch the services online. x Equip ushers and greeters with gloves and masks. x Consider keeping child care closed, unl ess the house of worship can comply with CDC guidelines for child care facilities.5 community/guidance-business-response.html ; Tex.

Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT 2 of 3 PageID #: 138 3 April 21, 2020 x Ensure all attendees sanitize their hand s and put on a mask before entering the building. x Ensure attendees sit with their family uni t, use social distancing between each unit, and, if necessary, add more service times to facilitate distancing. x Clergy should dismiss attend ees by family unit, maintaining social distancing. x Staff should sanitize seats and frequent ly touched surfaces between services. x Consider refraining from passing co llection plates and instead provide a central collection box in the build ing or encourage online giving. x Consider how the sacraments can be ad ministered without attendees having to touch the same surfaces and objects. These guidelines do not violate the re ligious liberty of houses of worship. Under the extraordinary circumstances in which we temporarily live, these guidelines provide that ho uses of worship may remain open. The guidelines make only recommendations to houses of worship. They do not violate the religious liberty of houses of worship because the government has a compelling interest in recommending this guidance (stopping contagion) and the guidance is the least restrictive means of serving that compelling interest (allowing houses of worship to stay open for ministry, but suggesting ways that help slow the spread of COVID-19).

Mills Governor of Maine 1 State House Station Augusta, ME 04333 207-287-3531 Janet.T.Mills@maine.gov RE: Church Meeting Ban Enforcement Dear Governor Mills: Liberty Counsel is a national non-profit litigation, education, and public policy organization with an emphasis on First Amendment liberties. Liberty Counsel represents Calvary Chapel of Bangor Maine (\"the Church\") . I write on behalf of the Church, its past or, Ken Graves, and its members. The Church desires to meet practicing social distancing guidelines and sanitary measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") , with more than 10 people in attendance. I am requesting written confirmation by 1:00 PM, May 5, 2020, that the \"gathering orders\" detailed below prohibiting churches from meetings of mo re than 10 people have been rescinded. If I do not receive this response, Li berty Counsel will take additional action on behalf of Pastor Graves and the Church. As you know, on March 18, 2020, the Office of the Governor issued Executive Order 14, stating that \"[g]atherings of more than 10 people are prohibited throughout the State,\" an d declared that such a prohibition was primarily aimed at \"social, persona l, and discretionary events,\" including those gatherings that are \"faith -based.\" On March 24, 2020, the Office of the Governor issued Executive Order 19, which continued, purported ly, to prohibit all gatherings of more than 10 people. Though continuing the prohibition on \"faith -based\" gatherings ( i.e., church) of more than 10 people, the gathering orders carved out a massive exemption from such prohibitions for Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 1-19 Filed 05/05/20 Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 154Church Meeting Ban Enforcement May 4, 2020 Page 2 businesses deemed \"essential\" and for certain businesses deemed \"non -essential.\" Such \"essential businesses include inter alia \"grocery and household goods\" stores, gas stations, \"home repai r, hardware, and auto r epair\" This exemption likewise pe rmitted \"big box\" stores to continue operations. Businesses deemed \"essential\" were and are permitted to cont inue operations subject to the requirement \u2014but only \"to maximum extent practicable\"\u2014 that they adhere to social distancing recommendations, maintained a six-foot distan ce between individuals, and other measures recommended by various government agencies. Executive Order 18 also permitted \"non -essential\" busines ses to continue provided that they did not require more than 10 employees, that in-person contact with customers was restricted, and where social distancing was not practical. These non- essential businesses include \"shopping malls,\" \"theatres,\" \"casinos,\" exercise gyms, massage parl ors, and other personal care facilities. On March 31, 2020, the Office of the Governor issued Executive Order 28, which stated: \"[a]ll persons living in the State of Maine are hereby ordered, effective as of 12:01 AM on April 2, 2020, to stay in their hom es or places of residence.\" EO 28 only permitted residents to travel out of their homes if they were conducting \"essential\" activiti es or traveling to their place of work at a business allowed to continue operations. Executive Order 28 further restricted the functions of \"essential\" businesses by setting numerical limitations on the number of customers or patrons depending on the square footage of the building in which the business was located, permitting 5 people for buildings of 7,500 square feet or less, 15 people for buildings between 7,500 and 25,000 square feet, 50 people for building between 25,000 and 50,000 square feet, 75 people for buildings between 50,000 and 75,000 square feet, and 100 for buildings larger than 75,000 sq uare feet. However, the exception for certain numerical limitations was not applicable to faith-ba sed gatherings or churches, regardless of the size of the building in which such worship servi ces took place. Executive Order 28 stated that violations constituted a class E crime subject to up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. On April 3, 2020, the Office of the Governor issued a list further explaining what businesses were considered \"essential\" and which were deemed \"non -essential\" under the previous Executive Orders. The l ist of \"essential\" businesses included grocery stores, househol d good stores, gas stations, hardware stores, home repair stores, garden centers and stores, child care service, and \"marijuana dispensaries.\" On April 14, 2020, the Office of the Governor issued a Proclamation to Renew the State of Civil Emergency in Maine, extending the purport ed authorities in Maine to continue to order prohibitions on religious gatherings and business closures for another 30 days. On April 29, 2020, the Office of the Governor issued Executive Order 49, further extending \"stay -at-home\" orders until at least May 31. The Maine State Police has stated to the publ ic that the Executive Orders relating to COVID-19 will be enforced. 1 This enforcement will include \"gathering orders\" limiting churches 1 https://www.maine.gov/dps/msp/taxonomy/term/513 Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 05/05/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 155Church Meeting Ban Enforcement May 4, 2020 Page 3 to attendance by no more than ten persons. Th e Maine State Police and other law enforcement agencies, acting at the direction of the Office of the Governor, are each acting under color of state law, and are depriving our clients and other similarly situated Main e citizens of rights secured by the United States Constitution, including the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Officials in other jurisdictions have thre atened to impose criminal sanctions on other religious gatherings. In Louisville, Kentucky, for example, the government threatened to use police to impose criminal sanctions on those individuals found in violation of similar COVID-19 orders and threatened to impose various sanctions on in dividuals found in violation of such orders. The United States District Court for the Western Distri ct of Kentucky found that the mere threat of such criminal sanction warranted a TRO. See On Fire Christian Center, Inc. v. Fischer , No. 3:20- cv-264-JRW, 2020 WL 1820249 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020). The On Fire TRO enjoined the Mayor of Louisville from \" enforcing, attempting to enforce, thre atening to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with any prohibition on drive-in church services at On Fire .\" Id. at *1 (emphasis added). In times of national crisis, such as th e current uncertainty arising from COVID- 19, \"the fog of public excitement obscures the ancient landmarks set up in o ur Bill of Rights.\" American Communist Ass'n, C.I.O. v. Douds , 339 U.S. 382, 453 (1950) (Black, J., dissenting). But, where the fog of public excitement is at its apex, \"the more imperati ve is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free a ssembly.\" De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353, 365 (1937). Without doubt, \"[t]herein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.\" Id. Here, the State of Maine has failed to c onsider other, substantially less restrictive alternatives to an absolute prohibition on \"religious \" gatherings. Other state s have determined that churches are essential and may continue to operate provided they follow appropriate social distancing and personal hygiene practices. For these reasons, demand is hereby made for a written response by 1:00 P.M. on May 5, 2020, with confirmation that the ban embodied in the COVID-19 Executive Orders prohibiting religious gatherings of more than 10 people has been rescinded. Specifically, please confirm that 1. individuals will be permitted to attend churc h services within the sanctuary at Calvary Chapel of Bangor in an equal manner with other essential and non-essential businesses permitted to exceed 10-person gathering li mitations, provided certain social distancing and personal hygiene practices are followed, and 2. there will be no enforcement of any church ga thering bans against Pastor Graves and members and/or attendees of Calvary Chapel church services. If I do not receive these respective confirmations by the time requested, Liberty Counsel will take additional action to prevent irreparable harm to the rights of our clients. Thank you for your attention to this matter. .

MIHET PROVIDING THE COURT WITH SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REQUESTED AT THE MAY 7, 2020 STATUS CONFERENCE I, Horatio G. Mihet, do hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of 18 years, have personal knowledge of the matters set forth in this declaration, and if called upon to testify to them, I would and could do so competently. 2. At the telephonic Status Conference held before this Court on May 7, 2020, this Court inquired whether Calvary Chapel may be able to obtain some relief under the aspirational language and structure of the Res tarting Maine's Economy plan (dkt. 1 -8). I indicated to the Court that Calvary Chapel would make all relevant inquir ies and requests, and apprise the Court of any relevant information. 3. Upon the conclusion of this Court's May 7 Status Conference, counsel for Calvary Chapel communicated in writing and telephonically with counsel for the Governor inquiring as to what procedures were in plac e for Calvary Chapel to sec ure permission, accommodation or conditional waiver to host parking lot, drive-in, an d/or in-person religious services in conformance with the so-called Restart ing Maine's Economy plan. Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 15 Filed 05/07/20 Page 1 of 5 PageID #: 1942 4. Counsel for the Governor informed us th at there is no mechanism or procedure under the Restarting Maine's Economy plan by which Calvary Chapel could seek or obtain any certification, permission, and/or exemption to pe rmit parking lot, drive-in and/or in-person religious services. The Governor 's counsel also informed us that there would not be such a mechanism or procedure available for Calvary Chapel during the pendency of Calvary Chapel's motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. 5. Also after this Court's May 7 Status Conference, I communicated with Calvary Chapel to confirm the approximate square footage of its facilities. 6. Calvary Chapel confirmed the square footage of its building is approximately 10,000 square feet, as this Court indicated it had seen in media reports. 7. Pursuant to Executive Order 28, if tr eated somewhat comparably with some non- religious \"essential\" entities , such as retail stores, Calvary Chapel would at least fall into the category permitting 15 individuals inside the building (dkt. 1- 4, at 4 (restricting \"essential\" retail stores with 7,500- 25,000 square feet to 15 individuals \"in the store at one time\")). 8. Under the same Executive Order 28, if tr eated somewhat comparably with some non-religious \"essential\" entities , such as retail stores, Calvary Chapel would at least be permitted to have an unlimited number of individuals on its premises \"outside ,\" as long as it would \"enforce the six-foot separation requirem ent\" and use \"signage and ground lines designed to impose that distancing.\" (Dkt. 1 -4, at 4). 9. In our discussions with the Governor's counsel on May 7, 2020, we requested on behalf of Calvary Chapel an accommodation for the Church to at least have up to 15 people in its building for a religious service on this coming Sunday, May 10, 2020, and to at least have the remainder of any attendees outside in the Church's large parking lot, appropriately spaced more Case 1:20-cv-00156-NT Document 15 Filed 05/07/20 Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 1953 than six feet between families not living togeth er, in pre-arranged, appropriately spaced seats and using signage and markings designed to impose th at distancing, all as available to \"essential\" entities under Executive Order 28. The Church's rationale in seeking this minimum accommodation is that the COVID-19 virus cannot tell the difference between 15 people shopping at Walmart (handing money or credit cards to cash iers and receiving change or credit cards back), and 15 worshippers appropriately spaced in a 10,000 square foot auditorium, who do not come into contact with each other (outside of same hous ehold family units) or with the Pastor. The Church's rationale is also that the COVID -19 virus cannot tell the diff erence between 100 people waiting in line outside of Walmart, listening to intercom music, a nd 100 people \"waiting\" outside at Calvary Chapel, equally spaced apart as the Walmart customers, and listening to a religious sermon instead. 10. Although these restrictions are not ideal, and Calvary Chapel neither implies nor concedes that it is not constitu tionally entitled to more, these minimum accommodations would be acceptable for TRO purposes, would put Calvary Ch apel on a more equal footing with at least some of the \"essential\" entities in the Governor's orders, and would provide meaningful, immediate relief for Calvary Chapel and its memb ers in the free exercise of their religious convictions. 11. At 6:18 p.m. on May 7, 2020, I and my fellow co-counsel for Calvary Chapel received an email from the Governor's counsel, which states , in relevant part: We have discussed your proposal with th e governor's office, and we have decided that we will not grant any ex ceptions or waivers from the current executive orders.
