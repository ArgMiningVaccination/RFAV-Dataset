Updated boosters can be administered at least 2 months after completion of the primary series or at least 2 months after the last monovalent booster dose Bivalent booster recommendation is the same for immunocompromised and immunocompetent people 23Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the United StatesBooster Recommendations, continued This new booster recommendation replaces all prior booster recommendations for this age group. Monovalent mRNA vaccines are no longer authorized as a booster dose for people ages 12 years and older. Children ages 5 -11 years are recommended to continue receiving 1 monovalent mRNA booster dose if eligible Only monovalent vaccines are approved or authorized for primary series doses J&J vaccine remains available as first booster for certain people 24Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the United StatesCOVID -19 Vaccine Timing by Age 25COVID -19 Vaccine Timing by Age Now includes monovalent and bivalent booster information. Updated15-Minutes Observation Period Now Optional 15-minutes post -vaccination observation period previously recommended by CDC Vaccination providers should consider an observation period: Consider 15 min observation: Adolescents (risk of syncope) Consider 30 min observation: Allergy -related contraindication to a different type of COVID -19 vaccine Non-severe, immediate (onset within 4 hours) allergic reaction after a previous dose of COVID -19 vaccine. Anaphylaxis after non -COVID -19 vaccines or injectable therapies 27 CDC Interim Clinical Considerations for the Use of COVID -19 VaccinesError and Deviation Guidance Updated Please see Appendix D in CDC guidance All vaccine administration errors should be reported to VAERS 28 Review: COVID -19 and Vaccination People with known current SARS -CoV-2 infection should defer any COVID -19 vaccination, including booster vaccination, at least until recovery from the acute illness (if symptoms were present) and criteria to discontinue isolation have been met. People who recently had SARS -CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or booster dose by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if infection was asymptomatic). 29Bivalent Booster, Other Considerations Covid -19 vaccination outside of the U.S. If an individual completed their primary series with a Covid -19 vaccine that is FDA - authorized, FDA -approved, or listed for emergency use by WHO -then they are eligible to receive the bivalent booster. Pediatric booster timeline Pediatric updated booster data discussed at 9/1/22 ACIP meeting Pfizer for children ages 5 years -11 years and Moderna for 6 years -17 years In the coming weeks, CDC expects to recommend updated COVID -19boosters for other pediatric groups. 30CDC Clinical Consideration for People who received COVID -19 vaccine outside the United States |CDC Media Statement, 9/1/202231 9/1/22, S. Data32 ACIP 9/1/22, S. Oliver presentationSummary: Balance Benefits and Harms for Bivalent Booster DosesInfluenza Season: 2021 -22 Burden Estimates 2021 -2022 U.S. Flu Season: Preliminary In -Season Burden Estimates | CDC 33New 65 -year Preferential Recommendation ACIP approved the following recommendations by majority vote at its June 22-23, 2022 ,meeting : Adults aged 65 years should preferentially receive one of the following influenza vaccines: Quadrivalent high -dose inactivated influenza vaccine or Quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age -appropriate influenza vaccine should be used . 34Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014United States, 2022 -23 Influenza Season | MMWR (cdc.gov)When to Vaccinate? Older adults: Not too early, after July/August Pregnant people During any trimester, preferably in September or October Flu vaccination may be considered in July or August for pregnant people in the 3rd trimester tohelp protect infants against flu in the first few months of life. All others: by the end of October, before flu begins spreading in the community. If your practice is planning dedicated flu clinics or outreach events, September and October are good months to offer. Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014United States, 2022 -23 Influenza Season (cdc.gov)Continue vaccinating until the last flu dose expires! Flu most commonly peaks in February and significant activity can continue into May. Avoiding missed opportunities is more important than precise timing! 35Flu + COVID Vaccine Coadministration is Safe Providers should offer influenza and COVID -19 vaccines at the same visit, if eligible. Extensive experience with non - COVID 19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. Generally, COVID -19 vaccines administered with seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) showed similar or slightly higher reactogenicity, however no specific safety concerns were identified. 36 ACIP 9/1/22, E.
