The benefits that fall under these two practices seem to be somewhat endless. Meditation- The definition of meditation largely depends on who you are asking. The common definition is a practice where an individual uses mindful techniques like focusing on a particular object, thought, activity, or breathe. The 'motive' is to reach far beyond the chatter in your mind and simply be. That's it, just be! Simple-right? Well, no, it is not simple at all.

We advise you to do more research as there is endless information and so much to learn about these common herbs/spices! Mushrooms Ahh yes, finally, we are going to discuss mushrooms! This is a hot topic that is only getting hotter and hotter as we learn more about these little fun-gis! Sorry-we know that was bad. We just couldn't resist! There are over 50,000 different spices of mushrooms that we know of and that number is only growing as we discover more and more. Various of these species are hallucinogenic and only 1-2% are poisonous. One thing is certain and that is that mushrooms as a whole have countless benefits to serve to humanity. Let's take a look at the benefits that psychoactive and non-psychoactive mushrooms have to offer. Non-psychoactive: Pretty much every type of edible mushroom contains varying degrees of protein and fibers. Many species also contain vitamin B as well as a very powerful antioxidant that is called selenium. This antioxidant helps with supporting the immune system and prevents damage to cells and tissues. Mushrooms can also help with improving heart health. If you are looking for a salty tasting food to add to a dish that actually doesn't contain that much sodium, mushrooms are a great alternative. They contain a glutamate ribonucleotides, which gives it a salty taste with low contents of actual sodium. Not only does glutamate ribonucleotides taste salty without any sodium contents, but it also helps fight against heart disease and assist blood pressure control. But what about your brain? Are there any health benefits that mushrooms offer for your brain? The answer is yes! Mushrooms can help protect your brain as your age. Ergothioneine and glutathione are two antioxidants found in mushrooms that may help prevent Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, according to the [Penn State ](https://news.psu.edu/story/491477/2017/11/09/research/mushrooms-are-full-antioxidants-may-have-anti-aging-potential) researchers. A new very commonly discussed species of mushroom that can help with improving brain function, focus and memory is [ Lions Mane Mushroom ](https://microdose-journey.com/lions-mane-mushrooms/) Psychoactive: Just like non-psychoactive mushrooms, psychoactive mushrooms are a huge topic. We will do our best to go over some important factors. Psychoactive mushrooms have a few names they go by. They are also known as 'magic mushrooms', 'psilocybin mushrooms', 'liberty caps', etc... These mushrooms can occur naturally and/or in a lab setting. There is one very important thing you need to know to understand the difference between these and other mushrooms you may find in the supermarket. That difference is the potent psychedelic and hallucinogenic properties they hold. This means you only have to take a very small dosage of 2-3 grams to (hopefully) enjoy a very intense psychedelic experience. This 'high' results in a lot of intense visual and auditorial hallucinations. This can give you a long strange trip full of mind-bending moments, morphing/breathing/melting of your surroundings, and/or loss of 'self' and 'ego. Not only do these magic mushrooms definitely feel like magic, but they also hold many benefits for the mind and soul. Here are a few benefits you can get out of taking mushrooms in both big and small quantities: - Can help treat depression - Can help treat PTSD - Can help treat nxiety - Can help fight addiction - Can increase creativity - Can increase focus/productivity - Can help with speech impediments These mushrooms, hence the name, are indeed 'magic'. Well, okay... perhaps they aren't literal 'magic'. But they are the next thing closest to 'magic' in my opinion. Time to wrap this up! Above are only a few ways to improve your mind, body, and spirit via natural remedies. We think it is important to constantly try out new methods to improve you and your life. One of the most beautiful things in life is self-evolution and self-progress. This is a never-ending Journey that we encourage you to begin. Life is beautiful and it is even more beautiful when you are your happiest and healthiest self. Do you partake in any of these practices? Perhaps it is time to sit down with yourself and re-evaluate what you are doing for your mind and body. Every day we make a choice, we hope you make the best choice for you.
