The active element in a homeopathic remedy is not energy but the information that energy has and transports, and this produces a reaction in the central nervous system (CNS) through the nerves. Hahnemann himself said that homeopathic remedies act on nerves, although he never mentioned the central nervous system (Organon; paragraphs 16, 272 and 247. \"The Chronic Diseases\" Pages 45 and 49). The CNS is the system that manages energy fluxes in living organisms. The information in homeopathic remedies has been proven by Benveniste, Ennis and Montagnier. For a deeper understanding of this I have written this document: Programatic Medicine; Homeopathy Is Programatic Medicine.](https://hpathy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/homeopathic-remedy-w-pellets.jpg) Everything is energy, but its essence is how it moves, and the way we can see it and intellectually comprehend and handle it is by naming it a \"program\". What is Homeopathy? In order to correctly typify homeopathy it is necessary to go beyond the traditional concept of Homeopathy, commonly seen as a form of energetic medicine. In the homeopathic remedies we do not only find energy, but the movement of energy, that is information. We do not handle energy-force but programs of energetic flux, and that is the \"healing program\". To say that homeopathy is an energetic medicine is insufficient, as all therapies use energy: allopathy uses chemical energy; chiropractic uses mechanical energy, and so on. So, establishing homeopathy as a form of energetic medicine, does not give it its proper place and status, which is in fact, different from other types of medicines. GENERAL CONCEPTS The important thing and which gives identity to everything in the universe, is how energy moves: on one side, the overall program and in the other side, the particular program for each individual or entity. How does this happen? A flower is formed with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a large number of other elements, all of them placed in a peculiar way... iron here... sodium over there... and copper further... so forth. A deer and a flower are organized the same way. So the important thing is how energy flows in each part of the whole system, in the energetic flux which we name a flower, a deer or whatever. The form in which the elements are organized, and how the energy settles down and how it becomes evident, is what has been recognized as \"intelligence\" or \"spirit\", that is, what integrates the program of how the whole and each part functions. And that structure is not only energy in itself but how it becomes evident to our intelligence. A heart is that same thing, energy flowing, and also the stomach and every other organ, tissue and cell. Now, a disease is not about a balance or imbalance in the Force; it is a problem in the energy flux in the organism. The important thing is that energy must flow where it \"should be moving\", and for that there must be a program, and so we can talk about a \"heart health program\", another for stomach and for each organ on its own, but also one for the circulatory apparatus, another for the digestive one and the same for each system and/or apparatus. By necessity, those programs must be processed and controlled by a control center: the central nervous system-computer. In other words, living beings are highly complex systems so we must think that their energy fluxes run through determined routes, which are controlled in a command center. Thus, we have to understand that we do not handle energy-force but programs. The phenomenon of life apparition in the germination process and the importance of the program in the seed In the phenomenon of germination we can clearly see the importance of the program in the emergence of life itself. Let's imagine a dried seed, inert, something with latent life, and being only a real life possibility. It is a capsule with the total information of how energy has to move plus the chemical elements, and with a bit of heat and water it will produce the wonderful experience of life. A tree was once a seed that did not contain all the energy that tree has, but it had the necessary information, the program of genetic information and based on it the plant was constructed and thus produced the motion of energy which we call \"life\"... just by adding water and warmth to the seed. The program in the human body and in all the neuronated beings (those that have neuronal structure and a control center) As I say in my books (sorry, only in Spanish) and lately in this document, in the superior animals there must be a program for each system and in the entire structure, one for each organic part of them. In the circulatory system there must be a heart function program, another for the veins and one for arteries, and in this way for the entire circulatory system. In the digestive apparatus there is a program for the stomach, another for the intestines, and in that way, for the entire digestive complex. These programs, working properly, produce good health. When they work wrongly, different from what the health program established, a disease is produced, and in this case, the body has prepared the necessary programs for the normalization of the functioning, which brings us to the presentation of disease. DISEASE In previous posts I have said that disease is a dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS), or the control center of the energy flux in living beings. However that definition was insufficient, because though it is so in some cases, the important aspect is that the program is behind each and every disease, and in some cases, the program is badly processed by the brain, because of a dysfunction of it, or because the program is not working right. Then we have these aspects of the programmatic medicine: we cause influence directly on the control centers of living beings in order to jump-start the correct healing programs. In other words, the correct functioning of the program is the final goal, not just the control center (the brain in neuronated beings). That is the reason why I use the term: programmatic medicine. PROGRAMATIC MEDICINE Programmatic medicine is the one that aims directly at how programs (software) operate in living organisms, beings with a central nervous system or a similar control center, such as the apex of the roots (see the work of Stefano Mancuso) or the membrane of the cells (see the work of Bruce Lipton). We are talking about highly complex functioning processes that require participation of millions of variables and elements: temperature variables, minerals, electricity, and so on. A simple cell is in itself a highly complex universe. Acupuncture as a therapy or allopathic chemical \"medicines\" have not this wide field of action.. CONCLUSIONS Homeopathy is programmatic medicine, as it mobilizes energy in order to correct and reestablish the normal function of life and health programs. To say that homeopathy is energetic medicine is insufficient, because the energetic concept forgets information, and the most important of it, structured information: life and health programs. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The author's book is Homeopathy and Informatics Andr\u00e9s Escuela de homeopat\u00eda del Instituto Hahnemanniano Internacional - Argentina Below are informal comments by various homeopaths and educators on Andr\u00e9s Amado Zuno Arce's book : Homeopathy and Informatics.

In any way I coincide fully in that what homoeopaths denominate \"immaterial\" is the information implied in the implied order of the universe like David Bohm wanted it. I have the full security that the enlightening road of the homeopathy goes with these concepts. I thank you again for the effort, for the publication of this work that I don't doubt it will illuminate others in the same sense.
