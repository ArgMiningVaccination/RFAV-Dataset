Freshman Project : Freshman students are required to complete the My Voice ECAP planning form. This project will guide the student to discover talents, interests, learning style and passions in planning their high school journey. They will be introduced to the four \"Find My Voice\" questions: o What need do you sense in your family, community and the world? o Do you possess a true talent that, if nurtured through learning, can meet the need? o Does the opportunity to meet the need tap into your passion ? o Does your conscience inspire you to take action and become involved? Students in their freshman year will focus on the first question: \"What need do I sense in my family, community, world?\" The culminating project will identify a range of needs that interest the student along with why that need is important to solve and pos sible solutions. Sophomore Project: The sophomore project continues developing the freshman project by focusing on the second question, \"What true talent do I have that if nurtured through learning can meet the need identified in the freshman project?\" Th e culminating project will include the student's exploration of learning styles and what is needed to learn and where to go to gain the knowledge to make an impact on the need identified in the Freshman project. Junior Project: The junior project builds on the previous years of development by exploring the question, \"Does the opportunity to meet the need tap into my passion to act?\" The student more deeply explores social impacts and ramifications of inaction to the need identified. The culminating project is an outline of action to be accomplished in the senior project. Senior Project: The senior project culminates with targeted internships and action research within the area of need, learning and passion identified in the previous years. Meditations Journ al: All Paideia students are exposed daily from Kindergarten to graduation to ideas that provoke critical thinking and deep pondering. These ideas might be sparked through thought -provoking quotes, short stories, pictures or music. Students spend one full week on a single idea. Every morning all Paideia students reflect or meditate on the presented idea. These reflections or meditations are recorded in their personal Meditations Journal. This daily habit develops the skill of thinking deeply and pondering s lowly of ideas and principles. During the student's senior year, she will explore through previous meditations and create a final meditations journal representing her intellectual journey to graduation. The meditations journal will be published by the sch ool with one copy given to the scholar at graduation and one copy placed in the Paideia library.

IV.New School Amendment Request Dr. Winsor explained the necessity of approving an amendment request to open a new school verses solely requesting grade level expansion and enrollment cap increase. This way, as he understands it, the two Paideia schools would not impact one another in their annual academic grade from the state. He explained that the corporate board would have fiduciary stewardship over both schools. He also explained the necessity to include in the motion to move the 7th and 8th grade students from the Terrace campus to the new school so that the Charter Board could see the whole picture. Board members asked clarifying questions. Motion by Mrs. Leach to amend the charter to include a new school named Paideia Liberal Arts Academy housing 7th -12th grades with an enrollment cap increase from 900 to 1700 students and that the current 7th and 8th grade students would move to the new school decreasing the grades served at the Terrace campus to Kindergarten through 6th grade.

Discussion to continue with an \"employment agreement\" or move to a \"contract\". After much discussion on the merits of a financial consequence to early termination of the agreement and the perils of not being able to collect the money and it being perceived by potential teachers as a deterrent to accepting a position with Paideia it was decided to table the issue until the Executive Team could gather more information from our attorney. Motion to table made by Mr. Landreth Second by Mrs. Schmaltz Vote: Dr. Tietgen -yes Mr. Landreth -yes Motion passes by majority vote Executive Team directed to gain further information from attorney Is this a common practice among charter schools? What would be the impact of changing to a contract? How could the school collect the penalty? What is the appeals process for an employee who is faced with a penalty for early termination? VI.Kindergarten Enrollment Guidelines Discussion regarding changing the kindergarten early enrollment policy: Current policy Kindergarten admission: Only scholars who turn 5 before September 1\" are automatically enrolled into Paideia's kindergarten. No scholar will be enrolled whose 5,, birthday is after December 31\" of the current academic year. Scholars with birthdays between September 1\" and December 31\" must meet the following criteria to be eligible to enroll: 1.Student must already be enrolled in an early childhood program, such as Headstart or Preschool; 2.A readiness letter (on the official letterhead of the early childhood institution) must be provided along with the enrollment packet. This letter must provide evidence that the child is ready for a full day Kindergarten program; and 3.Documentation of competency in a comprehensive early childhood assessment (such as an early childhood readiness assessment, DIBLES, AIMSweb, etc.). If none is available, Paideia Academy will provide the assessment. Discussion ensued about the challenges early kindergarten students face in future years along with the challenges kindergarten teachers face with them in the classroom. Most early kindergarten students have academic skills but lack the maturity level to make it in a structured kindergarten classroom. Motion by Dr. Winsor to change the Kindergarten Enrollment policy to: Kindergarten admission: Only scholars who turn 5 on or before September 15th are enrolled into Paideia's kindergarten.

Mr. Joel Brice of Consilium financial led the discussion. Mr. Brice explained the benefits of Paideia Academies acquiring Paideia Preschool. An estimate of 40-50 of the incoming Paideia Academy kindergarteners come directly from the Paideia Academy preschool. Those kindergarteners already have an understanding the Paideia culture and expectations. Offering a preschool on site to the families of Paideia Academy could be beneficial and bring new students to the academy. The board was very interested in acquiring the preschool and asked Mr. Brice to proceed with acquiring more information in regards to value.Dr. Winsor and Mrs. Mendonca were invited back into the board room. Joel Brice asked for them to get him Profit & Loss Statements for the past 3 years to assist in making a valuation.

Activating Prior Knowledge: discussion and questioning of previous learning about the standard 9 -10.W.1.a Word Work: Word Work could include context analysis, questioning, discussion of word use, and application to the standard. Academic Vocabulary for Word Work: central claim, oppos ing claim, counterclaim, reasoning , evidence Research -Pair-Share: Students have done previous research in preparation for the research -based argument paper. Have students discuss in pairs the strongest or most interesting possible central claim that has emerged from their research. Guided Practice using Outline Tool: Distribute the Outline Tool. Guide students to record their problem -based questions on the tool. Didactic Instruction and Questioning : Provide didactic instruction on central claims. Display a series of claims for students to analyze: o Central Claim: Granting anyone the rights to sell human tissue is morally and ethically questionable; neither researchers nor patients should have rights to s ell any human tissue. o Claim: Giving researchers legal ownership of others' genes, cells, or tissues infringes on individuals' rights to privacy and control over their unique genetic information. o Claim: Doctors and researchers can profit from tissue taken d uring surgery and institutions have control over these tissue samples. Word Work: Students will analyze and discuss the academic language for the standard - central claim, opposing claim, counterclaim, reasoning, evidence Research -Pair-Share: Students will discuss in pairs the strongest or most interesting possible central claim that ha s emerged from their research. Outline Tool : Record problem -based questions on the Outline Tool Discuss Central Claims: o Include subtopics that develop the topic and support the claim o Clearly state each subtopic o Use relevant and sufficient e vidence to develop my subtopics o Adapt content and l anguage to my specific audience Analyze claims : Students will organize the claims they identified in a coherent order. Partner Work: Discuss ideas and fill in Evidence and Reasoning portions of the Outline Tool. The student activities are aligned to the standard 9-10.W.1.a because students are introducing precise claims and creating a clear organization. 3 o Claim: The sale or resale of human tissue is dehumanizing and exacts a psychological toll on the patient or the patient's family. Ask: Which claim in this sequence does not support the central claim? Guided Practice and Intellectual Coaching : Instruct students to organize the claims they identified in a coherent order. Ask potential questions for students to guide their organization of the tools: o Are your Evidence -Based Claims in a logi cal order? o How do you link your claims to best support the central claims? o How can you transition from one claim to another to effectively show the reasoning and how it best supports the central claim? Model the Outline Tool : Remind students that the pu rpose of this outline is to have a clear plan for their research -based argument paper and to consolidate all of their information. Display one supporting claim of the Model Outline Tool for students. Explain that students need to use the evidence from thei r research to support each claim in the body of their paper (much like each claim in the paper supports the central claim), and copy the evidence onto the \"Evidence\" portion of the Outline Tool. Explain that students will write a brief explanation of how t his evidence supports each claim in the \"Reasoning\" portion of the Outline Tool. Model the process. Inform students that this analysis is the starting point for each body paragraph and the foundation of the reasoning among the evidence in the research -based argument paper. Partner Discussion : Instruct students to form pairs to discuss their ideas about which evidence best supports the first claim on their Outline Tool. Then students complete the first \"Evidence\" and \"Reasoning\" portions of the Outline Tool. 2 9-10.W.1 .b Objective : In this instructional strategy, the teacher will review the objective for this lesson - Students will determine a central claim for an argument, organize supporting claims and evidence for each claim, and analyze the evidence that supports each claim. Activating Prior Knowledge: discussion and questioning of previous learnin g about the standard 9 -10.W.1.b Word Work: Word Work could include context analysis, questioning, discussion of word use, and application to the standard. Academic Vocabulary for Word W ork: counterclaim, refute, opposing claim , supporting claim Developing Counterclaims: Students will develop counterclaims to their central claims and supporting claims for the counterclaim Turn and Talk: Students will talk to a partner about the relationships between the claim and the counterclaim: What is the view of the counterclaim How is it refuting the central claim? Discuss: Discus s counterclaims and supporting claims with the whole class. Partner Work: Students form pairs to review their central claims on the Outline Tool and form a counterclaim to their central claim. 4 Developing Counterclaims: Direct students to the counterclaims portion of the Outline Tool. Explain to students that in this lesson, they will develop both counterclaims to their central claims and supporting claims for the counterclaim. Turn and Talk: Display the model central cl aim and counterclaim portions of the Model Outline Tool. Ask students to briefly Turn -and-Talk in pairs to discuss the following question about the relationship between the claim and counterclaim. What is the view of the counterclaim? How is it refuting th e central claim? Discussion: Lead a brief whole -class discussion on student responses. Partner Review : Instruct students to form pairs to review their central claims on the Outline Tool and form a counterclaim to their central claim. Remind students to ref er to their Research Portfolios if necessary because over the course of their research, they have encountered opposing perspectives concerning their issues. Remind students that if they have several counterclaims to consider, they should think about which counterclaim would provide a more interesting or compelling exploration of the topic. Didactic Instruction on supporting claims: Display the following supporting claims for students. Model Counterclaim: All tissue should be available for an individual to sell if it does not endanger the individual's life and would improve his or her financial situation. Claim: If an individual has a way to profit from their body, they can put themselves in a position to make a lot of money. Claim: Compensation is necessary to get tissue donations. Claim: Researchers should not be the only ones profiting from sale of human tissue. Ask student pairs to discuss the following question: Which of the claims best supports the counterclaim and why? Which supporting claim does not e ffectively support the counterclaim and why? Outline Tool : Explain to students the Outline Tool is the lesson assessment. They will be assessed on the counterclaim as well as the supporting claims, evidence, and reasoning for the counterclaim. Instruct students to record the supporting claims for the counterclaim on the \"Supporting Claim\" portion of the Outline Tool, the evidence on the \"Evidence\" portion of the Outline Tool, and the reasoning on the \"Reasoning\" portion of the Outline Tool. Discuss in partners: Which of the claims best supports the co unterclaim and why? Which supporting claim does not effectively support the counterclaim and why? Outline Tool: Record the supporting claims for the counterclaim on the \"Supporting Claim\" portion of the Outline Tool, the evidence on the \"Evidence\" porti on of the Outline Tool, and the reasoning on the \"Reasoning\" portion of the Outline Tool. The student activities are aligned to the standard 9 -10.W.1.a because students are introducing and developing counterclaims. 5 Evidence -Based Claims Criteria Checklist (for use during instruction/modeling) S.A.

Activating Prior Knowledge: Students should begin to factor polynomial expressions by first analyzing their structure, a skill that is developed throughout the lesson. Suggest that students work on their own and then compare answers with a neighbor; allow students extra time if necessary. (A2.MP.7 ) Students should notice that the structure of each of the factored polynomials is the same; for example, the factored forms of part (a) and part (b) are nearly the same, except that part (b) contains 3 in place of the in part (a). In parts (c) and (d) , the factored form of part (d) contains 2, where there is only an in part (c). The factored form of part (f) is nearly the same as the factored form of part (e), with 2 replacing and 2 replacing . The difference of two squares formula, 22=(+)(), can be used to factor an expression even when the two squares are not obvious. Consider the following examples. Example 1 Write as the product of two factors. =()()=()(+) Example 2 Factor . - Engage in anticipatory set and discuss prior knowledge - Work in groups to factor polynomial equations in one variable and participate in a class discussion by using vocabulary and terms relevant to the lesson - Work out exit ticket problems with the goal of self -assessing their own process in factoring polynomial equations in one variable Activities are aligned to the standard A2.A -SSE.A.2 because students are polynomial expressions and factoring patterns. Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 3 of 7 = ()() =(+)() = [(+)][()] =(+)() Have students discuss with each other the structure of each polynomial expression in the previous two examples and how it helps to factor the expressions. Example 3 Consider the quadratic polynomial expression 92+125. We can factor this expression by considering 3 as a single quantity as follows: 92+125= (3)2+4(3)5. Ask students to suggest the next step in factoring this expression. Now, if we rename =3, we have a quadratic expression of the form 2+ 45, which we can factor 2+45=(1)(+5). Replacing by 3, we have the following for m of our original expression: 92+125=(31)(35). 2 Objective: Students use the structure of polynomials to identify factors. Activating Prior Knowledge (A2.MP.7) Direct Instruction/Intellectual Coaching: Use the example of factoring 38 to scaffold the discussion of factoring 38. Students should be pretty familiar by now with factors of 38. Let them try the problem on their own to check their understanding. Suppose we want to factor 38. Do you see anything interesting about this expression? (A2.MP.7) If they do not notice it, guide them toward both terms being perfect cubes. We can rewrite 38 as 3-23. - Engage in anticipatory set and discuss prior knowledge - Work in groups to factor polynomial equations in one variable and participate in a class discussion by using vocabulary and terms relevant to the lesson - Work out exit ticket problems with the goal of self -assessing their own process in factoring polynomial equations in one variable Activities are aligned to the standard A2.A -SSE.A.2 bec ause students are polynomial expressions and factoring patterns.

Guided Instruction on Rewriting Rational Expressions: 1) 4x+8 4 2) 44 2+4+4 Small Group Work: Group students to work together on Exercise 2 -4. Have students put problems up on whiteboards for class to discuss. Closing Ask students to summarize the important parts of the lesson in writing, to a partner, or as a class. Use this as an opportunity t o informally assess understanding of the lesson. The following are some important summary elements. Exit ticket as student self -assessment: Students take their exit ticket independently. Teachers write solutions to exit ticket problems on board and have students assess their own work and conclusions. 1.

Apply grades 11 -12 Reading standards to informational text and nonfiction. Rhetoric: The specific techniques that writers or speakers use to create meaning in a text, enhance a text or a speech, and in particul ar, persuade readers or listeners. Point of View (an author's opinion, attitude, or judgment) : Purpose (an author's reason for wri ting) : Rhetorical device and definition Examples of the rhetorical device in the text (with paragraph or page reference) Rhetorical effect (power, persuasiveness, beauty, point of view, purpose) Parallel structure: using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas are equally important \"to be a co -worker in the kingdom of culture, to escape both death and isolation, to husband and use his best powers and his latent genius.\" (par. 5) Du Bois's use of parallel structure contributes to the p ower of his text because it emphasizes the idea that African Americans want to achieve equality, and that achieving it will help them escape \"death and isolation,\" and allow them to use their \"best and genius\" (par. 5). Allusion: an indire reference \"The shadow of a mighty Negro past flits through the tale of Ethiopia the Shadowy and of Egypt the Sphinx.\" (par. 5) These allusions contribute to the power of the text because they remind the reader of the strong and celebrated history of African Americans that has been largely forgotten or ignored. Imagery: the use of figurative language or vivid descriptions to make pictures in the reader's mind \"the powers of single black men flash here and there like falling stars\" (par. 5) Du Bois's d escription of black men as falling stars contributes to the beauty of the text because it compares African -American men to rare and extraordinary celestial elements that occur only briefly before they disappear forever. This emphasizes the tragedy of how t he important contributions of \"single black men\" (par. 5) have been overlooked.

Item #2 Analyze the effectiveness of the way Silko begins the text, including how effectively her exposition engages the reader. Item #3 Analyze how Silko's explanation of wh at happened \"[i]n the 1880s\" (par. 1) orients the reader. How does this make her argument clear and convincing? Responses will be assessed using the End-of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. Commentary on the Task: Each assessment prompt measures 11-12.RI.5 because it demands that students: Analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the structure an author uses in his or her exposition or argument, including whethe r the structure makes points clear, convincing, and engaging. Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 6 of 8 Summative Assessment High Performance Response Requirements Item #1 Analyze the effectiveness of the structure Silko uses in her exposition, including whether the structure makes points clear, convincing, and engaging. Student responses will be assessed using the 12.1.2 End -of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. High Performance Response(s) A High Performance Response should: Identify 3 -5 structural elements of \"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit\" (e.g., The essay is written in first person, and is reflec tive. The essay relies heavily on memory and flashbacks, and continually contrasts \"old -time\" stories and people with d ominant contemporary American values. Silko does not directly address the title of her essay until the final paragraphs, which creates a circular structure.). A High Performance Response may include the following evidence in support of a multi -paragraph analysis: The essay is written in the first person and uses flashbacks to relate personal experiences (e.g., \"One day, when I was in th e first grade, we all crowded around the smiling white tourists\" (par. 8)). Silko's use of first person and flashbacks i s engaging because it feels as if Silko is speaking directly to the reader, engaging with her past in an inviting way. Silko titles her essay \"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit,\" but does not reference \"Yellow Woman,\" or Kochininako, unti l the final paragraphs of her essay, creating a circular structure. Silko begins focusing on herself with the statement \"From the time I was a small child, I was aware that I was different\" (par. 1). She recalls how her racial differences made her stand out, but how the \"old -time people\" never saw her as worth less than anyone else (par. 3). She then recounts several \"old stories,\" some of them personal and some of them mythical, ending finally with stories about \"Yellow Woman.\" She clarifies for the reader that in these stories, beauty is seen as an inward manifestation more so than an outward one: \"remember that the old -time people were not so much thinking about physical appearances. In each story, the beauty that Yellow Woman possesses is the beauty of her passion, her daring, and her sheer strength to act when catastrophe is immin ent\" (par. 26). After describing Yellow Woman, Silko writes that she \"even imagined that Yellow Woman had yellow skin, brown hair , and green eyes like mine\" (par. 30). Here, she conflates Yellow Woman's beauty and her own, giving the title of the essay more than one meaning. \"Yellow Woman\" refers both to Kochininako and Silko herself, and the \"beauty of the spirit\" belongs to both of them \u2014indeed, to \"all women\" (par. 32). The circular structure makes her claims about inner beauty more clear because the reader can trace the idea consistently through all the stories of the text. The circular structure also makes Silko's claims about beauty more engaging because the stories of beauty vary from personal family experiences to interesting mythical stories, ultimately including all women in the defini tion of beauty. Silko relies heavily on reflection, often referencing her Grandma A'moo h, and the \"old -time people.\" Like memory, her account is very fluid, often moving onto a new story or claim by simple association. However, at times, Silko's memory shifts are jarring in their juxtaposition. For exampl e, she discusses \"Tse'itsi'nako\" and then abruptly shifts to discussing the appearance of her great -grandmother (par. 10 -11). Also, when she is recounting stories of Yellow Woman, she inserts a jarring memory: At first Silko writes, \"Thus Kochininako's fearless sensuality results in the sa lvation of the people of her village, who are saved by the meat the Buffalo People 'give' to them\" (par. 27). Silko then immediately follows this story with the following sentences: \"My father taught me and my sisters to shoot .22 rifles when we were seve n; I went hunting with my father when I was eight, and I killed my first mule deer buck when I was thirteen. The Kochininako stori es were always my favorite because Yellow Woman had so many adventures\" (par. 28). This memory is relevant, but Silko makes no effort to transition in or out of it; it simply appears. Silko uses juxtaposition to imitate how memory works in people's minds \u2014seemingly unconnected scenes appear one after the other. This structural choice engages the reader because it feels as if the reader is invited into Silko's memory. The juxtaposition of stories also engages the reader becaus e it is jarring, and the reader must make sense of how the two st ories fit together. Summative Assessment High Performance Response Requirements Summative Assessment High Performance Response Requirements Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 7 of 8 Item #2 Item #3 Assessment(s) Analyze the effectiveness of the way Silko begins the text. Student responses will be assessed using the 12.1.2 End -of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. High Performance Response(s) A High Performance Response should: Describe an aspect of the way Silko begins the text (e.g., In her first sentence, Silko observes that \"[f]rom the time [she] was a small child, [she] was aware that [she] was different\" (par. 1).). Explain whether or not and why the way Silko begins the text is effective (e.g., Because this observation indicates that Silko has struggled with this awareness of difference \"[f]rom the time [she] was a small child\" (par. 1), th e reader instantly understands its importance to Silko. By setting out such a personal and significant observation in the very first sentence, Silko immediately engages the reader by making him or her curious about why Silko \"was different\" (par. 1) and ho w she has experienced it over the course of her life. Directly following the observation of her difference, Silko reaches further back in time before her childhood and explains that her great -grandfather was white and \"married [a] full -blood Laguna Pueblo wom[a]n\" (par. 1). Through sharing her family history, Silko clarifies why she and her sisters \"didn't look quite like the other Laguna Pueblo children, but [they] didn't look quite white either\" (par. 1). Including this information helps clarify why Silko 's appearance as both white and Indian is a significant issue for Silko to discuss. Though the reader understands by the end of the first paragraph why Silko \"was different\" (par. 1), the reader remains curious about why this difference is significant to S ilko.). Assessment(s) Analyze how Silko's explanation of what happened \"[i]n the 1880s\" (par. 1) orient s the reader . How does this make her argument clear and convincing? Student responses will be assessed using the 12.1.2 End -of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. High Performance Response(s) A High Performance Response should: Analyze how Silko's explanation orients the reader Explain how the explanation makes her argument clear and convincing. Silko orients the reader by going back to a time before she was born to explain the reason for her difference, why she and her sisters \"didn't look quite like the other Laguna Pueblo children, but [they] didn't look quite white either\" (par . 1). Her great - grandfather was white \"married full -blood Laguna Pueblo wom[a]n\" (par . 1). Silko explains that the white side of her family or iginally came to where the Laguna Pueblo lived to \"survey the land for the U.S. government\" and \"send[] Indian children thousands of miles away from their families\" (par . 1). Including this information orients the reader by helping clarify why Silko's appe arance as both white and Indian is a significant issue for Silko to discuss.

Didactic Writing Instruction: Engaging and Orienting the Reader The introduction to a personal narrative should establish a relationship between the narrator and the reader, and orient the read er to the problems or events that will be addressed in the rest of the narrative. Intellectual Coaching: What does it mean to \"engage\" a reader? What does it mean to \"orient\" a reader? Why does an author need to engage and orient their reader? According to standard 11-12.W.3.a, how might the author engage and orient the reader? Intellectual Coaching: Instruct students to turn to the opening paragraph of chapter 1 in The Autobiography of Malcolm X and consider how the first paragraph engages and orients the reader. Making Connections : Explain to students that they should provide the same level of information and vivid detail in their own introductions to orient and engage the reader with the text. However, the scope of their personal narratives may focus on a much shorter amount of time and the events may be less intense than Malcolm X's experiences.

If this sounds like you, then please share your story. If my life to date were a novel, the motif would be shoes . Shoes have made a huge impact on my life in ways varied and unexpected. In fact, a passion for shoes is a family trait. My father was a lo ng-distance runner and an early athletic shoe aficionado. He later became the CFO of an athletic shoe manufacturer where he help ed develop some of the first high-tech running shoes. Following in my father's footsteps, I acquired a great passion for learnin g about athletic shoes and I now have an impressive collection to match. Shoes have shaped my college and career plans, but their impact goes even deeper. Studying and collecting athletic shoes has taught me the value of a hard -earned dollar. When I was f ourteen, my mom gave me an ultimatum: \"Dad and I have been looking at the bills, and we have decided that unless you would like to eat shoes, you will have to get a job.\" I looked at the meticulously stacked shoeboxes towering over the rest of my room and made some quick calculations. \"I see your point,\" I replied. So I spent my summer poolside, not lounging around with a tall glass of lemonade, but standing over a deep fryer slinging fri es and onion rings at my community pool's snack bar. I faithfully sav ed half of every paycheck for college, and just as faithfully spent the other half on shoes. Pairs of slim metallic gold Air Max, orange filigree -embossed Foamposites, and a rare tie -dyed mash up of fabrics branded as \"What the Dunk\" all made their way int o my collection. By the end of that summer, I had enough stock in my collection that I decided to become a self -employed shoe entrepreneur, buying and selling shoes online at a handsome profit. I camped overnight in Center City Philadelp hia to get a prime place in line to purchase highly -coveted sneakers. I made some savvy investments, but I was also conned in an ill -advised Craigslist deal with an unscrupulous buyer. The challenges, rewards, and thrills of running a small business have fueled my decision t o major in business. A shared passion for shoes creates an instant connection with people I meet, whether in a suburban shopping mall or a trendy neon -lit Los Angeles sneaker store. I have learned that in some places, shoes are not a fashion statement or a status symbol. Rather, shoes enable a child to make an arduous trek to school and surmount a potential education barrier. When I first learned about the nonprofit organization, In Ian's Boots, I knew I found a way to unite my shoe passion with my mission to contribute positively to the world around me. Founded by the grieving parents of a fellow soccer goalie killed in a sledding accident, In Ian's Boots collects used sho es for people in need around the world. Doctors found a biblical message in his boots urging \"perseverance,\" and this story and message spoke to me. Last year, I hosted a drive and collected over 600 pairs of sh oes, some of which have been distributed to Honduras, Ghana, and Haiti. I am eager to continue my life's journey at a college where my passion, entrepreneurial spirit, and desire to effect social change can be ignited by a powerful educational experience. I can only imagine all the places my shoes will take me next. "}
