Variants are different versions of the virus. Monovalent COVID -19 vaccines : Vaccinations designed to protect against the original virus that causes COVID- 19. Bivalent COVID -19 vaccines : Vaccinations that protect against both the original virus that causes COVID -19 AND the Omicron variant and subvariants . Primary Series: The first COVID- 19 vaccines receive d. Up to Date : Adults and children aged 6 years and older are up to date with COVID -19 vaccines if they got a bivalent COVID -19 vaccine. See page 8 for additional details. Adverse Event : An y undesirable experience associated with the us e of a medical product. Antibodies: proteins that the human body makes to fight organisms like bacteria and viruses, including the virus that causes COVID- 19. Monoclonal Antibodies : Laboratory -made proteins that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off viruses like COVID- 19. Public Health Emergency (PHE): An event or imminent threat of an illness or health condition, either natural or manmade, that poses a substantial health risk to the public. Cost Sharing : When people pay for a portion of health care costs such as deductibles, co - insurance, and co -payments. Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP): Government -funded health insurance for children of uninsured families that do not qualify for Medicaid. Telehealth/telemedicine: H ealth care services provided remotely (via computer or phone) in place of an in- person office visit with a health care provider . Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ): A group of medical and public health experts that develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the civilian population of the United States. Vaccines for Children (VFC ): A federally funded and state -operated program that provides vaccines at no cost to children who might otherwise not be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Long COVID: An umbrella term for the wide range of physical and mental health consequences experienced by some patients that are present four or more weeks after SARS -CoV-2 infection, including by patients who had initial mild or asymptomatic acute infection. Other names for long covid include Post -COVID Conditions, long -haul COVID, post -acute COVID -19, long -term effects of COVID, and chronic COVID. The term post-a cute sequelae of SARS CoV -2 infection (PASC) is also used to refer to a subset of Long COVID. Commercialization - the transition of COVID- 19 medical countermeasures, including vaccines, treatments, and test kits previously purchased by the U.S. Government (USG), to established pathways of procurement, distribution, and payment by both public and private payers . Page | 3 The Public Health Emergency (PHE) Declaration In response to the public health crisis created by the rapid spread of COVID- 19, the fed eral government declared a PHE on January 31, 2020. Although COVID -19 remains a public health priority, the federal government will be ending the PHE effective May 11, 2023. Since 2020, widespread prevention and control measures like vaccinations have helped in transitioning away from the emergency or crisis phase to a new era in the pandemic. Ending the COVID- 19 PHE does not mean the virus has been eliminated. The CDC remains dedicated to preventing severe illness and death from COVID -19, particularly for high -risk populations . What changes to COVID -19 services and treatments will occur once the public health emergency ends on May 11, 2023? Once the federal supply of COVID -19 tests, treatments and vaccines run s out, coverage for the costs of these services and supplies will vary depending upon the type of insurance people have (e.g., private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, underinsured/uninsured). It is important to note that the CDC is working with other government agencies to maintain equ itable access to COVID -19 vaccines, testing and treatment. Health care providers received maximum flexibility to streamline delivery and allow access to care during the PHE. While some of these changes will be permanent or extended due to Congressional action, some waivers and flexibilities will expire, as they were intended to respond to the rapidly evolving pandemic, not to permanently replace standing rules. How will data reporting be affected once the PHE ends ? Some surveillance metrics have remained the same such as demographic case data, long COVID sentinel surveillance, vaccine coverage, safety, and effectiveness as well as, wastewater surveillance . Metrics that have changed in terms of reporting frequency, data sources or availability can be found on CDC's COVID Data Tracker . The homepage has a new look, and there are als o new landing pages for hospitalizations , emergency department (ED) visits , and death data, as well as visualizations of trends and maps . Several pages have also been retired, but COVID Data Tracker has a page with links to archived data and visualizations . For more information, visit COVID -1 9 Surveillance After Expiration of the Public Health Emergency Declaration United States, May 11, 2023 | MMWR (cdc.gov) Fact Sheet : COVID -19 Public Health Emergency Transition Roadmap | HHS.gov , and COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review | CDC. What do health care providers need to know about the CDC's new division known as the Coronavirus and other Respiratory Viruses Division (CRVD)? Page | 4 CRVD's mission is to prevent disease, disability, and death through immunization and control of coronaviruses, respiratory, and other related viral diseases. To learn more about this new division, visit, Federal Register: Establishment of the Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division Has the presidential proclamation regarding global travel changed? No. CDC's amended order , implementing the presidential proclamation on the s afe resumption of global travel during the COVID- 19 pandemic , will remain in effect until terminated by the President . For more information visit, Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID -19 Pandemic . Once the public health emergency ends, does this mean that COVID -19 is gone? Ending the emergency declaration does not mean that COVID- 19 is gone. The CDC continue s to advise that everyone stay up to date with their COVID- 19 vaccines, wear a mask during times when COVID- 19 levels are high, stay ho me if you think you are sick, and continue to use at- home testing if you are sick or may have been exposed. These precautions are the best practices for protecting everyone as the pandemic continues to evolve. For more information, patients can visit How to Protect Yourself and Others | CDC . For details about the PHE ending, visit COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review | CDC and CMS Waivers, Flexibilities, and the Transition Forward from the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency | CMS and Fact Sheet: COVID -19 Public Health Emergency Transition Roadmap | HHS.gov . People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have diff erent recommendations for COVID -19 vaccinations . General Vaccine Information Is a COVID -19 vaccine necessary ? COVID -19 can be a minor illness in some or lead to severe disease or even death in previously healthy people. This means everyone should take the virus seriously \u2014 if not for themselves, then for those around them. Many treatments and medications are being studied, but there is no cure. Prevention is key . Vaccination is an important step in helping to prevent this illness and its potentially devastating consequences. COVID -19 vaccine recommendations are based on three things: Age The vaccine that was first receive d, and; The length of time that has passed since the last dose. What vaccines are approved or authorized for use? The following are the COVID -19 vaccines available in the United States: Page | 5 Pfizer and Moderna : The FDA no longer authorizes use of these monovalent vaccines in the United States , only the bivalent vaccine is authorized. Novavax Note that all Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID -19 vaccines are expired as of May 6, 2023, and are no longer used in the U.S. For current information on the types and use of COVID- 19 vaccines available, visit Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines | CDC a nd Coronavirus (COVID -19) Update: FDA Authorizes Changes to Simplify Use of Bivalent mRNA CO VID-19 Vaccines | FDA. Are the COVID -19 vaccines given to children the same as the vaccines given to adults? The COVID -19 vaccines for children have the same active ingredients as the vaccines given to adults. However, some children receive a smaller, age -appropriate dose that is the right size for them. The smaller doses were rigorously tested and found to create the needed immune response for each age group. C hildren should get the vaccine made for their age group. For vaccine product presentations (age of use, storage and handling, cap color), visit summary of clinical considerations . Why should children receive the COVID -19 vaccine? Just like adults, children can become severely ill from COVID -19, be hospitalized, and even die. Children can experience short - and long -term health complications that can affect their mental and physical health and quality of life. There is no way to predict if a child will develop a severe or mild case of COVID -19.Even healthy children without underlying medical conditions can get severe COVID- 19 or suffer from long -term health complications. Vaccinating this younger age group helps lessen the strain on families by providing greater confidence with children participating in childcare , school, and other activities. COVID -19 vaccination reduces the strain on the health care system. Children who have previously had COVID -19 should still get vaccinated, as vaccination offers added protection. For more information about COVID -19 vaccines and children , cons ider sharing the following information with your patients : Protect your child with COVID -19 vaccine , for location of vaccines, have them visit, covid19.nj.gov/finder , or call the COVID -19 Vaccine Call Center at 855- 568-0545. Effective June 1, 2023, the NEW call center hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. The call center will be closed for all federal holidays . What do health care providers need to know about treating people with Long COVID? Based on current information, many Post -COVID Conditions can be managed by primary care providers, using patient -centered approaches to optimize the quality of life and function of affected patients. Page | 6 Understanding of Post -COVID Conditions remains incomple te. The approach to caring for patients with Post- COVID Conditions will likely change over time as evidence accumulates. For more information visit, Post -C OVID Conditions: Information for Healthcare Providers (cdc.gov). How can my patients get vaccinated? There are multiple ways to get an appointment: 1. Use the NJ Vaccine Appointment Finder to find vaccination locations near you with available appointments. 2. Attend a pop-up or mobile vaccination event in your community. 3. Register with the NJ Vaccine Scheduling System (NJVSS) to be notified when an appointment is available to you at vaccine locations that use the State's v accine scheduling system. If you need assistance registering with the NJVSS, call 855-568- 0545. 4. Seniors 65+ can call the senior -specific hotline at 855- 429-1168 to schedule dedicated vaccine appointments . 5. Veterans, their spouses, and their caregivers may be eligible for vaccines through the VA. Learn more. Note: Please verify requirements with a vaccination site before visiting or making an appointment. Some require proof of residency within a specific county or municipality. In addition, minors must have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to be vaccinated. I have some patients who are homebound. Will they be able to receive the COVID -19 vaccine? A person who is homebound or their health care provider/caregiver may request an in -home vaccination appointment by completing a form at covid19.nj.gov/homeboundvax (English) or covid19.nj.gov/homeboundvax -es (Spanish). For assistance completing the form by phone, call the NJ COVID -19 Vaccine Call Center at 1- 855- 568-0545. Can you tell me more about the NJVSS? W ill my patient's information be kept private ? The NJVSS is a secure online website developed by the NJ Department of Health for public health purposes. The system allows people to sign-up so they can make a COVID - 19 vaccine appointment at a vaccination location most convenient for them . Individuals will be asked to provide personal information (name, address, gender, race, and email), medical screening , and occupation information. This helps to determine eligibility for the vaccine . NJVSS will send the individual e -mail reminders about their appointment. For more information, visit NJVSS . Page | 7 Some of my patients used the NJVSS to receive the vaccine at my facility. Who do I contact for technical assistance with using NJVSS? Providers should email NJVaxReporting@doh.nj.gov for any issues or questions relating to NJVSS. I have patients who lost their COVID -19 vaccination card or need additional proof of vaccination. What advice can you give them? Patients may be able to get another copy of their COVID -19 vaccine card at the site where they were vaccinated; however, not all sites provide this service and some locations have closed . Alternatively, you can print your patient's official immunization record for them. Please include the COVID -19 vaccine lot number for the patient. The official record will list all vaccines that your patient has received and the dates of administration. Another option is for individuals to download the Docket mobile app (COVID -19 vaccines only). For more information, visit , How to use the docket app . Individuals can also submit a request to NJIIS. For specific instructions, have patients visit request an immunization record . Where can my patients find information on public transportation to vaccine locations? Through the Department's VAXRIDE initiative, NJ TRANSIT supports New Jerseyans in their efforts to get vaccinated against COVID -19. Visit Vax ride, NJ Transit to find vaccination sites that are conveniently served by NJ TRANSIT bus, train, and light rail routes. In addition, NJ 211 is offering free rides to and from vaccination sites in partnership with United Way Worldwide and Lyft. Rides are available wherever Lyft operates in New Jersey and are available to everyone , including those with collapsible wheelchairs and walkers. To request a free ride, call 211 or text 898 -211, or visit nj211.org to learn more. Number of Doses \u2014For Most People (General Population) Have there been updates with COVID -19 vaccine recommendations and products ? Yes, the CDC has issued updated recommendations to shift all administrations of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID- 19 vaccines to bivalent rather than monovalent doses. This move will help simplify the vaccination process moving forward. Who is eligible to receive the bivale nt vaccine ? The CDC recommends that everyone 6 years and older receive a bivalent mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine, regardless of whether they previously completed their (monovalent) primary series. The new recommendations allow for one additional bivalent vaccine dose for adults ages 65 years and older, at least four months after receiving their first bivalent dose and for those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised , a second dose of a bivalent vaccine at least two months apart. Page | 8 For young children, multiple doses continue to be recommended and will vary by age, vaccine, and which vaccines were previously received. For more details regarding specific dosing for children 6 months through 5 years, please see table one, Clinical Guidance for COVID -19 Vaccination | CDC . For more information visit, Coronavirus (COVID -1 9) Update: FDA Authorizes Changes to Simplify Use of Bivalent mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines | FDA and Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) (cdc.gov) For specific information regarding Moderna and Pfizer, visit Important Prescribing Information for Moderna, FDA , Important Prescribing Information for Pfizer FDA and Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID- 19 Vaccines | CDC Going forward , how w ill providers know if patients are up to date with their COVID -19 vaccinations? Adults, and children 6 years and older are up to date with COVID -19 vaccines if they have received one bivalent mRNA dose. 6 months through 5 years (who received the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine) are up to date if : -They are 6 months to 4 years of age and received at least three COVID -19 vaccine doses, including at least one bivalent COVID -19 vaccine dose . -They are 5 years of age and received at least one bivalent vaccine dose. 6 months through 5 years (who received the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine) are up to date if they received at least two Moderna COVID -19 vaccine doses, including one bivalent COVID -19 vaccine dose. CDC and ACIP will continue to monitor COVID -19 disease levels and vaccine effectiveness in the months ahead and look forward to additional discussion around potential updates. For all age groups, current data reveals that vaccination continues to be the best protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by COVID- 19. Continue to encourage eligible individuals to get vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine. Is Novavax still an alternative to mRNA COVID -19 vaccin es? Who is eligible to receive it ? Novavax remain s available for people who cannot or will not receive an mRNA vaccine . The monovalent Novavax COVID -19 vaccine remains authorized for use as a two -dose primary series and as a booster dose in certain limited situations. People ages 12 years and older who previously received one or two monovalent Novavax COVID -19 primary series dose(s) are recommended to receive one bivalent mRNA vaccine dose. How should providers handle expired doses of the Johnson &Johnson/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine which expired on May 6, 2023? For information about vaccine storage and handling, please refer to \"Vaccine Storage and Handling, located on page 19 of this document. Page | 9 For more information regarding Janssen, see appendix A, Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines: Appendices, References, and Previous Updates | CDC and Novavax COVID -19 Vaccine Local Reactions, Systemic Reactions, Adverse Events, and Serious Adverse Events (cdc.gov) What are the considerations for extended interval s for COVID -19 vaccine doses? An eight -week interval between the first and second doses of bivalent Moderna, monovalent Novavax and bivalent Pfizer COVID -19 vaccines might be optimal for some people as it might reduce the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with these COVID -19 vaccines. While absolute risk remains small, an elevated risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed among mRNA COVID -19 vaccine recipients, particularly in males ages 12 to39 years). Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were identified in clinical trials of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine and through passive surveillance during post- authorization use outside the United States. Under the current COVID -19 vaccination schedule, the extended interval of eight weeks, applies only to children, 6 months through 5 years, depending on their vaccination history and which mRNA vaccine is administered , and people 12 years and older receiving Novavax vaccine. COVID -19 vaccines are FDA -approved or FDA -authorized for a three -week (i.e., Novavax and Pfizer) and four -week (i.e., Moderna) interval between the first and second primary series doses. These shor ter intervals continue to be recommended for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, adults ages 65 years and older, and in situations when the fullest possible protection needs to be achieved sooner (e.g., increased concern about an individu al's higher risk for severe disease). For more information visit, COVID -19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis . Is interchangeability between vaccines recommended? The following is recommended: Children ages 6 months through 5 years who are unvaccinated and are recommended to receive more than one bivalent mRNA vaccine dose for initial vaccination should receive all doses from the same manufacturer. People who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised and previously initiated vaccination with a monovalent mRNA vaccine, specifically: o Children ages 6 months through 4 years who previously received one or more doses of a monovalent mRNA vaccine are authorized to receive only bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (s) from the same manufacture r. People aged five years who previously received one or more doses of : o Monovalent Moderna COVID -19 vaccine are authorized to receive either bivalent Moderna or bivalent Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine. Page | 10 o Monovalent Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine are authorized to receive only bivalent Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine . People ages 6 years and older who previously received one or more do ses of a monovalent mRNA vaccine are authorized to receive either bivalent Moderna or bivalent Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine The COVID vaccination schedules for People who are n ot moderately or severely immunocompromised should be consulted for age -s pecific information. For more information visit Clinical Guidance for COVID -19 Vaccination | CDC How do we vaccinate children who are turning 4 to 5 years of age during their vaccine series? CDC recommends that people receive the age -appropriate vaccine dosage based on their age on the day of vaccination. If a person moves from a younger age group to an older age group during the primary series or b etween the primary series and receipt of the bivalent dose, they should receive the vaccine dosage for the older age group for all subsequent doses with the following exception: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization requires that children who receive the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine and transition from age 4 years to 5 years during the primary series must complete the series they start. For more information visit, table 1 Clinical Guidance for COVID -19 Vaccination | and Pfizer - COVID -19 Vaccines | FDA. Immunocompromised (Weakened Immune Systems) Why are vaccines important for those with weakened immune systems? Those people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) have an increased risk of severe COVID -19 illness and death. Additionally, the immune response to COVID -19 vaccination may not be as strong as in people who are not immunocompromised. People with weakened immune systems might be eligible for additional doses of COVID -19 vaccines. Have there been updates with COVID -19 vaccine recommendations and products? Yes, revision of the bivalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccination schedule for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised is as follows: People ages 6 months and older who are unvaccinated are recommended to receive three bivalent mRNA doses. People ages 6 months and older who previously received only monovalent doses are recommended to receive one or two bivalent mRNA vaccine doses, depending on age and vaccine product. People who previously received a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose(s) have the option to receive one or more additional bivalent mRNA doses . Page | 11 To assist healthcare providers, the COVID -19 vaccination schedule for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised ( Table 2 ) provides detailed age -specific guidance. The EUAs UAs for Moderna and Pfizer COVID -19 vaccines allow healthcare providers flexibility for use of vaccine products, number of doses, dosage, and intervals between doses; alternative schedules within the parameters of the EU As may be appropriate based on individual circumstances and clinical judgement. People who are or who become moderately or severely immunocompromised should follow the COVID -19 vaccination schedule according to their age and immune status at the time of eligibility for that dose; see Considerations for timing of COVID- 19 v accination in relation to immunosuppressive therapies f or vaccination of people who will shortly become moderately or severely immunocompromised (e.g., prior to organ transplant) and Considerations for COVID - 19 revaccination . Clinical Guidance for COVID -19 Vaccination | CDC Vaccine Approval/ Safety Considerations Is Pfizer vaccine increasing the risk of adults 65 years and older having ischemic stroke (blood clots or particles blocking blood flow to parts of the brain)? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC use multiple safety monitoring databases to detect any possible COVID -19 vaccine side effects. Only one of these monitoring databases, the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), picked up a \"signal\" or notification, indicating a possible risk of ischemic stroke in adults 65 and older who received the Pfizer bivalent booster within 21 days following vaccination. The same signal or notification was not detected with the Moderna bivalent booster or any of the other COVID -19 monovalent primary series or monovalent booster vaccines. Given all the evidence, it is very unlikely that the signal in VSD represents a true risk to people who receive the vaccine. CDC and FDA will continue to investigate this occurrence ; however, there are no changes in COVID -19 vaccine recommendations. Staying up to date with vaccines is the most effective tool we have for reducing death, hospi talization, and severe illness from COVID -19. For more information, visit the CDC's preliminary safety signal for people 65 and older . Can the COVID -19 vaccines cause people to die suddenly? There is no evidence supporting the claim that people vaccinated against COVID -19 are more likely to die compared to unvaccinated people. In fact, the evidence indicates otherwise. The CDC takes the reports of sudden deaths seriously. Health care providers are required to report any death after COVID -19 vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it is unclear whether the vaccine was the cause . Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. For more information , visit Selected Adverse Events Reported after COVID -19 Vaccination | CDC . Page | 12 When trying to identify legitimate reports of vaccine saf ety or adverse events, it is important to check that the source is credible. While the Internet is a useful tool for researching health - related issues, it should not replace a discussion with a subject matter expert. For more information, visit CDC finding credible vaccine information website. COVID -19 vaccines are safe, effective, and supported by the FDA's rigorous scientific standards as well as evaluation during clinical trials where tens of thousands of people participated. Some people will have side effects , which often are mild; severe side effects are rare. What are the side effects of COVID -19 vaccine? Some people may have no side effects . If side effects do occur, they are typically mild and go away in one to two days \u2014 like soreness in the arm, fatigue, headaches, or a slight fever. Severe allergic reactions after getting a COVID -19 vaccine are rare. Individuals who are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) should not get Pfizer or Mod erna COVID -19 vaccine. Individuals allergic to polysorbate should not get Novavax or J&J/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine. What about heart problems? The risk of having a serious reaction to the COVID -19 vaccine is very low. Rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported. New studies have shown the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with mRNA COVID -19 vaccinatio n\u2014mostly among males between the ages of 12 and 39 years \u2014may be further reduced with a longer time between the first and second dose. Getting the COVID -19 vaccine is much safer than getting sick with COVID -19 illness. For more information, visit COVID -19 Safety and Monitoring, CDC . What is the difference between Emergency Use Authorization and full approval? In an emergency when lives are at risk, like a pandemic, it may not be possible to have all the evidence that the FDA would usually have before approving a vaccine or drug. If there's evidence that strongly suggests that patients have beneted from a treatment, the agency can issue an EUA to make it available. For the COVID -19 vaccines, FDA required two months of safety and efficacy data before the EUA was granted. That included clinical trials with tens of thousands of people and rigorous testing and review, and all the vaccines continue to be closely monitored. Comp ared to EUA , full FDA approval of vaccines requires even more data on safety, manufacturing, and effectiveness over longer periods of time and includes real- world data. Is there a package insert or Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) along with an EUA? When FDA authorizes emergency use of a medical product such as an anticipated COVID- 19 vaccine, an EUA Fact Sheet for Health care Providers (in place of a package insert typical of a licensed vaccine) and an EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients (akin to product information for patients or a CDC -provided VIS for a licensed vaccine) must be provided to the health care providers prescribing and/or administering the authorized medical product. The health care Page | 13 providers, in turn, provide the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients to vaccine recipients or their guardians. These fact sheets are available at COVID -19 Vaccines, FDA . What is the difference between the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)? When FDA authorizes a vaccine for use under an EUA, providers and public health entities involved in vaccine administration are legally required to provide the FDA -authorized EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients to individuals receiving vaccine or their guardians , similar to VISs that are also required by law for certain licensed vaccines. The EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients, like the VIS, explains the benefits and risks associated with the vaccine. U nlike a VIS, the EUA fact sheet also provides vaccine product -spec ific information, including the vaccine's authorized use, dose/dose -series, and known information or experience with the vaccine from clinical trials that support issuance of the EUA by FDA. Providers can provide the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients (or VIS if/when the COVID -19 vaccine is licensed) in a variety of ways, including hard copy, online, video, or other electronic means of dissemination. What are Emergency Use Instructions (EUI)? EUI allows certain uses of FDA- approved medical products that are needed during public health emergencies without the FDA needing to issue an EUA. CDC issued EUI for use of the bivalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccine s by Pfizer and Moderna . The EUI are necessary be cause these uses extend beyond their FDA -approved labeling. It is strongly suggested that providers provide EUI prior to vaccine administration . For additional information and to download the most current EUI , visit : Emergency Dispensing Orders and Emergency Use Instructions (EUI) | FDA What safety monitoring is in place for these vaccines? For COVID -19 vaccines, CDC and federal partners use a toolbox of existing and new monitoring systems for COVID -19 vaccine safety. CDC rely on existing systems that monitor the safety of vaccines every day : the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS ), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project. CDC has also developed a new, voluntary smartphone -based tool, v -safe, that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check -ins after patients receive a COVID -19 vaccination. CDC has also expanded its collaboration with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to include a special ACIP COVID -19 Vaccine Safety Technical Sub -Group to review available vaccine safety data. For more information, visit COVID -19 Safety and Monitoring, CDC . Page | 14 What is the difference between VAERS and v- safe? VAERS is the reporting mechanism for any adverse events. Specifically related to COVID -19 vaccination, providers will be required to report: Vaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not) ; Serious adverse events . Multisys tem inflammatory syndrome . Cases of COVID -19 that result in hospitalization or death after the recipient has received COVID -19 vaccine . Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including patients, family members, health care providers, vaccine manufacturers and the general public. VAERS cannot determine if a vaccine caused an adverse event but can determine if further investigation is needed. Additional information is available at the VAERS website : Vaccine Adverse Events | FDA V-safe is an optional smartphone -based tool that anyone who has received a vaccination can register for. At the time of vaccination, everyone receiving a vaccine will be given information about signing up for v -safe. Anyone reporting a clinically important even t during any v -safe health check will receive a phone call from the VAERS hotline, and if applicable, a VAERS report will be taken during that call. V -safe also collect s information on pregnancy status and enables follow -up on pregnant women. For more information, visit V-safe Frequently Asked Questions and Troubleshooting | Vaccine Safety | CDC . Will the COVID -19 vaccine affect the menstrual cycle? Results from recent research studies show that people who menstruate may observe small, temporary changes in menstruation after COVID -19 vaccination, including: Longer duration of menstrual periods . Shorter intervals between periods . Heavier bleeding than usual. Despite thes e temporary changes in menstruation, there is no evidence that COVID -19 vaccines cause fertility problems. Should people who are pregnant or breastfeeding receive the COVID -19 vaccine? Yes. A recent, large -scale study showed that pregnant individuals with COVID- 19 who were not vaccinated for COVID -19, were at a much higher risk for developing serious illness and complications than pregnant wom en who were vaccinated for COVID- 19. COVID -19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. Getting a COVID- 19 vaccine can protect pregnant individuals and their unborn children from severe illness and pregnancy complications from COVID -19. For more information, visit Pregnant and Recently Pregnant People | CDC , COVID -19 Vaccines While Pregnant or Breastfeeding and Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID- 19 Vaccines, CDC. Page | 15 What are the contraindications for (reasons for not rece iving) COVID -19 vaccination? A severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose or component of the vaccine is a contraindication for receiving any of the COVID -19 vaccines. People with an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should not receive additional doses of either of the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. CDC has provided a chart to assist in the evaluation of immediate reactions to vaccination: Use of COVID -19 Vaccines in the US, CDC . COVID -19 Vaccine Enrollment How can I become a COVID -19 provider? The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) began accepting new COVID- 19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement applications through NJIIS in June 2021.

You can't: Balance bill for COVID -19 vaccinations ; Charge your patients for an office visit or other fee if COVID -19 vaccination is the only medical service given ; or Require additional medical or other services during the visit as a condition for getting a COVID -19 vaccination . For more information, visit the Medicare Billing for COVID -19 Vaccine Shot Administration and CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Requirements and Support pages. Can providers bill insurance plans or other programs for an office visit when administering COVID -19 vaccine? Yes, providers can bill insurance plans or other programs for an office visit when administering COVID -19 vaccine if the visit meets the criteria for office visit coding under a recipient's plan. Has there been a change with the NJIIS opt- in process? Yes, Governor Murphy signed Executive Order (EO 207) to change NJIIS from an opt- in to an opt-out system. If someone chooses to receive the COVID -19 vaccine, their doses will be automatically entered into NJIIS. For more information, visit Keeping Track of Vaccines, NJIIS . Providers are required to enter all administered COVID - 19 doses into NJIIS. Do I have to manually enter data? NJIIS has four ways to send data to NJIIS : Manual data entry, HL7 interface, Upload Excel file, and NJVSS. Data may be entered manually. Once a staff member has completed the COVID- 19 training, they will be able to log into NJIIS with their username and password to manually enter COVID -19 doses into NJII S. If you have an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and wish to establish an interface with NJIIS, please complete the Interface NJIIS enrollment request form . NJIIS can receive immunization data directly from a provider's office EHR system via HL7 version 2.5.1 standard messaging protocol. The t ime it takes to establish an interface will vary based on issues with data submissions or errors in formatting of the messages. The Excel reporting format is available as an intermediate step while setting up an interface. Excel upload is only for COVID -19 doses. If you would like a n Excel upload, complete the Interface Enrollment Form. This form can be found on the NJIIS page under the I nterface Enrollment section. Page | 18 Vaccine Storage and Handling Now that monovalent vaccines are no longer approved for use in the United States , how should providers handle monovalent vaccines? Remove all monovalent mRNA vaccine (Pfizer and Moderna) from storage units immediately, even if they are not expired . This includes both EUA and BLA products (Comirnaty and Spikevax). Mark everything \"DO NOT USE\" to prevent administration errors. Dispose of all monovalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccine vials as regulated medical waste. Once all inventory is fully accounted for in NJIIS, remove monovalent mRNA C OVID -19 vaccine from the vaccine inventory in NJIIS. Use the category under waste \"Other - Unauthorized\" . How do we transact out monovalent vaccine? First, make sure that all the doses that were administered to patients have decremented from your inventory and we re reported appropriately. Look in your facility's inventory for any monovalent NDC Codes. Navigate into each Lot and transact out remaining doses using the waste category \"Other - Unauthorized\". For information regarding COVID -19 vaccine products, visit IIS COVID -1 9 Vaccine Related Code | CDC , Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines: Appendices, Refere nces, and Previous Updates | CDC and Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID -19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools (immunize.org) .. Is the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine expiring soon? Yes, all remaining doses of J&J/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine in the United States expire d on May 6, 2023. All channels should prepare to clear their COVID -19 vaccine inventory of J&J/Janssen and discontinue further administration of this vaccine. For information about disposal of expired vaccine, visit Operational S ummary for Iden tifying, Disposing, and Reporting COVID -19 Vaccine Wastage l CDC and The CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Agreement . Should jurisdictions invest in ultra -cold storage units at this time? Jurisdictions are not required to purchase ultra -cold storage units. Many COVID -19 vaccines do have allowances for regular freezer or refrigerator storage. Ultra -cold storage is the preferred storage for the Pfizer COVID- 19 vaccine since it supports the longest shelf life; however, the Pfizer grey, orange, and maroon caps can be stored in ultra -cold freezers or refrigerators. (Pfizer thermal shippers should no longer be used for vaccine storage.) Page | 19 Will there be additional funding for jurisdictions to purchase ultra -cold storage units? Because CDC does not recommend jur isdictions invest in ultra- cold storage units at this time, there will be no additional funding available. How is the Department making sure that sites are keeping the vaccines in the proper conditions and not wasting doses? All COVID -19 vaccine providers must sign and comply with the CDC's provider agreement, which requires health care providers to submit vaccine administration data within 24 hours to the statewide NJIIS. Daily temperature logs are required on -site to ensure vaccine efficacy and are submitted to NJIIS on the 1st and 15th of each month. NJDOH is also required by CDC to conduct site visits to certain COVID- 19 enrolled providers. These site visits are currently being conducted. How do I transfer vaccines? For vaccine transfers, temperature excursions, or other questions related to vaccine inventory that have not been answered, email COV ID19.Provider@doh.nj.gov . Please note you must receive approval from the COVID -19 program prior to initiating vaccine transfer. Can providers donate COVID -19 vaccines internationally? As a COVID -19 provider participating in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program, you cannot transfer or donate COVID- 19 vaccines allocated to you directly or from your jurisdiction outside of the United States. Any international transfer or donation of COVID -19 vaccines must be undertaken by the federal government. There is a complex array of legal issues involved, as well as questions about proper storage and handling of these vaccines that may raise potential safety considerations . As a reminder, all doses that have been provided to you or your jurisdiction have been allocated under the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program, which has stringent requirements for how such doses may be used. Such requirements apply to any COVID -19 vaccine (i.e., refrigerated Janssen vaccine, frozen Moderna and Pfizer vaccine) regardless of storage location. The U.S. Government recommends optimizing the use of all vaccines across vaccination sites, and we are committed to making sure that available and unused COVID -19 vaccine is utilized appropriately, whether in your own state, tribal community, or elsewhere. U.S. -based providers and partners with questions regarding donating vaccine internationally or sha ring within their jurisdictions or domestically should contact eocevent551@cdc.gov . Inquiries from international partners may be referred to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Global Affairs (OGAPETFlu@hhs.gov ). Vaccine Administration Is a consent form required for vaccination of minors? The EUA fact sheet for caregivers must be provided to the parents/guardians i n advance. Informed consent must be obtained from a parent/guardian for the minor to be vaccinated. Informed consent can be obtained (a) by a Page | 20 parent/guardian signing an informed consent form or (b) if the parent/guardian is physically present and verbally consents to the child receiving the vaccine. Point s of Dispensing (PODs) should follow existing laws regarding consent for minors for medical procedures and each POD should consult with their own legal counsel regarding the facility's specific policies and procedures for consent. Does CDC recommend an observation period after vaccination? ACIP currently recommends that providers should consider observing vaccine recipients for 15 minutes after receipt of a vaccine. Persons with a history of anaphylaxis (due to any cause) should be observed for 30 minutes. What if my patients have received COVID -19 vaccines outside of the United States? The recommendations for people vaccinated outside of the United States depend on the number and type of vaccine(s) received . For more details, please see appendix B, Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines: Appendices, References, and Previous Updates | CDC I am not receiving the appropriate number of doses per vial of COVID -19 vaccine. What can I do? Depending on the type of syringe you use (low dead volume (LDV) syringes or non -LDV) to draw up COVID -19 vaccine, you may not be able to obtain all the anticipated doses from a vial. NJDOH does not have control over what brand of syringes are sent within the ancillary kits. If you are receiving less than this due to the syringes in the ancillary kit s, please enter the missing doses under a waste transaction in NJIIS as \"Other - Doses Not Obtained.\" In the comments , put the brand and model of syringe sent to you. If I have leftover COVID -19 vaccine at the end of the day, can I use this vaccine for walk -in patients? Yes, please use any COVID -19 vaccine available to prevent any missed opportunities for vaccination and/or vaccine wastage. Be sure to follow all vaccine storage and handling requirements and to document doses administered into NJIIS. Follow guidelines for infection control and patient safety to administer vaccine properly: Never combine or \"pool\" partial doses from two or more vials to obtain a full dose of vaccine. Withdraw only the number of doses authorized for the specific vaccine. Discard vaccine vial and remaining vaccine if the amount of vaccine left in the vial is not a full dose. Has CDC provided clinical guidance on what to do if an error occurs while administering COVID -19 vaccinations? Page | 21 Yes. CDC published a n appendix to its \"Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines Currently Authorized in the United States.\" Appendix D provides resources for preventing and reporting COVID- 19 vaccine administration errors, as well as a simple table outlining actions to take after an error has occurred . Quarantine and Isolation What are the current recommendations for quarantine and isolation of the public ? The CDC recently updated the recommendations for isolation and quarantine. For specific guidance, visit Isolation Precautions for People with COVID -19, CDC . For information specific to New Jersey, visit Communicable Disease Service, NJDOH . What are the current quarantine and isolation guidelines for health care personnel? Guidance for residents and staff of health care settings can be found in the Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals about Coronavirus (COVID -19) | CDC and Interim Guidance for Managing Healthcare Personnel with SARS- CoV-2 Infection or Exposure to SARS - CoV-2 | CDC For current state guidelines, visit Communicable Disease Service, NJDOH . Protection from Vaccine/Efficacy Are COVID -19 vaccines effective? COVID -19 vaccination reduces the risk of COVID- 19 and its potentially severe complications. All COVID -19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the United States helped protect people against COVID -19, including severe illness, in clinical trial settings. In addition to providing protection against COVID- 19, there is increasing evidence that COVID - 19 vaccines also provide protection against COVID -19 infecti ons without symptoms (asymptomatic infections). COVID -19 vaccination can reduce the spread of disease overall, helping protect people around you. For more information, visit COVID -19 Vaccines are Effective , CDC . If my patient had COVID -19 and recovered, do they need to get the vaccine? Getting a COVID -19 vaccine after recovering from COVID -19 infection provides added protection against COVID- 19. You may consider delaying the vaccine by three months from when your patient's symptoms started or, if they had no symptoms, when they received a positive test. People who already had COVID -19 and do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more likely to get COVID -19 again than those who get vaccinated after their recovery. Page | 22 If my patient is currently sick with COVID -19 illness, can I g ive them the COVID -19 vaccine? No. Anyone currently infected with COVID -19 should wait to get vaccinated until after their illness has resolved and after they have met the criteria to discontinue isolatio n. In addition, people who have had a known COVID- 19 exposure should not seek vaccination until their quarantine period has ended to avoid potentially exposing health care personnel and others during the vaccination visit. Can people who had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children ( MIS-A or MIS- C) get the COVID -1 9 vaccine? People who have a history of MIS -A or MIS-C may need to wait a while after recovering before they can get vaccinated. Please review Use of COVID -19 Vaccines in the US, CDC for the latest guidance. Masking and Vaccine Requirements When should people wear a face mask ? Masking guidelines are based on hospital admissions for COVID -19 with specific recommendations being made for masking when levels are low, medium, and high. To learn about the recommendations, visit the Department of Health | Communicable Disease Service | COVID -19 Weekly Surveillance Reports (nj.gov) . It is also important to remember that anyone can make the personal choice to wear a mask . Health care workers should follow the mask guidelines established by their employer or facility and visit Infection Control: Severe acute respiratory syndro me coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) | CDC The Department of Health recommends wearing a face mask whenever you have symptoms of COVID -19, tested positive, were recently exposed to someone with COVID -19, or live in a county with medium or high hospital admission levels for COVID -19. What are the differences between masks? While all masks and respirators provide some level of protection, loosely woven cloth products provide the least protection, layered finely woven products offer more protection, well -fitting disposable surgical masks and KN95s offer even more protection, and well- fitting NIOSH - approved respirators (including N95s) offer the highest level of protection. Whatever product you choose, it is most important to wear a mask o r respirator correctly (fit closely on the face without any gaps along the edges or around the nose) and be comfortable enough (covering your nose and mouth) so that you can keep it on when you need to. For more information about masks, visit Use and Care of Masks, CDC . Page | 23 What employees are required to receive the COVID -19 vaccine or weekly t esting? Effective April 3, 2023, Governor Murphy signed an executive order lifting COVID- 19 testing requirements for employees of health care and congregate settings . While vaccination requirements were lifted for employees in congregate care settings , health care employees will still be required to provide proof of COVID -19 vaccination in accordance with Executive Order 294 to protect the higher risk populations that they serve . This action is supported by the federal government continuing vaccination requirements for most Medic are and Medicaid - certified providers and suppliers. For more information, visit COVID -19 Information Hub . Can an employer access an employee's COVID -19 vaccination records in NJIIS to verify their vaccination status? No, an employer cannot access an employee's vaccination records that are maintained in the NJIIS for the purpose of verifying the employee's vaccinations for employment. An authorized NJIIS user's access to information in the NJIIS is limited by law, namely N.J.S.A. 26:4 -131 et seq. and N.J.A.C. 8:57, subchapter 3. The statutes and rules provide that NJIIS users shall only access an individual's vaccination infor mation in the NJIIS if they have claimed the individual in NJIIS as their patient and/or if the user is currently providing health care services to the individual. The statutes and rules further provide that a child care center, school, college, or univers ity shall only access an individual's immunization information in the NJIIS if they have enrolled or are in the process of enrolling the individual in their institution. Because the statutes and rules do not permit an employer to verify an employee's vaccination status in NJIIS, employers should have employees submit vaccination documentation for verification. See COVID -19 Vaccination Documentation FAQs for more details on valid vaccine documentation. All authorized users should review the statute and regulations to ensure use is consistent with existing laws. The NJIIS is the official Immunization Registry pursuant to the Statewide Immunization Registry Act - N.J.S.A. 26:4 -131 et seq. (P.L. 2004, c. 138), subchapter 3. Did the ACIP require COVID -19 vaccine for children? The ACIP meets every year to review the vaccination schedule and make updates. This year, they recommended to include COVID -19 vaccine on the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The recommended immunization schedule is not a vaccine mandate. States and local jurisdictions make their own rules about which vaccines are required for school attendance. The CDC unveiled the 2023 Recommended Immunization Schedule in the February 10 , 2023 edition of the MMWR . Is COVID -19 vaccine required for school attendance in New Jersey? Currently, COVID -19 vaccination is not a requirement for school attendance in New Jersey. However, NJDOH strongly recommends that everyone should be up to date with age - appropriate vaccinations, per CDC's ACIP recommendations. Individuals and families shou ld Page | 24 discuss their concerns with their health care providers . It is important to remember that the recommended immunization schedule is not a vaccine mandate ; states and local jurisdictions make their own rules about which vaccines are required for school at tendance. What is the benefit of adding COVID -19 to the vaccines available through the VFC program? Providing COVID -19 vaccines through the VFC p rogram ensures equitable access to the vaccines as we transition COVID -19 vaccines to the commercial market. The current national vaccine distribution program and the transition to commercialization will not end once the PHE ends. The CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will continue to work together to ensure the public, especially high- risk populations, have access to COVID -19 vaccinations. For more on becoming a NJ VFC provider, visit Vaccines for Children (VFC): Why Join and Become a VFC Provider | CDC . Pa rents in need of information about the federal VFC Program can visit www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/parents/index.html . For NJDOH health education materials , visit COVID -19 vaccines for children . Other Vaccines Can you receive COVID -19 at the same time as other vaccines? In accordance with general best practices for immunizations , routine administration of all age - appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously is recommended for children, adolescents, and adults for whom no specific contraindications exist at the time of the health care visit. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID- 19 vaccine and other vaccines. However, there are add itional considerations for Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccines if administering an orthopoxvirus ( mpox) vaccine. For more information, see Coadministration of COVID- 19 vaccines with other vaccines Can people receive the monkeypox (mpox) vaccine and COVID -19 vaccine at the same time? People who previously received mpox vaccination (either JYNNEOS or ACAM2000), particularly adolescent or young adult males (between the ages of 12 and 39), might consider waiting four weeks before receiving a COVID -19 vaccine because of the possible risk for myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) after receipt of ACAM2000 vaccine and COVID -19 vaccines and the unknown risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after JYNNEOS vaccine. However, if individuals have previously received the COVID -19 vaccination , they may be given the mpox vaccine at any time after the COVID- 19 vaccine. Be sure to speak with your doctor to see which vaccines are right for you. For more information on mpox , visit mpox FAQs, NJDOH . Will getting the flu vaccine protect me against coronavirus? Page | 25 No. Influenza viruses and coronaviruses are different. Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID -19; however, the vaccine can reduce flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and can help to conserve potentially scarce health care resources during the pandemic. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others - especially those who are particularly vulnerable to both COVID -19 and influenza such as older adults and those with chronic health conditions. Medical Therapies & Testing Are monoclonal antibodies, like Evusheld, still used to treat people that are at high risk of disease progression from COVID -19? No, the use of monoclonal antibodies is no longer authorized by the FDA as a pre -treatment for preventin g COVID -19 in individuals at high risk for developing severe illness from COVID -19. The emergency authorizations were removed as the FDA's data revealed that monoclonal antibodies do not appear to protect high risk individuals from contracting COVID- 19 when exposed to the O micron subvariants that are currently circulating in the United States. Are other COVID -19 treatments still available ? Yes, there are other treatments available that target specific parts of the SARS- CoV-2 virus that can help reduce its multiplication and spread through the patient's body. For more information, visit Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID -19 Treatment in Outpatients | CDC and COVID - 19 Treatments and Medications | CDC . Now that the PHE has ended, will pharmacy testing sites for COVID -19 be affected? Changes in insurance cov erage and reimbursement may reduce the number of pharmacies offering testing . CDC will continue to fund testing for people who are uninsured through the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) for COVID -19 program, although testing access may be reduced if fewer testing sites are available. Please send questions regarding ICATT to eocevent588@cdc.gov and visit ICATT testi ng, CDC . Where can people get free COVID -19 testing and treatment? Free COVID -19 testing and treatment is available at Community Health Centers, also known as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), to all people whether they have health insurance or not and regardless of their immigration status . Find an FQHC with this search tool or on 211's online list of community clinics . Individuals with urgent symptoms may also co ntinue to access services at acute care hospitals.
