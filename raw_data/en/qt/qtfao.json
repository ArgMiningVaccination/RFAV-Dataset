If stress drags on for a long time, it makes you more vulnerable to illness, from colds to serious diseases. Chronic stress exposes your body to a steady stream of stress hormones that suppress the immune system. You may not be able to get rid of your stress, but you can get better at managing it. - Learn to meditate. - Slow down. - Connect with other people. - Work out to blow off steam. Counseling is a big help, too. Easing stress lowers levels of a stress hormone. It also helps you sleep better, which improves immune function. People who meditate regularly may have healthier immune system responses, some studies show. In one experiment*, people who meditated over an 8-week period made more antibodies to a flu vaccine than people who didn't meditate. And they still showed an increased immune system response 4 months later. *Psychosom Med. "}
