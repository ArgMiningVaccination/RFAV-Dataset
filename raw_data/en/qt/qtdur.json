Unfounded fears of autism scare some parents. Others buy the daffy conspiracy theory that pharmaceutical companies are just pushing vaccination to make a buck. Some parents invoke religious concerns despite that fact that hardly any religions think vaccination is bad and most teach that it is an obligation in order to protect children and the vulnerable in the community. One key reason behind falling vaccination rates is that if you believe any of the above untruths it is very easy to get an exemption. Most states let you out on religious or philosophical grounds. Every state excuses you or your kids for health reasons. So you might presume those ducking vaccines get approval to dodge vaccination from physicians. Uh uh. In 17 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico naturopaths, healers who believe in a mishmash of nutritional medicine, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine including chiropractic manipulative therapy, rolfing, iridology, and homeopathy among other New Agey philosophies can get licenses in their state. There are thousands practicing in the United States. Put aside the issue of why states are recognizing these 'healers' who rely on an evidence base only a few steps above astrology and palm-reading. The fact is in many states a naturopath can excuse a child from vaccination. And since many naturopaths take a pretty dim view of vaccination they give a lot of exemptions. A quick tour of the Internet reveals many naturopaths are making inaccurate and scary claims about vaccines. No wonder those who seek them out on 'health grounds are among the largest number of exemptors in the U.S. Our legislators have allowed an entire underground network to flourish where fruits and berries minded parents can find healers who agree with their vaccine hesitancy and can grant them waivers that put the entire community at risk of outbreaks like the current measles problem. I have no issue letting competent adults pursue their health care where they wish including the supplement store and the naturopath's office. But, when it comes to protecting kids and the community I think a bright line ought to be drawn by government in terms of granting authority to naturopaths to sign vaccine waivers on grounds of health. That is akin to letting high school kids grant sick days to other students. States should require a physician with some training in vaccination science to grant waivers for reasons of health. If we want to protect the public health when it comes to vaccination a visit to the naturopath is not what the doctor would recommend. "}
