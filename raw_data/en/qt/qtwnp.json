Curriculum Vitae Acknowledgements i Acknowledgements This work is a collaboration between the Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPMZ), the Office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) in 26 cantons and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (SFOPH), with help kindly provided by many municipalities, the Departments of Health and Education, school phys icians, school / \"Lunge nliga\" nurses, school officials and parents. Without their participation this survey would not have been possible. I am especially grateful to the CMOs and their assistances, who spent many patient hours explaining the school health and immunization policies in their cantons, aided in data collection or generously shared their database for analysis. To all the school doctors and the school / \"Lunge nliga\" nurses who helped collect the vaccination cards and completed the vaccination summary forms, along with parents who participated in the survey, my warmest thank you. My sincerest thanks to Prof. Robert Steffen for his supervision and unending suppor t throughout this thesis project. Always available, he permitted experimentation, coupled with trial and error that nurtures independence and problem-solving skills, characteristics necessary for future success. My deepest appreciation to Dr. Hanspeter Zimmermann for the hours of critical discussions on methodol ogy, particularly data collection, development of the questionna ire, preparation of the manuscripts and clarification regarding all aspects of immunization. Resources and financial suppor t were strategically and gratefully provided by Dr. Daniel Koch. To Professors Marcel Tanner, Charlotte Braun-Fahrl\u00e4nder, and Felix Gutzwiller I owe many thanks for their suppor t and encouragement during the study period. A special thanks to Prof Christoph Hatz and Niklaus Weiss for filling in at the last minute. Deepest gratitude is due to Dr. Philip Smith from the National Immunization Survey from the CDC for helping develop the sampling methodol ogy and statistical analysis. I enjoyed the many hours spent in discussion, not only concerning the survey. Greatest appreciation to my colleagues at ISPMZ, especially Ursula Piller who helped collect the data and coordinate the survey while providing companionship throughout the study period. Oh, how wonde rful for a 90% participation level! Vaccination inquiries were always directed towards Maia Funk whose door and ears were always gratefully open. For their encouragement and administrative assistance I thank Pat Schlagenhauf, Astrid Bruderer, Cordy K\u00fcderli, Margot special thanks to Hanspeter Jauss for perpetual and invaluable technical help, along with Alois Tschopp and Valentin Rousson for computer and statistical suppor t. To my family and friends in the US and here in Switzerland, who have encouraged me to continue this endeavor and given me many hours of free daycare, I am eternally grateful. I dedicate this work to Cornel, Anna, Sara and Jack. Financial Support Funding was provided by the SFOPH, Bern, and the Health Departments in Cantons Glarus and St. Gallen for the Vaccination Coverage Survey 1999-2003. In addition to the SFOPH, 25 cantons provided financial and / or resource suppor t to continue the survey in 2005-07. Summary ii Summary Despite being recognized as one of the most effective public health measures, vaccination has become increasingly controversial as more parents and doctors question the effectiveness and purpose of this preventive measure, with heightened emphasis on adverse events [Abrahamson and Pickering, 2002; Campion, 2002] . The goals of our study were to determine immunization coverage and examine factors influencing vaccination behaviors in 3 different age groups in each canton by collecting vaccination cards and questionna ires between 1999 and 2003 . National coverage estimates for 3 doses of diphtheria (Di or D), tetanus (Te or T), pertussis (Per or P), poliomyelitis (Pol) and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and combined dose of measles (M), mumps (M), and rubella (R), or simply MMR, were: over 91% for Di, Te, Per, Pol and Hib and around 81% for MMR for toddlers; they were more than 92%, for 4 doses of Di, Te and Pol, 60.9% and 26.6% for 4 doses of Per and Hib, respectively, and 87% for one dose of MMR for children at school entry. For children at school departure, coverage estimates at 5 doses of Di, Te and Pol was over 81% and around 50% for 2 doses of MMR (approximately 93% for 1 dose). Hepatitis B coverage ranged between 2.3% and 88.3% with the mean at 1 dose being 46.3%, for 2 doses at 40.8%, and 3 doses at 25.9%. Due to methodol ogical difficulties, comparison of coverage for schoolchildren among the cantons should be done with caution. Comparison of coverage for toddlers for MMR at one dose and Di, Te, and Pol at 3 doses with those from 1991 and 1998 revealed that coverage has remained relatively unchanged. However, for Per and Hib at 3 and 4 doses and 4 doses of Di, Te, and Pol, coverage levels have increased, with the uptake of Hib being most apparent, climbing from 77% in 1998 to 91% in our survey at 3 doses and from 47% to 79% at 4 doses. Summary iii Vaccination coverage is significantly better in cantons where French or Italian is the predominant langua ge spoke n as compared to their German counterparts, particularly for MMR. Cantons supplementing their school health services with cantonally employed school nurses or \"Lunge nliga\" nurses have improved vaccination coverage as compared to those working only with school doctors. Parental use of alternative medicine is found most often to be strongly associated with low vaccination coverage, cutting across cantonal differences and types of vaccines while being more influential by parents of younge r kids. Nationality follows suit, with Swiss children having lower MMR and higher Di and Pol coverage levels than those of foreign background. Approximately 90% of all those who completed a questionna ire indicated that they have information concerning vaccination. Of these, 67% are satisfied with what they have, while 17% are not happy, 7% remained unde cided and 8% refrained from answering. Future vaccination campaigns should address the latter 3 groups to effectively increase immunization coverage. Finally, doctors are one of the most important resources for parents for obtaining information regarding vaccination; however, parents prefer that doctors actively share this information, rather than having to request for it from the doctors themselves. Parents of schoolchildren increasingly rely on school phys icians for this information as their children get older. Health insurance should also share more information with parents while information distributed by the media is less desired. Parental attitudes towards vaccination and perception of the dange rs of the childhood preventable diseases and vaccine safety and efficacy are significantly associated with coverage. Our results show that the most significant predictors of a child being UTD with the recommended vaccination plan is if parents agree that they follow the doctor's recommendation, believe in the Summary iv effectiveness of vaccination, and think that as many children as possible should be vaccinated for the benefit of the community. In contrast, toddlers whose parents thought there was too much social pressure to vaccinate their children and have concerns about possible side effects from vaccines are less likely to be vaccinated as compared to those who disagree. In summary, children in Switzerland are sub-optimally vaccinated. Immunization coverage is affected by demographic and political factors, attitudes towards vaccination and perceptions of the dangers of the disease, as well as information available to the parents and healthcare providers. Future vaccination campaigns must address these factors, while providing clear and transparent resources to the parents and healthcare professionals.

Introduction 1 1. Introduction Since its inception, vaccination has prevented millions of deaths and sufferings, and has been documented as one of the most cost-effective public health measures [Chabot et al, 2004; Ulmer and Liu, 2002; CDC / 1999( a); CDC / MMWR, 1999( b); WHO website]. Based on statistics for the United States, annual morbidity due to childhood vaccine preventable diseases has decreased 99-100% since 1900 [CDC / MMWR, 1999( a)]. For measles alone, global summaries by the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that in 1980, 3.9 million cases were registered worldwide; in 2002, only 586,000 cases. In the WHO designated European region, the number of measles reported cases decreased from 492,000 in 1980 to 46,700 cases in 2002 [WHO: Global summaries, 2003] . Measles is respons ible for nearly half of the estimated 1.7 million annua l deaths due to childhood vaccine preventable diseases in 2000, and is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality [Henao-Restrepo et al, 2003] . Moreover, an estimated 1 million measles deaths have been prevented by vaccination in 2000, when assuming the same measles case-fatality ratios in the pre-vaccine era as those currently observed in the presence of vaccination programs [Henao-Restrepo et al, 2003] . The Measles Initiative announc ed recently that death as a result of measles has been reduced by 60% worldwide between 1999 and 2005, from an estimated 870,000 to 345,000 [Editorial team, Euro Surveill, 2007; Wolfson et al, 2007] . However, measles remains an extremely contagious disease, with outbreaks still common in Europe. Because vaccine-preventable diseases have become less prevalent, much of the attention from both healthcare providers and parents in the western communities has been shifted from dangerous consequences of the infections to the rare side effects of the vaccines [Offit and Coffin, 2003; Owens, 2002; Tickner, 2006] . Despite numerous studies that have 1. Introduction 2 proved otherwise, speculations that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism, encephalitis or aseptic meningitis have reduced MMR coverage about 8.6 percentage points in the United Kingdom , with some areas having coverage as low as 65% [Wakefield et al, 1998; Taylor et al, 1999; Kaye et al, 2001; Madsen et al, 2002; M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al, 2002; Owens, Ramsey et al, 2002; Wilson et al., 2003; DeStefano et al, 2004; Geier and Geier, Sengupt a, 2005] . Additionally, concerns that vaccination may lead to atopy, asthma, or diabetes have also added fuel to the ongoi ng vaccination debate, although many large epidemiological studies have refuted this claim [Paunio et al, 2000; Gr\u00fcber et al, Furthermore, mistrust in gove rnment agencies and medical professions regarding vaccination, along with increase doubt s in vaccine efficacy and safety, have negatively impacted vaccination campaign efforts [Evans et al, 2001; Cotter et al, 2003; Raithatha et 2003; Salmon et al, 2005; Casiday et al, 2006; Cassell et al, 2006 ]. Thus, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain vaccination coverage levels high enough to interrupt circulation of the wild virus in the popul ation, resulting in potentially dangerous epidemic outbreaks. For example, local measles outbreaks have been common in the past decade in many European countries. In The Netherlands, 2 measles epidemics occurred, one in 1999/ 2000 and one in 2002. Between June 1999 and May 2000, a large outbreak of 3,292 reported measles cases, with 3 measles-related deaths. It occurred in a community, where 83% of the 94% unva ccinated kids were religiously exempted [van den Hof et al, 2002] . Likewise, in Ireland, 1,407 cases of measles were notified, of which 111 children were hospitalized, and a total of 3 deaths resulted between December 1999 and July 2000 [McBrien et al, 2003 ]. A large outbreak occurred in London between December 2001 1. Introduction 3 and May 2002 where a total of 580 cases (confirmed and suspected) were reported. From the 70% of cases where vaccination history was available, 98% had no record of receiving any measles vaccine; the majority of confirmed cases lived in the more affluent area of London [Atkinson et al, 2005] . Two outbreaks plagued Italy within the last three years: one in 2002 where 1,571 cases were reported between January to July, affecting primarily unva ccinated school-aged children. Of the 1,543 cases where vaccination status was know n, only 7% of the children were vaccinated. Subsequently, it has been shown that the number of cases reported is inversely proportional to the vaccination coverage of the afflicted areas [Ciofi degli Atti et al, 2002( a) and 2002( b)]. Exactly one year later, 1,217 cases were reported in Italy between January and May 2003. Again coverage estimates for measles were low in the affected regions: 71% in al, 2003] . In Greece between September 2005 and February 2006, 171 measles cases were reported. Epidemiological data showed that the majority of cases occurred in children unde r 14 years of age (45% in 0-4 years), and of the 110 know n vaccination status, 89% were not vaccinated while only 11% had a single dose of measles-containing vaccine [Georgakopoul ou et al, 2006] . In Madrid, Spain, 59 cases of measles were notified during the first quarter of 2006 . Of the 19 cases who should have been vaccinated (between 15 months and younge r than 21 years of age), 14 were not vaccinated; all vaccinated patients were born in Spain, and the non-vaccinated ones were born in other countries or belonge d to minority ethnic groups [Garcia-Comas, 2006 ]. In Germany, there were regional variations in measles incidence and outbreaks, with the largest outbreak in Bavaria between November 2001 to April 2002 where 1,166 measles cases were reported; many parents in this region did not suppor t vaccinating their children against childhood diseases due to anthropos ophical beliefs. A more detailed investigation into an 1. Introduction 4 outbreak in Nordfriesland between January to April 2001 showed that of the 133 confirmed clinical cases, 93% had never been vaccinated against measles [Hellenbrand et al, 2003] . Local measles outbreaks were repeated in the federal states of Hess and Bavaria in 2005 [Siedler, 2006] and Nordrhein Eurosurveill, 2006]. Of the 223 cases in Hess, 95% were unva ccinated, with the highest age-specific attack rate in children aged 1- 4 years, with clustering observed in families and hous eholds. In Bavaria 98% of the 279 cases where not vaccinated, with the highest age -specific attack rate in children aged 5-9 years, indicating a clustering in schools or pre-school facilities. Within the first half year of 2006, 1018 cases of measles were reported in Nordrhein Westfalen, where only 2.5% were fully vaccinated with 2 - doses against measles; schoolchildren were mainly affected. In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, all 58 cases reported during the first quarter of 2006 were not immunized; the patients belonge d to a social group where measles vaccination is viewed as unnecessary. Finally, in Switzerland, there were two large measles outbreaks, one in 1997 and one in 2003. Two hundr ed and thirty five cases were reported in 1997 within Sentinella (estimated number of cases for Switzerland: 6,400), of which 16% of the patients were vaccinated, compared to 30% in 1995, 32% in 1996 and 25% in 1998 [Paget et al, 2000] . In 2003, 614 cases were registered through the notification system, where 79% of the patients were unde r 16 years of age and 88% were not vaccinated against measles [Richard et al, 2003; Zimmermann, personal communication, 2004] . Between 2004 and 2006, there were two small local outbreaks of measles in cantons LU and VD, with many of the cases not vaccinated against measles [Masserey et al, 2006; Shang-Meier, 2007 ]. 1. Introduction 5 Concerned with potential epidemic outbreaks, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (SFOPH) spons ored a national effort between 1999-2003 to determine vaccination coverage levels in each of the 26 cantons. The survey has two major goals: 1. to determine vaccination coverage and factors affecting vaccination in three different age groups : toddlers 24-35 months of age, children at school entry and school departure, and 2. to establish a feasible methodol ogy that could be implemented in every canton utilizing the existing infrastructure where possible. As it took 5 years to complete the study in all 26 cantons, the survey was repeated in the canton of Valais (VS, subsequently all cantons will be abbreviated) in 2003, taking into consideration the many changes to improve the methodol ogy to ensure better data quality. A section is used to describe the changes implemented and its overall effect on vaccination coverage and participation in the canton of VS. A third section of this thesis will briefly summarize the ongoi ng Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey developed based on the results and experience from the survey 1999-2003 . The current 3-year rolling cycle is an improvement of the previous methodol ogy implementing many of the recommendations suggested by collaborators and results analysis to produc e a sustainable surveillance system with outstanding and comparable data. 2. Methodology 6 2. Methodology 2.1 Target population As vaccination plays an important role in public health, a surveillance system to regularly monitor immunization coverage should be established. Three age groups were of interest: toddlers between 24-35 months of age (main target group), children at school entry and children at school departure. By the age of 2, children should be up to date with all the recommended infant and toddler vaccinations. If results indicate that immunization coverage for children at this age is low, then a program can be initiated to increase coverage before school entry in order to prevent disease outbreaks. Because vaccination behaviors of parents will change as children get older, it is important to continually monitor children's vaccination status. For examination of schoolchildren, the time of school entry is crucial, as well as the time of school departure, especially to determine Hepatitis B acceptance among the adolescents. If necessary, catch-up programs for children can also be implemented during these school years. 2.2 Study design As it is important to have high coverage in all regions / cantons to effectively control or eliminate a disease, one of the major goals was to conduc t the survey in every single canton. Due to limited resources and sampling frames, while hoping to gather suppor t from the individual cantons, it was sought to adapt the survey to the existing infrastructure in each canton as much as possible. For the toddlers, a two stage sampling design with municipalities serving as the primary sampling units was employed (Levy and Lemeshow, 1999) . Parents were contacted via two modes, mail and telephone . With the schoolchildren, random sampling of school classes with school classes serving as the primary sampling units was utilized. 2. Methodology 7 Parents were only contacted via letters through the aid of teachers, school officials, school doctors or school nurses. In addition to submitting information on their child's immunization status (via a copy of the immunization card), parents were also requested to complete a structured close-ended questionna ire regarding vaccination, perception of selected diseases, information about vaccination, and use of alternative medicine (Annex Questionna ire). The survey was repeated in canton VS in 2003 to determine the feasibility of the methodol ogy with changes as recommended by the collaborators in canton VS to improve data quality. Although the basic methodol ogy was still used, three major changes were implemented in 2003: 1) questionna ires were not utilized. Only vaccination status was examined, along with demographic variables such as gender and nationality. By the schoolchildren, 2) children in the second grade were recruited to participate instead of those in the first grade, and 3) vaccination summary forms were completed by the \"Lunge nliga\" (LL) nurses. 2.3 Statistical considerations Sample size calculation at 95% confidence interval and a precision of \u00b17% with a design effect of 2 due to sampling via clusters required a minimum of 400 samples. To take into account non-compliance of approximately 30-40%, a final sample size of 500- 600 per age group per canton was needed in this cross-sectional survey [Lemeshow et al, 1990] . 2.4 Data collection Data collection methods for toddlers and schoolchildren were distinctly different due to available sampling frames, but remained similar among the cantons. 2. Methodology 8 2.4.1 Toddlers For the toddlers, a list of the number of children born in a specified year in each municipality served as the sampling frame except for cantons AI, BS, NE, GE and VD where a single registry of all residents exists (Annex A). Supplied to ISPMZ by the Office of Statistics in the Canton of Zurich, this list is a compilation submitted by each canton to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO) for the Statistical Yearbook for Switzerland [1999-2003] . By the time the list is used for the survey, the birth cohort is about 3 years old. Because of the tendency for families to remain at the same address for a relatively long period of time, the list remains fairly accurate. For BS and NE, simple random sampling was conduc ted to select the children. Due to their relatively small size, all children who were between 24-35 months of age and resided in cantons AI, GL, NW, OW and UR at the time of the study were recruited for the study. Because diphtheria vaccination is mandatory in GE, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) regularly sends a letter requesting the immunization cards to all parents whose toddlers have reached the age of 28 months. Graciously, GE allowed ISPMZ to coordinate our study with this routine so as not to overburden the parents. In canton VD, sample selection was conduc ted by the \"Bureau Vaudois d'Adresses\" as they are respons ible for maintaining the central registry for the canton. By the remaining cantons, the sampling procedure varied statistically as we tried to simplify the sampling technique (please refer to the cantonal assessment submitted to each canton for details describing the survey as implemented in the canton). In brief, municipalities were first selected, and then the children in these municipalities (Annex B). These municipalities were then requested to provide information (names of child and parents, date of birth, gender, address, nationality, telephone number) of the selected children. Children and their families were then invited to participate per mail, which included an introduc tory letter, the 2. Methodology 9 questionna ire in the langua ge of the region, and if necessary another questionna ire based on their nationality, and a pre-paid return envelope. Three to four weeks later a reminder was sent to all those who still have not responde d, followed by a final telephone attempt, which included 3-4 calls at different hours during the week. Reasons for not participating in the survey were recorded in most cantons. The questionna ire exists in 8 different languages: German, French, Italian, Turkish, Albanian, Serbo-Croatian, English, and Portugue se. 2.4.2 Schoolchildren An exhaustive list of schools and the number of classes with children in the target popul ation served as the sampling frame for the schoolchildren, except in NE. From this list, between 30 and 50 school classes were random ly chosen, depending on the average class size in the canton (Annex B). All children in these selected classes were recruited for the study. After the classes have been chosen, the data collection method diversified, depending on the existing infrastructure (Table 1). In cantons FR, LU, NW, OW, SO, TG and ZG, school directors and teachers were directly contacted to participate in the study. They were requested to distribute, collect and send the information (questionna ire and a copy of the vaccination card or the original) to ISPMZ. In AI, AR, GL, GR, SG, SH, TI, UR and ZH information were sent to the school doctors who coordinated the study with the routine school health exams. Because of their small size, all school doctors in cantons AI, GL and UR were requested to collect information from all classes at school entry and departure that were unde r their care. After collecting the questionna ires from the kids and either copying the vaccination bookl ets or completing a vaccination summary form (Annex Vaccination Summary Forms), all information were then sent to ISPMZ. When a school doctor refused to participate, the teachers or directors were directly contacted and the same procedure followed, as described above . In cantons AG, BL, BS, GE, JU, SZ, VD and VS the study was coordinated with the nurses in the school health services or the LL league who, like the aforementioned 2. Methodology 10 collaborators, were respons ible for all stages of data collection. Because the study was coordinated with the school health examinations, the selected grades varied- for school entry: children in kindergarten (second year), first, second or third grade were recruited, and by school departure, included were adolescents in the 6th, 7th, 8th or 9th grade. Finally, in cantons BE and NE, the method utilized for the toddlers were also used for the schoolchildren. Families were directly contacted to participate in the study. Table 1. Data collection methods for schoolchildren Method Canton Nurses School health services BS, GE, VD, SZ Lungenliga AG, BL, JU, VS School physicians AI, AR, GL, GR, SG, SH, UR, TI, ZH School directors/ teachers FR, LU, NW, OW, SO, TG, ZG Municipalities BE, NE BE, TI: The survey was conducted independent of ISPM. As with the toddlers, each student in the selected classes received an envelope to bring home to their parents, which included an introduc tory letter and the questionna ire. The collected information was then returned to ISPMZ either via the school doctors, nurses, or school officials, with the original vaccination cards being returned within one week. In cantons BE, SO, TG and TI all phases of data collection were organized and conducted by the Office of the CMO; cantons SO and TG collected the data after sampling was conduc ted by ISPMZ, whereby in cantons BE and TI, all steps were performed independent of ISPMZ [Maurer, 2003; Galfetti, personal communication, 2003] . Data were graciously shared to ISPMZ for data analysis. In VS 2003, a revised vaccination summary form (Annex) was completed by the LL nurses for each class that was selected for the study. Children in the 2nd and 8th grades were recruited for the study. Regardless of whether or not they participated in the study, the nurses were 2. Methodology 11 requested to include every single student in the class on the form. Data were collected between April and June 2003 . Data entry and analysis were performed by ISPMZ. 2.5 Data analysis Data for the toddlers and schoolchildren were weighted based on sampling probability, adjusted for nonrespons e and poststratified by nationality (Swiss / non-Swiss), and sex. For toddlers, in addition to sex and nationality, urbanicity (city/ country, as defined by the SFSO) [1999-2003] was also used in poststratification so that totals matched estimates from the Statistical Yearbook with respect to the 3 aforementioned variables for generalization to the current popul ation. Adjustment for nonresponse included distributing the weights of nonresponde rs to responde rs, unde r the assumption that the sample is representative of the general popul ation and that behavior of those who do not respond will be similar to those who do respond. Imputation was conservatively done for missing information on gender and nationality for selected toddlers, where names were available. In the cantons of BE, VD and TI where the survey was independently conduc ted by the cantons themselves, questionna ires were not used with the schoolchildren. In addition to vaccination status, nationality and gender were also available for the children in the canton of BE, while only nationality was recorded for VD; for TI, only nonrespons e adjustments were made since no other variables were collected. Age distribution was examined only for children submitting information from the vaccination card. For the schoolchildren in canton BL, dates of births were extracted from the questionna ires since this information was not supplied on the vaccination summary forms. Because data collection lasted for several months, to determine the age of the children, the point at which the majority of data were collected was selected as the time of reply for that 2. Methodology 12 particular canton and that specific age group. When it was not possible to estimate this period, the middle point of data collection was designated as the time of participation. Only in cases where vaccination information were extracted from a vaccination card, descriptive Chi square analyses and logistic regression were conduc ted utilizing the statistical software Stata, Version 7.0 [2001] . Vaccination status and questionna ire were obtained for toddlers from all cantons; for the schoolchildren, vaccination information is missing from canton JU and questionna ires are missing from cantons BE, TI and VD. Due to misunde rstandings in canton JU, immunization coverage by doses for the individual vaccines were not determined, although questionna ires were collected. For data analysis, \"up to date\" (UTD) with the recommended childhood vaccination schedule was defined according to the 3 age groups at different number of doses for diphtheria (Di or D), tetanus (Te or T), pertussis (Per or P), poliomyelitis (Pol), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and at the DTPPolHibMMR immunization series for toddlers and children at school entry and DTPPolMMR series for children at school departure. For toddlers, the DTPPolHibMMR immunization series was either 33333111 (i.e. 3 doses of D, T, P, Pol and Hib and combined dose of measles (M), mumps (M), and rubella (R)), or 44443111, or without Per and Hib at 33030111 or 44040111; for children at school entry, it was held at 33333111, 44443111, 55553111 and 55553222, and without Per and Hib at 33030111, 44040111, 55050111 and 55050222; and for children at school departure, we compared coverage at various DTPPolMMR vaccination series, with and without 3 doses of Per. Hib was not analyzed for the children at school departure as it was only introduc ed into the vaccination plan recommended by the SFOPH and the Swiss Advisory Board on Immunisation (SKIF) in 1991. The DTPPolMMR 5505111, Methodology 5535111, 5535222, (see list of Abbreivations). Hepatitis B (HepB) was analyzed only for children at school departure as it is recommended by the SFOPH for children between 11-15 years of age. Independent variables for the univariate logistic regression model included: demographic factors (nationality (Swiss vs. non-Swiss), sex (male vs. female), number of siblings (0 vs. 1), number of older siblings (0 vs. 1), number of younge r siblings (0 vs. 1), and highest educational level of the mother (low vs. middle vs. high), langua ge of the region (German vs. French vs. Italian), alternative medicine use (no vs. yes), receipt of information regarding vaccination (no vs. yes), satisfaction with the available information (no vs. yes), respons e rate (toddlers: < 60% vs. 60-70% schoolchildren: < 60% vs. 60-79% vs. 80%), parental perception of the dangers of childhood vaccine-preventable diseases, and parental attitudes toward immunization in general. Mode of data collection and school vaccination policy also served as independent variables for the schoolchildren. Dependent variables for the toddlers were coverage estimates for DTPPolHibMMR at series 3333111, Di at 3 doses, Hib at 3 doses and measles at one dose; for children at school entry, the dependent variables were coverage estimates for DTPPolHibMMR at series 44443111, Di at 4 doses, Hib at 3 doses and measles at one dose; and by the children at school departure, the dependent variables were coverage estimates for DTPPolMMR at series 5505111, Di at 5 doses, Pol at 5 doses and measles at one dose. Hib was not considered in the analysis for the school departure, as it was only recently recommended; many of the teenagers would not have been vaccinated for it. Significance was held at p-value less than 0.05, unless otherwise specified. Nationality was also examined in further detail, as collected in the questionna ire. Children of foreign background were further categorized into 4 regions: Europe (countries in the European Union and Norway); Eastern Europe, including Turkey; Asia; and others. As canton 2. Methodology 14 VD did not use identical nationality groupings in the vaccination summary form as those in our survey, schoolchildren from canton VD were not included in this analysis. Because geographical location of some European countries may also influence vaccination coverage as determined by Bouvier et al in 1994, countries of origin were also regroupe d into 7 regions: northern and western Europe (countries in the European Union and Norway), minus those categorized as Southern Europe; Eastern Europe, including Turkey; Southern Europe, which includes Portugal, Italy, France, Spain, and Greece; Asia; Latin and South American; Africa; North America, New Zealand and Australia. This latter re-grouping was only done for the toddlers, when the information was available; it did not include cantons BE, TI and TG. Educational level was partitioned into categories very similar to those from the Statistical Yearbook, as defined by the SFSO [2003] . The categories included: none (no formal education), first 9 years of schooling (obligatorische Schule), basic vocational training / Apprenticeship (Berufsschule / Berufslehre), high school diploma / teaching training (Maturit\u00e4tsschule Lehrerseminar), non-university diploma (H\u00f6here Berufsausbildung) , university (Universit\u00e4t / Hochschule), and others. Parents who provided a description as to their educational background when \"others\" was checked, were re-groupe d into one of the aforementioned categories when possible. The list of conditions for analysis found on pages ix-x summarizes the different categories used in the analysis and the subdivision of cantons within these variables. Cantons designated as French-speaking are FR, GE, JU, NE, VD and VS; the German-speaking region includes cantons AG, AI, AR, BE, BL, BS, GL, GR, LU, NW, OW, SG, SH, SO, SZ, TG, UR, ZG and ZH; TI is the only Italian-speaking canton. For the logistic regression, respons e rates were divided into 3 groups : low, where participation was below 60%; medium, where participation was between 60-70% for toddlers and 60-79% for schoolchildren; and high, where 2. Methodology 15 participation was more than 70% for toddlers and 80% or more for schoolchildren. For the toddlers, cantons falling into the group with low participation included AR, BS, FR, GR, JU, NE, LU, SG, SH, SO, TG, VS, ZG; medium high included 4 cantons AI, BE, GE, TI. For school entry, cantons with low participation included AR, GL, GR, LU, NW, OW, SG, SH, SO, TG, UR, VS and ZG; at the middle level are cantons AG, BL, FR and SZ; and those with high participation included cantons AI, BS, GE, VD and ZH. For school departure, cantons falling into the low participation group included BL, GR, LU, NW, OW, SG, SO, TG and ZG; at the middle level are cantons AI, AR, BS, FR, GL, SH, SZ, UR and ZH; and those with high participation are cantons AG, GE, VD and VS. The influence of the mode of data collection on vaccination coverage was also examined for schoolchildren where the methods used were similar for the 2 age groups and did not include cantons BE, NE, JU and TI. Cantons where collaboration with school doctors were sought included AI, AR, GL, GR, SG, SH, UR, TI, and ZH; collaboration with cantonal employed school / LL nurses supplementing the school health services (thereafter referred to as school / LL nurses) included cantons AG, BL, BS, GE, SZ, VS and VD; and collaboration with school authorities included cantons FR, LU, NW, OW, SO, TG and ZG. Before this analysis could be done for HepB, the cantons were first categorized by their HepB vaccination policy (yes, vaccinate for HepB vs. no) or existence of a HepB campaign (yes vs. no) in the schools and then further subdivided into the different modes of data collection. A HepB campaign is defined as one where additional HepB information was shared to supplement the standard disease / vaccination information given to the parents before the routine school health examinations. The final subsets for data collection method, in regards to HepB vaccination policy, are cantons where collaboration with school doctors were sought included AR, GL, GR, SG, SH and ZH; with school / LL nurses included cantons AG, BL, BS, GE, VS and VD; and with school authorities included cantons FR, NW, and Cantons AI, and ZG did not vaccinate against HepB during school 2. Methodology 16 hours while cantons AI, BL, GL, GR, NW, OW, SG, SH, UR and ZG did not organize an official HepB campaign in the schools. In AR and ZH, HepB campaigns were conduc ted in the schools and help was sought from the school doctors; in cantons AG, BS, GE, SZ, VD and VS, school / LL nurses collected the data; and those where collaboration with school officials were requested included cantons FR, LU, SO and TG. Finally, immunization coverage levels for schoolchildren were further investigated by categorizing the cantons into those who do and do not vaccinate within the school health service, and those with and without school / LL nurses to supplement the school health services. Cantons who vaccinate in the schools (not considering HepB) include AG, AR, BE, BS, FR, GL, GR, JU, NE, NW, SG, SH, SZ, TG, VD, VS, and ZH; those who do not vaccinate in the school are AI, BL, GE, LU, OW, SO, TI, UR and ZG. Cantons AG, BL, BS, GE, JU, NW, SZ, VD and VS supplement their school health services with school / LL nurses; those without this additional help include cantons AI, AR, BE, FR, GL, GR, LU, NE, OW, SG, SH, SO, TG, TI, UR, ZG and ZH. As described earlier in the analysis of data collection modes in regard to HepB campaign and vaccination policy in the schools, the grouping of cantons within these two categories remain the same, but now also includes BE, NE and TI. HepB campaigns were also conduc ted in cantons BE and TI and not NE; HepB vaccination may be administered in the schools in BE, but not in NE and TI. Data analysis for VS 2003 is similar to those done for the cantons in 1999-2003. Additional information recorded includes reasons for nonrespons e for schoolchildren, which were collected on the vaccination summary forms. 3. Results 17 3. Results 3.1 ParticipationBetween 1999 and 2003, we have completed the study for all 3 age groups in every sin gle canton. Cantons participating in 1999 were VS and ZH, as part of the pilot study; throughout 2000 to 2002, the remaining 24 cantons participated, averaging about 8 cantons per year [Annex C]. In 2003, data collection was completed for canton VD and the study was once more repeated in canton VS, but without the additional questionnaire. C antons BE and TI conducted the survey in 2001 and 2002, respectively, and shared the data with ISPMZ for analysis. Support for this study was given by all CMO, except from cantons OW and ZG. However, a former president of the pediatric society in canton ZG co-signed the letters sent to the parents in the name of all pediatricians in ZG. Most cantons helped in some way during data collection, particularly with the schoolchildren, by contributing financial and/ or personnel resources and written support such as letters to the parents, municipalities, educational departments or offices of data protection. C antons TG and SO were alone responsible for the entire data collection process after ISPMZ performed the sampling; TI andBE conducted the entire survey independently from ISPMZ, but utilized similar data collection method for comparability purposes. In TI, all chil dren were recruited through the schools, whereas in BE the municipalities were used and parents were directly contacted by the Office of CMO. 3.1.1 Toddlers For 25 cantons, toddlers between 24-35 months of age were selected, except in TI where data was collected from children in the first year of kindergarten. Participation by the individual municipalities was high at a mean of 97.1%, with a low of 89% in cantons TG and FR (Table 2). These two cantons have many municipalities which, although politically integrated, were indicated as separate entities on our sampling frame lists; consequently, some municipalities completed the3. Results 18 requested information without incorporating the requests directed to the other municipalities included in their district. Examination of the age distribution of toddlers at the time when a vaccination card was submitted revealed that the age ranged between 25.5 and 81.3 months, with the mean at 34.7 months of age (standard deviation (SD) \u00b15.30), where 63.9% were between 25 and 35 months of age (data not shown). When excluding toddlers from the canton of TI, the age distribution was between 25.5 and 42.4 months, 33.7 (SD \u00b1 3.6), and 69.2%, respectively. As indicated in Table 2, response rates from families of toddlers who submitted both vaccination cards and questionnaires ranged from a low of 41.9% in TG to a high of 79.6% in AI with an overall mean of 59.9%. Inclusion of information from vaccination cards based solely on parental recalls can increase the participation to as high as 80% (data not shown). Response rates were also increased at all 3 times of contact with the parents, with the first letter being most effective (25 .7%), followed by the telephone call (15.0%), and finally the recall letter (13.7%).3.

Furthermore, a logistic regression of the response rates with vaccination coverage levels at 3 doses of Di and Hib and one dose of measles did not show any differences (data not shown); however, children residing in cantons that achieved response rates of more than 70% have a higher chance of being up to date (UTD) at the 33333111 DTPPolHibMMR series and at 4 doses of Di, Hib, and Pol than those where response3.

Results 22 3.1.2 Schoolchildren Participation by the schoolchildren varied dramatically, depending on the method of data collection (via school directors, teachers, school doctors, or school health officials (Table 4, Annex D)). In cantons where cantonal employed school nurses or school health services supplement the school doctors at health examinations, participation rate was clearly better, ranging between 61.3% and 98.4%, with the mean being at 84.8% for chi ldren at school entry and 84.4% for those at school departure. When working with school doctors, the response rate decreased about 20% with the mean being 60.9% at school entry and 67.2% at school departure. Another 20-25% drop was seen when we worked only with the school officials and teachers to reach the parents. On the other hand, the response rates in NE where families of schoolchildren were directly contacted without aid from the school doctors or officials were mediocre at 69.6% for school entry and 63.5% at school departure; in BE participation was high at 89.5% and 90.6%, respectively, after 4 contacts per mail [Maurer, 2003]. Through the help of school doctors, response rates for the canton of TI were also high at 84.2% and 83.7%, respectively (Annex D.4) [Galfetti, personal communication, 2003] .3. Results 23 The age distribution of the children at school entry submitting information from the vaccination card ranged between 4.5 and 12.5 years, with the mean being 7.3 (SD\u00b11.12) years, where 91.2% were between ages 4 and 8. For those at school departure, the age ranged between 9.6 and 18.8 years, with the mean being 15.0 (SD\u00b11.06) years, where 96.7% were between ages 12 and 16 (data not shown). The influence of the participation level and method of data collection (via school doctors, school/ \"Lungenliga\" (LL) nurses or school authorities) was also examined, in which cantons BE, NE, TI and JU were excluded as parents in cantons BE and NE were directly contacted instead of via schools, the canton TI constructed its own sampling frame and conducted data collection independently from ISPMZ, and coverage estimates were not able to be assessed for canton JU. In Table 4.1.1, it can be seen that response rates, as well as the method of data collection, for children atschool entry do not generally correlate with vaccination coverage, ex cept for being UTD at 3 dosesTable 4.

Results 25 For child ren at school departure, Table 4.1.2 revealed that the method of data collection is more associated with vaccination coverage than the response rate. For adolescents residing in cantons where participation reached 80% or more, the odds of being UTD for 5 doses of Pol is 1.69 (CI: 1.33, 2.16) times that of those residing in cantons where participation was below 60%. Data collection method is highly correlated with being UTD at the 5505111 DTPPolMMR series and 5 doses of Di and Pol where adolescents residing in cantons in which the help of school / LL nurses was sought have an odds of 1.38 (CI: 1.10, 1.72), 1.36 (CI: 1.04, 1.77) and 1.76 (CI: 1.36, 2.27), respectively, times that of those residing in cantons in which school doctors aided in data collection. By HepB, there are significant associations between coverage estimate and participation and mode of data collection (Table 4.1.2.1). Adolescents residing in cantons where participation ranged between 60 and 79% had a significantly lower chance of being UTD (odds ratio: 0.54, CI: 0.38, 0.76) at 1 dose of HepB than those living in cantons where participation in the study was less than 60%. Teenagers living in cantons in which doctors aided in data collection and where there were either HepB campaigns implemented or HepB vaccination permitted in the schools have a lower chance of being UTD for 1 dose and 3 doses of HepB than those residing in cantons where there were neither HepB campaigns nor were HepB vaccination permitted in the schools. In contrary, adolescents residing in cantons where data collection were conducted by the school or LL nurses and school authorities have a higher chance (odds ratio: 2.16 (CI: 1.60, 2.91) and 2.01 (CI: 1.31, 3.09), respectively), of being UTD at 1 dose of HepB when considering whether or not HepB vaccination is permitted in the schools.3.

As it can be seen by the toddlers, where no adjustments and weights were made, participants were similar to the demographic statistics provided by the SFSO only in terms of gender. By nationality and urbanicity, the differences were very apparent. After the application of sampling weights, nonresponse adjustments and poststratification, the distribution of the demographic variables were much more similar to those from the SFSO. By the schoolchildren the difference in demographic background between the participants and the authorative figures from the SFSO varied very little. Similar to the toddlers, with the necessary adjustments and poststratification, the demographic background became more comparable (Annex E for cantonal details).3. Results 28 Table 5.

Results 29 3.3 Immunization coverage Immunization coverage varies within all 3 different age groups (Table 6). 78.0% of the toddlers living in Switzerland are UTD with the 33333111 DTPPolHibMMR series and 70.6% at the 44443111 series. More specifically, cantons SH, AR, AI are among the lowest to be vaccinated, at 49.4%, 66.4%, 66.7%, respectively, for the 33333111 series while TI at 90.7%, VS at 89.6%, and GE at 87.4% are the highest (Annex F.1); for the 44443111 series, SH and AI remain as the cantons with the lowest vaccination coverage while GE and TI as the highest. When analyzing vaccination coverage by the different linguistic regions, toddlers residing in the German-speaking region are only 74.6% UTD for the 33333111 series and 67.0% for the 44443111 series, whereby toddlers in the French-speaking region have a coverage of 86.0% and 78.6%, respectively, and for the canton of TI, coverage levels are even higher at 90.7% and 85.6%, respectively. Only 69.2% of the children at school entry are UTD at the 33333111 series, 49.2% at the 44443111 series, 16.0% at the 55553111 series and 9.9% at the 55553222 series. The same trend can be observed by the children at school entry as compared to the toddlers for all three series, with the children in the German-spe aking region having the lowest immunization coverage, followed by the French-speaking reg ion, with the Italian-speaking region having the highest coverage. Due to missing information for Per and Hib from some school classes (total of 3 classes for children at school entry and 6 for those at school departure), coverage estimates were also examined without including Per and Hib for toddlers and children at school entry for comparative purposes. When notconsidering Per and Hib, coverage estimates for toddlers remained similar to the series with Per and Hib at 79.8% and 73.0% at the 33030111 and 44040111, respectively, DTPPolHibMMR series. For children at school entry, there is a large difference where 84.8% are vaccinated at the 33030111 DTPPolHibMMR series, 81.7% at the 44040111 series, 52.6% at the 55050111 series, and 29.6% at the 55050222 series. More specifically, the canton of SH is lowest at 56.7% for the 33333111 series and 25.1% for the 44443111 series while TI displays the highest coverage at 86.5% and3. Results 30 83.9%, respectively (Annex F.2.1, F.2.2). Even when not considering Per and Hib in the DTPPolHibMMMR immunization series, the same trends are seen at the cantonal level. Finally, this pattern as observed in the two younger age groups, can also be seen by children at school departure, with the DTPPol MMR series which included Per being slightly lower as compared to the series examined without Per. Here the cantons of VS and OW have the lowest coverage for the 6 different DTPPolMMR series while SZ has the highest coverage (Annex F.3.1, F.3.2), regardless if the series included Per or not. Additionally, cantons UR and ZG are often among the cantons with the highest immunization coverage levels for the series requiring 3, 4 or 5 doses for Di and Te, i.e. 3333111, 4434111, 5535111 and 5535222, whereas cantons VD and AG are among the highest for immunization series requiring 6 doses for Di and Te, i.e. 6635111 and 6635222.3.

Results 32 Table 6.1 presents a summary of the coverage, along with the range, by vaccine per dose for all three age groups. C overage estimates for the first 3 doses of Di, Te, and Pol for all 3 age gr oups, including Per and Hib for the toddlers, are relatively high (> 90%). After this, coverage declines, for example to as low as 83.6% for 4 doses of Di for toddlers, 60.0% for 5 doses for children at schoolentry and 51.4% for 6 doses for the teenagers. C overage levels for 1 dose of measles, mumps and rubella are 82.3%, 81.1% and 80.8%, toddlers and increase to 88.4%, 87.0% and 86.6% for those at school entry (Table 6.1, Annex F.4); they remain around 50% at 2 doses for all 3vaccines for the adolescents. For children at school departure, HepB coverage estimates had a wide range, from 7.5% to 88.3% (mean 46.3%) for 1 dose, 6.7% to 82.0% (mean 40.8%) for 2 doses and 2.3% to 68.3% (mean 25.9%) for 3 doses. Here cantons AI, UR and SZ always have the lowest coverage estimates for all 3 doses for HepB, whereas cantons NW and VD have the highest for the 1 st and 2nd doses (Annex F.4).3.

Results 34 Using information extracted from the vaccination card, 219 (2.0%) children 24-35 months remain completely unvaccinated, 39 (0.4%) for those at school entry, and 48 (0.5%) for those at school departure (Table 7, Annex G). More specifically, the Ge rman-speaking region has the majority of the kids who are unvaccinated living in their area. The total number of children who remain unvaccinated is relatively small, with more toddlers remaining unvaccinated as compared to schoolchildren. Table 7.

Because vaccination cards were not collected in canton JU, question naires used to confirm vaccination status. Hence, the calculation for school children does not include JU. 3.4 Demographic influence on immunization coverage Tables 8 display results from the logistic regression analysis for social and demographic factors extracted from the questionnaire with immunization coverage. Sex does not play a significant role invaccination coverage; in contrast, the total number of siblings, both older and younger, are significant factors in vaccination coverage, but only with selected vaccines. 95.0% of toddlers who have 1 or more siblings are vaccinated with 3 doses for Di compared to 97.4% of those who do not have any siblings (Table 8.1).3. Results 35 The odds of being UTD at 3 doses of Di among toddlers who have 1 or more siblings is 0.52 (CI: 0.34, 0.79) times that of those who do not have any siblings. F urthermore, the odds of being UTD for Di at 3 doses among toddlers with more than one younger sibling is 0.69 times (CI: 0.51, 0.93) that of those with no younger siblings. In this case, only 94.4% of those with younger siblings are UTD for 3 doses of Di, in comparison to 96.1% of those without younger siblings. Similar to Di at 3 doses, toddlers with siblings are significantly less vaccinated for mea sles than those with no siblings, with 81.2% and 84.8%, respectively, and the odds ratio being 0.77 (CI: 0.62, 0.97). Toddlers with older siblings have a significantly lower chance of being UTD for mea sles at 1 dose than those without older siblings, with the odds being 0.83 (CI: 0.70, 0.97). Another significant factor associated with being UTD for measles at one dose and series 33333111 is the nationality of the child. 82.2% of ch ildren of foreign background are UTD at the series 33333111 compared to only 76.4% of Swiss toddlers; for measles at one dose, they are 87.7% and 80.2%, respectively. Theodds of being UTD for measles at one dose among children of foreign ethnicity is 1.76 (CI: 1.40, 2.20) times that of the Swiss c hildren; at series 33333111 the odds of being UTD among non- Swiss chi ldren is 1.42 (CI: 1.19, 1.68) times that of Swiss children. Closer examination of the nationality of the children revealed in Table 8.1.1 that only children from countries designated as from southern Europe are significantly better vaccinated against Di and Hib and are more likely to be UTD at the 333333111 series than Swiss children. The odds of being UTD for 3 doses of Di, Hib and at the 333333111series among children from southern Europe is 2.42(1.24, 4.72) and 4.54 (CI: 2.91, times that of Swiss children. For mea sles at one dose, the odds is increased to 7.39 (CI: 4.40, 12.43) times; children of African background also have a significantly higher chance of being vaccinated for measles than Swiss children (odds ratio: 4.28 (CI: 1.40, 13.07)).3.

Results 38 By the children at school entry, sex, the total number of siblings and the number of younger siblings are not significantly associated with vaccination coverage (Table 8.2). More prominent than with the toddlers, having an older sibling plays a significant role in influencing the chance that a child at school entry will be vaccinated. Children with older siblings have a lower chance of being UTD for the 44443111 series, for Di at 4 doses, for Hib at 3 doses and for measles at one dose. In contrast totoddlers, children of foreign background at school entry are significantly less likely to be vaccinated than their Swiss counterpart. The odds of being UTD at series 33333111among children of foreignbackground is 0.85 (CI: 0.74, 0.99) times that of Swiss children; for Di at 4 doses, it is 0.36 (CI: 0.28, 0.46) times; and for Hib at 3 doses, it is 0.48 (CI: 0.42, 0.56). However, the odds of these children being vaccinated for 1 dose of measles is 1.99 (CI: 1.53, 2.57) times that of Swiss children.Further investigation into the influence of nationality reveals the same trend in Table 8.2.1, with children, whose nationality is among one of the countries in the European Union or Norway, having the same chances of being UTD at the 44443111 series and 4 doses of Di and 3 doses of Hib as theSwiss childr en; children of Eastern European background, including Turkey, have a lower chance with the odds being 0.61 (CI: 0.48, 0.38), respectively. In contrast, for m easles at one dose, the pattern is reversed, where the former has a significantly higher chance at being UTD with the odds being 2.51 (CI: 1.58, 3.99) times that of theSwiss.3.

JU, TI, VD: not included in analysis The demographic factors examined are also sporadically associated with vaccination coverage by the children at school departure (T able 8.3). Here the number of younger siblings does not play a significant role, but gender significantly influences coverage when examined at the DTPPolMMR immunization series 5505111 and for Pol at 5 doses. Only 68.3% of boys are vaccinated at the 5505111 series and 78.3% for Pol, compared to 73.2% and 81.4%, respectively, of the girls. The odds of being UTD at the 5505111 series and for 5 doses of Pol among boys is 0.79 (CI: 0.69, 0.91) and 0.83 (CI: 0.71, 0.97), respectively, times that of girls. This difference between boys and girls are also found for rubella, at one dose and two doses, where girls have signi ficantly higher coverage estimates for rubella than boys at the national level (Annex H.1, H.2). The same trend can be seen with the number of siblings and the number of older siblings, with the same chances of being UTD for the 5505111 series and Pol significantly lower for those with siblings, particularly older siblings. The odds of being UTD for the 5505111 series for those with siblings is approximately 0.72 (CI: 0.53, 0.97) and older siblings is 0.77 (CI: 0.65, 0.90) times that of those without siblings. Unlike the two younger age groups, coverage for measles at one dose is not significantly associated with the number of siblings, regardless if they are older or younger. In3. Results 41 addition to siblings, nationality also plays a highly significant role on vaccination coverage, with children of foreign background being less likely to be UTD at the 5505111 series, and for 5 doses of Di and Pol. More specifically, the odds of these children being UTD at the 5505111 series is 0.35 (CI: 0.29, 0.41) times that of the Swiss children. The chances of being UTD for 5 doses of Di and Pol for those children of foreign background are even more reduced at 0.20 (CI: 0.17, 0.26) and0.21 (CI: 0.17, 0.25), respectively. In contrast to the two younger groups, coverage for mea sles at one dose is not significantly associated with the ethnic background of the oldest age group. Sex andthe number of siblings, regardless if they are older or younger, have no association with HepB coverage; on the other hand, children of foreign background are significantly better vaccinated than Swiss children for HepB (Table 8.3.1). The odds of being UTD for 1 dose of HepB for children offoreign background is 1.46 (CI: 1.20, 1.77) times that of Swiss children; the odds of being UTD for3 doses of HepB is 1.39 (CI: 1.15, 1.68). More detailed analysis into the effect of nationality confirmed the aforedescribed phenomenon: aside from the 5505111 series for children whose nationality is part of the European Union or Norway, adolescents of foreign background have a significantly lower chance of being UTD at the 5505111 series, for 5 doses of Di and Pol than Swiss children; by HepB at 1 and 3 doses, the effect is in the opposite direction, where foreigners have a higher chance of being UTD (Table 8.3.2). The highest level of education attained by the mother plays a significant role in immunization coverage (p<0.05). Toddlers of mothers with higher educational background (masters or university degree) are less likely to be UTD with the recommended vaccination plan at series 33333111 than those with middle (technical and teaching schools) and low educational backgrounds (completing 9 mandatory school years or lower), with vaccination coverage estimates at 73.0%, 78.4%, and 83.9%,respectively (Table 8.1). The odds of being UTD at series 33333111 among those with a middle degree of education is 0.69 (CI: 0.55, 0.88) times, and those with ucational background is 0.52 (CI: 0.39, 0.68) times, that of lower educational background. For Di and Hib at 3 doses, there is a significant difference between vaccination coverage only between those children whose mothers' educational level is classified as low and high, with high educational background3. Results 42 yielding significantly lower coverage. By measles for toddlers and children at school entry, this trend is also observed (Tables 8.1 and 8.2). For ch ildren at school entry, the odds of being UTD among children whose mothers' educational background lies in the middle is 2.60 (CI: 1.94, 3.49) times, and those with the highest educational background is 1.74 times (CI: 1.20, 2.51), that of lower educational background. For the children at school departure, teenagers whose mothers' ed ucational level is rated as being in the middle have significantly the highest coverage estimates at the 5505111 series and for 5 doses of Di and Pol; adolescents of mothers with low educational background have the lowest coverage (Table 8.3). By measles at one dose, the odds of being UTD among teenagers whose mothers' educational background is defined as high is 0.51 (CI: 0.33, 0.77) times that of those whose mother's educational background is rated as low. Similarly, teenagers whose mother's educational level is rated low has a higher chance of being UTD for HepB than those whose mother's educational background is rated medium or high, although there is little or no difference incoverage estimates between the two latter groups (Table 8.3.1).3.

Results 45 3.5 Vaccinating professionals Question: By whom was your child vaccinated (More than one answer was possible.)Table 9 displays the distribution of health professionals active in vaccinating children in the 3 age groups. 79.2% of all toddlers were vaccinated by their pediatricians, whereas only 21.5% by general practitioners (GPs). Combined, complementary / alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners and otherhealth professionals contributed to approximately 3%. Pediatricians remain by far as the most cited health profesional to vaccinate children at school entry (71.3%), followed by GPs (40.6%) and school health personnel (12.8%) while CAM practitioner and others making up the last category at 4.1%. By children at school departure, the distribution of vaccinators is more evenly dispersed: 58.4% were the GPs, 60.4% were pediatricians, 47.5% were school health officials; 4.1% were vaccinated by other health professionals. When examining this distribution among the different linguistic regions, the same trends are observed, with pediatricians playing an even more apparent role by vaccination than the GPs in the F rench- and Italian-speaking regions compared to the German-speaking region for the two younger age groups. By the older schoolchildren, the differences are less apparent in the Ger man-speaking region, but remains the same in the French- speaking region. Upon examination of this distribution of health professionals by cantons, it is noteworthy to see that in smaller cantons, such as in AR, GL, LU, OW and NW, the frequency of the toddlers being vaccinated by the GP and pediatrician is the same (Annexes I.1, I.2, I.3). AI is an exception where 85.9% of the vaccinators are GPs, and only 15.5% are pediatricians. By schoolchildren, vaccination policy and additional help of school or LL nurses become apparent. Parents living in cantons with additional help in the school health service or where the school doctors are permitted to vaccinate in the schools cited that their children were vaccinated by school officials much more often than those without these conditions.3.

However, closer examination by cantons confirms that dissatisfaction is highest among parents in cantons VS, NE and FR. On the other hand, the canton of JU has the highest level of satisfaction (Annex J.1). Toddlers whose parents claimed to have received information regarding vaccination are significantly less likely to be vaccinated than those who have not received information (Table 11.1).

Results 48 among toddlers whose parents have received information is 0.65 (CI: 0.51, 0.82) and 0.55 (CI: 0.40, 0.75), respectively, times that of those who have not received information. Among those who have received information, and are satisfied, 72.0% fit into this category; the other 28.0% were not satisfied or did not know how to respond. Among those who are satisfied with the information, 79.7% are UTD with the 33333111 immunization series and only 70.3% for those who are not satisfied; the odds of being UTD among those satisfied is 1.65 (CI: 1.39, 1.96) times that of those not satisfied or did not know. This pattern is also significantly observed with Di at 4 doses, Hib at 3doses and measles at 1 dose. The same pattern for information status is also observed by the schoolchildren, as shown in Table 10. 91.8% of the parents of children at school entry have received information regarding vaccination, and 87.2% of those at school departure. Of these families, 67.0% of the former group are satisfied with the current information, 17.8% are not satisfied, and 6.8% remained undecided and 8.4% did not answer the question. By children at school departure, it is 69.5%, 14.7%, 8.1% and 7.7%, respectively. The percentage of those not satisfied decreased as those who did not know or refrainedfrom answering increased. This distribution of satisfaction/ dissatisfaction is similar throughout the different linguistic regions. Among the parents of children at school entry, those in canton OW displayed the least amount of satisfaction. The highest proportion of parents of schoolchildren whorefrained from answering the question or who responded as did not know resided in canton AI (Annexes J.2, J.3). Similar to the toddlers, children at school entry whose parents have received information have lower coverage for measles at one dose than those where parents have not received information (Table 11.2). The odds of these children being UTD for 1 dose of mea sles is 0.64 (CI: 0.44, 0.94) times that of those who have not received information. Unlike the toddlers, children at school entry whose parents have received information are significantly better vaccinated for Di at 4 doses and Hib at 3 doses than those who have no information, with the odds being 1.88 (CI: 1.34, 2.64) and 1.47 (CI: 1.17, 1.85), respectively. Those who are satisfied with the information received are significantly better vaccinated for the 44443111 immunization series, Di, Pol and mea sles than those who are dissatisfied.3. Results 49 In contrast to the other two age groups, coverage for mea sles at one dose for children at school departure who have or have not received information regarding vaccination is not significantly different. However, children in this age group whose parents have received information are significantly better vaccinated than those with no information at the 5505111 series and for Di and Pol at 5 doses (Table 11.3). The odds of being UTD at series 5505111, 5 doses of Di and Pol among adolescents whose parents have information regarding vaccination are 1.88 (CI: 1.49, 2.37), 2.17 (CI: 1.72, 2.76), and 2.29 (CI: 1.78, 2.95), respectively, times that of those whose parents have no information or who were not sure of the information they received. Like the other two age groups, teenagers whose parents are satisfied with the information they have regarding vaccination are significantly better vaccinated than those whose parents are dissatisfied, with the highest odds of being UTD for measles at one dose. This trend is also seen with HepB, where having information about vaccination and satisfaction with the information received increase the chances of the adolescent being UTD for this vaccine, with the odds being 1.53 (CI: 1.25, 1.89) and 1.39 (CI: 1.08, 1.79), respectively, for HepB at one dose and 1.54 (CI: 1.30, 1.82) and 1.50 (CI: 1.25, 1.82), respectively, for HepB at 3 doses (Table 11.3.1).3.

Of the information available, the top 3 resources for information regarding vaccination for all 3 age groups include information from the doctors upon request, followed by information brochures, and obtaining the information from their physicians without it being requested. In the future, parents would like to receive more information from the doctors, instead of having to ask the doctors themselves (Table 12, Annex K). They would like less information from the media, but more from the health insurance. Among the different language regions, the same trend is observed for the type of information available and what they wish to receive in the future. The two major differences are the information from public health facilities and the active seeking of information. More precisely, parents in all regions for the 2 youngest age groups prefer information to be given to them freely bythe physicians; by the adolescents, the same trend is observed in the German-speaking region, but the difference is not apparent, either by the French-speaking region or by the overall mean. Parents in the German -speaking region significantly receive more information from the public health facilities than those in the French- and Italian-speaking regions. Parents of toddlers generally would like more information from public health services, whereas the trend is reversed for those in the school age groups. Finally, more par ents recognize the increase in information from school health3. Results 54 official as their children are older; consequently, they would like this flow of information to also increase in the future. Table 12.

Results 55 3.7 Use of complementary / alternative medicine (CAM) Question: Have you ever used any form of alternative medicine for your child?In Switzerland, 41.7% of families of toddlers use some form of CAM, with a steady decrease as the children are older, down to 37.9% at school entry and to 30.9% at school departure (Table 13). Table 13.

BE, TI, VD: no information for schoolchildren since questionnaire was not used. More specifically, parents in the French-speaking region utilize CAM much more than their German counterpart, although the pattern of decrease use of CAM with increasing age remains the same. In all three age groups, the most frequently reported use of CAM are in the French-speaking can tons, with the exception of canton OW, where 56.5% of parents of toddlers admitted to using some form of CAM (Annex L). When examining the use of CAM against immunization coverage, it appears to be consistently associated with vaccination rates. Toddlers of parents who use CAM have a lower chance of being UTD. For the 33333111 series, the odds of being UTD among these toddlers is 0.38 (CI: 0.33, 0.43) times that of those where the parents do not use CAM. Further investigation into the individual vaccines for both toddlers and chi ldren at school entry reveal the same pattern (Tables 11.1, 11.2). This pattern is also found among the children at school departure for mea sles at3. Results 56 one dose and HepB at one dose and at 3 doses, but for Di and Pol at 5 doses, the trend is reversed (Tables 11.3, 11.3.1). Here, adolescents whose parents use CAM are better vaccinated than those whose parents do not practice C AM. The odds of being UTD for 5 doses of Di and Pol among teenagers whose parents use CAM is 1.26 (CI: 1.06, 1.56) and 1.29 (CI: 1.06, 1.56), respectively, times that of those whose parents do not use CAM. For toddlers and children at school departure whose parents use C AM, a significant difference could be found in coverage levels between those residing in the French- and German-speaking regions (Tables 11.1, 11.3). The odds of being UTD for toddlers from the French-speaking region at the 33333111 DTPPolHibMMR series, 3 doses of Di and Hib, and 1 dose of mea sles is 2.66 (CI: 2.17, 3.25), 2.83 and 2.83 (CI: 2.26, 3.53), respectively, times that of those from the German-speaking region. In contrast, the odds that adolescents from the French-speaking region are UTD with the 5550111 DTPPolHibMMR series, 5 doses of Di and1 dose times that of those from the German-speaking region; for 1 dose and 3 doses of HepB, the odds of being UTD are 2.06 (CI: 1.45, 2.91) and 3.44 (CI: 2.41, 4.93), respectively (Table 11.3.1). There was no significant difference in CAM use between the linguistic regions for the children at school entry, as seen in Table 11.2.3. Results 57 3.8 Linguistic region Almost as pronounced as the use of alternative medicine is the influence of the different linguistic regions on vaccination coverage. The general trend for the two younger age groups shows that those children from the German-speaking regions are significantly less vaccinated, followed by the French-speaking reg ion, and finally the Italian-speaking region has the highest immunization coverage, with the trend being less distinct as the age of the children climbs (Tables 11.1, 11.2). Only 74.6% of toddlers residing in the Germ an-speaking region have completed the vaccination series 33333111 in comparison to 86.0% of those residing in the French-speaking region and 90.7% in the Italian-speaking region. The odds of being UTD for the 33333111 series among thosetoddlers in the and 3.33 (CI: 2.56, 4.34), respectively, times that of those in the German -speaking region. By Di and Hib at 3 doses, this pattern is also significantly similar. For measles at one dose, the odds is even higher at 2.41 (CI:1.99, 2.92) for the French-speaking region, and 3.96 (CI: 2.90, 5.40) for the Italian-speaking region to be UTD, as compared to their German counterparts. This trend is also apparent for children at school entry, with the odds of being UTD for series 44443111 and measles at 1 dose for the French-speaking region are 1.62 (CI: 1.37, 1.92) and 1.39 (CI: 1.09, 1.76), respectively, and for the Italian-speaking region are 6.40 (CI: 4.95, 8.28) and 2.17 (CI: 1.46, 3.23), respectively, times that ofthose from the German -speaking region. By 4 doses of Di and 3 doses of Hib, the odds that children from the Italian-speaking region are UTD are 1.60 (CI: 1.10, 2.34) and 1.19 (CI: 1.05, 1.35), respectively, times that of those residing in the German-speaking region. This pattern is not so distinct in the oldest age group as displayed in Table 11.3. By the 5505111 series and Di at 5 doses, coverage levels for the children in the German- and French-speaking regions are similar, but they are lower than those in the Italian-speaking region; by Pol, coverage in the German- and Italian-speaking regions are similar, but significantly lower than the French- speaking region; for measles at one dose, children from the French- and Italian-speaking regions, 91.7% and 91.5%, respectively, are significantly less vaccinated than those from the German-3. Results 58 speaking region (94.7%). The odds of being UTD for measles at one dose for among adolescents living in the Fr ench- speaking region is 0.62 (CI: 0.50, 0.77) times that of those in the German- speaking region; for the Italian-speaking region, the odds is 0.59 (CI: 0.45, 0.77) times. In contrast to measles, adolescents in the French-and Italian-speaking regions have significantly higher chancesof being vaccinated for HepB than those children in the Germ an-speaking region (Table 11.3.1). The odds of being UTD for HepB at one dose among those living in the French-speaking region is 2.86 (CI: 2.31, 3.54) times that of those living in the German-speaking reg ion; for the Italian speaking region, the odds is 3.77 (CI: 2.85, 5.00) times. 3.9 School vaccination policy Vaccination coverage in schoolchildren was also examined against school immunization policy. Cantons with cantonal employed school or LL nurses supplementing school health services (AG, BL, BS, GE, NW, SZ, VD and VS) have overall significantly higher vaccination coverage by the immunization series than those without these services for both age groups, with coverage estimates for ch ildren at school entry being 59.3% and 44.0%, respectively, for the 44443111 DTPPolHibMMR series and for school departure, 75.7% and 70.0%, respectively, for the 5505111 DTPPolMMR series (Tables 14.1, 14.2). The odds of being UTD for the 44443111 series for children at school entry in cantons with these services is 1.86 (CI: 1.61, 2.14) times that of those in cantons where there are no supplementary school health nurses; by the adolescents, the odds is 1.33 (CI: 1.14, 1.55) at the 5505111 immunization series. For measles at one dose, coverage is significantly higher for children at school entry in cantons with these services, whereby they do not influence coverage by the adolescents. However, by the children at school departure, the odds of being UTD for Pol at 5 doses and HepB at 1 dose for children in cantons with additional school health nurses is 1.46 (CI: 1.20, 1.76) and 1.66 (CI: 1.33, 2.08), respectively, times that of those residing in cantons without the extra help (Tables 14.2, 14.2.1). Further analyses of the services with the additional nurses against higher doses for the recommended vaccines (i.e. for school entry, 5 doses for Di and Pol, 4 doses for Hib; for school departure, DTPPolMMR immunization series at6605111 and 5505222, 6 doses for Di and 2 doses for measles) as displayed in Tables 14.1 and3. Results 59 14.2 show that chil dren in cantons where the additional n urses are available have a significantly better chance of being vaccinated than those living in cantons where they rely solely on the school doctors for school health services. In contrast to additional help from school / LL nurses, the policy in which immunization is permitted in the schools is not significantly associated with vaccination coverage by the adolescents; however, when analyzed against higher doses, children where vaccination is permitted in the schools do have asignificantly higher chance of being vaccinated than those living in cantons where immunization is done privately by the GPs (T able 14.2). At 5 doses of Di, 1 dose of measles and immunization series 5505111, the differences in vaccination coverage levels are not significant, whereas at 6 doses of Di, 2 doses of measles and the immunization series 6605111, the odds of being UTD among adolescents living in cantons where vaccination is permitted in the schools are significantly higher at1.32 (CI: 1.12, 1.56), 1.39 (CI: 1.16, 1.66), and 1.22 (CI: 1.04, 1.44), respectively, than those where it is not possible to vaccinate in the schools. There is no significant difference in HepB coverage among the cantons with and without HepB campaign in the schools. There is however a significant association between the odds of being UTD for 3 doses of HepB and whether or not HepB vaccination is permitted in the schools. Adolescents residing in cantons where HepB vaccination is administered in the schools have an odds of being UTD at 3 doses of HepB of 0.58 (CI: 0.46, 0.71) times that of adolescents living in cantons where HepB vaccination is not offered during school hours (Table 14.2.1). Association between vaccination status of children at school entry and the factor of residing in cantons where vaccination is permitted in the schools depends on the vaccine. At 5 doses of Di and Pol, children living in cantons where vaccination is permitted in school have a signi ficantly higher chance of being vaccinated than children living in cantons where immunizations are done privately, with the odds at 1.99 (CI: 1.73, 2.28) and 2.10 (CI: 1.83, 2.41), respectively (Table 14.1). In contrast, by the 44443111 immunization series and Hib, at 3 and 4 doses, children at school entry living in cantons where they can be vaccinated by school health officials have lower immunization3. Results 60 coverage than compared to those living in cantons where vaccination is encouraged to be administered by the family physicians. 47.8% of children in cantons belonging to the former group is UTD for the 44443111 series as compared to 53.4% in the latter group; it is 76.9% and 82.3%, respectively for Hib at 3 doses and 23.9% and 33.3%, respectively, at 4 doses (Table 14.1).

I follow the doctor's recommendations regarding vaccination. 2. There is too much social pressure to vaccinate children. 3. I believe that vaccination protects from certain diseases. 4. As many children as possible should be vaccinated so that all children will be protected from complications associated with certain diseases. 5. Doctors provide enough information on childhood immunization. 6. I am concerned about possible side effects from vaccines. Parental attitudes toward vaccination in general are also strongly associated with immunization coverage, with the same trend revealed for all six statements described above (Tables 15). These six statements posed on the questionnaire dealt with following the doctor's recommendations, social pressure to vaccinate, effectiveness of vaccination, importance of solidarity, explanation of doctors, and concerns regarding possible side effects. By parents of toddlers, 89.9% parents agree or3. Results 64 strongly agree that they follow the recommendations of the physicians, 58.0% disagree that there is too much social pressure in society, 96.7% believe in the effectiveness of vaccination, 78.8% would vaccinate their children for the benefit of all kids, 64.0% agree or strongly agree that doctors provide enough information about vaccination, and 55.7% of the parents are concerned with possible side effects (Table 15.1). In short, toddlers whose parents follow the recommendations of their doctors, believe in the effectiveness of vaccination, concur with the advantage of herd immunity and agree that doctors provide enough explanations about vaccination are better vaccinated than those whose parents do not agree with these statements. In contrast, toddlers whose parents thought there were too much social pressure to vaccinate their children and have concerns about possible side effects from vaccines are less likely to be vaccinated as compared to those who disagree. Most pronounced are the responses to following the doctor's recommendations and the effectiveness of vaccination where the odds of being UTD for meas les at 1 dose among those who strongly agree with these statements are 42.70 (CI: 31.88, 57.17) and 22.25 (CI: 13.74, 36.06) tim es, respectively, that of those who disagree. In contrast, the odds of being UTD for measles at 1 dose among those who strongly agree that there is too much pressure to vaccinate their children and are concerned about side effects from vaccination are 0.08 (CI: 0.06, 0.10) and 0.09 (CI: 0.07, 0.12) times, respectively, that of those who disagree. The odds of being UTD are higher for those who responded with \"strongly agree\" t han with \"agree\" or \"do not know\" when the reference group is \"do not agree\" for statem ents with positive con sequences towards vaccination, whereas the odds of being UTD for those who responded with \"strongly agree\" than with \"agree\" to statements that are negative towards vaccination are lowest.3.

Results 66 For schoolchildren, the trend remains similar to those apparent by the toddlers, but the magnitude of the odds of being UTD is smaller, with the magnitude decreasing with increasing age (Tables 15.2, 15.3). Of the 4 conditions examined for being UTD, the differences in the odds of being UTD for measles at one dose are distinctly magnified among the 6 statements posed. For example, for responses as to whether or not parents of children at school entry follow the recommendations of their doctor, the odds of being UTD for the 44443111 series, 4 doses of Di and 3 doses of Hib for those who strongly agree with this statement are 6.51 (CI: 4.81, 8.82), 3.26 (CI: 2.29, 4.62), and 3.86 (CI: 2.96, 5.04) times, respectively, that of those who disagree; for mea sles at one dose, the odds of being UTD is 22.15 (CI: 15.80, 31.05). Although the same trend is prominent among the adolescents, the the odds of being UTD for the 5505111 series, 5 doses of Di and 5 doses of Pol, and 1 dose of meas les vaccination for those who strongly agree with this statement are only 3.39 (CI: 2.55, 4.49), 2.10 6.51 (CI: 4.10, 10.38) times, respectively, that of those who disagree. Notable is also for those who responded with \"do not know\" to these questions. Teenagers whose parents are unsure of how to respond have a lower chance of being UTD for the immunization series 5505111 and Di and Pol at 5 doses than those who disagreed with the statements. As seen in Table 15.3.1, the same trend is revealed for HepB at both 1 dose and 3 doses.3. Results 67 Table 15.2.

Results 70 3.11 Perception of the dangers of childhood vaccine preventable diseases Question: In your opinion, would the following illnesses be very dangerous, dangerous, or not dangerous for your child if he / she has not been vaccinated? Presented in Tables 16.1-16.3 is the logistic regression of parental perceptions of the dangers of certain childhood vaccine preventable diseases with different immunization coverage estimates for allthree age groups. For toddlers, Pol, Hib and Te are perceived as extremely dangerous by 72.8%, 80.0% and 56.5% respectively, of parents, with Di at 44.7% and Per at 23.1%; in contrast, almost 50% of parents do not view measles, mumps and rubella as dangerous (Table 16.1). C onsequently, this perception greatly influences the chances of the child being vaccinated, with the likelihood that atoddler is vaccinated for a disease perceived as dangerous is significantly higher than when the disease is not perceived as dangerous; the odds ratios range between 1.57- 11.50, with the largest difference observed with Hib. Moreover, even toddlers of parents who answer \"do not know\" to this question are better vaccinated than those responding \"not dangerous\"; the percentages of thoseUTD increase as the responses proceed towards the positive spectrum, with \"very dangerous\" yielding the highest immunization coverage. As in the comparison for attitudes towards vaccination between children at school entry and toddlers, the same pattern can be found with the perception of the dangers of childhood preven table diseases. Children at school entry whose parents believed that a disease is very dangerous have the greatest chance of being UTD (range 1.25-3.06), with the magnitude of the odds of being UTD higher by the toddlers (Table 16.2). Teenagers whose parents perceived that a vaccine preventable disease is dangerous have a significantly higher chance of being UTD than those whose parents find it not dangerous. There is no distinction between those who responded with \"dangerous\" and \"very dangerous\". Only by measles are the odds of being UTD for those who found it very dangerous not significantly different from those who do not find it dangerous. In contrast, adolescents whose parents are unsure3. Results 71 of how to rate the dangerousness of measles, mumps and rubella are less likely to be UTD at the 6605111 and 5505111 immunization series than those whose parents perceived these diseases as being not dangerous; the odds of being UTD for the 5505111 series being 0.56 0.90), respectively (Table 16.3).

Results 74 3.12 Valais 1999 vs. 2003 3.12.1 Participation Participation by parents of the toddlers improved from 58.4% in 1999 to 74.6% in 2003, with the increase due to the 27.7% of the contacts made per telephone (Table 17.1). Participation acquired via the first letter remained unchanged, but those acquired via the second recall letter decreased from 30.3% in 1999 to 19.5% in 2003. For chi ldren at school entry, the number of participating classes increased, but the overall percentage slightly decreased from 93.3% in 1999 to 92.0% in 2003. However, the number of submitted vaccination cards increased from 309 (55.2%) to 472 (76.6%). Despite the 100% participation from the selected classes and the increase in the number of submitted vaccination cards by the adolescents at school departure from 371 in 1999 to 590 in 2003, the overall participation decreased from 86.5% to 79.2%. Because HepB vaccination was recorded on a separate sheet of paper in 1999, and in some cases only these were submitted without the vaccination cards sheets (from 16 students), the n for HepB was 387 in 1999. Tables 17.2.1-.2 display reasons for nonparticipation in the survey only in 2003, as this information was not collected for 1999. As seen in Table 17.2.1, the most prominent reason for nonparticipation by parents of toddlers is the failure to make personal contact with the selected family, where telephone numbers were not found for 55 (37.9%) households, no contact was made despite having the telephone number for 29 (20.0%) households and letters were not delivered to the family as theycould not be found for 24 (16.6%) households. By the schoolchildren, 144 (23.4%) children at school entry and 155 (20.8%) at school departure did not submit their vaccination cards to the nurses. Many p rovided no reasons; for those who did, the most prominent reason is refusal to participate.3. Results 75 Table 17.1.

After removing the responses made through telephone contacts, differences in coverage levels remained significant only by MMR and Hib (Fig 1). In contrast to the toddlers, coverage estimates for all vaccines increased from 1999 to 2003 for the schoolchildren, as seen in Table 17.3. By children at school entry, the difference in Per coverage between the two years is significant at all doses, whereas Di and Te are significant only at 5 doses, Hib at 4 doses and MMR at 2 doses. For adolescents at school departure, the differences in Di, Te and Per coverage estimates between the two years are significant at all doses. For Pol at 6 doses, the coverage of 60.7% in 1999 decreased to 10.6% in 2003, whereas at 4 doses of Pol, coverage increased from 89.5% to 94.1%. MMR has3. Results 77 also significantly increased from approximately 30% in 1999 to 85% for 2 doses. This also applies to HepB for the 1st and 2nd doses, where it rose from 54% to 84%. Table 17.3.

Discussion 80 4. Discussion During the 5 years of implementing this survey, much effort was expended to understand the existing infrastructures and compile the necessary information before the methodology could be adapted. Because one of the major goals of the study is to build a surveillance system to determine vaccination coverage in each canton by utilizing this study as a foundation, we attempted to use the existing infrastructure where possible to increase acceptance, ease the workload and maintain an acceptable budget. While this was achieved, data quality was compromised, particularly for the schoolchildren. The methodology employed for the toddlers is an adaptation of the WHO recommended EPI cluster sampling method to determine vaccination coverage for children between 24-35 months of age, and has been conducted in the past years by many cantons independently [Henderson and communication, 2000; Maurer, 1997, 2001, 2003]. Changes in our survey from the established protocol to increase precision from \u00b110% to \u00b17% included sampling more clusters in each canton, selecting the number of samples proportional to the size of the selected cluster and increasing sample size. Because of the inclusion of a questionnaire and the larger sample size, effort to increase response rate, despite enormous attempts, was not as successful as what was achieved by the cantons in the previous years. Participation ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 83%. Comparison of responders andnonresponders revealed differences by urbanicity and nationality. Although urbanicity does not seem to be correlated with vaccination coverages, nationality is an important factor. Nonresponse adjustment and post-stratification of responders were made to account for this difference, but further research into characterization of nonresponders is warranted in order to4. Discussion 81 make the necessary statistical adjustments more effective. Finally, our results also showed that response rates correlate with vaccination coverage levels where children residing in cantons with participation of more than 70% having a significantly higher chance of being UTD than those residing in cantons where participation was below 60%. This clearly indicates that more efforts should be expended to decrease bias resulting from participation level in the study. For the schoolchildren, the data collected have been compromised, such that comparison among the cantons and among the age groups within the canton is difficult. Because collaboration was sought with various organizations, potential variations in data collectionmethod were high among the cantons. This is due to diverse organizational structures within the school health services and school authorities, different methods of data collection, the wide grade range for health exams, and the different vaccination policy, such as grade levels at which the routine health exams are mandated, vaccines that are offered in the school, whether or not school doctors are allowed to vaccinate at all, and whether or not HepB campaign is actively conducted in the school (Annex M.1, M.2). Our results showed that coverage levels are affected by participation in the study and the data collection methodology employed, with the latter being more influential. Additionally, the period during data collection and school vaccination may not have coincided, which consequently could yield inaccurate estimates. Catch-up shots administered by the family physicians would be missed in some cases. Moreover, problems encountered within the individual cantons also exacerbate the comparability problem, such as incompleteness of the vaccination summary form by some of the school doctors and nurses. Finally, by using the schools, the nature of the non- responders is not known. There could be many reasons, ranging from being recently vaccinated by their family physician, to downright refusal of any vaccines.4. Discussion 82 Moreover, coverage estimates obtained for all age groups could be an over-estimation of the actual coverages in the population, due to the high nonresponse rate and not taking into account valid vaccination doses. While some health studies show that there are not much differences between responders and nonresponders, other studies have contradicted Fowler et al, 2002]. A recent hypothetical cohort study revealed that studies with low response proportions may actually be less biased than studies with high response proportions; however, vaccination coverage was not the target health variable in this simulation [Stang and J\u00f6ckel, 2004]. Confirming this, our survey did demonstrate that participation rates for the toddlers and children at school departure are directly related to immunization coverage levelswhere those living in cantons in which higher participation in the study was attained have a higher chance of being UTD. Contrary to this, two studies in Switzerland have shown data revealing differences in vaccination status of children with timeliness of response where those responding later or not at all are less likely to be up to date with the recommended vaccination scheme [Schorr et al, 1993; Golay, personal communication, 2003]. Although basic adjustment has been made to address nonresponse bias by redistributing the weights of nonresponders to responders and poststratification, more precise matching of the samples by nationality would better address this problem. Subsequently, by assuming that nonresponders behave similarly to responders, this naive nonresponse adjustment could also over-estimate vaccination coverage. Further over-estimation of immunization coverage could stem from the fact that the validity of vaccination doses was not evaluated before determining coverage levels due to lack of resources. A study in the United States where the required interval between doses were evaluated showed that 10.5% of children received at least one invalid dose of vaccine and that coverage estimates were decreased by 0.7% for 3 doses of polio, 6.5% for 3 doses of Hepatitis B and 3.4% for the 4443111 DTPPolMMR series for those between 19-35 months of age [Stokely et al, 2004]. Additionally, a large study in Sweden also4. Discussion 83 demonstrated that when dates of actual vaccination were recorded, postponed MMR vaccinations up to 1.5 years beyond the recommended 18 months accounted for about half the reported drop in coverage in 2001 [Dannetun et al, 2004]. Over-estimation of vaccination coverage could lead to missing kids and adding them to the pool of unvaccinated children, which could eventually lead to future outbreaks. Moreover, kids who have an invalid dose must be re-vaccinated, increasing not only health care cost, but also the risk of adverse reactions and injection discomfort. However, coverage estimates obtained could also be an under-estimation. Although new vaccination cards were also accepted, no considerations were made for doses that were alreadycompleted but recorded elsewhere. Additionally, many foreigners participating in the study have missing information on vaccination completed outside of Switzerland. Hence, when lacking written confirmation for abroad or in Switzerland, assumptions that no other vaccinations were administered were made. This could lead to conservative immunization coverage estimates. Despite these methodological limitations, the results can be interpreted with some confidence, as they corroborate coverage and significant associations obtained in the many studies already conducted in and outside of Switzerland [Minder and Steffen, 2001, 2003; WHO: global summaries, 2003]. Despite their overall higher response rate, national coverage estimates remain similar between 1991- 2003 in Switzerland (Table 18).4. Discussion 84 Table 18.

Includes onlyinformation from t he vaccination cards. c: same as a, but includes vaccination information based on parental recall. d: vaccination information from parental recall and vaccination cards, but does not include any adjustments or weights. Moreover, the method used with the toddlers is an established method by the WHO and has been implemented in many countries worldwide to determine vaccination coverage. Although the validity of the administered vaccine doses was not investigated in our survey, the study by Stokely et al [2004] described earlier found that excluding invalid doses from vaccination coverage estimates had litle effect on the national coverage levels for the United States, except for HepB series; however, state coverage levels were affected. Furthermore, as data was collected via mixed modes (mail and telephone), nonresponse bias due to single mode, as shown by Fowler et al [2002] and Brambilla and McKinlay [1987], can be reduced while also increasing the response rate. Finally, although comparability may be compromised in our data, this is the first survey to examine vaccination coverage in every single canton.4. Discussion 85 Examination of immunization coverage at different series of DTPPolHibMMR for toddlers and children at school entry and of DTPPolHibMMR series for children at school departure reveals that children in these age groups are far below the immunization coverage, as recommended by the SFOPH and the WHO [Swiss National Immunization Survey, 2000]. When comparing coverage estimates attained and those needed to block transmission of the infectious agent at the individual level [Anderson and May, 1990], toddlers have achieved this critical coverage for Di and Pol, but are 12% below the minimum necessary coverage level required for Per, 10% for measles, 9% for mumps, and 4% for rubella. Except for Pol at 5 doses for the adolescents, schoolchildren appear to be drastically under-vaccinated, particularly those at school entry. Because of methodological difficulty encountered with thecompleteness of the vaccination summary form, the DTPPolHibMMR series for toddlers and children at school entry and DTPPolMMR for children at school departure were re-evaluated without including Per and Hib for comparative purposes. From this re-evaluation, it can be seen that catch-up shots are administered between the years examined, as coverage estimates at the 33030111 and 44040111 series are lowest for the toddlers, then increased, although still sub-optimal, by school entry and remains at this level at school departure; coverage levels then increase at the 5505111 and 5505222 series by the adolescents compared to the children at school entry. Coverage estimates are then drastically reduced when looking at 2 doses of MMR and the recommended 5 doses of Di and Te for children at school entry and 6 for school departure. This decrease in the already low immunization coverage indicates that more efforts are needed to be expended in order to reach the optimal goal for vaccination coverage set by the WHO to establish herd immunity and prevent circulation of the wild type virus [Anderson and May, 1990]. Herd immunity is especially important for those vulnerable in the population, such as infants, the elderly, and immuno-compromised individuals whose immune system is underdeveloped or weakened [Vitek et al, 2003]. Recent increase in outbreaks due4. Discussion 86 to importation of the infectious agent through faster and easier global mobility mandates high immunization coverage levels [Wilson, 2003; Gushulak and MacPherson, 2004]. As demonstrated in the numerous measles outbreak throughout Europe as described in the Introduction, containment of the various outbreaks in communities with low immunization coverage had been probably due to high coverage in the neighboring communities that have achieved herd immunity [van den Hof et al, 2002; de Melker, 2003; Yip et al, 2004]. In the case where parents continue to decline vaccination to avoid the potential vaccine associated risks, then a major epidemic outbreak could occur as the number of susceptible individuals will increase [Jansen et al, 2003; Wallinga et al, 2005]. This predicament had alreadyhappened in England with Per in the mid 1970's when coverage dropped from 80-90% to a 30% low [Ulmer and Liu, 2002; Baker, 2003]. Consequently, two severe outbreaks of whooping cough occurred, which resulted in more than 120,000 reported cases, with hundreds of serious complications and 28 deaths. Furthermore, Van der Wielen et al [2003] showed that a pertussis booster vaccination is needed as the antibody level declined after the age of 20 years. Comparison of the Swiss national coverage for children between 24-35 months to the WHO global estimates and estimates from the WHO designated regions reveals, as displayed in Table 19, that coverage levels for toddlers for 3 doses of DTP and Pol residing in Switzerland between 1999-2003 are similar to those children in the European, American and developed regions, and are far higher than the global estimates and in the remaining regions. For measles at one dose, children in Switzerland are 6-8 percentage points below the European and the developed regional estimates [WHO: Global summaries, 2003]. Measles coverage for children in Switzerland is among the lowest of the selected European and industrialized countries in Table 19. Compared to its immediate neighbors France, Italy, Germany and4. Discussion 87 Austria, coverage for children in Switzerland is only higher than those from Austria for all vaccines (DTP at 3 doses, Pol at 3 doses and MMR at one dose) and from Italy at one dose of MMR.

Except for Greece and Italy at one dose of MMR, the results obtained from our survey, indicating that toddlers from countries designated as from southern Europe (France, Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy) have higher immunization coverage estimates for DTP, Pol, and measles than Swiss children, correlate with coverage as reported by these countries individually (Table 19) and the study conducted in 1992 by Bouvier et al [1994]. Because there were very few children in our samples originating from Greece, their impact on vaccination coverage was minimal. Furthermore, immigrants seeking asylum in Switzerland so far must have a mandatory health exam conducted by the \" grenzsanitarische Untersuchungen\" (GSU). This includes checking immunization status and vaccination whennecessary. Every year about 2,200 foreign children aged 13 and under are vaccinated by the GSU, of which 0.3% are infants [Neyens, 2003]. In total about one quarter of the applicants4. Discussion 88 are permitted to remain in Switzerland. This could be one factor to help explain why foreign kids are better vaccinated for measles at one dose than Swiss kids; by the other vaccines, as more than one dose is necessary, the impact of the GSU on coverage could not be observed. As presented in Table 18, comparison of coverage for toddlers for MMR at one dose and Di, Te, and Pol at 3 doses with those from 1991 and 1998 revealed that coverage has remained relatively unchanged; however, for Per and Hib at 3 and 4 doses and 4 doses of Di, Te, and Pol, coverage has increased, with the uptake of Hib being most apparent, climbing from 77% in 1998 to 91% in our survey at 3 doses and from 47% to 98% at 4 doses. The increased coverage for Per and Hib could be a result of more frequent use of combined vaccines. ForHib, as it is only included in the recommended vaccination plan since 1991, the large increase in coverage could be due to greater understanding of the dangers of the disease, reinforced by the inclusion of Hib in the combined vaccines. Since 1991, MMR remained a controversial vaccination, with coverage fluctuating at the low 80's. Because coverage by the DTPPolHibMMR series are affected by the individual vaccines, any level of rejection or promotion of one vaccine will affect the overall estimate. By toddlers in the canton of SH, discussion with the CMO revealed that one pediatrician in this relatively small canton prefer not to immunize toddlers against rubella; catch-up shots for rubella are then administered during their attendance in kindergarten [H\u00e4ggi, personal communication, 2003]. This position by the pediatrician, consequently renders the canton of SH with the lowest coverage for both DTPPolHibMMR immunization series examined, at 49.4% for the 33333111 series and 30.9% for the 44443111 series. On the other hand, cantons GE and TI have the highest vaccination coverages for both the 44443111 and 33333111 series. Because Di is mandatory in these cantons, it could account for the higher vaccination coverage for Di, and consequently Te, Per, Hib and Pol due to more frequent use of combined vaccines.4. Discussion 89 Although only Di vaccination is mandatory, many parents may forget that MMR is not; this uncertainty may prompt them to have their children immunized for MMR. A study in Italy demonstrated that mandatory vaccines have much higher coverage than those that are facultative, with many parents often mistakening the vaccines in these two categories [Bonannni and Berganini, 2002]. As mandatory vaccinations are found only in the French- speaking cantons (GE, FR, NE) and TI, coverage differs significantly by regions, with toddlers in the Italian- and French-speaking cantons being better vaccinated than their German counterpart. This difference is also observed in Germany where measles coverage in former western Germany, with its decentralized health care services, is lower than that in the former eastern side who had a centralized health care system and mandatory immunizations[Hellenbrand et al, 2003]. This phenomenon for TI must be cautiously interpreted as children in the first year of kindergarten, i.e. children between 3-4 years of age, were selected instead of those between 24-35 months of age as in the other cantons. Furthermore, based on the results from the survey conducted in VS in 1999 and 2003, coverage for toddlers at the 33333111 DTPPolHibMMR immunization series have significantly decreased from 89.6% in 1999 to 83.0% in 2003. More precisely, vaccination coverage estimates for Di,Te, Per and Pol appear to be significantly higher for toddlers in 1999 than in 2003. However, after removing the responses from the telephone contacts, differences in coverage remained significant only by MMR and Hib. Acceptance for MMR appears to be slowly decreasing for VS, perhaps due to greater influence and popular use of alternative medicine, which selectively promotes vaccination, if at all. Diseases that are considered rare but often fatal, such as Di, Te, and Pol are recommended by some licensed homeopathic physicians, whereas those that are recognized as rather benign childhood diseases (MMR), or are considered to be indicated only for certain risk groups (Hib and HepB) are not recommended; by factions of homeopathic practitioners, all vaccinations are4. Discussion 90 discouraged [Lehrke, 2001]. In contrast to what has been recommended by some homeopathic practitioners, the President of the Swiss Homeopathy Society has confirmed that homeopathy is purely therapeutic, and that they do not oppose vaccination [Steffen, personal communication, 2004]. The gradual decline in MMR acceptance in VS could also be caused by the perception that measles, mumps and rubella are not particularly dangerous diseases, which naturally results in lower vaccination coverage. In our survey, only 50% of parents perceive measles, mumps and rubella as dangerous diseases. Furthermore, CAM practitioners recommend that children experience these childhood diseases (measles, mumps and rubella) to strengthen the immunesystem, although a newly published cohort study contradicted this by showing that children who were exposed to childhood infectious diseases before 18 months of age are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis [Ernst, 2002; Benn et al, 2004]. Compounding these perceptions of MMR are unsubstantiated claims that MMR is connected to autism, despite the many studies that have disproved this link [Wakefield et al, 1998; Taylor et al, 1999; Kaye et al, 2001; Madsen et al, 2002; M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al, 2002; Owens, Ramsey et al, 2002; Wilson et al., 2003; DeStefano et al, 2004; Geier and Geier, Sengupta, 2005; Afzal et al, 2006]. Regional difference in immunization coverage as revealed by the toddlers is still prevalent at the school level. Children at school entry level residing in TI have the highest coverage, followed by the French-speaking region and lastly, the German-speaking region. Perhaps as children have not received their catch-up shots for rubella, the estimates for the 33333111 and 444431111 series for the canton of SH remain low. Although TI only works with school doctors and do not vaccinate in the schools, according to the CMO the local pediatricians are young and very active; their enthusiasm ensures active participation in school health4. Discussion 91 promotion, and hence high vaccination coverage. While it was conducted in an adult population in Switzerland, Bovier et al [2001] confirmed that physicians play an important role in attaining adequate immunization coverage where lack of recommendation from the GP accounted for most missed vaccination opportunities. For VS, because students in the 2nd grade were recruited for the study in 2003 instead of the 1st grade as in 1999, this could most likely be the reason for the increase in vaccination coverage; this particularly applies to MMR as catch-up shots could be accounted for, along with cases where children prefer to be vaccinated by their private doctors than the school doctors. By the adolescents, the regional difference is still apparent, but the magnitude has diminished. Examination at the cantonal level reveals that the canton of SZ has the highest vaccination coverage, regardless if it included examining the series with or without Per. This is most probably due to the fact that school nurses in canton SZ travel to every schoolhouse in the canton offering DiTe, DiTe-Pol, MMR vaccinations to students in the 1st or 8th grade. Furthermore school vaccination policy appears to play a more important role in coverage estimates. Because the school nurses in cantons VD, AG and SZ are permitted to vaccinate the children on their scheduled visits during the routine health examinations, the children in these cantons have the highest coverage estimates when examining the various DTPPolMMR series with 6 doses of Di and Te. On the other hand, at lower doses for Di and Te, cantons working only with school doctors have higher coverage. It appears that catch-up shots are administered effectively to teenagers by the school nurses in the schools; this phenomenon is also apparent for children at school entry for Di and Pol. However, for Hib for children at school entry, the reverse is applied because it is not offered in the schools as part of school vaccination, but are administered by the GPs / pediatricians, and offered only during the first 5 years.4. Discussion 92 Coverage for 3 doses of HepB range from a low of 7.5% in canton AI and 8.6% in SZ to a high of 88.3% in NW and 81.2% in VD. This large range indicate that HepB coverage varies, depending on whether or not a canton has already implemented a HepB vaccination campaign, the extent of the campaign, the HepB vaccine used [i.e. whether 2 or 3 applications are needed] and the school vaccination policy. In cantons AI and SZ, HepB vaccination is not offered in the schools during the routine health examinations whereby in cantons NW and VD, the school nurses vaccinate against HepB in the schoolhouses. Furthermore, there is a large HepB campaign in canton VD in the 7th grade; data for the survey was collected in the 8th grade. By the 1st and 2nd HepB dose is NW high while it is one of the lowest at the 3rd dose. The vaccination nurse in NW examines adolescents in February, and does not administer the3 rd dose until the beginning of the next school year. Since we collected the vaccination cards at the end of the school year, doses number 1 and 2 were quite high, whereby number three was not yet administered. Thus, this could also be a reason why one of our results showed that the odds of being UTD at 3 doses of HepB for adolescents in cantons where vaccination is permitted in the schools is lower (0.58 (CI: 0.46, 0.71)) than that of those living in cantons where vaccination is not permitted; the time of data collection differed for each canton and was not necessarily coordinated with the application of the final dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine, whether it be a 2 or 3 application scheme. When interpreting the estimates for schoolchildren, caution must be taken since 3 or 4 different school grades were evaluated depending on the canton, i.e. by school entry is kindergarten, 1st, 2nd or 3rd accepted and by school exit, 6th-9th, the grades depending on when the cantons allow their school doctors to perform the school health exams. Hence, coverage by the 6th graders in AI is much lower than that from the older classes, especially with HepB. However, although the 3rd graders were recruited in BS, students in this canton do not have the highest overall coverage in this age group. Furthermore, there are many cantons that4. Discussion 93 remain either at the top as being best vaccinated or vice-versa; however, reasons for this are not superficially apparent, such as the low rubella coverage for SH. Especially important would be further discussions with the CMOs and school doctors to explore plausible explanations regarding differences in coverage due to the wide diversity in mentality and vaccination policies among the cantons. Only then can theories as to cantonal vaccination behaviors be more confidently hypothesized. As also described in many other studies, vaccination coverage is affected by various factors, such as social and demographic factors, use of CAM, information availability, attitudes towards vaccination and the perceptions of the dangers of the disease [Masserey, 1997; BAG,1999; Gellin et al, et al, 2002; Luman et al, 2003; Chu et al, 2004; Cassell et al, 2006]. Our results confirm that having siblings, educational level of the mother, and the nationality of the child are all significant predictors of vaccination coverage. Having siblings, more specifically, toddlers with older siblings have a lower chance of being vaccinated for measles as compared to those who have no siblings. Single children have the full attention of the parents, whereas those who are the youngest, are more likely to be neglected as parents are pre-occupied with increased household responsibilities and family commitments. As mentioned also in earlier reports [Masserey, 1997; BAG, 1999], nationality of the child and highest level of education attained by the mother is a significant predictor of being UTD, particularly for measles. Toddlers of Swiss background have a less likely chance of being UTD for measles than those children from a foreign country and toddlers whose mother has attained a higher level of education are less likely to be vaccinated than those with a lower educational level. In contrast, schoolchildren of Swiss background have a significantly higher chance of being vaccinated than their non-Swiss counterpart. By the measles vaccine is the odds reversed,4. Discussion 94 with the non-Swiss children at school entry having a significantly better chance of being vaccinated than the Swiss children. Like the toddlers, the odds of schoolchildren whose parents have a middle or high level of education being UTD with 1 dose of measles is lower than those whose parents educational level is rated low. However, by the immunization series and Di, Pol and Hib, the opposite is seen where the latter has a much higher chance of being vaccinated. Because coverage levels of Di, Pol and Hib are higher for Swiss children and children whose mothers have a higher educational degree, access to health care may have a strong influence on vaccination status. A study showed that refugees in southern Italy has a much lower immunity to diphtheria than native Italians [Chironna, 2003]. A recent study of newly arrived adult immigrants and refugees in Canada also revealed that 36% of the targetpopulation was susceptible to measles, mumps or rubella [Greenaway et al, 2007]. Additionally, an examination of more than 57 000 children between ages 5 and 12 years in Amsterdam showed that foreign born children who had been born abroad were most likely not to be fully vaccinated [van der Wal et al, 2005]. Furthermore, this phenomenon could also be influenced by the use of CAM. As CAM is only recently popular, parents whose education is rated as being in the middle and are parents of children at school departure still follow the vaccination plan as recommended by their physicians; hence, the odds of these adolescents to be UTD with the examined immunization series and Di, Pol and Hib are higher than those whose mothers' educational level is rated low and children at school entry. For HepB, the reverse is true, where children of foreign background have a higher chance of being vaccinated than Swiss children; moreover, children whose mother's educational background is rated low has a higher chance of being vaccinated for HepB than those whose mother's educational level is rated medium or high. Since many foreigners in Switzerland originate from countries where HepB is more endemic, many families welcome the chance to be vaccinated for this disease. Swiss parents, on the other hand, do not believe that their4. Discussion 95 children fall into the HepB risk group. Furthermore, because asylum seekers must go for their check-up at the GSU, vaccination is made during these examinations, when necessary. Finally, many foreigners from the eastern European countries have very limited education opportunity, as compared to the Swiss where the majority of the educational background is at the middle level [SFSO, SAKE, 2004]. Highly influential on the level of vaccination coverage are 3 factors also observed in our findings: the use of CAM, attitudes towards vaccination, and perceptions of the dangers of childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. As seen in other studies [Masserey 1997; BAG, 1999; Robert Koch Institute, 2003; Cassell et al, 2006], parental use of CAM was stronglyand significantly associated with vaccination status regardless of differences in the cantons or type of vaccines while the other factors varied randomly among the cantons. Approximately 41.7% of the parents of toddlers have used some type of alternative medicine, with a steady decrease to 37.9% for students at school entry and to 30.9% by school departure. The odds of being UTD at the 33333111 series among toddlers where CAM is used in the home is 0.38 (CI: 0.33, 0.43) times that of those toddlers in homes where only classical medicine is followed. This is especially true for infectious diseases perceived as less dangerous, such as MMR. Although no follow-up of one cohort was possible in this cross-sectional survey, it appears that as children are older, the influence of CAM on vaccination coverage declines, as its use is also reduced. For those who practice homeopathy more rigorously, there is an alternative vaccination scheme recommended by their homeopathic practitioner, where the number of doses and vaccines are reduced and the administration of the vaccines are postponed until the infant is older [Klein and Albonico, 2003]. With the rise in popularity of CAM [Eisenberg et al, 1998; Kessler et al, 2001; Marstedt and Moebus, 2002], the use of CAM is a crucial factor that must be addressed in order to deter the possibility of immunization coverage further declining in this population. A Canadian study showed that4. Discussion 96 only 12.8% of the students enrolled in a naturopathic university would recommend the full vaccination scheme to their patients, and 74.4% only partially [Wilson et al, 2004], due to concerns of unknown side effects and doubtful efficacy. Similar to those attending a chiropractic university, students attending these schools longer have significantly more critical view of vaccination [Busse et al, 2002]. Collaboration with the educational boards is vital to ensure that immunization is fairly and accurately represented in the curriculum. With strongly significant association is the finding that the predominant language spoken in the region plays a crucial role in the immunization status of children residing in Switzerland. Toddlers and children at school entry residing in the French- and Italian- speaking regions arebetter vaccinated than those residing in the German-speaking region, despite more use of CAM in the former regions. In fact, toddlers residing in the French- and Italian-speaking regions whose parents use CAM have a significantly higher chance of being vaccinated than those in the German-speaking region. As mentioned earlier, perhaps the different childhood vaccination recommendation guidelines in each canton can confound these results. For example, 4 out of 7 of the cantons in the French- and Italian-speaking regions require that children be vaccinated for Di, but none of those in the German-speaking region has made that mandatory. Consequently, as cited earlier, because parents often mistaken the vaccinations that are categorized as mandatory or facultative, and will bring their children to be vaccinated since some will believe that all vaccinations are obligatory, toddlers residing in these cantons will be better vaccinated than those where no vaccinations are mandatory [Bonanni and Beganini, 2002]. This political factor, as well as other factors, must be controlled in a multivariate logistic regression to determine if there is really a significant difference between the different language speaking regions. Furthermore, the higher immunization coverage levels of toddlers in TI compared to those in the German-speaking region was also influenced by the fact that children 3-4 years of age, instead of the standard 24-35 months of age were4. Discussion 97 recruited for the study. By the children at school entry, this significant difference between linguistic regions could be affected by the school immunization policy, along with the efforts of the school doctors. Contrary to this pattern, adolescents in the French- and Italian- speaking regions have a lower chance of being vaccinated for measles at one dose than those children in the German- speaking region. This could be due to the fact that, parents in the French- and Italian-speaking regions utilize more alternative medicine, than their German counterparts, where the use of alternative medicine is negatively correlated with measles uptake. As confirmed in this survey, adolescents from families where alternative medicine is practiced and reside in theFrench-speaking region have an odds of 0.63 times of being UTD for measles at one dose than those in the German-speaking region. For HepB, as vaccination campaigns are more organized and well publicized in the schools in the French- and Italian-speaking regions (5 from 7 cantons), adolescents in these regions have a significantly higher chance of being UTD for HepB than those in the German-speaking region (8 from 19 cantons), despite higher use of alternative medicine. Furthermore this significance could also be exacerbated by the use of cantonal employed school / LL nurses, in which cantons supplementing their health services with school nurses have an odds of 1.66 times of being UTD for 1 dose of HepB than the cantons without this supplementation. Naturally, parents with negative attitude towards vaccination will less likely have their children fully vaccinated, as seen by Cassell et al [2006]. In our survey, the most significant predictors of a child being UTD with the recommended vaccination plan is if parents agree that they follow the doctor's recommendation, believe in the effectiveness of vaccination, and think that as many children as possible should be vaccinated for the benefit of the community. This pattern applies to children in all 3 age groups, with the magnitude of the association4. Discussion 98 decreasing with increasing age. Because schoolchildren, particularly those at school departure, have had already received many of the recommended vaccinations, and vaccination is now only a very controversial topic, attitudes of the parents of these children are not as strong predictors of vaccination behaviors as those from parents of toddlers. Parents of toddlers must make a decision regarding immunization for their children with contradictory opinions and information being constantly expressed. The \"Arbeitsgruppe f\u00fcr differenzierte Impfungen\" encourages parents to delay recommended childhood vaccination, where the delay time varies with the vaccine [Klein and Albonico, 2003]. Measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations are only recommended for teenagers between 12-14 years of age when the respective diseases have not yet been contracted. It is hypothesized that suppression of acutediseases in childhood may induce chronic diseases in the future (Teixeira, 2002). The delay in immunization of these children could result in an epidemic, especially when there is a clustering of children who remain unvaccinated [Van den Hof, 2002; May and Silverman, 2003; de Melker, 2003]. Furthermore, Siedler et al. [2002] showed that more than 50% of measles cases in infants in Germany could be prevented if the 85% coverage for toddlers could be reached by the second, instead of third year of life. With the success of vaccination, many of the childhood diseases prevalent before the advent of vaccination are no longer experienced, with small pox being eradicated globally [CDC/MMWR, 1999(b)]. This lack of experience with certain diseases and advancement in medical knowledge and technology support the illusion that certain diseases are no longer dangerous. Additionally, a study by Smailbegovic et al [2003] showed that parents perceived that having their child immunized with a particular vaccine was more risky than non- immunization. This particularly applies to measles and rubella as more than 50% of parents do not find these two diseases to be dangerous. In contrast, many parents perceive Hib as very dangerous; hence, these parents of toddlers are 8 times and parents of children at school entry4. Discussion 99 are two times more likely to have their children comply with the recommended vaccination scheme than those who perceive Hib as not dangerous, although Hib coverage is still sub- optimal. Children at school departure have the highest odds of being vaccinated for Pol as parents perceive it as more dangerous than any of the other diseases. Pol is also perceived as very dangerous by parents of the 2 younger groups. Extremely noteworthy is also the high odds of being UTD for those who responded that they do not know how to perceive the dangers of the certain childhood vaccine preventable diseases. This particular group could be parents who are less critical of immunization, and vaccinate their children simply because it is part of the routine. Although we see that the magnitude of the perceptions of the dangers of certain diseases vary by age groups, when comparing the perceptions of parents of toddlers from this survey to that of those from the national survey conducted in 1998 by the SFOPH, perceptions of the diseases, as well as immunization coverage, have not changed much (see Fig. 2). There are, however, two exceptions. While coverage for Hib has drastically increased, the perception of the dangers of this disease remained the same. This increase in coverage is probably a result of the more popular use of combined vaccines, as is the case with Per, although the perception of the danger of Per has increased by 8%.4. Discussion 100 Good information is an important aspect of obtaining high vaccination compliance [Gellin et al, 2000; Swennen et al, 2002]. Surprisingly, approximately 90% of parents of children in all 3 age groups did acknowledge the receipt of information regarding vaccination. Of these, on average, 67% are happy with the information they have, 18% are not, 7% did not know, and 8% refrained from answering. Our results also surprisingly reveal that parents of toddlers who have information about vaccination available to them are not as well vaccinated as those who have no access to this information. This also applies to children at school entry for measles. Perhaps this could be due to the fact that parents seeking information are more critical and concern about the type of information available, particularly about vaccination than those who do not seek any information. This phenomenon has been confirmed by Cassell et al [2006],Fig. 2 Vaccination coverage (%) and perception of disease severity (%) of parents of toddlers 24- 35 months of age in 1998 and 1999- 2003 6065707580859095100 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 090 1 0 0 Perception of disease severity (%)Vaccination coverage (%) 532 4 8 Vaccination coverage 1998 Vaccination coverage 1999-2003 1: Diphtheria * 5: Measles # 2: Tetanus * 6: Mumps #3: Pertussis * 7: Rubella # 4: Polio * 8: Hib * Number of doses: * 3, # BAG. mumps missing.5 778342 1 1 64. Discussion 101 where mothers actively seeking information on MMR are more likely to be vaccination non- compliers than those who are more passive regarding this theme. In contrast, for children at school departure, receipt of information is a strong consistent predictor of being vaccinated. This could be accounted to the influence of the information from the school health officials. Additionally, approximately 20% of parents are not satisfied with the information available. Finally, toddlers whose parents are not satisfied with the available information are not so well vaccinated as toddlers whose parents are satisfied with the information obtained . This confirms that vaccination campaigns need to improve the type of information available to parents to restore the public's trust in vaccines and hence increase acceptance and immunization coverage. To ensure not only compliance, but also concordance, they shoulddisseminate information in such a way that parents are actively involved and their views and concerns are respected [Vernon, 2003]. Our results also indicate that doctors are the primary resource for parents about information regarding vaccination, regardless if the parents need to request this information, as in many other studies [Masserey, 1997; BAG, 1999; Gellin et al, 2000; Swennen et al, 2002]. Because doctors are often highly regarded by their patients, many follow their doctor's advice despite their own hesitations [Kolasa et al, 2001; Leask et al, 2006]. Additionally, parents distinguish between their doctors and doctors in general, where they have more trust in their doctors than doctors in general [Casiday et al, 2006]. Zucs et al [2004] showed that among all the factors examined, the main independent predictors of non-immunization of preschool children from Bavaria, Germany were doctors advising against vaccination and those abstaining from giving advice. Moreover, parents of schoolchildren desire more information from school health officials. Although many parents may wish that information from the media is reduced and that from4. Discussion 102 the health insurance is increased, scientists should strive to build a long-term relationship with these two groups. An analysis of the media coverage of the MMR controversy in Great Britain between January and September 2002 showed that the media misled the public over the MMR vaccine by focusing their reports on the possible link between MMR vaccine and autism and giving the same coverage for those supporting and contradicting the link; only 23% of the public were aware that the bulk of the evidence favored supporters of the vaccine [Hargraves et al, 2003]. Moreover, in addition to MMR, the negative impact of the media was clearly evident also during the controversy surrounding Per and smallpox vaccination in Great Britain [Fitzpatrick, 2004; Baker, 2003]. By working closely with the media and health insurance, we can ensure that accurate information are disseminated, particularly in times ofdisease outbreaks [Cookson, 2002]. 4.1 LimitationsBecause one of the major goals of the study is to build a surveillance system in each canton concerning vaccination coverage by using this study as a foundation, we attempted to use the existing infrastructure as much as possible in each canton to increase acceptance and ease the workload, while maintaining an acceptable budget. While all cantons do employ some method of checking the vaccination cards, information is recorded only enough to suffice for vaccine reimbursement. Unfortunately, this does not provide enough information for in-depth statistical analysis into vaccination coverage levels. This required that new procedures were created and adapted to the needs and resources of each canton. Our collaboration with various health organizations and school health officials in each canton have reduced the workload for ISPMZ substantially, but unfortunately, has also compromised the comparability of the results among the cantons. As described earlier, this variability is due to the different vaccination policy in each canton, such as the grade levels at which the routine health examines are4. Discussion 103 mandated, vaccines that are offered in the school, whether or not school doctors are allowed to vaccinate at all, and whether or not HepB campaign is actively conducted in the school (Annex M.1, M.2). For example, in many cantons school doctors can perform the routine health examination and vaccination card control anytime during the entire school year. Some cantons allow the school doctors the choices to examine the students either at kindergarten or 1st grade or at grades 7th, 8th or 9th. Because the study was coordinated with the routine school health examination so as not to overburden the school doctors, teachers and parents, comparability among the cantons was compromised. Moreover, in many cantons vaccination policies require that students be referred to their GPs for catch-up shots; this vaccination could not be assessed through the school health exams. In contrary, although some cantonsallow the physicians to vaccinate in the schools, some physicians may prefer referring the schoolchildren to their GPs for catch-up shots. Comparisons of the immunization coverage for schoolchildren where vaccinations are permitted in the schools and where they are not should be done with caution, despite significant associations. HepB coverage is especially influenced by such policies as some cantons expend much resource to educate their students about HepB while other cantons spend very little or nothing at all. Additionally the period during data collection and school vaccination may not have coincided, which consequently could yield inaccurate estimates. Catch-up shots administered by the family physicians would be missed in some cases. Completion of the vaccination summary form by the school doctors and nurses also added to the problem as some health officials also checked for Per and Hib during their examination of the vaccination cards while others ignored these two vaccines. After correcting for this error, data for Per and Hib were incomplete for 2 classes from canton AI for children at school entry and Per for 5 (3 from AI and 2 from GR) for those at school departure. In BS information for these two vaccines was missing for 24 children at school entry and 57 at school departure, in addition to single cases in cantons SG, SH, TI, ZG and ZH where this information could not be assessed from the vaccination cards. As evident in4. Discussion 104 our results, coverage estimates for teenagers were also associated with mode of data collection; adolescents where nurses collected the data have a higher chance of being vaccinated than those in cantons where doctors aided in data collection. Perhaps higher coverage could be accounted to better data collection by the cantonal employed school / LL nurses as they have more time than the school doctors for the evaluation. Furthermore, by using the schools, the nature of the non-responders is not known. There could be many reasons, ranging from being recently vaccinated by their family physician, to downright refusal of any vaccines since those kids who do not want to be vaccinated will normally not submit their vaccination booklets to the school health officials. Moreover, clear communication between ISPMZ and the school health officials must be improved to avoid any misunderstandings. Although collaboration with the LL nurse in the canton of JU was very simple and efficient with telephone inquiries from ISPMZ throughout the school period to inquire about the process of data collection, the vaccination information delivered at the end of the school year was not adequate to determine vaccination coverage by vaccination per dose due to misunderstandings. Consequently, despite utilizing all the available information, ISPMZ was not able to reconstruct the necessary information; hence, vaccination coverage from JU for schoolchildren was missing. Finally, the use of the vaccination summary form has simplified data entry, but other work arose due to unforeseen problems. According to the wish of the CMOs to increase compliance among the school doctors by reducing their work, school doctors should be allowed to check one box if the child is UTD for all vaccines; hence, it would not be necessary to complete the individual boxes for each vaccine if the child is UTD. Although the SFOPH recommended vaccination plan was attached to the summary form, it was nevertheless not defined enough for the school doctors. Some doctors defined UTD as having 4 doses for Di, Te, Per, Pol and4. Discussion 105 Per and one for MMR for school entry and for the children at school departure, UTD was defined as 5 doses for Di, Te, Pol, 0 for Per and two for MMR. We contacted all the school doctors to confirm the nature of UTD if the UTD boxes were checked. Moreover, because Per and Hib do not apply to the children at school departure and are not vaccinated in the schools, some school doctors did not even control for the number of doses for these two vaccines in the vaccination booklet. Some of these uncertainties along with the unknown nature of nonresponders have been addressed in the study repeated in VS. The pilot study conducted in 1999 in VS served as a good platform on which to change data collection methods to improve data quality, ensurecomparability and improve the chances for sustainability. The collaborators in 1999 were eager to join efforts once more, with many ideas to overcome some of the problems encountered in the pilot study. For VS, the nurses from the LL were requested to make sure that all kids are represented on the vaccination summary form, and reasons for not vaccinating a child or checking the vaccination card should be clearly indicated. The nurses were also requested to complete the form fully, regardless if the child is vaccinated according to the recommended SFOPH childhood vaccination plan. In the case of the toddlers, difficulties encountered originated from other areas. For example, in the canton of NE as all three age groups were sent the same letter at the same time, chaos broke for the first letter since placing the returned answers in the correct age group was sometimes impossible. In the canton of VD, where the \"Bureau Vaudois d'Adresses\" performed the sampling and sent the first letter, the mistakes were not realized until too late. The first set of letters was sent to the wrong families as children of all ages were sampled, instead of those between 24-35 months of age. After this error was noticed, a second sampling was done. It was not until the completion of the survey was it realized that the sampled4. Discussion 106 population was not representative of the general population in VD. The sampled population consisted of 60% foreigners, whereas the general population had only 30%. After inquiry into the sampling method of the BVA, it was discovered that simple random sampling was not used, but the method employed was similar to proportional to the size of the different ethnicity, based on the judgement of the person in charge. To exacerbate this error, the selection of parents within the different ethnicity were not random, but were more systematic where those first on the list were always selected. The last convenience utilized by BVA for selection of samples could unknowingly select the same families for various different studies, with negative consequence for those depending on their participation. Hence, despite the huge efforts expended by ISPMZ to increase the response rates, participation from parents oftoddlers in canton VD remained at a modest 68%. Among the 3 different methods used to collect data for the schoolchildren, coordination with the school health services supplemented with cantonal employed or LL nurses was most efficient and clear. For data entry, the vaccination summary form was easy to interpret and clearly more completed. Furthermore, participation rate was distinctly higher. Although many school doctors agreed to help out with the study, one refusal could lower the response rate dramatically, particularly in the smaller cantons. Sustainability by cantons would be most feasible by collaborating with cantonal employed school or LL nurses supplementing school health services. Since many cantons do not offer such services, collaboration with school doctors would be sought next where feasible. However, the vaccination form would have to be drastically simplified to reduce the amount of work for these doctors in order to ensure compliance and acceptance. By the toddlers, not many methods exist by which to reach the toddlers. The method used for the majority of the cantons, in which help from municipal halls were sought, was feasible,4. Discussion 107 although quite labor intensive. In three cantons where there is a single registry for all residents in the canton, sampling by simple random sampling was done, and direct contact with the family was taken. With help from Dr. Philip Smith from the National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we employed a self-weighting sampling design for data collection of toddlers in 2002, which eased the sampling procedure, simplified weight calculations and produce accurate estimates and confidence intervals [Smith, personal communication, 2001]. In short, using this sampling design each child will have the same weights regardless of the cluster to which the child belongs [Levy and Lemeshow, 1999]. A comparison study between telephone and written surveys to assess adolescent immunization coverage rates showed that combining both methods would maximize the data collected,increase response rate while maintaining cost and attaining accurate vaccination coverage rates [Peddecord et al, 2004]. An additional improvement that would ease data collection methods for toddlers would include a procedural change in cantons where Di or Te vaccination is mandatory. Because a method must exist to check that all toddlers are vaccinated for either Di or Te, the vaccination card can be simultaneously copied or a vaccination form completed for the district, as in canton GE. No additional surveys would then be needed for the toddlers in these cantons; adaptations or modifications to an existing infrastructure are ideal if comparable data can be collected, and should be seriously considered as a step towards establishing a sustainable and comparable vaccination surveillance system. Nonresponse continues to be a major obstacle in this study for both schoolchildren and toddlers. As aforementioned, this could be addressed adequately for the schoolchildren with the help of the school nurses in VS, but the problem remained difficult to resolve with the toddlers. Personal communication with Dr. Sudre from GE indicate that the addition of a questionnaire to the routine letter decreased the usual response rate of 70% down to about4. Discussion 108 50% after the first letter, when comparing the participation in the survey with the routine data collection by the Health Department in GE to monitor vaccination coverage [Sudre, personal communication, 2003]. This effect is also confirmed when one compares the usual 80-90 % response rate conducted in other cantons in previous years [Schorr, 1993; Vranjes, 1996; Maurer, 1997, 2001, 2003]. In our current survey, we also showed that toddlers residing in cantons where participation of more than 70% could be achieved had a higher chance of being UTD with the recommended immunizations. Perhaps more parents who are willing to participate in the study have a more positive attitude towards immunization. Furthermore, accessibility to copiers could also hurt compliance with the study. We have experienced from many parents, particularly those living in the rural regions, that the process of going out andmaking a copy of the vaccination card had also hindered them from immediately returning the completed questionnaire. By repeating the study in VS in 2003 and collecting only vaccination cards, it has been confirmed that participation from the parents can be greatly increased by: dropping the questionnaire, hiring telephone assistants to contact parents of foreign background, contacting GPs when parents do not have the vaccination cards available, increasing the number of telephone attempts, and using more resources to find missing telephone numbers. As most school doctors, nurses, CMOs, and teachers are willing to assist in the study, more strategies are needed to utilize their assistance effectively, perhaps even paying for their assistance, if need must be to enhance data quality. For example, in canton NW, the vaccination nurse was willing to collect all available vaccination cards and bring them home and complete the vaccination summary form, if we could have paid her for this extra effort. The time and effort spent to contact the schools and to get compliance from teachers, directors, and parents could have been saved, while increasing our meager response rate of 20% in canton NW considerably if we were to use this strategy. Moreover, some school4. Discussion 109 doctors have directly contacted ISPMZ to complain that participating in the study required much time and that they should be monetarily reimbursed for their efforts. Strategies to combat nonresponse should be investigated and carefully implemented. By this study, the high nonresponse rate, especially by schoolchildren in cantons ZG, OW and NW, and for vaccines where coverage levels were much lower than the assumed 80% prevalence, had compromised the results considerably. Some confidence intervals were much wider than the desired \u00b17% precision that was used to calculate the sample size, particularly by schoolchildren in the aforementioned cantons where participation was meager at 11.8%, 20.2%, 29.2% at school entry and 8.6%, 13.0%, 20.5% at school exit, respectively. Nonresponse bias can also be handled statistically by using nonresponder adjustment, imputation and poststratification. Use of these methods should yield estimates closer to the true population estimate and more accurate confidence intervals. Basically, by nonresponder adjustment, it is assumed that the sample is representative of the general population and that behavior of those who do not respond will be similar to those who do respond. Hence, it is possible to distribute the results among the population to get appropriate population estimates [Korn and Graubard, 1999; Levy and Lemeshow, 1999]. Imputation involves using data obtained from the survey to fill in missing information and poststratification entails adjusting the weights of each individual child so that the overall proportion will be equal to that obtained in an independent authoratative resource, i.e. the census figure [Brick, 1996; Smith, personal communication, 2001]. Before the analysis of the results with the toddlers, these statistical procedures were used, with conservative imputations for gender and nationality based on names of the children selected for the study. Many parents claimed not to have refused or missed any opportunities to have their children vaccinated. Further inquiries, when possible, requested that the parents clearly state the number of shots for the recommended4. Discussion 110 number of doses for each vaccine. By the toddlers, parents who are too busy to participate in the study or have no interest in the topic also confirmed that their children never missed a doctor's appointment for vaccination. Moreover, those who were clearly against or sceptical about vaccination were very open about their opinions on the phone. For comparative purposes, Table 18 presents coverage estimates resulting from different statistical manipulations. As can be seen, there is at most a 2.0% difference between these different procedures, with data using weights and adjustments, along with parental recall yielding slightly higher figures than when taken at face value, i.e. without weights, imputation or adjustments. Based on many statistical analysis, those using nonresponse adjustment and poststratification will yield estimates that are closer to the true population estimates withappropriate standard errors [Korn and Graubard, 1999]. 4.2 Conclusions Vaccination coverage of children in Switzerland has not reached the optimal level to establish solid herd immunity, but it has reached a threshold where major outbreaks are avoided, but not small minor ones (Wallinga et al, 2005). When infection is re-introduced, an outbreak can occur in the communities with low coverage. This can be clearly seen with the numerous local measles outbreaks throughout Europe, as described in the Introduction. These outbreaks usually affect unvaccinated, or not fully vaccinated children who due to common philosophical, religious and / or social bonds are clustered geographically [Smith et al, 2004]. Future vaccination campaigns need to more clearly define their target population as there are many factors associated with immunization coverage. They include socio-demographic variables (such as nationality, number of older siblings and maternal level of education), parental attitudes and perceptions of disease and healthcare, type of information available, use4. Discussion 111 of complementary / alternative medicine, relationship with healthcare providers, all influenced by regional differences in local and national immunization policies. The interplay of these factors results in varying degrees of impact on coverage level. Campaigns directed towards parents should include strategies that are informative, personal and compelling, and yet transparent, explaining also the differences between coincidental and causal relationships while communicating risks and addressing vaccine safety concerns more effectively [Bellaby, 2003; Offit and Coffin, 2003]; moreover, strategies should treat parents as active partners, rather than passive recipients of information, respecting their intentions to protect their children's health [McMurray et al, 2004]. A working relationship between themedia, health care professionals and scientists would benefit everyone immensely with the correct information being produced and used. Furthermore, campaign strategies should also include educating / re-educating doctors or healthcare providers about the benefits of immunization and the basic principles behind vaccinology, immunology and herd immunity. Furthermore, many healthcare providers would like more information and resources to be easily available to them to help refute the anti-vaccination claims and alleviate parental concerns especially regarding vaccine safety without compromising their credibility, as many parents re-instate their trust in their GPs [Petousis-Harris et al, 2004; Casiday et al. 2006; Petousis-Harris et al, 2005]. In one study, many health professionals in Wales were not aware of or do not use the good written resources available about the second dose of MMR [Petrovic et al, 2001]; 3 other studies showed that healthcare providers lacked substantial knowledge about the recommended immunization schedules and vaccine contraindications [Cohen et al, 2003; Petousis-Harris et al, 2004; Petousis-Harris et al, 2005]. With greater understanding, health care providers can easily promote vaccination and persuade their sceptical patients toward this goal. Moreover, as the use of CAM increases, collaboration with educational4. Discussion 112 institutions is important to ensure that immunization is accurately represented in the curriculum [Busse et al, 2002; Wilson et al, 2004]. Utilizing the findings from this study, a new vaccination campaign in Switzerland must prepare new information directed especially towards Swiss parents and who reside in the German-speaking region. This new information should address the increasing negative attitudes toward vaccination, concerns about possible adverse effects, perception that childhood vaccine-preventable diseases are not so dangerous, and contradictory information provided by CAM practitioners. Additionally, vaccination policy should be carefully constructed as it significantly affects vaccination coverage. Since more parents consistentlywould like more health information from school officials, health authorities should use this invaluable opportunity to distribute information during the school years. 5. Future Research 113 5. Future research As the controversy over vaccination will only grow, more research into this topic should be invested. Areas that deem further investigation include: 1. Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of phys icians towards vaccination, especially in light of the increase influence of complementary / alternative medicine. As phys icians are the most important resource for parents concerning vaccination, and they are respons ible for immunization in their practices, hospitals and health clinics, it is especially important to unde rstand their views, knowledge, attitudes and opinions not only about current vaccination policies, but also vaccination in general [Petrovic et al, 2001; Seid et al, 2001; Milledge et al, 2003] . A recent study showed that many physicians' know ledge regarding catch-up regimes and contraindications are minimal, with more errors occurring when the children are older and immunization recommendation plans are more complex [Cohen et al, 2003] . Studies of health professionals in Germany and New Zealand confirmed that phys ician's uncertainty in assessing contraindications correctly and lack of know ledge were important reasons for insufficient vaccination rates [Schupfner et al, 2002; Petousis-Harris et al, 2004; Petousis-Harris et al, 2005 ]. Furthermore, Bovier et al [2001] also demonstrated that lack of phys ician's encouragement accounted for most missed vaccinations in the adult popul ation in Switzerland. A survey of school nurses and personnel in the US showed that vaccination exemptions were more likely to be given to children attending schools where nonm edical personne ls were responde rs, and those who hold disease susceptibility and severity and vaccine efficacy and safety as low, have less confidence 5. Future Research 114 in local and state department, have consulted with an alternative medicine practitioner, or use few professional organizations or gove rnment resources for vaccine information [Salmon et al, 2004]. A current study in Switzerland examined vaccination behaviours of phys icians in Switzerland [Posfay-Barbe et al, 2005]. The authors showed that pediatricians icians who were not pediatrications (nonpe differently, with a significant proportion of nonpe diatricians twice unlikely to follow the recommended Swiss vaccination plan for their own children. These groups of nonpe diatricians would also more likely to postpone DTP and MMR vaccinations and refrain from using combined vaccines, despite their scientific training and education. Qualitative questionna ires and/ or personal interviews with general practitioners and pediatricians would provide more in-depth unde rstanding of the know ledge, attitudes and perceptions of this critical group. If necessary, further education into vaccinology and immunology with focus on contraindications and vaccines, along with current popul ar perceptions of immunizations and reasons for anti-vaccination should be integrated during the medical training year or as a refresher course for practicing phys icians. The information ascertained from the interviews with the phys icians will help plan vaccination campaigns to increase immunization coverage. 2. Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of parents in Switzerland towards vaccination. Although this was also examined in the current survey, a closed structured questionna ire was used. Focus groups or in-depth open-ended questionna ires of parents with oppos ing views about immunizations (suppor ting, waivering, postponing and declining) could provide more essential information towards planning vaccination campaigns [Ramsey et al, 2002; Swennen et al, 2002; Taylor et al, 2002; Smailbegovic et al, 2003; Cassell et al, 2006; Tickner et al, 2006] . A recent telephone survey in 5. Future Research 115 Sweden found that parents postponing MMR are different from those who abstain from vaccinating their child [Dannetun et al, 2005] while another study in Scotland [Friederichs et al, 2006] demonstrated that levels of econom ical deprivation affect vaccination coverage and time at vaccination where those most affluent either vaccinate their children promptly or not at all; hence different strategies would be needed to target these parents successfully. Equally important would also be to determine the extent of parental refusal towards immunization, i.e. if this negative perception pertains only to certain immunizations, combination vaccinations or all immunizations in general. Primary barriers to vaccination for parents are concerns of vaccine safety, distrust in the gove rnment, growing distrust in the medical authority and prior experience with vaccine adverse effects [Allred et al, 2004; Gust et al, 2004; McMurray et al, 2004] . Because of the multi-cultural and langua ge diversity embedded in Switzerland, it would be critical to differentiate parental views and perceptions among the different regions. Our study also confirmed this phenomenon, as toddlers and children at school entry residing in the French- and Italian-speaking regions in Switzerland, are better vaccinated than their German-speaking counterparts; adolescents residing in the former regions, on the other hand, have higher coverage. Additionally, a recent publication showed that acceptance of immunization among Swiss mothers living in Geneva depends on their level of education, use of CAM and perception of individual control over the health of their family [Burton-Jeangros et al, 2005] . Furthermore, more effective communication of immunization implies that new and existing information must reworked so that it can be integrated into parent's context of their individual situation and level of unde rstanding [McMurray et al, 2004] . Limited resources and funding could be more adequately allocated to achieve effective results. 5. Future Research 116 3. Patterns of complementary / alternative medicine (CAM) use and its influence on vaccination in Switzerland. Because the use of CAM has become increasingly popular among consumers [Eisenberg et al, 1998; Kessler et al, 2001; Marstedt , with oppos ing as those suppor ting vaccination [Busse et al, 2002; Robert Koch Institute, 2003; Wilson et al, 2004] , it is important to unde rstand the level of its impact on immunization. In-depth investigations from other countries have also shown the difference in perceptions of immunization by different groups of CAM practitioners [Ernst, 1997, 2002; Lehrke et al, 2001] . Moreover, about one third of the visits to homeopathic practitioners or naturopathic doctors are children and adolescents; however only half of those CAM practitioners participating in the study have any formal pediatric training, with most not actively recommending immunizations [Lee and Kemper, 2000] . Furthermore, a current survey in canton VD, Switzerland, confirmed that children whose main healthcare providers are homeopaths are less likely to be vaccinated against MMR than those whose providers are certified doctors or pediatricians [Masserey et al, 2006] . Further research into CAM, its prevalence, and especially influence on vaccination in Switzerland needs be done . Qualitative questionna ires and/ or personal interviews targeting this group would be critical for evaluating their attitudes and influence on vaccination. As seen in our study, the influence of CAM practitioners varies, depending on the linguistic region and field of specialization. A comprehensive list outlining the geographical location of CAM practitioners and their specialization would aid in differentiating and unde rstanding this difference. 5. Future Research 117 4. Analysis of coverage by validity of vaccination doses and / or age-appropriate vaccination since coverage estimates could be an over-estimation and timely vaccinations can protect children as early as possible and prevent disease outbreaks. As mentioned earlier, the study by Stokely et al. [2004] has shown that coverage estimates decline between 0.7% to 6.5% when the validity of the doses are taken into account. Furthermore, another study has revealed that by the age of 24 months, 9 out of 10 children will have received at least one dose of vaccine outside the recommended age ranges [Luman et al, 2002] . Hence over-estimation of coverage will leave many of these kids unprotected. A study in Germany calculated that if the current measles coverage of 85% can be achieved in the second instead of third year of life, then more than 50% of measles cases in 1 year old children could be prevented [Siedler et al, 2002] . A recent publication from the canton of Basel, Switzerland, also confirmed that when examined by doses, coverage level was high, while when examined if vaccinations were timely made, coverage level droppe d significantly [Heininger and Zuberb\u00fchler, 2005 ]. This information should and could be easily assessed in the next cycle to determine vaccination coverage of children in each canton. Date of birth and dates of all vaccine administration for each child must be recorded at time of data collection. 5. Greater unde rstanding of the level of popul ation immunity in Switzerland. A recent publication showed that a minimum vaccine coverage of 80% at the second birthday in the United States may be sufficient to prevent measles transmission among preschool-aged children if popul ation immunity is 93% among persons 6 years of age [Hutchins et al, 2004] . This coverage level varies by the age group and depends on the immunity of the target popul ation, vaccination requirements and contact rates among children during preschool-aged years, along with contact rates with schoolchildren and 5. Future Research 118 adults, their popul ation immunity and the risk of introduc tion of measles from sources outside the preschool-aged population. A hous ehold contact study, as conduc ted by Arbenz et al [2005] would be useful to calculate vaccine effectiveness. Knowledge of the minimum vaccine coverage will aid in achieving and maintaining disease elimination while assessment of the popul ation immunity will also help in evaluating epidemiological effects of the existing vaccines and new vaccines [de Melker, 2003] . This information should also be assessed for Switzerland. 6. More in-depth investigation into the impact of nonresponde r bias, timeliness of respons e to survey, and mode of data collection on vaccination coverage in Switzerland. Although there has been research documenting the influence of these factors on immunization coverage in the USA [Smith et al, 2005; Salmon et al, 2006] , there is not enough information in this domain for Switzerland. While time at and mode of participation in the survey will be important in determining effective methods of data collection, recording reasons for nonrespons e, and vaccination status of these children, will be imperative to investigate its effect on vaccination coverage obtained from participants; more detailed nonresponde r adjustments could be made in future surveys. Additionally, the prevalence of mobile telecommunication in the Swiss popul ation also needs to be calculated, since more families, particularly foreigners, rely on them as the sole source of contact. Greater unde rstanding of the aforementioned factors will aid in more applicable statistical adjustment and improved data quality, such as those implemented in the National Immunization Survey [Smith et al, 2005 ]. 6. Recommendations 119 6. Practical Recommendations 6.1 To increase vaccination coverage Based on these preliminary results, a few recommendations to increase vaccination coverage and for immunization campaigns could now be drawn: 1. The easiness to obtain vaccination does affect immunization coverage, particularly at school departure and for vaccines Per and MMR, with possibly higher coverage estimates for the cantons where immunization is offered in the schools and those with cantonal employed school or LL nurses to supplement the school health services. School health services could be a direct source of information to the parents, since more parents rely on schools for information as their children get older. An emphasis on the importance of prevention to the adolescents in the school would also help in raising awareness. Additionally, a uniform method of vaccine reimbursement and distribution would decrease confusion [Schmitt, 2002] . Immunization policy and school health guidelines need to be adapted to the present conditions to achieve higher vaccination coverage. A recent study in the United States revealed that school vaccination requirements can substantially increase vaccination coverage among students subject to the law (Averhoff et al, 2004) . Furthermore, many of the well, organized school health services in Switzerland have coverage information detailed by local schoolhous es and zip codes; areas with low coverage could be easily identified and efforts to increase immunization acceptance focused. 2. Clear, but yet compelling information is very critical to immunization acceptance in the current society. Vaccination campaigns should directly address parental concerns while 6. Recommendations 120 discreetly respondi ng to false allegations purported by the anti-vaccinators, whether it be through publications or in the Internet [Spier, 2002; Wolfe et al, 2002] . Strategies need to be implemented to conve rt the 44% comprising of those who have not received information regarding vaccination, are dissatisfied with the information received, or have no interest in the topic. Because parents are weary of the types of information shared by the media, this form of information is less desired. However, as a strategic maneuver the scientific community should also begin to build long-term relationship with the media so that accurate information is disseminated, especially in times of an outbreak. Such steps can prevent the tragedy that was seen with the rotavirus vaccine in the US, as a balanced portrayal of vaccines with its risks and benefits may avoid the sudde n shifts in the media and public reaction and lend credit to the information distributed [Danova ro-Holliday et al, 2002] . Moreover, as more parents assess the Internet for information regarding vaccination, accurate and compelling information in support of vaccination while addressing parental attitudes and perceptions, in particular vaccine safety and efficacy should be easily accessible. After utilizing the MMR web based decision aid which provided numerical and graphical evidence of the risks associated with the diseases alongside with potential risks associated with the vaccines, many parental attitudes towards MMR vaccination had improved significantly [Wallace et al, 2005 ]. 3. Healthcare providers also need to be targets of vaccination campaigns as many parents rely on these providers, and still prefer them to other resources, for information regarding vaccination. Despite their concerns regarding vaccine safety, a recent study by Leask et al [2006] demonstrated that mothers whose children are fully vaccinated reasserted their suppor t for immunizations by deferring to authority figures, particularly their GPs. Reviews and revised medical education need to clearly emphasize basic immunology, vaccinology and herd immunity principles, especially in light of increased acceptance and 6. Recommendations 121 use of CAM. More resources, such as INFOVAC-PED, should be more available to provide suppor t for the growing demands placed on health care providers as increasingly more new vaccines are being produc ed and more questions pertaining to adverse events and long term effects are being asked [Siegrist et al, 2002 ]. Rigorous surveillance of adverse effects in Switzerland by Swissmedic and at the global level by the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety should be continually monitored and upda tes published for more information on the safety of vaccines [Folb et al, 2004] . With a strong background, healthcare providers can confidently respond to the criticisms and scepticism frequently expressed. 4. Vaccination coverage could be improved through simply reminding patients of an upcoming / overdue vaccination shot. An upda ted Cochrane Database Review recently confirmed that simple procedures such as patient reminders via telephone , postcards or letters could increase immunization rates by 1 to 20 percentage points, with a pooled random effect of OR 1.45 (CI: 1.28, 1.66) for increased likelihood for routine childhoo d vaccinations, and the effectiveness increasing with several reminders [Jacobson Vann and Szilagyi, 2005] . Reminder and recall were effective for both adults and children, all medical settings and all vaccinations. 6.2 To improve survey methodology In order to develop a surveillance system that is feasible, comparable and sustainable, a consensus must be found between the cantons and SFOPH to set priorities and goals. Areas that must be discussed include: 6. Recommendations 122 1. Grade levels for the schoolchildren. As seen from the data, due to the diversity among the cantons, comparability had been compromised, particularly for HepB, by attempting to use the existing infrastructure. To ensure strong and comparable data, a decision must be taken on the grade levels to be examined. Three options are available: 1) regardless of the grade level of the current routine school examination, all cantons must agree on the grade level and period of data collection. The advantages and disadvantages must be thoroughl y discussed. 2) the cantons would have to amend school health policy and synchronize the age at which vaccination cards are examined in order to coordinate the survey with existing infrastructures while maintaining comparability among the cantons. 3) to adapt the method [via municipalities] implemented for the toddlers for data collection. This method would not utilize the existing infrastructure for the schoolchildren, but comparability among the cantons will be increased substantially. 2. Mode of data collection for the schoolchildren should be thoroughl y discussed, in terms of feasibility, comparability and sustainability. Should we continue to work with school health services and school doctors and nurses? Or is it better to go through the municipalities, like in NE and BE? 3. Continued collaboration with the school doctors and a standard vaccination summary form require clear guidelines as to what is defined as being up to date. 4. More detailed information are needed regarding the respons ibilities of the school doctors: the district for which the school doctor is responsible, name of the schoolhous e, number of classes, number of students. This information is crucial for 6. Recommendations 123 accurate sampling design and would reduce the amount of work for ISPMZ incredibly since much energy was expended to ascertain this information ourselves. 5. Cantons where Di or Te vaccination is mandatory could already begin collecting data on vaccination coverage very easily. Because a method must exist to check that all toddlers are vaccinated for either Di or Te, the vaccination card can be easily copied or a vaccination form completed at this time for the district, as in canton GE. This small effort could be easily incorporated into the existing infrastructure, and would subsequently reduce additional work and cost tremendous ly. 6. Serious consideration should also be given to creating a computer database where vaccination coverage can be directly entered. This can be started for the younge r children and would eventually render the need to collect vaccination coverage at school age obsolete, if data are recorded longitudinally. This would entail careful planning as to how to coordinate data entry so that there is a single continually upda ted registry. This database could overcome many current obstacles, such as nonresponde r bias, low participation from foreigners, incomplete information due to record scattering, resulting from numerous vaccination cards and doctors. With this system, many purposes can be met: to determine vaccination coverage very easily and at all levels [local, cantonal and national], to examine demographic factors influencing coverage very quickly, to manage vaccine distribution, to maintain health care cost, to provide insight into patterns of immunization delivery, and especially to monitor the different types of vaccines for short and long term adverse effects [Navarro et al, 2002] . Moreover, Kempe et al [2004] has also shown that a common registry can increase vaccination coverage up to 50% for children aged 24 months of age by reducing record scattering. Finally, a recent study in the USA showed that parental 6. Recommendations 124 suppor t of immunization registries, particularly among parents of vaccinated children was relatively high; suppor t was also given from parents whose child has been exempted for at least one vaccination, if registries offered choice for participation (Linkins et al, 2006 ). It could be expressed to the Office of Data Protection that such a vaccination registration would meet the criteria under the Epidemiology Law (Federal Law 818.101) as a method to prevent disease outbreaks, and naturally, that the data would be treated with the utmost confidentiality. 6.3 To ensure data comparability Before implementation of the condu cted survey as a proposed methodol ogy in a surveillance system, some areas of improvements should be considered, such as 1. Adopting a self-weighting sampling design to obtain accurate estimates and confidence intervals. 2. Reducing responde nt burden and maintaining cost, such as decreasing sample size. Because the goal is to utilize this survey as an annua l surveillance system, reducing burden should be one of the priorities to ensure compliance and acceptance from all parties involved: parents, teachers, school doctors, municipal halls. There needs to be an acceptable balance between sample size, precision, available resources and cost. 3. Measures to decrease nonrespons e below 20%: stronge r engagement of the cantons, intensifying telephone attempts, employing telephone assistants to contact foreigners in their native langua ge, locating more telephone numbers, and contacting physicians when vaccination cards are not available from the parents, with permission granted. 6. Recommendations 125 4. Fine tuning of the nonrespons e adjustments to account for difference in behaviors and attitudes toward vaccination between the Swiss and those of foreign backgrounds . 5. Children must be of the same age to allow comparability, especially those in the school years. 7. Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 126 7. Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey (SNVCS) 2005-07 With suppor t Gesundhe itsdirektorinnen und -direktoren\", the second cycle to determine vaccination coverage of children in Switzerland is currently being executed between 2005-07. In this cycle most of the practical recommendations that were listed in sections 6.2 and 6.3 to improve data quality and ease data collection have been implemented, with adaptations mandated by the existing infrastructures and available resources in each canton. The current methodol ogy includes: 1. Data collection for all 26 cantons will be a 3-year rolling cycle. Cantons are encouraged, and not obligated to participate. 2. The same methodol ogy, which was used for toddlers in 1999-2003 should be used for all 3 age groups . Sampling depended on the available sampling frame, which can be summarized into 2 sampling methods : - cluster sampling: used in 11 cantons where no central registry of residents exist. The sampling frame is a list of children born in each municipality in each canton. First the municipalities are selected, then the children. To decrease the complexities of the sampling method for the municipalities, the same sampling procedure will be implemented for all 3 age groups . - simple random sampling: used in cantons where either a central registry of residents exists, or in cantons with less than 35 municipalities. Since a central registry exists in 7 cantons the central office of registry in these cantons are requested to random ly selected the children for the study. In the remaining 8 cantons, all municipalities are asked to provide a list of all children in the targeted age groups . Once this list is compiled for each canton, then the children are selected via simple random sampling. 7. Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 127 3. The target popul ation includes: toddlers 24-35 months, 8-yr olds and 16-yr olds. The exact birth cohort will depend on the time of participation. 4. Funding is provided by both the cantons (2/3) and the SFOPH (1/3). Final financial contribution depends on the amount of work the cantons can assume. All families of selected children are then invited to participate per mail, which included an introduc tory letter and a pre-paid return envelope. Families are asked to send a copy or the original vaccination card. Four to five weeks later a reminder is sent to all those who still have not responde d, followed by a final telephone attempt, which included 5-6 calls at different hours during the week. Only vaccination information is evaluated, along with certain demographic factors as supplied by the municipalities or the central registries. Questionna ires are not used. Dates of all administration of selected vaccinations are registered, along with the time of respons e. Only the names of Hepatitis B vaccines have been recorded due to the numerous HepB vaccinations and schemes available in Switzerland. For those who do not want to participate in the survey, reasons for nonresponse are also noted, and if possible a general vaccination status of the selected child (fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated). Many of the limitations from the survey 1999-2003, particularly comparability among the 3 age groups and 26 cantons, have been eliminated in the cycle 2005-07 due to methodol ogical improvements as described above . By the end of the 3-year data collection period, 25 cantons will have participated. Only one canton has not joined this national effort. In 2005 data were collected in 10 cantons (AI, AG, BL, BS, NE, SH, SO, SZ, ZH), in 2006 in 8 cantons (FR, JU, 7. Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 128 LU, OW, UR, SG, TI, ZG) and in 2007 in 7 cantons (AR, GE, GL, GR, TG, VD, VS). Cantons BE, GE, TI and VD conduc ted the survey independently of ISPMZ and will share their database at a later time point; while the municipalities and children were sampled by ISPMZ, cantons BL and LU collected the data independently and have already given the data for analysis. The national coverage will be released in 2008 . Collaboration with the cantons has been simple and easy, and most cantons have opted to utilize the same data collection method for all 3 age groups . Due to logistic and financial restrictions, 3 cantons (BS, JU, VD) will continue to collect the data for the school children with the aid of school / LL nurses employed through their highly organized school health services. Despite their organized school health infrastructure, VS has opted to adopt one method for all 3 age groups as recommended for comparative purposes. Data quality and operational cost will be calculated to compare the cost / benefits of the different methodol ogies utilized. Annexed is an article providing coverage obtained in the first year of survey cycle 2005-2007 for 9 participating cantons [Lang et al, 2007]. In short, while comparison with data from 1999-2003 revealed that coverage for toddlers has remained relatively unchanged at the national level for Di, Te, and Pol, the rise in coverage for MMR at 1 and 2 doses, Hib and Per at 4 doses at the national level is significant. This could be impacted by the use of combined vaccinations, the change from whole-cell Per samt f\u00fcr Gesundhe it, 2006], improved vaccination campaign by the SFOPH and increase acceptance of new recommendations due to a general lag time needed to allow for implementation by health care professionals and acceptance by the community. 7. Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 129 Of the 9 cantons participating in 2005, there is a general rise in coverage in 8 cantons while in canton SZ there is a clear reduction. There is also a significant rise in coverage for the schoolchildren for all vaccinations; it could however, be a result of the different age recruited for the study. HepB coverage jumped to 65.3% for 1 dose, 60.8% for 2 doses and 36.8% for 3 doses. Similar to Hib and Per, greater acceptance of HepB vaccination since its introduc tion in 1998, together with heightened know ledge of the disease and improved immunization campaigns in the school could be reasons for the rise in HepB coverage. Furthermore, the change from a 3-dose to a 2-dose scheme for HepB could have also increased acceptance among the adolescents, parents and healthcare professionals. 8. References 130 8.

This list can be obtained from the statistical ofce in every canton. A self-weighing sampling design has been developed for cantons with this standard list. It has been used in 6 cantons in 2002 and and it is recommended to be used in the future.For cantons with a a single central registry, random sampling was used. For small Cantons (AI, NW, GL, UR, OW), all children were recruited.GE: all children who have reached 28 months of age are required to submit the vaccination cards to the ofce of the cantonal physician. Letters are sent outmonthly,which includes about 500 children. Annex B. Sampling and Data Collection Procedure I. TODDLERS (24-35 months of age) 1. Obtain approval from the office of data protection. 2. Obtain a list of children born in a specific year per municipality. 3. Select municipalities. 4. Select children in the municipalities. 5. Send letters to the municipalities requesting information on these children. 6. Send letters to the parents of the selected children. 7. One month later, send a reminder. 8. After another month, telephone . 9. Return the vaccination card to the parents after information has been extracted. II. SCHOOLCHILDREN (School entry and departure) 1. Obtain a list of all public schools and the number of classes in the one grade, and if possible, the number of children in each class. 2. Random ly select the classes. 3. Request schooldoctors and teachers (or school nurses or school officials) of these selected classes for their coope ration and supply them with the questionna ires. 4. Request the teachers to send the vaccination cards and completed questionna ires directly to ISPMZ, or to the schooldoctors who should send the information back to ISPMZ. 5. Return the vaccination cards directly to the teachers or doctors once copies have been made, unless otherwise specified. Annex C: Cantonal Participation and Distribution ISPMZ. GE: Birth cohort of children 28 months of age were selected TI: children in Kindergarten were sampled. All other cantons: some cantons, many school doctors used the vax.sum.form, however, we still needed to collect a few vax cards for the study to be completed. BE, TI, VD: no questionnaires were used.
