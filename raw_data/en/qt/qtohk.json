Thus, it has also been reported that broth toxin from a culture of the hemolytic streptococcus (scarlet fever) when mixed with sodium ricinoleate and injected intramuscularly into man did not induce any severe reaction such as usually follows an administration of the same amount of untreated broth toxin; moreover, after the elapse of a certain time, the intracutaneous test became negative in a large percentage of cases. To gain some insight into the efficacy of soap-vaccine and into the mechanism of soap action, the following experiments have been carried out on mice. Method. Sodium ricinoleate was prepared from castor oil saponified by alcoholic potassium hydroxide and purified by cooling, by fractionation of its potassium, sodium, and barium salts by the method described in another paper which will be published later.
