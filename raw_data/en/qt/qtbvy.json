EBOV and MARV cause outbreaks of severe, often fatal, disease in humans2. The second largest filovirus outbreak, caused by EBOV, is ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has resulted in 3, 444 infections and 2,264 deaths as of March 20204. The largest human outbreak of MARV occurred in Angola during 2004-2005, causing a reported 252 infections and 227 deaths5. Despite the aggressive use of a recently approved vaccine, control of the ongoing Congolese outbreak has been difficult, demonstrating the need for continued exploration of the patho biology of these high- impact viruses. There is substantial evidence that bats serve as hosts for filoviruses. MARV has been isolated from Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus ) from sites in Uganda and Sierra Leone6-8. Ecological and experimental studies have demonstrated that these bats serve as a natural reservoir for MARV7,9. Circumstantial evidence suggests an association of bats with EBOV outbreaks10,11. Surveillance studies identified the presence of EBOV antibodies and RNA in several species of bats, implicating them as potential reservoirs of EBOV and other filoviruses12. However, infectious EBOV has never been isolated from a bat12. Additional evidence of association of filoviruses with bats has been obtained via detection of diverse filoviruses in bat tissues. These include Bombali virus (a novel species in the genus Ebolav irus identified in Chaerephon pumilus and Mops condylurus bats), Lloviu virus (the sole member of the genus Cuevavirus identified via RNA detected in Miniopterus schreibersii bats in Spain and Hungary) , and Mengla virus (the sole member of the proposed genus Dianlovirus detected in the liver of a bat from the genus Rousettus )13-17. Experimental infections with MARV in Egyptian rousette bats have demonstrated virus replication in various tissues, but minimal clinical signs of disease. The virus is shed in saliva, urine , and feces18-22. Co-housed bats can transmit MARV from one individual to another9. A serial sacrifice study following s ubcutaneous inoculation of MARV demonstrated mild pathology as evidenced by transient elevations of alanine aminotransferase and, lymphocyte/monocyte counts as well as by modest levels of inflammatory infiltrates in livers20,22. Animals were able to clear MARV , and develop adaptive immune responses, including MARV - specific neutralizing IgG23. Serological data suggests the possibility that EBOV may infect bats of the Rousettus genus in nature24-26 although it is unknown whether it was a systemic or abortive peripheral infection (often referred t o as \" exposure\") with bats becoming seropositive as a result . EBOV can replicate in R. aeqyptiacus cell lines27. However, experimental inoculation of EBOV in these bats has not previously been associated with disease and has not produced definitive evidence of significant virus replication27. We experimental ly infected Egyptian rousette s with EBOV and MARV and analyzed mRNA transcripts from multiple tissue types: liver, kidney, spleen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) , and testes. For that purpose , we compiled a comprehensive list of bat transcripts, based on our sequence data together with existing genome annotations28, and, where possible, identified genes with human or mouse homologues. The majority of the differentially -expressed genes upon filoviral infection were common to bats and huma ns29. These genes include co mponents of a number of pathways involved in the innate, inflammatory, acute phase, and adaptive immune responses, as well as in the activation of the complement/coagulation pathway. Despite this broad similarity of the responses, filoviral infections in v ivo result in very different outcomes in bats compared to humans. bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 2.

The pathways impacted by these genes suggest that they may be involved in the remarkable ability of bats to avoid clinical illness during filovirus replication. Our transcri ptomics data suggest that unlike humans, infected bats 1) are in a state of impaired coagulation and increased vasodilation (which may have the effect of lowering blood pressure), 2) exhibit anti -inflammatory signatures including an early transition to an M2 macrophage phenotype and tissue regeneration in the liver, 3) exhibit downregulation of critical components of the complement system that facilitate antibody activity suggesting a muted antibody response ( to MARV7), and 4) appear to mount a robust T cell response, which is a component of successful viral clearance in humans. This is the first comprehensive in vivo study of the transcriptomic changes induced by filovirus infection in bats. Our results highlight key parts of the systemic response that facilitate the ability of bats to survive filovirus infections and suggest potential host -targeted therapeutic strategies with utility in human infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental methods Viruses . Recombinant wild -type EBOV, strain Mayinga, was recovered from the full -length clone and support plasmids in HEK 293T cells and passaged twice in Vero cells for as described previously29. Recombinant wild-type MARV, strain Uganda , was recovered similarly in BHK -21 cells as described previously30 and was also passaged twice in Vero E6 cells for amplification. Bat experimental protocol . Adult Egyptian rousette s were obtained from a commercial source and quarantined for 30 days under ABSL -2 conditions. Animals were implanted with microchip transponders for animal ID and temperature data collection. For studies with EBOV and MARV, animals were transferred t o the Galveston National Laboratory ABSL -4 facility. Animals were segregated into groups of three. Except for one MARV - infected male , all bats were female. Each group was housed in a separate cage for inoculation with the same virus. After acclimation to the facility, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and infected subcutaneously in the scapular region with 105 focus forming units (FFU; titrated on Vero E6 cells) of EBOV or MARV . Every other day, animals were anesthetized by isoflurane, weighed, temperature was determined via transponder, and 100-150 \u00b5L of blood was collected from the propat agial vein. Nucleases in b lood w ere inactivated in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (Thermo -Fisher Scientific). Samples were then removed from ABSL-4 containment , and RNA was extracted. Droplet -digital with primers specific to nucleoprotein ( NP) gene was used to detect viremia. If fewer than 106 MARV RNA copies/mL viremia w ere detected in a MARV -inoculated bat, the animal was observed for additional 2 days to allow the animal to reach a higher viral RNA load. In 48- 96 hours after first observation of viremia , the animal was euthanized under deep isoflurane sedation via cardiac exsanguination confirmed by bilater al open chest. All EBOV -inoculated bats were euthanized 48 hours after the first detection of viremia, independent of viral RNA load. Tissues were collected (listed in Table S1 ) and immediately homogenized in an appropriate volume of TRI zol reagent and stored at -80\u00b0 C. Tissue sections were also homogenized in minimal essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and stored at -80\u00b0C. Additional tissue sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology. bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 3.

Given that the course of infection appears to be relatively short in these animals21, we sacrificed them shortly after onset of viremia in the infected animals to ensure adequate capture of changes in transcriptional dynamics. As such, animals were bled every other day, and viral loads w ere assessed via ddRT -PCR. In addition, a nimals were weighed , and temperature was determined with each bleed. All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Anima l Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston . Leukocyte isolation. Leukocyte isolation was performed using ACK lysis buffer (Gibco). Ten volumes of lysis buffer were added to whole blood, incubated for 2- 3 minutes, and then neutralized with complete DMEM media containing 10% FBS. Following neutralization, samples were centrifuged at 250 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C, after which the supernatant was decanted from the pellet. This process was repeated several times per sample until a white pellet of cells free of contaminating red blood cells remained. Density gradient purification was not performed on these samples prior to or after red blood cell lysis; therefore, these leukocyte populations were assumed to contain granulocytes in addition to PBMC s. mRNA sequencing . Total RNA was isolated from bat tissues using Ambi on's RNA isolation and purification kit. For most samples, p olyA- tailed mRNA was selected using beads with oligo- deoxythymidine and then fragmented. A few samples with poor (RNA Integrity Number) scores were treated with Ribominus (targeting human ribosomal RNA) to enrich for polyA -tailed mRNA before fragmentation. cDNA was synthesized using random ligated with adaptors compatible with Illumina's NextSeq 500 sequencer . A total of 88 samples were sequenced on t he NextSeq 500, as 75 base pair single reads . Analytical methods Transcripts . We built a custom non- redundant reference bat mRNA sequence database, which is available on the shiny website . The issue of splice variants was avoided by keeping only the longest transcript for each gene . We used transcripts from different bat species and added missing annotations/sequences ( e.g., CYP11B2 and PLG) to our database by assembling reads from our own sequence data. These required custom scripts as the support for transcripts was not always robust enough to use standard tools, due to low coverage and/ or gaps in the transcripts. The gene sequences are collected from different bat species , so error -free reads might not map perfectly to the transcripts in the database. The database has sequences of 18,443 bat mRNAs , and include EBOV and MARV sequences , the infectious agents used in our studies. The genes were identified by homology to mouse and human genes. Most genes (16,004) had high similarity to human or mouse homologues , as defined by BLASTn with default settings identifying matches spanning the length of the mRNA. We label the set of rem aining genes (2439) as divergent and use these transcripts to identify systemic differences between the bat and human responses to filovirus infections. Of these, a smaller set (1 ,548 transcripts) could be identified by increasing the sensitivity of BLASTn by reducing the word -size from 11 to 9, which is equivalent to matching at the protein level. Th e remaining 891 putative transcripts could not be reliably identified by homology. Of these 891 transcripts, homologues for 182 could be identified on the basis of partial homology and domain structure, whil e the remainder (7 09 sequences whose names start with UNDEF ) belonged to one of four classes, 1) aligned to un-annotated transcripts in the human genome , 2) non-coding RNAs , 3) transcri pts unique to bats , or 4) assembly errors . We use capital izations to represent bat gene symbols, as in the human gene nomenclature. bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 4.

Kallisto was expression levels from reads . Kallisto uses pseudo- alignments and is relatively more accepting of errors /variants in reads31. This is the appropr iate tool to quantify transcripts in the samples, as the mRNA sequences from different species can have mismatches to error- free reads. Kallisto uses a parameter \"k\" while indexing the database to specify how sensitive it is to matches with smaller k value s leading to more spurious hits. We empirically determined k=23 to be an appropriate parameter value with which to index the reference mRNA dataset. We used the transcripts -per- million (tpm) value as the transcript expression levels to determine changes in expression across samples. We used the presence of viral transcripts to confirm proper assignment of samples . This approach has previously helped us to identify and correct mistakes of annotation in some of the cell line data and also identified a problem with a published dataset32, where all the na\u00efve (uninfected) samples showed signs of viral infection . Furthermore, to ensure there was no mislabeling of samples from individual bats, we identified single nucleotide variants to ensure that all tissue samples from an individual had the same set of variants Tools for data exploration and interrogation . We developed a web browser- based tool using Shiny in R, which is accessible at http://katahdin.girihlet.com/shiny/ bat/. This allows exploration of the data across various samples on a gene -by-gene basis, as well as analysis of viral expression in the samples. S amples can also be compared using scatter plots and hierarchical clustering. Data from the outlier excluded from our analyses is available in the online tool . Statistics . Datasets obtained from in vivo studies are inherently noisy, for a variety of biological reasons : viral replication and infection of cells is variable across samples/tissues and the samples consist of a heterogenous mixture of cell type s that can vary from sample to sample, even from the same tissue typ e. Bats can also be infected b y other pathogens in addition to the filovirus . Large changes in expression profiles were readily detected by comparing averages across replicates , since such changes are less affected by noise ; however , subtle changes (less than 2 -fold) were difficult to reliably detect due to lack of power in the sample size and variability between samples. To accommodate this most effects noted in our study are greater than 2- fold up- or down- regulated. Pathway analyses . A basic assumption underlying our study is that bats are mammals that possess innate and adaptive responses to infections that roughly mirror those seen in humans. The data from comparative filovirus infections in human and bat cell lines supports this .29 Despite similarities in the basic architecture of the networks, e ffects seen at the organismal level are likely to arise from subtle differences in th e systemic responses . We were, therefore, able to guide our analysis by what is known from human and mouse studies of the relevant pathways and genetic networks. We identified pathways of interest, based on divergent genes that were differentially expressed in bat liver upon filovirus infection , as explained in the results ( Fig. 3 ). RESULTS Clinical, virological, and pathological finding s in inoculated bats Inoculated bats showed no apparent clinical signs or changes in behavior, and body weights and temperatures remained relatively constant ( Fig. 1-I,II). Viral RNA was detected (using ddRT -PCR) in the blood of MARV - inoculated animals earlier (and higher) than in the EBOV -inoculated animals ( Fig. 1- III), particularly in the liver, spleen, and kidney samples. We examined the potential for excretion via salivary glands and urine in bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 5.

Two of three animals had virus detectable by plaque assay in the salivary glands, while one of three animals had detectable virus in the kidneys ( Fig 1-IV). The virus was not detected by plaque assay (limit of detection is 10 Pfu/cc) in most or all tissues collected from EBOV -inoculated animals ( Fig 1-V ). In M ARV -infected animals, histopathological observations were largely consistent with prior publications18,21. For MARV -infected animals, cytoplasmic immunostaining was performed using a pan- filovirus antibody. In these bats, we observed diffuse cytoplasmic immunostaining with moderate frequency in the absence of histopathological lesions in the mammary glands and testes, suggesting presence of virus in these organs . Two of the three EBOV -inoculated animals presented with noteworthy histopathological lesions in the liver, consisting of pigmented and unpigmented infiltrates of aggregated mononuclear cells compressing adjacent eosinophilic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. Focal EBOV immunostaining was observed in the liver of one animal, using both pan -filovirus and EBOV -VP40 antibodies, but very few foci were found, suggesting low viral replication (Fig 1-VI). Since the animals did not come from a colony known to be pathogen- free and viral loads were determined to be extremely low, any connections between the histopathology and EBOV infection are unclear. Filovirus infection of bats results in a significant a nd consistent response in the transcriptome mRNA from tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, lungs, salivary glands, large and small intestine, and testes) collected from infected and uninfected bats was deep sequenced. Multi- dimensional scaling (MDS, Fig. 2A) established that one non- infected control bat liver sample (labeled cb1 in the shiny tool) seemed to be an outlier compared to the other two ( cb2 and cb3 in the shiny tool); many inflammatory genes were upregulat ed in this sample , suggesting that cb1 may have had an unexpected injury or infection . Although we left cb1 out of the analysis, cb1 data are available for exploration in the shiny tools. Consistent with the fact that liver is one of the main targets of MARV33 and abundant viral transcripts were present only in the liver samples , we expect ed to detect robust transcriptional response in the liver tissue. However, samples from other tissues also clustered separately based on the type of infection (MARV, EB OV and mock, Fig. 2B, S 1). This suggests that even though the liver was the focus of replication, the response to infection was system wide . We summarize the effect of filoviral infection on the liver transcriptome using an upset plot ( Fig. 3), which is just another way of drawing a Venn diagram, showing membership of genes in six sets (genes up/down regulated in EBOV -infected samples compared to mock -infected samples, genes up/down regulated in MARV - infected samples compared to mock -infected samples, and genes up/down regulated in EBOV -infected samples compared to MARV -infected samples). The various intersections between the sets show members unique to that intersection. A large set of genes was found to respond to infection with either virus, indicating t he response is broader than a simple perturbation of the na\u00efve state. We also found that more genes responded to MARV infection than to EBOV infection, concordant with more robust replication of MARV in these animals ( Fig. 3). As such, most of our analyse s concentrated on liver RNA transcripts . For some genes , we also analyzed transcriptional response in kidneys and/or spleens in order to understand the regulation of certain pathways (e.g., Renin is expressed in kidney and regulates the blood pressure syst em).

Routine pathway analyses using standard tools usually result in lists of pathways/functions replacing gene lists, often without offering much additional insight. If we start with the full list of genes responsive to filovirus infections, the list will be dominated by the interferon response genes, obscuring the pathways responsible for the systemic response. The multiple testing problem becomes apparent at this level because, with the large set of responsive genes it is not clear which genes are i mportant and if some are highlighted due to random chance To guide our exploration of the datasets, we identified a set of bat genes ( 2439 genes) with significant differences from their human/mouse homologues, defined as genes whose homologues could not be identified using BLASTn with default settings. This is based on our hypothesis that these divergent genes must be the foundation of the differences in the systemic responses to filoviruses between bat s and humans systemic. Considering only genes with reasonable expression (tpm > 20) in at least one class of liver samples (MARV -, EBOV - or mock- infected) we refined the list down to 264 genes . Of these, 151 genes were responsive in at least one class of bat livers , defined a s up- or down- regulated at least 2 -fold upon infection with EBOV or MARV . This process of narrowing down the list of genes of interest is depicted in Fig. 4. Tables S1 -S8 show the 151 genes split into various classes, upregulated (the log2 ratio to the mock- infected sample is greater than 0.6) in both, downregulated (log2 ratio to the mock- infected samples is less than -0.6) and various combinations thereof. The tables have annotated various pathways/processe s that the genes participate in. The major themes identified by this preliminary analysis and the connections between them are outlined in Fig. 5. We found that the following pathways/systems were impacted by filovirus infection: acute phase proteins ( Table 1), interferon responsive Fig. 6,7 ), polarization ( Fig. 8,9,10 ), the complement system ( Fig. 11), the adaptive immune system ( Fig. 12) and the vascular system ( Fig. 13,14,15). Infected bats have transcriptional profiles indicative of a robust innate immune response to filovirus infection We detected a robust innate immune response in vivo not only to MARV, but also to EBOV , despite limited viral replication. I nnate immune genes are seen to be responsive to MARV and EBOV infection (Fig. 5,6,7 ). Our previous in vitro transcriptomic studies demonstrated that the innate immune response in bat cells is broadly similar to that in human cells 29. Additionally, most innat e immune bat genes are not divergent from their human homologs, as we have defined it. Thus, we believe that the innate immune response likely cannot explain, on its own, the drastic difference in infection phenotype observed in bats relative to humans. Infected bats exhibit an acute phase response, involving multiple acute phase proteins (APP ) Inflammation and injury34,35 trigger inflammatory cytokines ). These cytokines subsequently trigger transcriptional events that lead to an increase in serum levels of some acute phase protein ( APP)36 and a decrease of others (e.g., transferrin, albumin37). APPs are produced by hepatocytes in the liver, and are an important part of the innate immune response .38 Depending upon the combination of cytokines, the specific re action can vary in response to different inflammatory conditions .39-41 The IL-6 response is often not directly detect ed by mRNA -seq data due to low expression; however, the APPs respond strongly. Our data indicates that MARV infection, and to a lesser ex tent EBOV infection, elicits a strong APP response in bats ( Table 1). SAA expression , for example, increased 1,000- fold in response to MARV infection. Curiously, bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 7.

Potentially , CRP may not be present in an active form in bat s at all (Tabl e 1). Persistent expression of IL -6, known to cause chronic inflammation , is tightly regulated via negative feedback loops . We found that several of these negative feedback loops were strongly upregulated in liver tissues in response to MARV infection and to a lesser degree in response to EBOV infection. These include 1) GP130 (IL-6ST), which acts to initiate the Janus kinase (JAK) -STAT3 pathway, 2) STAT3, which induces various IL -6 responsive genes such as APPs and the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) genes, and 3) the SOCS genes themselves , which bind to JAK and GP130 to stop IL -6 signalin g (Fig. 6,7). Inflammation is also mediated by leukotrienes (LTC4) and prostaglandin E, which are produced by microsomal glutathione S -transferases (MGST1 and MGST2)42. Under bats, MGST1 and MGST2 are highly upregulated. Infected bats exhibit a transcriptional profile suggestive of an early transition from an M1 dominated to an M2 dominated macrophage population Macrophages recognize and phagocytize foreign organisms and damaged host cells. Macrophages , an important early target for filoviruses43, play a major role in the immune response in the liver, one of the primary site s of filovirus replication. Macrophages can be either in an M1 state (inflammatory, assisting innate immunity) or in an M2 state (anti -inflammatory, assisting tissue regeneration) ( Fig. 8,9,10) and can polarize or shift from one state to the other. K ey markers of M1 macrophage activation include IRF5, NF -B, AP -1, and STAT 1 (Fig. 8), which subsequently lead to the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-, IL- and M2c ) are distinguished by others44. M2a macrophages enhance tissue regeneration and inhibit inflammatory responses. They are activated by IL -4 and IL -13, which , in turn, upregulat e , IL-10 -inflammatory activ ity by -6, IL -10, TNF -. M2c macrophages suppress inflammatory response. They are activated by IL -10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF -), and glucocorticoids , and they produce IL -10 and TGF -. In the anti -inflammatory state, mitochondrial activity is increased and primarily involved in fatty acid metabolism. Prolonged M1 activit y can be harmful and is modulated by the negative feedback that transforms macrophages from M1 to M2 state46,47, thereby controlling inflammation during infections and the transition to tissue repair 48,49 (Fig. 8). M1 macrophages rely upon glycolysis and M2 macrophages utilize fatty acid oxidation as an energy source . The switch between states is achieved by simply disrupting cellular energy metabolism. M2 macrophage polarization is accompanied by mitochondrial biogenesis. Hypoxia- inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a key regulator inducing M2 polarization through hypoxia50. HIF1A51-53, promotes mitophagy and is required by M1 macrophages, whereas M2 macrophages depend on the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Inactivating HIF1A also promotes M2 polarization. We found that filovirus- infected bats exhibit upregulat ion of key markers of M1 macrophage s, including IRF5, NF-B, AP 1G1 (a subunit of the AP -1 complex) , and STAT 1 (Fig. 6,7). These lead to the secretion of pro- inflammatory as IFN-, IL-1, IL-23 upregulat ed in filovirus- infected bats , which we infer through either direct or indirect evidence.

Although we did not detect expression of IL -4 and IL-13 in any bat tissues, genes regulated by them, such as MRC1, TGFB1 and ARG1 were found to be highly expressed in livers of bats infected with both viruses. CSF1 is a cytokine that controls the production, differentiation, and function of macrophages. The CSF 1 receptor (CSF1R) that mediates the biological functions of CSF 1 was also upregulated in filovirus infected bat livers, the upregulat ion was greater in EBOV infected ani mals (Fig. 8,9). Several genes related to fatty acid oxidation were found to be upregulated by filovirus infection ( Table s 1-3). Infected bats al so upregulated multiple markers of mitochondrial abundance, such as TFAM, OPA1, MFN1/2, and DNM1 L, pyruvate response to hypoxia was also upregula ted (more so in MARV than bats, SOCS 3, which promotes M1 polarization, was upregulated. S everal M2 markers, including TGFB 1, ARG1, and MRC1 wer e also upregulat ed (Fig. 8,9). Additional evidence for M2 polarization is provided by the non- anemic state of EBOV -infected bats, inferred from the presen ce of abundant iron, which enhances macr M2 polarization.56 PKM, HIF1AN and which play an important role in inactivating HIF1A to promote the M1 to M2 switch , are all upregulated in filovirus infected bats (Fig. the gene GPD2, the mitochondrial glycerol -3-phosphate dehydrogenase which contributes to the shift in core metabolism in macrophages associated with the M1 to M2 transition during infection aiding tissue repair57 was found to be upregulated by filovirus infection ( Fig. 9). These findings indicate t hat bats may transition from an M1 -dominated macrophage response to an M2- dominated response relatively early in infection compared to humans. This switch may be an important component of the ability of the animals to control infection and avoid clinical disease by suppressing inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration. This would reduce or prevent immunopathology and allow the adaptive immune system to effectively control the virus. Expression of key components of the classical complement pathway is i nhibited by filoviral infectio n The complement pathway has three branches, the classical pathway, the mannose- binding lectin pathway and the alternative pathway58. The classical pathway recognizes antigens bound to antibodies; the lectin pathway binds to sugar molecules on the virus particles and the alternative pathway is a component of the innate defense against infections . Both the classical and lectin complement pathways were activated by filovirus infection ( Fig. 11). However, several elements of the classical pathway were downregulat ed or even not expressed in filoviru s infected livers, including C1R, C3, C8G, and MASP2. ion of C1R , C3, and MASP2 would compromise the classical pathway as they are key to the antibody effector activity. This likely reduces the efficiency of the antibody activity in i nfected bats, consistent with the finding that antibody- mediated virus neutralization is not the dominant mode for filovirus clearance in R. aegyptiacus bats.59 Infected bats exhibit transcriptional signatures of robust T cell activity bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 9.

Overall, this suggests that control and clearance of filovirus infection in bats may largely depend upon a robust cellular response , similar to what has been observed in humans, where individuals who recover tend to mount robust cellular responses .60-62 Infected bats exhibit dramatic signatures in the vascular system, with low coagulation, vasodilation and non- anemic states despite HAMP upregulat ion Three major interconnected pathways of the vascular system are, a) iron metabolism ( Fig. 1 3), b) blood pressure ( Fig. 1 4) and c) coagulation ( Fig. 1 5). The interplay between the three is complicated (outlined in Fig. 5). We highlight genes involved in the response affecting the three pathways and the connections between them. To better present our results in context, give a brief overview of iron metabolism . Iron, an essential component of heme needed for oxygen transpor t, is tightly regulated , 63 mostly by hepcidin (HAMP )64(Fig. 1 3). HAMP controls the internal absorption of iron65, by binding Ferroportin (SLC40A1/FPN1), to block export of iron across membranes and cau se Ferroportin degradation. H AMP is upregulat ed by iron in serum and pro- inflammatory stimuli (IL-6), such as infection.66 In blood , iron forms a complex with Transferrin (TF), which is enabled by c eruloplasmin (CP) and MOXD1, involved in processing copper .67 In the cytosol , iron is bound to f erritin (comprised of a heavy chain, FTH1 and a light chain FTL), synthesized by cells in response to increased iron. Thus, ferritin is a marker for iron levels in serum .68 In mitochondria, iron is bound to FTMT , the mitochondrial ferritin .69 PCBP2, an iron chaperone is also needed for i ron transport within the cytosol70. STEAP3 helps transport iron from Transferrin to the cytosol of erythrocytes71. Most iron is in hemoglobin (66%) , the remainder is stored mostly in macrophages in the liver, which take up iron through the CD163 receptor. The bone marrow can suppress HAMP synthesis, in response to anemia, leading to export of iron from macrophages , and increased uptake of iron from diet. In EBOV - and MARV -infected bat tissues, H AMP was upregulate d (Fig. 13). In MARV infection, macrophage expansion/infiltration (as was observed in histology sections of infected tissues) and lowered hemoglobin expression suggest that red blood cell production m ight be impaired, which is potentially a sign o f anemia. Further, CD164, which suppresses hematopoietic cell proliferation, was also upregulated by MARV infection (Fig. 1 3). In EBOV , FTH1 and FTMT were both upregulated Fig. 13), reflecting increased iron abundance in serum . In contrast, FTH1 and FTMT Upregulat ion of HBB in EBOV -infected samples was also observed. This suggests that hematopoiesis was impaired in MARV -infected bats, but not in EBOV -infected bats . It is likely that this was a result of the divergent pathobiology of EBOV and MARV infection s in Egyptian rousettes . The early control of EBOV by these bat s suggest that the iron levels in bat s that eventually clear MARV infections may resemble the iron levels in EBOV -infected animals . Filovirus -infected bats exhibited transcriptional signatures of vasodilation, which may indicate a low blood pressure sta te Blood pressure (Fig. 1 4) can be cont rolled by either vasoconstriction ( e.g., AGT2 activity and the renin/angiotensin system), or by changing the concentration of salts in blood ( e.g., regulation of aldosterone by bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 10.

The primary means of blood pressure regulation is renal expression of renin, which converts Angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I. Angiotensin Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels to increase pressure. ACE expression is upregulat ed by a feedback loop triggered by low blood pressure. Angiotensin II also enhances production of active plasmin increasing coagulation, connecting the pressure and coagulation pathways72. Inflammation upregulat es the SERPIN genes, several complement genes, and HAMP, which connects the iron, blood pressure blood pressure, CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 (which reduce blood pressure and inflammation) all connect blood pressure, inflammation and coagulation73. During filovirus infection in bats, we found that ACE was upregulated, while angiotensin and AGT were downregulate d (Fig. 1 4). Additionally, we found that PTGIS was upregula ted. In EBOV -infected bats, ) was upregulated ( Fig. 1 4) The vascular response might be another key to the response of bats to filovirus infection. Humans infected with EBOV or MARV in many cases eventually exhibit excessive bleeding, low blood pressure , and excessive and dysregulated coagulation in the form of disseminated intravascular coagulation74. Our data suggest that bats use multiple strategies to protect their vascular systems during filovirus infection, an important mechanism for limiting the pathology. DISCUSSION The ability of bats to serve as hosts for a variety of diverse viruses has been a topic of considerable interest and scientific attention, with several theories being proposed to explain this phenomenon. One theory posits that bats have constitutively expressed interferons or permanently active innate immune system, ready and waiting for pathogens to appear 75, although this has not been a universal observation in all bat species76,77. The reported levels of constitutive expression reported75 are extremely low (at least 5 orders of magnitude lower than ribosomal RNA), which makes them undetectable in mRNAseq, but also raises questions about nature of the constitutive expression. Further, in an mRNA -seq study on PBMCs from EBOV -infected humans, individuals who succumbed to disease showed stronger upregulation of interferon signaling and acute phase response -related genes compared to survivors during the acute phase of infection 82. Therefore, the differences in responses between h uman and bats goes beyond any upregulation or constitutive expression of interferons. Another theory suggested that components of the innate immune response (e.g., STING(TMEM173)) could be mutated to become less effective in bats78. It is unlikely that a single gene is the \"magic bullet\" that explains the profound differences observed between human and bat responses to filovirus infection. Instead, our data together with the extant literature strongly suggest that modifications of entire systems is required to produce the observed divergence in the response to infection. The innate response of human and bat cell lines to filovirus infections is almost identical, but in vivo , the clinical course and outcomes in humans and bats are different . Such differential responses likely involve a variety of tissue/cell types and the interactions between them are driven by numerous genes. Identifying diver gent genes in this large set and using them to identify the systemic differences between bats and humans provides a rational basis for the analysis of this data. By limiting ourselves to genes that fit this requirement, the multiple testing problem was ame liorated, by drastically reducing the number of genes being considered. bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 11.

Nonfatal cases had higher levels of sCD40L expression, a marker for T cell activity, consistent with our data that suggest that T cells are highly active during filovirus infection of bats while antibody-m ediated virus neutralization is potentially less important for filovirus clearance 59. The state of the bat under filoviral infection and the fact that they do survive these infections suggests potential approaches to helping human patients. We believe the anti -inflammatory state induced in bats upon filovirus infection is a natural appli cation of this strategy, especially the early switch to M2 macrophage polarization. This allows the adaptive defenses of bats to clear the virus and avoid damage from immunopathology. Thus, an attempt could be made to reduce the human hyperinflammatory re sponse88 to filovirus infections by modulating the innate response to prevent damage and allow other processes to clear the infection and allow for wound healing. For example, Anti -inflammatory agents could also be used to emulate the protective physiological conditions observed in bats (e.g., through the inhibition of IL -6). One approach would be to target the IL -6 receptor through the use of tocilizumab (Actemra), an antibody directed against the IL-6-receptor95. Alternatively, IL -6 could be targeted directly with age nts such as siltuximab (Sylvant)96. Another class of anti - inflammatory agents are LTC4 inhibitors, used to treat asthma, may be of benefit in filovirus infection which in bats upregulate MGST1 and MGST2, in turn inducing leukotrienes (LTC4) and prostaglandin E, which are mediators of inflammation42. Our evidence further suggests that bats, upon infection by filovirus, may naturally vasodilate and reduce their blood pressure (mimicking the action of ACE inhibitors). They further make the endothelial system anti - thrombotic. Surprisingly, use of ACE inhibitors and statins has already been tried in field studies which have suggested they might help humans infected with EBOV 90. Along these lines, another potentially useful drug is Prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2, or epoprostenol, its drug name), a powerful vasodilator and anti -coagulant that acts by binding to the prostacyclin receptor. This has potential for use in human filovirus infections to emulate the physiological conditions (low blood pressure and coagulation) in bats that we believe have protective effects 91. In Infected bats, high HAMP expression seems decoupled from the levels of iron, which should normally be depressed by HAMP. This suggests HAMP inhibitors, used to treat anemia, might prove useful in filoviral infections. Two Hamp inhibitors, Heparin 92 and erythropoietin (EPO) 93,94, have additional effects, anti - coagulation and RBC synthesis respectively, which might make them particularly useful . Vitamin D is also a HAMP inhibitor which could be used with minimal side -effects . A limitation of our study is our inability to conduct genetic manipulations that would help tease out details of interactions that we have uncovered here. Another limitation is our inability to purs ue potential therapeutic agents we have identified. Investigating these effects further requires either reconstituting systems in vitro or experimenting on live animal models, both of which are beyond the scope of this work. CONCLUSIONS Bats are an ideal model system for research into the pathobiology of filovirus infection . The resistance of bats to clinical illness provides a useful basis for comparison to human infection. Based on transcriptional analyses, we have composed a framework for understanding a filovirus -infected bat's remarkable resilience to serious bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 12.

Upset plots are an alternative to complex Venn diagrams. In the plot, mock refers to mock -infected bats, EBOV to EBOV -infected bats, and MARV to MARV -infected bat livers. Each row in the lower panel represents a set, with the corresponding colored bars at the lower left representing membership in the sets. There are six sets of genes, EBOV/mock comprises of genes at least 2- fold up regulated in EBOV infection, compared to the mock samples, while mock/EBOV is genes at least 2- fold down regulated in EBOV samples compared to the mock samples. The vertical blue lines with bulbs represent set intersections, the main bar plot (top) is number of genes unique to that intersection, so the total belonging to a set, say mock/EBOV, is a sum of the numbers in all sets that have mock/EBOV as a member (41+203+6+31=281). For example, the last bar is the set of genes common to EBOV/MARV, EBOV/mock and MARV/mock, so are up 2- fold in EBOV compared to the mock and MARV samples, and at least 2- fold up in MARV compared to mock . Many more genes respond to infection by MARV than -specific (MARV/EBOV) responses specific to the viral VP40, VP35 and VP24 genes. 1822 bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 21.

The process used in the paper to identify pathways of interest to help explain the bat's resilience in the face of filoviral infection. Bat genes evolutionarily divergent from their human homologs that are responsive in liver to filovirus infection were identified. The pathways they participate in were explored to understand the systemic response to filovirus infections in bats and identify key differences from human responses. The vascular system (Blood pressure, Coagulation and Iron homeostasis) was a prominent pathway. Glycolysis, which is controlled by Hypoxia, is responsible for the balance between M1 and M2 states of macrophage activation. The pathways are interconnected, as we show in subsequent figures. bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 22.

The innate immune response causes inflammation, which triggers an acute phase response (APR), leading to a cascade of vascular events, affecting regulation of HAMP (iron), coagulation, blood pressure and M1 macrophage stimulation. The anti -inflammatory state characterized by M2 macrophages is increased relative to the M1 macrophages in both EBOV and MARV. M1 to M2 conversions are possible. Coagulation and blood pressure are down regulated in MARV and EBOV infection, while iron levels are high, especially in EBOV infection (contrary to the levels of HAMP). Fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial activity are up, which are hallmarks of M2 macrophages. T cell (CD8) activity is also upregulated. The complement system is incompletely stimulated by the acute phase response, leading to potentially restricted antibody activity. The details are given in subsequent figures. bat-filovirus-jayaprakash 23.

Virus RNA/proteins are detected by sensors, leading to upregulation of Interferon type I (IFNA and IFNB) and interferon stimulated genes (ISG) through the JAK -STAT pathway. Cytokines chemokines create an anti -viral state in the cell. Inflammation (IL- 6) triggers expression of acute phase proteins. Secretion of interferon gamma enables an adaptive immune system response. In human and bat cell lines, interferon responses to the filoviruses were similar.

HAMP induces macrophages in the M1 state. Cell iron status also influences macrophage polarization54, which leads to vascular effects80. During filovirus infection, the system is in an anti -inflammatory state (markers for M2 are up), while during MARV infection, the inflammatory M1 state is also seen, consistent with the acute phase response involving down regulation of albumin and upregulation of SAA1/2. The M1- M2 switch is anti -inflammatory and promotes wound healing, low -angiotensin, hematopoiesis etc. Different SOCS family molecules are molecular switches that control M1/M2 macrophage polarization. High expression of SOCS3 in MARV infection promotes M1 polarization. M2 markers are also upregulated. The M2 state is probably the key to the resilience of bats during filovirus infection, allowing bats to fight off filoviruses without significant adverse effects. Under MARV infection, there is limited viral replication and disease symptoms before it is cleared, consistent with this, the anti -inflammatory state is not as pronounced as in the case of EBOV -infected bats. The anti -inflammatory state is also characterized by tissue regeneration, which is facilitated by an increase in mitochondrial numbers and fatty acid oxidation activity. There is also a connection between iron metabolism and macrophage M1/M2 polarization with increasing iron favoring M2 54.

ACE catalyze conversion of AGT to AGT2, which constricts blood vessels to increase pressure. AGT is lowered by filovirus infection. PTGIS, which reduces blood pressure and coagulation, is upregulated by filovirus infection. Additionally, ACE is upregulated, which is a sensor of low blood pressure. Thus, bats under filovirus infection are likely in an anti -coagulative state with low blood pressure.

Catalytic activity is represented by a red dot. The serine protease plasmin opposes this process by attacking the -1) inhibits the activity of uPA, blocking the creation of Plasmin, thereby stabilizing clots. SERPINF2 also stabilizes clots by plasmin. PTGIS creates prostacyclin, which prevents platelet aggregation, yet another path for inhibiting clot formation and coagulation. Prostacyclin is also a potent vasodilator. Failure in the control of plasmin (e.g. inactivation of SERPINF2 which inhibits plasmin) can lead to hemorrhagic diathesis, while blocking plasmin activity can lead to excessive clotting. Filovirus infection in bats leads to low F2 (which lowers fibrin) and raises levels of PTGIS which suggest that they are in a low coagulation state.
