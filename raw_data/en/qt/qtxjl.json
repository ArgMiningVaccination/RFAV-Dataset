Naturopathy provides a holistic approach to health and wellbeing and addresses the underlying cause of disease, focusing on restoring your body's innate ability to heal. During an initial naturopathic consultation, you can expect your practitioner to discuss your current health concerns, your health goals, along with your health history, current diet, lifestyle, stress, sleep, and the impact of environmental factors. How can a naturopath help you? A naturopathic practitioner deals with internal health problems and metabolic imbalances through the treatment of the whole person. In general, a wide range of assessment techniques are employed to uncover the causative factors, so treatments may then involve nutritional advice, herbal medicines, homoeopathy, bodywork, and nutritional supplements. Naturopaths will not necessarily use all these therapies for every patient, but may have a range of therapies they specialise in. Naturopaths believe that when we restore the equilibrium of the body, our immune system is better placed to defend itself against infection and disease. Naturopaths are trained in a variety of therapy types and therefore can treat a broad spectrum of disease states, either acute or chronic. Naturopathy can be used to support: - Respiratory conditions - Skin conditions - Anxiety and depression - Infectious diseases, such as [colds and influenza](https://naturalmedicineweek.com.au/your-health/immunity-cold-and-flu/) - Gastrointestinal and digestive disturbances - Hormonal abnormalities such as menopausal symptoms - Allergies Your naturopath will educate, inform, and involve you in your health care so that you feel empowered to reach your goals and regain your health and wellbeing naturally.
