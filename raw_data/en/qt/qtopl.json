Below are some things you can expect when getting started. A bit of paperwork You will need to fill out forms that provide general information about you and your condition. Our staff is happy to assist you with the paperwork and you can save time by downloading them and filling them out before you come in. Consultation and History During your first consultation with the doctor, we'll discuss any health-related issues and concerns to see if chiropractic could be helpful. You will also learn about spinal and wellness care options. Examination In order to assess your structure and function, the doctor will perform a variety of targeted tests that will determine the causes of weakness and injury to your structure and function. First Adjustment Once we have examined you, we will perform various gentle chiropractic adjustments based on your exam findings, your age, physical condition and any contraindications. First adjustments are usually very gentle for those new to chiropractic. If you've been to a chiropractor before, we may be able to accomplish more on your first visit. Diagnostic imaging Your specific condition may require us to refer you for other tests such as x-ray or MRI to either rule out more serious conditions or assist us in assessing the most effective spinal care plan for you. Home instructions Before leaving, you will be given instructions on certain activities or procedures to be conducted at home. This may include ice or heat applications, avoidance of certain activities or positions, as well as home exercises. First Visit Fees The fee for an initial visit is $75 payable at the time of service and includes the consultation, examination and first adjustment. Subsequent adjustments are $75 per visit. We also offer to those who wish to commit to an ongoing individual or family care; packages of 6, 12, and 24 visit care plans that can lower your cost per visit. We will verify if you have insurance benefits that cover chiropractic, and if qualified, we may accept your insurance assignment as payment. We are an out of network provider and do not participate in any in-network panels or plans. We do our best to work with all our practice members to make chiropractic care affordable for all who wish our services. If you need special consideration due to hardship, we will be happy to discuss alternate arrangements.
