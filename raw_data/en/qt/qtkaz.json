November 16 - 17, 2013. - Cost: US$ 70.00The Key to the Remedy: Embracing the Unknown Original Date: November 16, 2013 Presenter: Doug Brown CCH, RSHom (NA), FNPOften we find ourselves thinking of a possible remedy early on in the interview. This is unavoidable, as we have in our heads so much knowledge of so many remedies; it would be a surprise if the patient's story didn't evoke our mental associations with keynotes and rubrics we have studies. But these associations, and especially our attachment to them, are the biggest obstacles to finding the remedy. In this talk I will explain why, and talk more generally about how our own fear of not knowing blinds us to what is in front of us. Learning Objectives: a) Understand the power of our own insecurity in prematurely concluding our case-taking; b) Recognize how, no matter how little we know or perceive, the correct remedy will always be waiting to express itself in the patient; c) Enhance the power to perceive how what is present differs from what one expects or desires. Biography Doug Brown worked as a sociologist with Cornell University's American Indian Studies Program before resolving to gain more practical skills as a Family Nurse Practitioner at Yale University. After more than a decade providing primary care, mostly to underserved populations, he became dissatisfied with the medical model and searched for a healing modality that recognized the intrinsic connectedness of mind and body. When he witnessed a miracle of healing by homeopathy, he was led to the Hahnemann College, and later to studies with Sankaran, Chaabra, Scholten, and other masters. He has taught extensively for the American College of Homeopathic Medicine in Phoenix, AZ, and the Seattle School of Homeopathy.1.5 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00Restorative Wildcrafting in the Pacific Northwest Date: 16, 2013 Presenter: Lisa Amerine, ND, approved by Cost: US$ 125.00The Case for Clarity Original Date: November 16, 2013 Presenter: Joe Kellerstein, ND, DHANP\"The history of homeopathy is filled with examples of attempts at simplifying the method and making the practice easier. It is not to everybody's taste to follow Hahnemann's intransigent approach...Again and again they tried to find shortcuts and to compare disease entities and other theoretical abstractions to each other, instead of comparing the subjective individual symptoms.\"G Von Keller (Homoeopathy Simplified).Why would this have happened at all? In turning to my own experience in practice the first seemingly insurmountable obstacle to practicing in a Hahnemannian way was \"how do I get sufficient high quality symptoms enabling a decisive totality.\" An attempted answer is the creation of a new concept in Homoeopathic education. \"Coaching the Essential Skills of Case Taking.\" The course is an experiential training in the essentials of questioning for Homoeopathy with derivations from NLP and Clean Language (David Grove). This is a presentation of the thinking and principles underlying this effort.BiographyJoseph Kellerstein, DC, ND graduated as a chiropractor in 1980 and as an ND in 1984.
