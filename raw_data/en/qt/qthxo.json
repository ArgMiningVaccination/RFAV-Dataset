M aterials and reagents with their catalogue numbers are listed in annex 1. I. Preparation 1. Materials 1) Cell line Bhas 42 cells (v -Ha-ras-transfected Balb/c 3T3 clone and mycoplasma , supplied from HRI (Hatano Research Institute, Food and Drug Safety Center, Japan) Cell Bank . 2) Media MEM : Minimum essential medium with 2.2 g/L NaHCO 3. : NaHCO 3. FBS: Fetal bovine serum should be selected showing a low spontaneous focus formation an d a high focus formation in the positive control. PS: Penicillin G sodium (10000 units/mL ) PS (500 mL MEM + 56 mL FBS + 5 mL PS) : Used for the expansion of provided cells, cell storage, and the first culture after thawing. DF5F: DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS + 1% PS (500 mL DMEM/F12 + 26.5 mL FBS + 5 mL PS) : Used for routine passages, cell growth assays and transformation assays. 3) Chemicals Test chemicals and solvent/vehicle: Test chemicals are dissolved or suspended in an appropriate solvent or vehicle and diluted with the solvent/vehicle to each individual concentration before added to culture media so that all chemical treatment media contain an equal concentration of the solvent/vehicle. The final conc entration of the solvent/vehicle in the medium is 5% with distilled water/ultra pure water and 0.1% with DMSO (permissible up to 0.5% when a test chemical does not dissolve). Negative and positive controls: The solvent/v ehicle for a test chemical is used as the negative control. A known initiator, 3 -methylcholanthrene (MCA: final concentration of 1 g/mL), and a promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol -13- acetate (TPA: final concentration of 50 ng/mL), are use d for the positive controls. 4) Fixatives and staining solutions Formalin (37% formaldehyde): Used for fixing cells. Methanol: Used for fixing cel ls. 0.1% crystal violet (CV) solution: Used for staining cells in cell growth assays. First, 1 g of crystal violet is dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol, and the total volume is adjusted to 1 L with distilled water/ultra pure water. Extraction solution (0.02 mo l/L HCl and 50% ethanol): Used for extracting CV in cell growth assays. 480 mL distilled water/ultra pure water + 500 mL ethanol + 20 mL 1 M HCl. 2 5% Giemsa solution: Used for staining cells in transformation assays. 5) Culture vessels 00-mm dishes: Used for routine passage. 96-well plates: Used for cell growth and transformation assays. 6) Micropipettes Electronic multichannel pipettes are convenient. 2. Cell culture 1) Cell culture and passage Bhas 42 cells are cultured in a humid ified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 \u00baC. The passage should be done at about 70% confluence of cell growth. 2) Preparation of cell stock The provided cells are expanded in M10F. The regular method of preparation of cell stock is as follows: One tube (2.5 x 105 cells) is thawed and suspended in 50 mL of M10F. The cell suspension is distributed into 5 of 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a volume of 10 mL/dish and cultured. Usually the cultures become to be 50 -70% confluent in 4 days under these conditions. The culture s at 50 -70% confluence are trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin after washed once with 0.02% EDTA -PBS( -). The cells are resuspended at a cell density of 5 x 105 cells/mL in cold fresh M10F containing 5% DMSO, frozen in 0.5 mL aliquots (2.5 x 105 cells/tube) at - 80C and stored in liquid nitrogen. Every transformation experiment is started from this frozen stock. For this validation study Bhas 42 cells are provided at passage 17 (2006.12.16, P17) from HRI. In this validation study Bhas 42 cells must be used at passa ge 18 for the transformation assays. But for cell growth assays the cells at higher passages can be used and should be used to save frozen cell stocks for subsequent transformation assays. II. Experimental procedures A. Initiation assay3) 1. Cell grow th assay for determination of test concentrations (crystal violet method) 1) Test concentrations and used vessels The highest concentration is 5 mg/mL4,5). In the case of chemicals difficult to dissolve, the highest concentration may be one or two level higher than the concentration showing the utmost solubility. Five or more c oncentration levels are set by an appropriate serial dilution factor such as 10, square root 10 or 2. In some chemicals the cell 3 growth assay should be repeated in a narrower conce ntration range. The solvent/vehicle for a test chemical is used as the control. Each cell growth assay should include each solvent/vehicle control. Eight wells of 96 -well plates are used for each concentration . Blank control: Wells added with the medium al one are prepared for the blank control in cell growth assays. The blank control can be shared among different experiments conducted at the same time. 2) Procedure of cell growth assay Day -3: The cells at about 70% confluence are trypsinized and suspended in DF5F at 0.7 to 1 x 104 cells/mL. The cell suspension is transferred at a volume of 10 mL to 100-mm dishes. The cells with a high passage number can be used for the cell growth assay. Day 0: The cells at about 70% confluence are trypsinized and suspended in DF5F at 4000 cells/mL. The cell suspension is distributed into each well of 96 -well plate s at a volume of 0.05 mL (200 cells/well). Because the volume is very small, the cell suspension is spread on the bottom of well by tapping the plates lightly. After keeping the plates at room temperature for 15 min until the cells are attached to the bott om, they are put into a incubator. Eight wells are prepared for each treatment condition. Day 1: Media containing test chemicals at two times the final concentration are prepared, and 0.05 mL of the preparations are added to the wells without medium change . The plate is tapped to mix media in the wells. Day 4: Medium is changed with 0.1 mL of fresh DF5F. Day 7: After fixing, the cells are stained with 0.1 mL of CV solution for 15 min or more, rinsed well with water and dried. Measurement: The stained dye of each well is e xtract ed with 0.1 mL of extraction solution , gently shaking for 10 min or more, and the optical density of each well is measured at a wavelength between 540 and 570 nm. Before measurement, the plates are shaken for several seconds (a micropl ate reader with mixing function is recommended). Bubbles, if any, are broken by touching with lightly heated tweezers. Growth rates relative to the solvent/vehicle control culture are calculated. 2. Transformation assay 1) Test concentrations an d used vessels Five to nine concentrations are set up based on the results of cell growth assays . These concentrations cover a range from highest toxicity (less than 20% survival compared to the control culture ) to little or no toxicity . Ideally, one dose below NOEL, two doses between NOEL and IC50 and two doses between IC50 and IC90 are assessed in the initiation assay, as follows; ------------------------------- NOEL ----------------------------------- IC50 --------------------------------- IC90 One dose Two doses Two doses Mother c ulture : MEM10 + 10% FBS (M10F)-3 01 4 7 10 or 11 Day 21 -7 or -6 assay Transformation + 10% FBS (M10F)-3 01 4 7 10 or 11 Day 14 21 -7 or -6 FixFormaldehyde or assay Transformation + 10% FBS (M10F)-3 01 4 7 10 or 11 Day 21 -7 or -6 assay Transformation + 10% FBS (M10F)-3 01 4 7 10 or 11 Day 14 21 -7 or -6 FixFormaldehyde or Medium change: Cell platingCell growth assay Transformation assay 4 For a chemical which gives the sharp decline of cell growth within a narrow concentration range, one or two more doses above or below the predicted concentration range may be set up as a prec aution against the fluctuation of cell response among experiments. For low cytotoxic chemicals , the assay is performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg/mL4,5). One plate for the transformation assay (96 wells), and eight wells for the concurrent cell growth ass ay are prepared at each concentration . Each assay of a chemical should include negative and positive control s (when the solvent of the test chemical is 5% water, DMSO control is also necessary as the control for MCA). The control data cannot be shared amon g experiments of different chemicals even if they are carried out at the same time. 2) Procedure of transformation assay and concurrent cell growth assay Day -7 or -6: Frozen stock cells are thawed, and cultured in 10 mL of M10F in 100-mm dishes. Transfo rmation assays must be started from the frozen stock cells but not from the cells with a high passage number. Day -3: The cells at about 70% confluence are trypsinized and suspended in DF5F at 0.7 to 1 x 104 cells/mL. The cell suspension is transferred at a volume of 10 mL to 100-mm dishes. Day 0: The cells at about 70% confluence are trypsinized and suspended in DF5F at 4000 cells/mL. The cell suspension is distributed into each well of 96 -well plates at a volume of 0.05 mL for the transformation assay and the concurrent cel l growth assay (200 cells/well). One plate is prepared for each treatment concentration of transformation assay. Eight wells are prepared for each treatment concentration of concurrent cell growth assay. Day 1: Media containing test chemicals at two times the final concentration are prepared, and 0.05 mL of the preparations are added to the wells without medium change. The plate is tapped to mix media in wells. Day 4: The medium is changed with 0.1 mL of fresh DF5F. Day 7: The medium of transformation assa y is changed with fresh DF5F. The cells for the concurrent growth assay are fixed and processed according to the procedures described above ( II.A.1. 2). Day 10 or 11, and 14: The medium of the transformation assay is changed with fresh DF5F. Day 21: The cel ls are fixed and stained with 5% Giemsa solution for 30 min or more. B. Promotion assay6,7) 1.

For the chemicals that exhibit marked growth enhancement, test concentrations are selected to cover from growth enhancement to little effect on cell growth. Ideally, one doses bellow NOEL , three doses in the range of growth enhancement, and one dose in the range of weak growth inhibition are assessed in the promotion assay, as follows; --------------------- NOEL --- Growth enhancement --- Growth inhibition One doses Three doses One dose For the chemicals that do not induce marked growth enhancement, test concentrations are selected ranging from a dose exhibiting below 50% growth level to that two or three levels lower than the non -effective concentration. Ideally, two doses below NOEL, two doses between NOEL and IC50 and one dose above IC50 are assessed, as follows; ---------------------------------------- NOEL --------------------------------------------- IC50 --------------- ------------------- Two doses Two doses One dose For a chemical which gives the sharp decline of cell growth within a narrow concentration range, one or two more doses above or below the predicted concentrat ion range may be set up as a precaution against the fluctuation of cell response among experiments. For low cytotoxic chemicals , the assay is performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg/mL4,5). One plate for the transformation assay (96 wells), and eight wells f or the concurrent cell growth assay are prepared at each concentration . Each assay of a chemical should include negative and positive control s (when the solvent of the test chemical is 5% water, DMSO control is also necessary as the control of TPA). The co ntrol data cannot be shared among experiments of different chemicals even if they are carried out at the same time. 6 2) Procedure of transformation assay and concurrent cell growth assay Day -7 or -6: The cells are thawed in the same manner as the initiati on assay ( II.A.2. 2). Day -3: The cells are subcultured in the same manner as the initiation assay ( II.A.2. 2). Day 0: The cells are replated in the same manner as the initiation assay ( II.A.2. 2) except that 0.1 mL of the cell suspension are plated (400 cel ls/well). Day 4: Media containing test chemicals at the final concentrations are prepared, and used for medium change (0.1 mL/well) . Day 7: The medium of transformation assay is changed with a media containing a test chemical. The cells for the concurrent growth assay are fixed and processed according to the procedures described above ( II.A.2. 2). Day 10 or 11: The medium of transformation assay is changed with a media containing a test chemical. Day 14: The medium is changed with 0.1 mL of fresh DF5F. Day 21: The cells are fixed and stained in the same manner as the initiation assay ( II.A.2. 2). C. Medium change The medium is removed by inverting the plates, i.e. paper towels or diapers are laid to catch the medium and the plates are swing and shake three t imes to drain off the medium completely. The medium is gently dispensed to the cells from tips which are touched to the upper walls of the wells. D. Cell fixation The cells are fixed with direct addition of 0.01 mL of formalin to the culture medium, or wi th 10 % formalin or methanol after the medium is removed. After 30 min or more (when fixed with formalin) or 10 min or more (when fixed with methanol), the cells are washed with tap water and dried. E. Focus count Transformed foci are featured by the foll owing morphological characteristics; (a) more than 100 cells, (b) spindle -shaped cells different from the contact -inhibited monolayer cells (spindle -shaped), (c) deep basophilic staining (basophilic), (d) random orientation of cells at the edge of foci (cr iss-cross), (e) dense multilayering of cells (piling up) and (f) invasive growth into the monolayer of surrounding contact -inhibited cells. There are transformed foci not prominent in some of these characteristics. The number of wells having transformed fo ci is recorded for each plate: a well having one focus is counted as one and a well having two or more foci is also counted as one. Transformed foci are counted on the bottom surface but not on the wall of a well. F. Test acceptance of criteria The initia tion or promotion assay is repeated independently, as needed, to satisfy acceptance criteria. 1. Concurrent cell growth assay At least should exist one concentration near NOEL which gives 80 -120% cell growth compared to solvent/vehicle control. When contamination or technical problems are observed, four undamaged wells are necessary at the minimum for each concentration . 2. Transformation assay 1) Initiation assay and promotion assay If the cells are killed and/or not confluent at the end of trans formation assay, the concentration is not valid and excluded from focus -counting, statistical analysis and judgment , and \"toxic ity\" is written in the data sheet. 7 When contamination or technical problems are observed, if the number of damaged wells are 7 or more the concentration is not valid and excluded from focus -counting, statistical analysis and judgment , and \"contamination \", \"accident \", \"technical error \" and so on are written in the data sheet. 2) Initiation assay Negative control: The number of wells having transformed foci should be 10 wells/plate or less . Positive control: The number of wells having transformed foci should be 30 wells/plate or more . Concentrations: F our valid concentrations are necessary at the minimum to accept the trans formation assay for evaluating a chemical: a t least one concentration near the NOEL and three concentrations in the range between the NOEL and IC90 . 3) Promotion assay Negative control: The number of wells having transformed foci should be 20 wells/plat e or less . Positive control: The number of wells having transformed foci should be 30 wells/plate or more . Furthermore, the proportion of wells having transformed foci should be significantly increased in the positive control plate compared to the solve nt control plate (chi -square test, p<0.05). Concentrations: F our valid concentrations are necessary at the minimum to accept the transformation assay for evaluating a chemical: a t least one concentration near the NOEL and two concentrations in the range of growth enhancement when the chemical enhances cell growth (increase cell density). The durations of chemical exposure to the cells are different between the cell growth assay and the transformation assay. Then chemical toxicity is sometimes accumulated during 10 days in the promotion assay and plates may be lost because of chemical toxicity . In such cases four valid plate s are also requested in the concentration range where cells are not killed and confluent at the end of transformation assay . It may be required to repeat the assay in a lower concentration range. (The parts unde rlined are tentative and may be shifted with change in the batch es of FBS from Moregate , Lot no. 7825120 to G IBCO , Lot no. 1391481 .) G. Three independent control data To evaluate interlaboratory and intralaboratory variability , three independent data , at least, of positive and negative controls are needed in each laboratory. Independent data mean data obtained from the cells thawed on different days. An example of three independe nt control data by plating cells on different days ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lab Chemicals for each lab Chemicals evaluated at the same time Thawing frozen cells ---------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- Lab-A a, b, c , d, e, f a, b 1 Dec 2008 c, d 8 Dec 2008 e, f 15 Dec 2008 Lab-B a, b, c, d, e, f a 8 Dec 2008 b, c 25 Dec 2008 d, e, f 5 Jan 2009 Lab-C a, b, c, d, e, f a, b 4 Dec 2008 c, d, e 18 Dec 2008 8 f, (repeated a) 8 Jan 2009 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- H. Statistical analysis The proportion of wells with transformed foci in the plate treated with a test chemic al at each concentration is compared with that in the solvent/vehicle control plate by chi -square test (p<0.05) . For multiplicity, t he number of concentrations that satisfy \"Test acceptance criteria \" (II.F) is considered by Bonferroni method . H. Judgment The result is considered positive if significant increase s in the proportion of wells with transformed foci are observed at two serial concentrations when analyzed by chi -square test (p<0.05, multiple comparison analysis). If the increase is significant at only one concentration , the transformation assay should be repeated in a narrower concentration range and judged based on the repeated assay . Judgment of results ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Results -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ Judg ment 1st experiment Repeated experiment ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------- Significant at two and more serial concentrations - Positive Significant at one concentration No significant concentration Negative Significant at one or more concentrations Positive No significant concentration - Negative ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------- The final judgment is based on a comprehensive evaluation that also takes into account the biological significance. All results are entered in the data sheet given and sent to Arai ( arai.s@fdsc.or.jp, Hadano Research Institute). Transformation plates must be stored and archived in each lab until the termination of validation study . III. References (1) K. Sasaki, H. Mizusawa and M.
