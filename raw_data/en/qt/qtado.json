Naturopathic treatments are effective in treating a wide variety of conditions. Fatigue, trouble sleeping, aches and pains, skin rashes, indigestion or stomach discomforts are all symptoms of an underlying cause. Rather than just suppressing symptoms, our goal is to identify the underlying cause of illness and support the body's natural healing process. Who would benefit from Naturopathic medicine: - You want to live a healthier and more fulfilling life. - You have health problems and want alternative support alongside your current medications. - You get sick all the time and want to feel better and increase your immune system. - You don't feel well and have symptoms, but all your labs are normal and your doctor tells you there's nothing wrong with you. - You are concerned that the side effects of your drugs may be worse than the disease. - You have tried numerous nutritional supplements without noticeable results. - You are looking for a natural health expert that will answer your questions and work with you to restore your health. The principles of Naturopathic Medicine are used as a guide to promote health and well-being: First Do No Harm - Your health is our main priority, so medicines and therapies that have the least side effects are used. Identify and Treat the Cause - Symptoms are messages from the body that there is an imbalance in the body. We teach you to understand what these symptoms mean and address the underlying cause of the problem. The Healing Power of Nature - Our bodies have a powerful innate ability to heal itself. Our goal is to help you nurture this innate self-healing by teaching you what diet, nutrients, herbs, or lifestyle practices can help support your body's healing. Treat the Whole Person - Each person is seen as an integrated whole, consisting of body, mind, and spirit. Treatments are customized to fit each person's needs taking into consideration the whole person and the factors that can influence health- genetics, environment, emotional and social factors, and diet and lifestyle. Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining optimal health. We want to empower you with tools and knowledge of healthy living practices and preventive medicine so you can take care of your health. Prevention - evaluate for risk factors that can make one more susceptible to disease and address them. When we keep ourselves healthy, we're less likely to need treatment for future illness.
