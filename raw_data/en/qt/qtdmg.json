While common, stress can have severe effects on your health. It can impair your ability to make good decisions, sleep, maintain a healthy weight, and recover from illness. It can even disrupt your hormones and accelerate the aging process. Fortunately, many botanicals can support your body as it healthily responds to stress.* The Three Phases of Stress There are three phases of stress. The first two phases are acute, meaning short-lived, while the third phase is chronic, meaning persisting over a prolonged period. - Acute, non-recurring, and mild response: In this phase, you may suffer from stress for a short time, but it does not incapacitate you. You need support, but you can function normally. - Acute, recurring, and poor recovery: In the second phase, your stress is recurring, and you may take longer to recover. Your sleep can become affected, and you may feel nervous and uneasy. If this is the case, ask your doctor for lab tests to evaluate your cortisol levels, a stress hormone. - Chronic, prominent symptoms and poor recovery: By the third stage, your stress has become chronic. Your symptoms are prominent, and it takes a long time to recover because your adrenal glands are most likely exhausted. You may also have unusual sleep patterns, sleep apnea, and excessive fatigue. Chronic stress can also impair your short-term memory. Since chronic stress can lead to serious diseases \u2014 including heart disease and depression \u2014 it is best to consult your healthcare practitioner on coping methods if you are continually overwhelmed and debilitated. However, everyone suffers from acute stress (both phase 1 and phase 2) now and again. 4 Botanicals to Support Stress Management For centuries, people worldwide have used herbal remedies as natural alternatives to manage feelings of stress and anxiety.
