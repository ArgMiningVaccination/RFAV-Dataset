Because elliptic curve cryptography offers the same level of security than, for example, RSA with considerably shorter keys, it has replaced traditional public key cryptosystems, especially, in environments where short keys are important. Public-key cryptosystems are computationally demanding and, hence, the fact that elliptic curve cryptography has been shown to be faster than traditional public-key cryptosystems is of great importance. Elliptic Curve Cryptographic (ECC) schemes are public-key mechanisms that provide the same functionality as RSA schemes. However, their security is based on the hardness of a different problem, namely the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithmic Problem (ECDLP). Most of the products and standards that use public-key cryptography for encryption and digital signatures use RSA schemes. The competing system to RSA is elliptic curve cryptography. The principal attraction of elliptic curve cryptography compared to RSA is that it offers equal security for a smaller key-size. Auxiliary Result In this section we mention some auxiliary results which are necessary to prove the main result. For a prime number p, Let Zp[i] = {a + bi: a,bZp where i2 = -1} be a ring having p2 elements. We have the following assertion: Lemma 1: An element a + ib is invertible in Zp[i] if only if a2 + p) [3]. Proof: Let a + ib be invertible then there exists an element c + id in Zp[i] such that (a ib)( ) 1 c id + += (1) which implies (ac-bd) + i(bc + ad) = 1 i.e. ac-bd = 1and bc + ad = 0. In (1) take the conjugate (a-ib)(c-id) = 1 (2)Multiply (1) and (2), we get (a ib)(a ib)( )(c id) 1 c id + + = We deduce 220(mod p) ab+ , so 220(mod p) Let p be a prime number. Then Zp[i] is field iff p3 (mod 4) [4]. Proof: Assume that Zp[i] is not field if p3(mod 4) then an element a + biZp[i], which is not invertible. By Lemma 1 we have a2 + b2 = 0(mod p). So a2 + b2 = k, where kZ. We can write a = ta1, b = tb1 with g.c.d (a1,b1) = 1. Suppose a is not divisible by p then p does not divide t but p divides a12 + b12. Using proposition 1 [5], we obtain a12 + b12 = kp. We have p3 (mod 4). Suppose p = 2, we can write 12 + 12 = 0(mod 2) then 1 + i is not invertible. Assume p = 1, then an element cZp[i] such that 1 21p c because cp-1 = 1 this implies that 1 21p c = and hence (ck)2 = c2k = -1. So 12 + (ck)2 = 1-1 = 0. We deduce that ck + I is not invertible. This completes the proof of the result.

The principal attraction of ECC compared to RSA is that it offers equal security for a smaller key size. The present paper includes the study of two elliptic curve E a,b and Ea,-b defined over the ring Zp[i] where i2 = -1. After showing isomorphism between Ea,b and Ea,-b. We define a composition operation (in the form of a mapping) on their union set. Then we have discussed our proposed cryptographic schemes based on the elliptic curve E = E a,bEa,-b. We also illustrate the coding of points over E, secret key exchange and encryption/decryption methods based on above said elliptic curve. Since our proposed scheme are based on elliptic curve of the particular type therefore the proposed schemes provides a highest strength-per-bit of any cryptosystem known today with smaller key size resulting in faster computations, lower power assumption and memory. Another advantage is that authentication protocols based on ECC are secure enough even if a small key size is used.

To show that e is the identity element with respect to binary operation . Let x in E. If xG1 then xe = x*e = e*x = ex = x, Because xG1 and e is the unit element of (G1,*).

Elliptic curve over the Field Zp[i] Let Ea,b,Ea,-b be two elliptic curve over the field Zp[i], where p is a prime number such that p = 3(mod 4), defined by 23 ,{( , ) : } {O}abE x y y x ax b= =+ + and 23 ,b {( , ) : } {O}aE x y y x ax b= = + Where O is the point at infinity [11-14]. Corollary 1: If b0 then Proof: Let (x,y)Ea,bEa,-b, y2 x3 + ax + b and y2 = x3 + ax-b this implies that b = -b i.e. b = 0 which is a contradiction. Hence Ea,bEa,-b = {O}. Main Result Theorem 2 Let f be a mapping from Ea,b to Ea,-b defined by F(x,y) = (-x,iy) and f(O) = 0Then f is a bijection.Proof: First we show that f is well defined.Let (x,y)E a,b then y2 = x3 + ax -y2 = -x3-ax-b i.e. (iy)2 = (-x)3 + a(-x)-b therefore (-x,iy)Ea,b Hence f is well defined.f is one-one: Let (x 1,y1),(x2,y2)Ea,b such that 11 2 2(, ) (, )fxy fx y = 0 0 11( ,i ) ( ,i )xy xy= This implies (x,y)Ea,-b. y2 = x3 + ax-b or -y2 = -x3-ax + b This implies that because = (-x)3 + a(-x)-b and f(- x,iy) = (x,y) Thus, f is onto. f is homomorphism: Let (x1,y1),(x2,y2)Ea,b there is three cases arises: Case 1: When x1x2 We have 2 11 2 2 , 1 2 , 2 3 )ab ab fx y f x x x x y + = 2 , 1 2 ,2 3 2 ( ,i ( ) )ab ab x x x x iy = ++ where 21 , 21abyy xx= and 2 3 , 12 ab x xx= again 11 2 2 1 1 2 2(( , y )) ((x , )) ( ,i ) , )f x f y x y iy + = + 2 , 1 2, 2 4 2( ,( ))ab ab x x x x iy = ++ where 21 , 21abiy iy xx=+ and 4 , 12 ab x xx = ++ . It is obvious that 22 ,,ab a b = this implies that22 ,,ab a b = and 34xx= Therefore 1 1 22 1 1 22(( 2: When x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 2 11 2 2 , 1 , ) )ab ab fx y f x x x y + = 2 , 1 ,1 3 1 ( 2 ,i ( ) )ab ab x x x iy = + where 2 1 , 13 2abx y= and 2 3 ,1 2ab xx= again 11 2 2 1 1 2 2(( y )) ((x , )) ( ,i ) , )f x f y x y iy + = + 2 , 1, 1 4 1( 2, ( ) )ab ab x x x iy = + where 2 1 , 13( ) 2abx y= and 2 4 , 12 ab x xx = ++ . It is evident that 2 1 ,, 13 2a b abxiiy= = then, 22 ,,ab a b = and x3 = -x4. Therefore, 1 1 22 1 1 3: When x1 = x2 and y1 = -y2 We have 11 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1(( , y )) x y iy iy x iy O + = + = + = and 11 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1(( , y )) x y iy iy x iy O + = + = + = Thus 1 1 22 1 1 22(( , y )) ((x , )) (( , ))fx f y fx y y += + Therefore, in either case f is a homomorphism. Hence f is a bijection.

Then is an internal composition law, commutative with identity element O and all elements in E are invertible. Proof: Keeping in view the result of theorem 1, corollary 1, and theorem 2, it is evident that is an internal composition law, commutative with identity element O and all elements in E are invertible. Corollary 3: If E a,b and Ea,-b are isomorphic groups i.e. they are both abstractly identical of groups then Card(E) = 2Card(Ea,b)-1. Proof: Since is isomorphic to implies Card(Ea,b) = Card(Ea,-b) Now, E = Ea,bEa,-b This implies that = Card(Ea,b) + Card(Ea,-b)-Card(Ea,bEa,-b) Therefore, Card(E) = 2Card(Ea,b)-1. Cryptographic Applications In this section we shall illustrate our proposed methods for coding of points on Elliptic Curve, then exchange of secret key and finally use them for encryption/decryption. Coding of element on elliptic curve It is described with the help of illustration-1 and illustration-2. Illustration 1: For p = 3, a = 1 and b = 1, Then codes of elements of E = Ea,bEa,-b are given by E = {00100,00101,00201,10001,10101,102 01,20001,01101,01201,11001,11101,11201,21001,02101,02201,12001,1 2101,12201,22001} Since, 1,1{( , E xy y x x= = ++ and 23 2 3i,1 i {( , ) : (2 3 ) 1 } {O} E xy y x ix i++ = = + + (2 + i,0), (1 + 2i,1), (1 + 2i,2), (2 + i,0)}{O}. Coding of element E = E1,1E1,-1 are described as follow Let P = [x0 + x1i;y0 + y1i;z], where xj,yjZ3 for j = 0 or 1 and z = 0 or 1. Then coding method is given by x0x1y0y1 which produces the following codes E={00100,00101,00201,10001,10101,10201,20001,01101,01201,110 01,11101,11201,21001,02101,02201,12001,12101,12201,22001} Illustration 2: For p = 7,a = 2 + 3i and b = 1 + i. The coding of points of Ea,bEa,-b can be described as 23 2 3i,1 i {( , ) : (2 3 ) 1 } {O} E xy y x ix i++ = = + + ++ 23 2 3i, (1 ) {( , ) : (2 3 ) (1 )} {O}i E xy y x ix i+ + = = + + + Let P = [x0 + x1i; y0 + y1i; z], where xj,yjZ7 for j = 0 or 1 and z = 0 or 1. Then coding method is given by x0x1y0y1z, which produces the us to encrypt and decrypt any message of any length. Exchange of secret key 1. For a publically integer p, and an elliptic curve E(Zp[i]) let PE(Zp[i]) of order n. 2. By P generate a subgroup and denoted it by GP= . Which is used to encrypt the message m. Now, key exchange between Alice and Bob can be described as follows: 3. Alice chooses a random number 0NAn-1, computes K = NAP and sends it to Bob. 4. Bob chooses a random number 0NBn-1, computes K = NBP and sends it to Alice. 5. Alice computes NAK = NA.NBP. 6. Bob computes NB.K = NB.NAP. 7. Alice and Bob are agree with a point S = NA.NBP, choose the binary code of point S as a private key, which transformed on the decimal code <<S >>. Remark: With the secret key S such as the decimal code of point S Alice and Bob can encrypt and decrypt the message (m). Illustration 3: Let E3,45 = {(x,y): y2 = x3 + 3x-45}{O} are two elliptic curve defined over the same field Z8831[i] having 88312 element, where 8831 be a prime number such that 88313(mod 4) and a point P = (4,11)Z8831[i] of order 4427. (1) Alice choose a random number NA = 12, compute K = 12(4,11) = (814,5822) and sends it to Bob. (2) Bob chooses a random number NB = 23 and comput K = 23(4,11) = (3069,3265) and sends to it Alice. (3) Alice computes NAK = 12.(3069,3265) = (3076,265). (4) Bob computes NB.K = 23.(814,5822) = (3076,265). (5) Alice and Bob are agree with a point S = (3076,265), choose the binary code of point S as a private key, which transformed on the decimal code <<30760000265000001>>. ECC key generation phase Now, exchange of secret key involves the following steps: 1. Encode the message m on the point Pm. 2. Choose a random number k, compute Q = k.Pm and calculate Pb = S.Q. 3. Public key is (a,b,p,P,Pb,Q). 4. Private key is (NA,NB,k,S). ECC encryption phase To encrypt Pm, a user choose an integer <<r>> at random and sends the point (r.Q,Pm + r.Pb). This operation is shown in Figure 1.Citation: Kumar M, Gupta P (2016) Cryptographic Schemes based on Elliptic Curves over the Ring Zp[i]. J Appl Computat Math 5: 288. doi:10.4172/2168- 9679.1000 288 Page 4 of 5 Volume 5 Issue 1 1000288J Appl Computat Math ISSN: ECC decryption phase Decryption of the message is done by multiplying the first component of the received point the secret key <<S>> and subtract it from the second component: (Pm + r.Pb)-S.(r.Q) = Pm + r.SQ-S.r.Q = Pm This operation is shown in Figure 2. Illustration 4: The E3,45 = {(x,y): y2 = x3 + 3x-45}{O} are two elliptic curve defined over the same field Z8831[i] having 88312 element where 8831 be a prime number such that 88313(mod 4) and a point P = (4,11)Z8831[i] of order 4427. Alice's message is point Pm = (5,1743). Bob has chosen his secret random number k = 3 and computed Q = k.Pm = 3.(5,1743) = (445,3115) and calculated Pb = S.Q = 30760000265000001(445,3115) = (7093,2868) Bob publish the point. Alice chooses the random number r = 8 and compute r.Q = 8.(445,3115) = (7966,6354) and Pm + r.Pb = + 8.(7093,2868) = (5011,2629) Alice sends (7966,6354) and (5011,2629) to Bob, who multiplies the first of these point by S.(r.Q) = 30650000265000001.(7966,6354) = (6317,6201). Bob then subtracts the result from the last point Alice sends him. Note that he subtracts by adding the point with the second coordinate negated: .P S'.(r.Q) (5011, 2629) (6317,6201) (5,1743)mb m Pr P + = = = Bob has therefore received Alice's message.
