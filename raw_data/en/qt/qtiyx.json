(\"Amarin\") appeals the decision of the International Trade Commission(\"Commission\"), which determined not to institute aninvestigation and, accordingly, dismissed Amarin'scomplaint. The Commission held that Amarin'scomplaint failed to allege a cognizable claim based onan unfair method of competition or unfair act under 19U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a)(1)(A). We affirm.App. 4 I Amarin markets Vascepa\u00ae capsules, a prescription drug that consists of 1 gram of eicosapentaenoic acid (the omega-3 acid commonly known as \"EPA\") in a 1-gram capsule. The EPA in Vascepa\u00ae is in ethyl esterform and is synthetically produced from fish oil.Amarin obtained approval from the Food and DrugAdministration (\"FDA\") to market and sell Vascepa\u00ae,which is designed to reduce triglyceride levels in adultpatients hypertriglyceridemia. Vascepa\u00ae ethyl product sold in theUnited States as an FDA-approved drug. On August 30, 2017, Amarin filed under oath a complaint alleging violatio ns under \u00a7 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. J.A. 4-114 (Compl.). The complaint alleges that certain companies were falselylabeling and deceptively advertising their importedsynthetically produced omega-3 products as (or for usein) \"dietary supplements,\" where the products areactually \"new drugs\" as de fined in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") that have not been approved forsale or use in the United States. J.A. 9 \u00b6 1. Specifically, Amarin articulated two claims in its complaint: (1) that the importation and sale of thearticles is an unfair act or unfair method of competitionunder \u00a7 337 because it violates \u00a7 \u00b6\u00b6 53-105; importation of the articles violates the TariffAct \"based upon the standards set forth in the FDCA,\"see J.A. 56 \u00b6 106. By way of relief, Amarin's complaint seeks an order under \u00a7 337(d) that would excludesynthetically produced omega-3 products from entryApp. 5 into the United States, as well as a cease-and-desist order under \u00a7 337(f) to prohibit the proposedrespondents from importing, using, omeg a-3 products. J.A. 112-13 \u00b6\u00b6 D-F. After Amarin filed its complaint, the FDA submitted a letter urging the Commission not toinstitute an investigation and instead to dismissAmarin's complaint. J.A. 627-37. In the FDA's view,the FDCA prohibits private enforcement actions,including unfair trade practice claims that seek toenforce the FDCA. J.A. 630. The FDA contended that the FDCA precludes any claim that would \"require[]the Commission to directly a pply, enforce, or interpret the FDCA.\" J.A. 631. The FDA further contended thatthe Commission should decline to institute aninvestigation based on princi ples of comity to the FDA. J.A. 629. On October 27, 2017, the Commission issued its decision declining to institute an investigation anddismissing the complaint. J.A. 1-3. The Commissionreasoned that precluded Id.; see POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca- Cola Co. , 573 U.S. 102, 109 (2014) (\"Private parties may not bring [FDCA] enforcement suits.\" (citing 21U.S.C. \u00a7 337)). In December 2017, Amarin filed in this court a petition for review and, separately, a petition for a writof mandamus. We consolidated the two cases. RoyalDSM NV, DSM Marine Lipids Peru S.A.C., DSMNutritional Products LLC, and Pharmavite LLC(collectively, \"DSM\"); and Nordic Natural, Inc. andApp. 6 Nordic Pharma, Inc. (collectively, \"Nordic\") (both, \"the Intervenors\") intervened in the appeal. ECF Nos. 14,23, 25, 49. II At the outset, we begin by confirming that we have jurisdiction to review the Commission's decision in thiscase. We then address Amarin's argument that theCommission has a mandatory, non-discretionary dutyto institute an investigation when presented with acomplaint under oath. Finally , we address whether the Commission correctly determined that Amarin'sallegations are precluded by the FDCA. A Amarin contends that we have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(6), but the Intervenors andthe Commission disagree. Our jurisdictional statute gives this court exclusive jurisdiction \"to review the final determinations of theUnited States Internationa l Trade Commission relating to unfair practices in import trade, made under section337 of the Tariff Act of 127 F.3d 1057, 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The Intervenors and the Commission argue that the only \"final determinations\" subject to appellate revieware those listed in \u00a7 Intervenors' Br. 18-19;Commission's Br. 52-56. And these decisions, accordingApp. 7 to the Intervenors, can only be made \"as a result of an investigation.\" Intervenors' Br. 19. The question as to our jurisdiction in this case is resolved by our decision in Amgen Inc. v. ITC , 902 F.2d 1532 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In Amgen , the complainant alleged that a company violated \u00a7 337 by importing articles made by a patented process. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a)(1)(B)(ii). The Commission instituted aninvestigation. Amgen , 902 at 1534. Ultimately, however, the Commission dismissed the complaintbecause the patent at issue did not contain a processclaim, which the Commission considered to be ajurisdictional prerequisite for an investigation under\u00a7 1337(a)(1)(B)(ii). Id. at 1535. On appeal in Amgen , we first addressed our under 28 U.S.C. requiring a 'final determinationdecision on the merits , excluding or refusing to exclude articles from entry' under section 1337(d), (e), (f) or (g).\"Id. (quoting Block v. ITC , 777 F.2d 1568, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). But instead of adopting the rigid approach Intervenors argue for in this case, we concluded thatthe Commission's decision was \"intrinsically a finaldetermination, i.e., a determination on the merits ,\" thus making it appealable under \u00a7 1295(a)(6). Id. (emphasis in original). In reaching that conclusion, we carefully explained the difference between our holding there and ourearlier holding in Block , a case in which we held that a Commission order was not a final determination. In Block , the Commission initiated an investigation on itsApp. 8 own motion. The Commission later terminated that investigation after the patent at issue was amendedduring reexamination. See id. As we explained in Amgen , \"nothing in the termination Order [in Block ] prejudiced the Commission or any private party in afuture proceeding.\" Id. Unlike in Block , however, the Commission order in Amgen \"clearly reach[ed] the merits of [the] complaint and determinatively decide[d][the complainant's] right to proceed in a section 1337action.\" Id. We further explained that \"any future action brought by [the complainant] would necessarilyraise the same issue, and would presumably bedismissed for the same reason.\" Id. at 1536. As in Amgen , the Commission's decision not to institute in this case is \"intrinsically a finaldetermination, i.e., a determination on the merits .\" See id. at 1535 (emphasis in original). Here, the Commission declined to institute an investigationbecause the claims were precluded by the FDCA and,therefore, the complaint failed to state a cognizableclaim under \u00a7 337. See J.A 1-3. As in Amgen action.\" See id.; see also Import Motors, Ltd., Inc. v. ITC , 530 F.2d 940, 946-47 (CCPA 1976) (analyzing the right to appeal aCommission order by asking whether the order \"hasthe operative effect of a 'final determination undersubsection (d) or (e)'\" and no ting that \"[s]ubstance, not form, must control\"). Any future complaint brought byAmarin alleging these same facts \"would necessarilyraise the same issue\" and \"would presumably bedismissed for the same reason\"\u2014i.e., for lack of aApp. 9 private right of action to enforce the FDCA. See Amgen , 902 F.2d at 1536.1 In other words, as discussed below, as long as Amarin's complaint is based on proving violations of the FDCA (at least where the FDA has not provided guidance as to whether the articles violate theFDCA), Amarin's claims will be precluded. TheCommission's decision is ther efore intrinsically a final determination that effectively denies Amarin's requestfor relief under \u00a7 337(d) and (f). 2 We are unpersuaded by the Intervenors' and the Commission's argument that a final determination can 1 The Commission's decision to di smiss the complaint presented a pure question of law regarding FDCA preclusion. Based on that holding, Amarin was in no way free to file another complaint onthe same grounds, as the dissent suggests. See Dissent at 12. Our recognition of the possibility that Amarin's complaint may not beprecluded in the future, under a different set of facts (i.e., whereFDA has provided guidance as to whether these particular articles violate the FDCA) does not make the Commission's determination \"without prejudice.\" Indeed, that future possibility would not haveexisted but for our ability to re view and narrow the Commission's even broader preclusion holding through this appeal. 2 The dissent's attempt to charac terize the Commission's decision in this case as an order under \u00a7 1337(b), rather than as effectivelybeing an order under \u00a7 1337(d) or (e), cannot be reconciled withAmgen . Amgen also did not involve a formal order under \u00a7 1337(d), (e), (f), or (g). Regardless, and as the dissent recognizes, see Dissent at 11-12, we held in Amgen that the substance of the Commission's analysis meant that it \"should have dismissed on themerits.\" 902 F.2d at 1536. But a dismissal on the merits would stillnot produce a formal order under \u00a7 1337(d), (e), (f), or (g). Instead, as our predecessor court emphasized in Import Motors , what matters is that the order \"ha[s] the same operative effect, . . . as afinal determination under subsecti ons (d) and (e). Substance, not form, must control.\" 530 F.2d at 945-46.App. 10 be made only after institution. See Intervenors' Br. 3; Commission's Br. 52. Although the decision in Amgen occurred after institution, the court's reasoning in that case was not based on that procedural detail. See Amgen , 902 F.2d at 1535. Instead, the court's analysis focused on the operative effect of the Commissiondecision. See id.; Import Motors, 530 F.2d at 946-47 (\"Substance, not form, must control.\"). The dissent makes essentially the same argument, contending that a \"final determination\" can exist onlyafter institution. Dissent at 4-5, 7, 11. But thisapproach elevates form over substance. The dissent'sapproach would require the Commission to formallyinstitute an investigation\u2014which requires publicationof notice in the Federal Register\u2014just long enough forthe Commission to issue the same dismissal order italready issued in this case. There is no indication fromthe statutory text or context that Congress intendedsuch rigid formality. Because the Commission's decision is intrinsically a final determination on the merits that has theoperative effect of denying Amarin's request for reliefunder \u00a7 337(d) and (f), the decision is a \"finaldetermination\" under \u00a7 337(c). We therefore havejurisdiction to review that decision under 28 U.S.C.\u00a7 1295(a)(6). Having found our jurisdiction proper, we need not address Amarin's alternative argument forApp. 11 jurisdiction\u2014that we have authority to compel agency action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1).3 B We next address Amarin's argument that the Commission had a mandatory duty to institute aninvestigation in this case. Amarin contends that 19U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(b)(1) imposes a non-discretionary duty on the Commission to institute an investigation whenpresented with a complaint under oath. See \u00a7 1337(b)(1) (\"The Commission shall investigate anyalleged violation of this section on complaint underoath or upon its initiative.\"). The relevant statutory scheme contemplates certain scenarios in which the Commission need not institutean investigation. See \u00a7 1337(b)(3) (stating, for example, that the Commission \"may institute\" under specifiedcircumstances); see also \u00a7 1330(d)(5) (stating that an investigation shall occur if \"one-half of the number ofcommissioners voting agree that the investigationshould be made\"). The Commission Rules alsocontemplate non-institution. Rule 210.10 provides that 3 It is unclear whether Amarin is also arguing that we may review the decision via mandamus aside from \u00a7 706(1). Indeed, Amarin states that \"[t]he judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act have effectively displaced the need for courts to issue writs of mandamus when aske d to review agency decisions.\" Appellant's Br. 26 (emphasis added). Regardless, to the extentAmarin contends that some other basis for mandamus review iswarranted, Amarin has failed to explain how it would satisfy thetraditional mandamus requirements. See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C. , 542 U.S. 367, 380-81 ( 2004) (listing the three requirements that must be satisfied before a writ may issue).App. 12 \"[t]he Commission shall determine whether the complaint is properly filed and whether an investigation should be instituted on the basis of the complaint.\" 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(a)(1) (emphases added).That Rule further explains that \"[i]f the Commissiondetermines not to institute an investigation on thebasis of the complaint, the complaint shall bedismissed.\" 19 210.10(c); see also . . . [t]he Commission shallexamine the complaint for sufficiency and compliancewith the applicable sections of this chapter.\"). The question remains, th en, in what circumstances may the Commission decline to institute aninvestigation? Our precedent recognizes at least onesuch circumstance. See Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. v. ITC, 659 F.2d 1038 (CCPA 1981). In Syntex , our predecessor court held that the Commission wascorrect to dismiss a complaint without instituting aninvestigation where the complaint containedinsufficient factual alle gations to support a monopolization or conspiracy claim. Id. at 1044. The court framed the issue in that case as whether thecomplaint was a \"'complaint' within the meaning ofsection 337.\" Id. at 1041. Noting the absence of a definition of \"complaint,\" the court recognized that acomplaint must comply with then-Commission Rule210.20, which set forth requirements for a complaintunder \u00a7 337, including a requirement that thecomplaint include a statement of the facts constitutingthe alleged acts of monopolization and conspiracy. Id.App. 13 at 1042.4 The court explained that its disposition was based on the complaint's failure to comply with the requirements set forth in that Commission Rule. Although Amarin appears to raise a broader argument regarding whether the Commission hasdiscretion generally not to institute an investigation, we need not address that question here. Instead, wesimply hold, consistent with Syntex , that the Commission may decline to institute an investigationwhere a complaint fails to state a cognizable claimunder \u00a7 337. The facts alleged as the basis for Amarin's complaint demonstrate that Amarin's allegations arebased entirely on violations of the FDCA. As we explainbelow, claims based on such allegations are precludedby the FDCA, at least where the FDA has not yetprovided guidance as to whether violations of theFDCA have occurred. Thus, under the facts of this case, where Amarin's complaint fails to state a cognizableclaim for relief, the Commission did not err in itsdecision not to institute. C We next address the Commission's holding that Amarin's complaint \"does not allege an unfair methodof competition or unfair ac t cognizable under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a)(1)(A), as required by the J.A. 1. The Commission explainedthat \"the Lanham Act allegations in this case are 4 The Commission Rule at issue in Syntex has since been re- codified as Commission Rule 210.12.App. 14 precluded by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,\" and that \"the Food and Drug Administration is chargedwith the administration of the FDCA.\" J.A. 1. Asexplained below, we agree. As relevant here, the FDCA authorizes the FDA to regulate drugs and dietary supplements. Introducing a\"new drug,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p), into interstatecommerce requires FDA approval, id. \u00a7 355(a). Dietary supplements, however, do not require pre-marketapproval. The FDCA provides the United States with \"nearly exclusive enforcement authority.\" POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. (2014); see also \u00a7 337(a) (\"Except as pr ovided in subsection (b), all such proceedings for the enforcement, or to restrainviolations, of this chapter shall be by and in the nameof the United States.\"); Buckman Co. n.4 (2001) (\"The FDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Governmentrather than private litigants who are authorized to filesuit for noncompliance with the medical deviceprovisions . . . .\"). Private parties may not bring suits toenforce the FDCA. POM Wonderful, 573 U.S. at 109 (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337) . Given the lack of a private right to enforce the FDCA, other circuit courts have grappled with theextent to which private parties' claims under \u00a7 43(a) ofthe Lanham Act are PhotoMedex, Inc. v. Irwin , 601 F.3d 919 Cir. Alpharma, Inc. v. Pennfield Oil Co. , 411 F.3d 934 (8th Cir. 2005); cf. Sandoz Pharm. Corp. v. Richardson- Vicks, Inc., 902 F.2d 222 (3d Cir. 1990). App. 15 For example, in PhotoMedex , the Ninth Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of a defendant as to a Lanham Act false advertising claim based on allegations that the defendant misrepresentedthat its product had received FDA clearance. 601 F.3dat 922. That case involved the FDCA's 510(k) clearanceprocess, and the court focuse d heavily on the details of that statutory scheme in reaching its holding. In short,the defendant had received 510(k) clearance for itsearlier device, but the plaintiff argued that based onsignificant changes to the device, the defendant shouldhave made a new 510(k) submission to obtain market clearance for the updated product. Id. at 926. In reaching its conclusion, the court emphasized that \"[i]tis significant that under the regulatory structureestablished by the FDA for the medical devices at issuein this case, clearance to market a given device did notnecessarily require an affirmative statement ofapproval by the FDA.\" Id. Further, the court explained that even though the FDA had been aware of thealleged need for a new clearance, the FDA had nevertaken the position that the products had not beenproperly cleared. In sum, the court held that \"[b]ecausethe FDCA forbids private rights of action under thatstatute, a private action brought under the LanhamAct may not be pursued when, as here, the claim would require litigation of the alleged underlying FDCAviolation in a circumstance where the FDA has not itself concluded that there was such a violation .\" Id. at 924 (emphasis added). 5 5 The court limited its holding, reasoning that \"we do not suggest that the Lanham Act can never support private party claims involving FDA approval or clearance of drugs or medical devices.\"App. 16 The Eighth Circuit employed similar reasoning in Alpharma . 411 F.3d at 939-41. There, the district court granted a defendant's motion to dismiss a plaintiff's Lanham Act claim that was based on allegedmisrepresentation of the uses for which a drug hadbeen approved. Id. at 935-36. The Eighth Circuit reversed, reasoning that because the FDA had givenguidance on the precise dispute between the parties,the plaintiff's claim in this particular case did notrequire a \"preemptive determination\" of how the FDAwould interpret and enforce its own regulations. Id. at 940; see also PhotoMedex , 601 F.3d at 929 (summarizing Alpharma and noting that, there, \"FDA explicitly made clear that it had not given thedefendant's product the affirmative approval requiredfor expanding its list of permissible uses\" and thus \"theplaintiff could bring a Lanham Act claim based on thedefendant's false statements in its advertisement thatthe uses had been approved\"). In its complaint, Amarin includes two separate bases for its \u00a7 337 claims. First, Amarin alleges thatrespondents' labeling or advertisements about thearticles is false or misleading, in violation of \u00a7 43(a) ofthe Lanham Act, such that importation of those articlesis an \"unfair act\" under \u00a7 337 See J.A. 31-56 \u00b6\u00b6 53-105 (Compl.). This claim is based on the Id. at 924. Giving an example, the co urt stated that if \"it was clear that an affirmative statement of approval by the FDA was required before a given product could be marketed and that nosuch FDA approval had been gran ted, a Lanham Act claim could be pursued for injuries suffered by a competitor as a result of afalse assertion that approval had been granted.\" Id. at 924-25.App. 17 allegation that labeling the products as \"dietary supplements\" is literally false because the products\"cannot meet the definition of 'dietary supplement' inSection FDCA. \" J.A. 33 \u00b6 60 (Compl.). And, the claim is further based on the allegation thatthe products \"are actua lly unapproved J.A. (C ompl.). Amarin's complaint relies on these alleged FDCA violations to support keyelements of its Lanham Act false-advertising claim. See J.A. 55 \u00b6\u00b6 102-03 (applying these allegations to theelements of a false advertising claim). In other words,proving the Lanham Act claim in this case requiresproving violations of the FDCA. The second claim in Amarin's complaint alleges that the respondents' importation and sale of the productsconstitute unfair acts or unfair methods of competitionunder \u00a7 337 based on the standards set forth J.A. 56 \u00b6 106; see J.A. Amarin alleges that the products are\"misbranded drugs in violation of the standards setforth in Section 502 of the FDCA, [21 U.S. C.] \u00a7 352, and adulterated drugs, in of Section 501 of theFDCA, id. \u00a7 351.\" J.A. 57 \u00b6 107. Every allegation supporting this claim rests on an alleged violation ofthe FDCA. In sum, Amarin's two \u00a7 337 claims are based on the same factual allegations\u2014that respondents' productsdo not meet the before us bears much resemblance to PhotoMedex , and we consider the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in that case persuasive. In our case, the alleged violations of \u00a7 337 are based entirely on\u2014andcould not exist without\u2014the FDCA. Because privateparties are prohibited from enforcing the FDCA, thesame concerns expressed in PhotoMedex apply here. See PhotoMedex , 601 F.3d at 924. We note, however, that a major concern of the court in PhotoMedex was that proceeding with the Lanham Act claim would\"require litigation of the alleged underlying FDCAviolation in a circumstance where the FDA has notitself concluded that there was such a violation.\" Id. The court in PhotoMedex appears to have been concerned with adjudicating FDCA violations for thefirst time via a Lanham Act cl aim, rather than via the FDA. See id.; id. at 928 (noting that the court's decision was consistent with other de cisions \"refusing to allow private actions under the Lanham Act premised onenforcement determinations that the FDA and otherregulatory agencies did not themselves make \" (emphasis added)); see also Alpharma , 411 F.3d at 935-37; Sandoz 231 (noting that what the FDCA \"do[es] not create directly, the Lanham Act does notcreate indirectly, at least no t in cases requiring original interpretation of these Ac ts or their accompanying regulations\"). As in PhotoMedex (and unlike in Alpharma ), affirmative FDA approval is not required in the dietarysupplement context. Instead, manufacturers self-police. And as in PhotoMedex (and unlike in Alpharma ), the FDA has not provided guidance as to whether theproducts at issue in this case should be consideredApp. 19 \"new drugs\" that require approval. Given this lack of guidance, we see no need to go further than the courtin PhotoMedex did. We therefore hold that a complainant fails to state a cognizable claim under\u00a7 337 where that claim is based on proving violations of the FDCA and where the FDA has not taken theposition that the articles at issue do, indeed, violate theFDCA. Such claims are precluded by the FDCA. We note that this limited holding is consistent with the Commission's arguments in its briefing, whichindicated that Amarin's claims are precluded at least until the FDA has provided guidance as to whether theproducts at issue are dietary supplements. See, e.g. , Commission's Br. 58 (suggesting that \"Amarin is freeto file a new complaint once the FDA issues sufficientguidance with respect to the accused products suchthat the Commission is not required to interpret theFDCA in the first instance and Amarin's claims areotherwise no longer preclu ded by the FDCA\"). We also note that the United States , as amicus, appears to seek a broader ruling\u2014that all such claims are precludedregardless of whether the FDA has provided guidance. As explained above, we need not address that broaderquestion here, as the FDA has not provided guidance asto whether the products at issue properly qualify as\"dietary supplements.\" Despite Amarin's heavy reliance on POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co. , 573 U.S. 102 (2014), that recent decision does not alter our analysis. There, the plaintiffsued a competitor under \u00a7 43 of the Lanham Act,alleging that the label on one of the defendant'sproducts was deceptive and misleading. Id. at 106. TheApp. 20 product at issue was a juice blend sold with a label featuring the words \"pomegranate blueberry\" moreprominently than the words \"flavored blend of 5 juices.\"Id. at 106, 110. Despite the prominence of the names of those two juices, the product actually contained just0.3% pomegranate juice and 0.2% blueberry juice. Id. at 110. The plaintiff alleged that this labeling (andother features) mislead consumers into thinking thatthe juice blend contained primarily pomegranate andblueberry juices. Id. The issue in the case was whether a private party could bring a Lanham Act claimchallenging a food label as misleading, where that foodlabel was regulated by the FDCA. The Ninth Circuitheld that the plaintiff's Lanham Act claim wasprecluded by the FDCA, which forbids misbranding offood, including by misleading labeling. Id. The Supreme Court reversed, holding instead that theLanham Act claim in that case was not precluded. Amarin views POM Wonderful as rejecting the view that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims. But thisreads POM Wonderful too broadly. Although POM Wonderful held that the FDCA does not categorically preclude a Lanham Act claim based on a product (e.g.,a label) that is regulated by the FDCA, the court didnot open the door to Lanham Act claims that are based on proving FDCA violat ions. The allegations underlying the Lanham Act claim in POM Wonderful did not require proving a violation of the FDCA itself.See id. at 117 (\"But POM seeks to enforce the Lanham Act, not the FDCA or its regu lations.\"). This stands in stark contrast to the allegations in our case, which arebased solely on alleged violations of the FDCA'srequirements.App. 21 Amarin also relies on this court's decision in Allergan, Inc. v. Athena Cosmetics, Inc. , 738 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013). But Allergan was a pre-emption case\u2014not a preclusion case. As the Supreme Court explained in POM Wonderful, \"[i]n pre-emption cases, the question is whether state law is pre-empted by afederal statute, or in some instances, a federal agency action.\" POM Wonderful, 573 U.S. at 111. Meanwhile, in cases where a cause of action under one federalstatute is alleged to be pr ecluded by the provisions of another federal statute, \"the state-federal balance doesnot frame the inquiry,\" and the \"'presumption againstpre-emption' has no force.\" Id. (internal citation omitted). In Allergan , we simply held that the FDCA did not preempt certain state law claims based onviolations of state law requirements that paralleledFDCA requirements. Allergan , 738 F.3d at 1354-56. That analysis has no bearing on this case. In short, although Amarin presents its claims as violations of the Tariff Act, in reality those claimsconstitute an attempt to enforce requirements of theFDCA through the remedies provided under the TariffAct. Because private parties have no such enforcementauthority, Amarin's allegations fail to state acognizable claim for relief. 6 6 Although the Intervenors ar gue that the Commission should receive Chevron deference for its interpretation of \u00a7 337 with respect to the preclusion issue in this case, see Intervenors' Br. 54-68, the Commission does not. The United States, as amicus, also does not argue in favor of Chevron deference.App. 22 III For the foregoing reasons, we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction to review the Commission's decision not to institute an investigation in this case.Exercising that jurisdiction, we hold that theCommission correctly held that Amarin's complaintfails to present a cognizable claim under \u00a7 337. Thedecision is therefore affirmed and the petition formandamus is denied as moot. AFFIRMED W ALLACH , Circuit Judge , dissenting . It is axiomatic that \"the power which [C]ongress possess[es] to create [c]ourts of inferior jurisdiction,necessarily implies the power to limit the jurisdictionof those [c]ourts to particular objects.\" United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 33 (1812); see Lockerty v. Phillips , 319 U.S. 182, 187 (1943) (explaining that Congress may \"withhold[] jurisdiction from [lowercourts] in the exact degrees and character which to Congress may seem proper for the public good\"(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks andcitations omitted)). The statute is clear: Congresslimited our subject-matter jurisdiction \"to review thefinal determinations States 1337 addresses, inter alia, \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of articles . . . into the Section 1337 is partApp. 23 (emphasis added), by defining an ITC \"final determination\" as a determination made \" under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g) of [\u00a7 1337],\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(c) (emphasis added). Although I agree with the majority's conclusion that the ITC did not err in declining to institute aninvestigation into the complaint under \u00a7 1337 J.A. 4-114 (Complaint), I disagree with the majority's approach, for it fails to give due respectto Congress's choice to limit our appellate jurisdiction.As the ITC's decision no t to institute was made pursuant to \u00a7 1337(b), I believe that we lack appellatejurisdiction; however, I would instead exercisemandamus jurisdiction and conclude that Amarin hasnot demonstrated that the \"extraordinary remedy\" ofissuing a writ of mandamus is appropriate. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp. , 485 U.S. 271, 289 (1988). Because I would dismiss Amarin's appeal anddeny its petition for a writ of mandamus, I respectfullydissent. D ISCUSSION I. Congress Limited Our Appellate Jurisdiction Congress conferred upon us exclusive jurisdiction \"to review the final determin ations of the [ITC] relating to unfair practices in import trade, made under[\u00a7 1337].\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(6). Relevant here, of the Tariff Act of 1930 (\"Tariff Act\"). See Pub. L.

Cir. 1997). II. We Lack Appellate Jurisdiction to Review the ITC's Decision Not to Institute an Investigation Amarin filed its Complaint, which alleges, inter alia, that Royal DSM NV et al. (\"Intervenors\") have\"falsely labeled[] pr dietary supplements,\" even though they\"are actually unapproved new drugs under the FederalFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act ('FDCA'),\" 21 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 301 et seq. (2012), thereby violating Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 the standards established by the FDCA,\" J.A. 9 (internalquotation marks omitted). The Commissioners of theITC voted not to institute an investigation, see J.A. 681, and sent a letter to Amarin's counsel notifying it of that decision, J.A. 1-2; see 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(c) (2018) (\"If the [ITC] determines not to institute an investigationon the basis of the complaint, the complaint shall bedismissed, and the complainant and all proposedrespondents will receive written notice of the [ITC]'saction and the reason(s) therefor.\"). The ITC stated it\"has determined not to institute an investigation basedApp. 25 on the [C]omplaint . . . and has dismissed the [C]omplaint.\" J.A. 1. According to the ITC, the \"[C]omplaint does not allege an unfair method ofcompetition or an unfair act cognizable under . . .\u00a7 as required by the rules.\" J.A. 1. The ITC reasoned \"that theLanham Act allegations in this case are precluded bythe [FDCA],\" and that \"the Food and DrugAdministration [('FDA')] is with theadministration of the FDCA.\" J.A. 1. The ITC's Decision Not to Institute is not an appealable final determination. An appealable finaldetermination is an ITC determination made \"undersubsection (d), (e), (f), or (g) of 1337(c). cease- and-desist orders, see id. \u00a7 1337(f)-(g). 2 Amarin contends that the ITC's Decision Not to Institute is afinal determination under either \u00a7 1337(d) or (f). See by the ITC post-initiation of an investigation. Subsection (d) explicitly provides that the ITC'sdetermination to exclude articles will be made \"as aresult of subsection (d) or (e) . . . shall be 2 Section 1337(g) governs determinations rendered pursuant to a default and thereby relates to both exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(g)(1)-(2).App. 26 made on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing\"). Subsection (f) sets forth that the ITC'sdetermination to issue a cease-and-desist order is \"[i]naddition to, or in lieu of, taking action\" pursuant toother statutory provisions that involve an initiatedinvestigation, i.e., taking ac tion \"under subsection (d),\" completed id. \u00a7 1337(f)(1), which covers the ITC's determination to exclude articles made \"during thecourse of an investigation,\" id. \u00a7 1337(e)(1). Here, the ITC neither initiated an investigation, decided whether a violation of \u00a7 1337 occurred, nordetermined whether to issue an exclusion or cease-and-desist order. See J.A. 1-2. In Block v. United States International Trade Commission , we held that the \"ITC's decision to terminate its investigation as 1985); see id. at 1571. The ITC terminated the investigation because, following theU.S. Patent and Trademark Office's reexaminationrelating to an allegedly-infringed patent, thereexamined claims were substantively changed. Id. at 1570. There, the ITC's termination decision \"did notrule on the merits,\" so its \"action could not intrinsically be a final determination wi thin the meaning of . . . \u00a7 1337(c) because it was not a decision to exclude or refuse to exclude articles from entry under . . . \u00a7 1337(d), (e), or (f).\" Id. at 1571 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Decision Not to Institute did not rendera decision on whether to exclude the allegedlymislabeled products or issue a cease-and-desist order.See J.A. 1-2. The ITC refused institution of anApp. 27 investigation and dismissed the Complaint, without reaching the requested relief. See J.A. 1-2. Rather than placing the ITC's authority to investigate in subsections (d), (e), (f), or (g), of \u00a7 1337,Congress located that authority in subsection (b).Section 1337(b) ITC to \"investigate anyalleged violation [\u00a7 1337] on initiative,\" \u00a7 1337(b)(1), andcontemplates instances any investigation\" or id. the [ITC] generalauthority to investigate violations of the statute\").Congress indicated its intent to make \u00a7 1337(b)determinations, such as the Decision Not to Institute,non-appealable through its exclusion of subsection (b)from the list of final determinations in \u00a7 1337(c). See Marx v. Gen. Revenue Congress includes one possibilityin a statute, it excludes another by implication.\"); cf. United States v. Erika , 456 U.S. 201, 207 (1982) (\"In the context of the statute's precisely drawn provisions , this omission provides persuasive evidence thatCongress deliberately intended to foreclose furtherreview of such claims.\" (emphasis added)). 3 Had 3 Case law, while not expressly de ciding the issue, supports this conclusion. See BASR P'ship v. United States , 795 F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (consulting case law to construe a statute). In Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. v. United States International TradeApp. 28 Congress intended to make non-institution decisions appealable, it merely needed to include them in its list of determinations that would be considered final in\u00a7 1337(c). Given that Congress decided not to adopt this\"obvious alternative,\" \"the natural implication is that[it] did appealable. Lozano Montoya Alvarez , 1, 16 (2014). \"We cannot revisit that choice.\" Id. The statutory context further reveals that Congress did not contemplate appealability of an ITC non-institution decision. See Digital Realty Tr., Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777 (2018) (acknowledging thatcourts may rely upon a statute's \"purpose and design\"to \"corroborate\" their understanding of the statutorytext); Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst. , 467 U.S. 340, 349 (1984) (\"[T]he presumption favoring judicial review ofadministrative action may be overcome by inferences ofintent drawn from the statut ory scheme as a whole.\"). In fact, \u00a7 1337(b)(1) covers the procedures forcommencing and conducting an investigation, anddetails that, \"[u]pon commencing any suchinvestigation, the [ITC] shall thereof inthe Federal Register.\" Moreover, \"the [ITC] shall,within 45 days after an investigation is initiated , Commission , the ITC decided not to institute an investigation pursuant to \u00a7 1337 and accordingly dismissed a complaint. See 659 F.2d 1038, 1040 (CCPA 1981). The complainant first petitioned our predecessor court for a writ of mandamus based on the ITC'srefusal to investigate and later filed an appeal from the ITC'sdecision. Id. at 1041. Our predecessor court, by separate order, \"dismissed [the complainant's] . . . appeal on the ground that there had been no final determination by [the] ITC, which is essential for jurisdiction of the court.\" Id. (emphases added).App. 29 establish a target date for its final determination .\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(b)(1) (emphases added). Through this language, Congress established two separate types ofITC determinations\u2014a decision whether to institute aninvestigation and, separately, a final determination,i.e., those made under subsections (d), (e), (f), or(g)\u2014and clarified that a final determination isrendered after an institution decision. See id. Similarly, \u00a7 1337(j) provides that, when the ITC \"determines that there is a violation . or. . there is such aviolation,\" it shall, inter alia, \"transmit to the Presidenta copy of such determination and the action takenunder subsection (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) [4] 1337].\" Id. \u00a7 1337(j)(1), (j)(1)(B). policy reasons\" to \"disapprove[ of] suchdetermination\" within sixty days, id. \u00a7 1337(j)(2), and, if not disapproved or if approved, the \"determinationshall become final ,\" id. \u00a7 1337(j)(4) (emphasis added). Such determinations that are submitted to thePresident become final well after an investigation iscomplete. See id. \u00a7 1337(b), (j). Tellingly, Congress has conferred jurisdiction ex plicitly over certain administrative decisions not to institute aninvestigation, elsewhere in the Tariff Act. Congressexplained that \"an interested party . . . may commencean action in the United States Court of InternationalTrade [('CIT')]\" challenging \"a determination by [the 4 Section 1337(i) authorizes the ITC, \"[i]n addition to taking action under subsection (d),\" to \"issue an order providing that any article imported in violation of the provisions of [\u00a7 1337] be seized andforfeited to the United States\" in situations.App. 30 U.S. Department of Commerce] . . . not to initiate an investigation\" related antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. 19 (a)(1)(A) (emphasis added); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) CIT with \"exclusivejurisdiction\" over actions commenced pursuant to\u00a7 1516a). Congress did not confer such jurisdiction in\u00a7 1337. The legislative history does not support the majority's conclusion. See Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich , 510 U.S. 200, 207, 209-12 (1994) (consulting legislative history for statutory interpretation).Although the original version of \u00a7 1337 did not definean ITC final determination by reference to specificsubsections, see Tariff Act \u00a7 337, 46 Stat. at 703-04, Congress amended \u00a7 1337(c) and added that \"[a]nyperson adversely affected by a final determination ofthe [ITC] under subsection (d) or (e) may appeal suchdetermination,\" Trade Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-618, \u00a7 341(a), 88 Stat. 1978, 2054. 5 When Congress inserted this language, the Senate Finance Committeerecognized it was \"extend[ing] the right to judicialreview of final [ITC] determinations.\" S. Rep. No. 93-1298, at 197 (1974) (Conf. Rep.). It provided that \"[b]y final determination , as used in this section, the Committee means a [n ITC ] determination which has been referred to the President under [the predecessor to current \u00a7 1337(j) ], and has been approved by the 5 Congress later amended this language to include additional subsections under the definition of an ITC final determination. See, e.g. , Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-39, \u00a7 1105(c), 93 Stat. 144, 311 (adding subsection (f)).App. 31 President or has not been di sapproved . . . after referral of the determination.\" Id. (emphases added). This appears to be the only time in the legislative history Congress expounded its understanding of the termfinal determination in \u00a7 1337. Nowhere does Congressequate a non-institution decision to a finaldetermination. See id. While this court has acknowledged that \u00a7 1337 \"provides for judicial review of both positive andnegative determinations,\" we should be careful not toexpand the scope of the term final determination toinclude determinations beyond those contemplated byCongress. Amgen, Comm'n 1532, 1535 (Fed. Cir. (footnote Imp. Motors, Ltd. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n , 530 F.2d 940, 945 (CCPA 1976) (explaining that \u00a7 1337(c)\"indicate[s] an intent to provide appeal of such anunfavorable decision\"). I find no support for theproposition that Congress intended a non-institutiondecision to be an appealable final determination.Accordingly, I do not believe that the ITC's DecisionNot to Institute is a final determination under\u00a7 1337(c). Apparently recognizing that it is not a final determination as defined by \u00a7 1337(c), the majoritysweeps the ITC's Decision Not to Institute under ourjurisdiction by holding that it is intrinsically a final determination, based on Amgen . See Maj. Op. 6-9. In Amgen , the ITC dismissed a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the patent-at-issuedid \"not contain any process which jurisdictional prerequisite.\" 902 F.2dApp. 32 at 1535. We exercised appellate jurisdiction and vacated and remanded the ITC's dismissal,determining that the dismissal \"should have beenphrased as a dismissal on the merits.\" Id. at 1537. 6 There, the ITC's determination that the patent's claims\"do not, in fact, cover proc by statute] . Id. at 1535. The court recognized that \"the jurisdictional requirements of [\u00a7]1337 mesh with the factual requirements necessary toprevail on the merits,\" and explained that \"the fact that [the complainant] was later unable to sustain theseallegations [regarding whether its patent covered aprocess] is not material to the issue of jurisdiction .\" Id. at 1536. The majority's reliance on Amgen is misplaced. Amgen did not involve a determination made pursuant 6 Amgen 's statement that \"when a decision is intrinsically a final determination, i.e., a determin ation on the merits, then that decision is appealable under [\u00a7] 1337(c),\" traces back to our predecessor court's decision in Import Motors . Amgen , 902 F.2d at 1535 (emphasis omitted) (citing, inter alia, F.2d at 944). Evenunder this interpretation of \"final determination,\" the ITC'sdetermination must be m ade \"under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g)\" because the statutory language cabins the types of final determinations that are appealable. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(c); see ImportMotors, 530 F.2d 1337, interpreted[,] . . . refers to a final administrativedecision on the merits, excluding or refusing to exclude articles from entry under subsection (d) or (e)\"). Amgen does not expand our jurisdiction to determinations made under differentsubsections of \u00a7 1337, nor could it. See Lozano , 572 U.S. at 16 (recognizing that we are bound by Congress's choice).App. 33 to \u00a7 1337(b); instead, the ITC in that case \"conduct[ed] a full investigation\" before dismissing the complaint.Id. at 1534. The majority dismisses this fact by stating \"the court's reasoning in [Amgen ] was not based on that procedural detail\" but \"focused on the operative effecto f t h e [ I T C ] d e c i s i o n . \" M a j . O p . 8 . T h a t i s h a r d l y aprocedural detail; this fact, coupled with \u00a7 1337(c)'sprecise definition of a final determination,fundamentally limits Amgen 's holding. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(c). The majority criticizes \"this approach [as]elevat[ing] form over substance.\" Maj. Op. 9. There isa \"general principle that agencies with statutoryenforcement responsibilities enjoy broad discretion inallocating investigative and enforcement resources.\"Torrington Co. v. United States , 68 F.3d 1347, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The majority fails to give due respectto Congress's choice, thereby placing \"this court in and one that could be quite disruptive of[the ITC]'s effort to establish enforcement priorities.\"Id. In addition, Amgen determined that the ITC improperly characterized its dismissal as jurisdictionalon the process patent claim issue, but we explainedthat the substance of its analysis meant it \"should havedismissed on the merits.\" 902 contrast, the IT C's two-page Decision Not to Institute, which dismissed on jurisdictional grounds,does not purport to, nor in fact does, reach the meritsof Amarin's Complaint; rather, it recognizes that theFDCA vests with primacy over such claims.See J.A. 1-2. Amarin is not barred from seeking relief;App. 34 for instance, the ITC did not find that Amarin failed to \"pro[ve] . . . an element of th e cause of action,\" such as finding the Intervenors did not falsely label their accused products and therefore did not commit anunfair act under \u00a7 1337(a). Engage Learning, Inc. v. Salazar, 660 F.3d 1346, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citation omitted); see Block , 777 F.2d at 1571 (dismissing for lack of appellate jurisdiction where the ITC did notmake a \"finding ITC's Decision Not to Institute is not \"the equivalent of a finaldetermination,\" as it was \"without prejudice,\" becauseit did not make findings on the merits, and Amarin is\"free to\" file another complaint. 777 F.2d at 1571; see id. (rejecting the argument that the ITC's \"order . . . , 902 F.2d at 1535 (distinguishing Block and recognizing there that the court \"found the lack of any findings by the [ITC] to be critical; nothing in the termination [o]rder prejudiced the [ITC] or any private party in afuture proceeding\" (emphasis added) (citationomitted)). Indeed, the ITC represents, on appeal, thatits dismissal is \"without prejudice.\" Appellee's Br. 57.The ITC notes that \"Amarin is free to file a newcomplaint once the FDA issues sufficient guidance withrespect to the [A]ccused [P]r oducts such that the [ITC] is not required to interpret the FDCA in the firstinstance and Amarin's claims are otherwise no longerprecluded by the FDCA.\" Id. at 58 (footnote omitted); see Imp. Motors , 530 F.2d at 947 & n.13 (relying on an ITC representation made on appeal regarding whethera party could participate in the second stage of a \u00a7 1337investigation). The majority implicitly recognizes thatAmarin may eventually re-file. See Maj. Op. 7-8 (\"[A]sApp. 35 long as Amarin's [C]omplaint is based on proving violations of the FDCA ( at least where the FDA has not provided guidance as to whet her the articles violate the FDCA ), Amarin's claims will be precluded.\" (emphasis added)).7 Accordingly, I conclude that the ITC's Decision Not to Institute is not an appealable finaldetermination within the meaning of \u00a7 1337(c). III. We Should Exercise Mandamus Jurisdiction and Deny Amarin's Petition Intervenors argue that we lack mandamus jurisdiction to review Amarin's Petition, see Intervenors' Br. 34-37, because we may not \"usemandamus to obtain jurisdiction over agency decisionsotherwise beyond [our] reach,\" id. at 36. Amarin and the ITC contend that we have mandamus jurisdiction.See Appellants' Br. 25-27; Appellee's Br. 51-52. I agree with Amarin and the ITC. Pursuant to the All Writs Act, we \"may issue all writs necessary or appropriate aid of\" 28 1651(a). of mandamus is restricted bystatute to those cases in which the writ is in aid of[appellate] jurisdiction.\" Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n , 319 U.S. 21, 25 (1943). \"The authority is not limited to issuance of the writ where the court alreadyhad jurisdiction on appeal; rather, the authority 7 Because the dismissal is withou t prejudice and Amarin can re- file, the majority need not be concerned that the ITC would unnecessarily be required \"to formally institute . . . just longenough . . . to same dismissal order it already issued inthis case.\" Maj. Op. 9.App. 36 extends to those cases which are within its appellate jurisdiction although no appeal has been perfected.\" In re Princo Corp. , 478 F.3d 1345, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). I believe we have jurisdiction to consider Amarin's Petition, which seeks mandamus relief. Section 1295(a)gives us . final determination\"). If the ITC were to erroneously refuseto initiate an investigation, we might consequently bedivested of appellate jurisdiction over a matter whichwe should have had jurisdiction following ITC'sinstitution and final determination. See id.; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(6). Review over su ch matters is necessary as an exercise of \"limited judicial power to preserve th[is]court's jurisdiction.\" FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597, 604 (1966). Amarin's Petition asks whether theITC is required to initiate an investigation under thegoverning statute. See, e.g. , Appellants' Br. 38 (\"The Tariff Act imposes a non-discretionary duty on the[ITC] to institute investigations into alleged unfairtrade practices and methods of competition.\"); see id. at 39 (relying on \u00a7 1337(b)). Accordingly, we retainmandamus jurisdiction, which, under ssary to protect [our] prospective jurisdiction.\" & Action Ctr. v. FCC , 750 F.2d 70, 76 (D.C. see, e.g., Syntex , 659 F.2d at 1041 (considering, but ultimately denying, a petition for writ of mandamuswhere petitioner sought \"to compel [the] ITC toinstitute an investigation\"); cf. In re Cypress Semiconductor Corp., 321 F. App'x 964, 965 (Fed. Cir.App. 37 2009) (exercising jurisdiction over, but ultimately denying, a petition for writ of mandamus seeking tocompel the ITC \"to halt its investigation\"). Heckler v. Chaney does not require a different result. See 470 U.S. 821 (1985); see also Intervenors' Br. 26-27, 35 (citing Heckler to argue the ITC's Decision Not to Institute is immune from judicialreview). Although Heckler held that \"an agency's decision not to take enforcement action should bepresumed immune from judicial review,\" 470 U.S. at832, the Supreme Court did not address \"a refusal bythe agency to institute proceedings based solely on thebelief that it lacks jurisdiction,\" id. at 833 n.4, or a \"decision [that] is predicated solely on the agency'sinterpretation of a statute,\" Int'l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock , 783 F.2d 237, 245 n.10 (D.C . Cir. 1986). However, as discussed above, the Petition challenges the ITC'sinterpretation of \u00a7 1337 and the FDCA, see Appellants' Br. 38-39, 50, and the ITC refused to institute becauseit lacked jurisdiction over Amarin's Complaint, see J.A. 1. Thus, I would exercise mandamus jurisdiction overAmarin's Petition, but agree with the majority'sconclusion that Amarin has failed to demonstrate thatit is entitled to the extraordinary relief of mandamus.See Maj. Op. 9 n.3, 9-18. 8 8 To the extent there remains a question about whether we have mandamus jurisdiction, the ITC's failure to institute an investigation would not evade judicial review. Instead, theAdministrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 60 Stat. 237 (1946) (codifiedin scattered sections of 5 U.S.C. (2012)), provides that \"[a] person. . . adversely affected\" by \"final agency action[s] for which there isno other adequate remedy in a court\" may seek review of thatApp. 38 CONCLUSION Through \u00a7 1337(c), Congress expressly defined a final determination of the ITC and thereby precisely drew the limits of our appellate jurisdiction. Themajority disregards the text of the statute and Congress's intent by holding that a \u00a7 1337(b) non-institution determination is appealable, even thoughCongress expressly defined a final determination asone made under \u00a7 1337(d)-(g). Because I believe wemust follow Congress's directiv e, I respectfully dissent. action, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 704. Under this type of action, a reviewing court may \"compel agency action unlawfully withheld,\" id. \u00a7 706(1), for example the ITC's failure to institute an investigation. Therefore, if appellate and mandamus jurisdiction are lacking inthis court, Amarin may be able to raise an APA challenge indistrict court. See Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All. , 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) (holding \"a claim under \u00a7 706(1) can proceed only wherea plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take \"). It is useful to note that \u00a7 1337(c) expressly contemplates APA review of certain types ofdeterminations. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(c) (stating that ITC \"determinations (f), and (g) . . . withrespect to its findings on the pub lic health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and UnitedStates consumers, the amount and nature of bond, or theappropriate remedy shall be reviewable in . . withrespect to forfeiture of bonds an d under subsection (h) . . . with respect to the imposition of sa nctions for abuse of discovery or abuse of process shall also be reviewable in accordance with [\u00a7]706\").App. 39 APPENDIX B UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20436 October 27, 2017 Jeffrey M.

INTRODUCTION 1. Amarin Pharma, (\"Amarin (collectively, \"Amarin\" or \"Complainants\") filethis Complaint pursuant to Section 337 of the TariffAct of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (\"Section 337\"). Amarin manufactures and markets Vascepa\u00aecapsules, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") consisting of 1 gram ofeicosapentaenoic acid (the omega-3 acid commonlyknown as \"EPA\") in a 1-gram capsule. The EPA inVascepa\u00ae is in ethyl ester form and is syntheticallyproduced. Amarin respectfully requests that the U.S.International Trade Commission (the \"ITC\" or\"Commission\") commence an investigation into theunlawful importation or sale in the United States ofsynthetically produced omega-3 products that arepredominantly comprised of EPA in either ethyl ester(\"EE\") or re-esterified (\"rTG\") form and are falselylabeled, and/or promoted for use as, or in \"dietarysupplements\" (the \"Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products\" (as defined with more particularity inparagraph 8, below)). Exhibits 1-12. These supplements\" but are actuallyunapproved drugs\" under the Federal Food, Drugand Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"). The false labeling orpromotion of these products constitutes an unfair actand/or unfair method of competition under Section 337because, among other things, these acts violate Section43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), and the standards established by the FDCA.App. 106 2. A large majority of omega-3 products that are imported or sold in the United States are legally marketed \"dietary supplements\" comprised of commonfish oil. See Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (\"GOED\") Blog, June 5, 2014, (noting that,for example, \"[e]thyl esters represented 12% of the USdietary supplement market in 2013\"), Exhibit 13. Common fish oil typically includes a mixture ofsaturated and unsaturated fats, including a variety ofomega fatty acids in their na tural triglyceride (\"nTG\") form. R. Preston Mason and Samuel C.R. Sherratt, Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil dietary supplements containsaturated fats and oxidized lipids that may interferewith their intended biological benefits, Biochemical andBiophysical Research Communications (2016), Exhibit 14. Common fish oil is not synthetically produced. Amarin is not alleging that the import or sale in theUnited States of common fish oil, i.e., for use in, or as \"dietary supplements,\" violates Section 337, or otherU.S. laws per se, and Amarin is not requesting an investigation into the import or sale of those naturalproducts. Nor is Amarin requesting an investigationinto synthetically produced omega-3 products in EE orrTG form that are not predominantly comprised of theomega-3 acid, EPA. 3. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products are being sold in the United States as ingredients forfinished products, and as fi nished products themselves. Certain of the Proposed Respondents are sellingsynthetically produced omega-3 oil, or encapsulatedsynthetically produced omega-3 oil, for use in or as finished products marketed as \"dietary supplements\"- namely:App. 107 Royal DSM NV (\"DSM NV\"), Exhibit 1 ; DSM Marine Lipids Peru S.A.C. (\"DSM-Peru\"), Exhibit 1 ; DSM Nutritional Products LLC in the United States (\"DSM-US\"), Exhibit 1 ; DSM Nutritional Products Canada Inc., (\"DSM- Canada\"), Exhibit 1 ; Ultimate Biopharma Corp. (\"Ultimate\"), Exhibit 2; Marine Ingredients AS, Exhibit 3 ; Marine Ingredients LLC, Exhibit 3 ; Golden Omega S.A., Exhibit 4 ; Golden Omega USA LLC, Exhibit 4 ; Nordic Pharma Inc., Exhibit 5 ; Croda Europe Ltd., Exhibit 6 ; Croda, Inc., Exhibit 6 ; and Technologica de Alimentos S.A., Exhibit 7 (collectively the \"Manufacturers\"). 4. The other Proposed Respondents are selling finished products containing synthetically produced omega-3 oil as \"dietary supplements\" directly to consumers - namely: The Nature's Bounty Co. (\"Nature's Bounty\"), Exhibit 8 ; Nordic Naturals, Exhibit 9 ;App. 108 Pharmavite LLC, Exhibit 10 ; Innovix Pharma Inc. (\"Innovix Pharma\"), Exhibit 11; and J. R. Carlson Laboratories (\"Carlson\"), Exhibit 12 (collectively, the \"Distributors\"). 5. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products, like Vascepa\u00ae, are derived from common fish oil. Common fish oil includes omega-3 fatty acids in theirnatural triglyceride form (\"nTG-OM3\"), such in Although theSynthetically Produced Omeg a-3 Products are derived from common fish oil, they are not the same as commonfish oil. As discussed in more detail in paragraphs 42-51, typically, common fish oil is extracted from oily fish by using physical, not chemical processes, such that nochemical bonds are broken or created. 6. Depending upon the fish from which the oil was extracted and the environmental conditions in whichthe fish were raised, the ratio of nTG-EPA and nTG-DHA can differ. However, typically, 30% of common fish oil by weight is nTG omega-3 fatty acids, or nTG-OM3. The remaining 70% of the oil has otherconstituents, most predominan tly, saturated fat, other omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 and omega-9 fattyacids. See Figure 1 (below).App. 109 Figure 1. Leading Common Fish Oil Supplement with 30% nTG-OM3* * See R. Preston Mason and Samuel C.R. Sherratt, Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil dietary supplements contain saturated fats and oxidized lipids that may interfere with their intended biological benefits, Biochemical andBiophysical Research Communications (2016), 1-5.Exhibit 14. 7. It is not possible to produce natural marine oil with a collective concentration of nTG-EPA and nTG-DHA that is greater than approximately 30% by weightof the oil. Oils with a high er collective concentration of EPA and DHA must be chemically synthesized, i.e., synthetically produced. Many of the SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products are chemically altered todeliver heightened levels of EPA and/or DHA - wellbeyond the levels that are found in nature, see, e.g., Exhibits 8-I, 9-T, 9-V, 11-A, 12-D . Some are also chemically altered to remove less valuable or unwantedcomponents of common fish o il, such as saturated fat. See Figure 2 (below). 8. Common molecular forms and mixtures of Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products include thefollowing:App. 110 (i) purified EPA in its ethyl ester form (\"E- EPA\"), (ii) purified EPA in its form (\"rTG-EPA\"), (iii) omega-3 mixtures in their ethyl ester form (\"E-OM3\"), (ii) omega-3 mixtures in their re-esterified form (\"rTG-OM3\"). Amarin believes that all of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products identified in this complaint containE-EPA, rTG-EPA, (where E-EPA is thepredominant component), or rTG-OM3 is the predominant component). Exhibits 8-A - 12-M 1; see also Section VII. 9. To synthesize omega-3 fatty acid mixtures, or their EPA or DHA components, from their naturaltriglyceride form into th eir ethyl ester form, the natural triglyceride molecules undergo chemicalreactions. First, the glycerol backbone of eachtriglyceride molecule in the common fish oil is removed.Second, the resulting free fatty acids are reacted withethanol through a process known as esterification. Thisethyl ester form allows for the substantial heightening of the level of the E-EPA and/or E-DHA in thesynthetically produced oil. The manufacturer canchoose which fatty acid levels to heighten, and either to 1 Throughout this document, when a range of exhibits is given, it refers to all like subparts within the given range, unless otherwise noted.App. 111 manipulate the ratio of E-EPA to E-DHA or to purify the product into E-EPA or E-DHA. 10. The differences between the complex mixture of multiple constituents that comprise common fish oilproducts and the various pharmacologically designedand chemically synthesized products is illustrated bycomparing Figure 1 (above) to Figure 2 (below). Figure 2. Vascepa\u00ae (Purified E-EPA)* *Vascepa\u00ae Full Prescribing Information, Exhibit 15 (reflecting that FDA has labeled Vascepa\u00ae 1 gramcapsules as containing 1 gr am of E-EPA. The capsules also contain trace amounts of inactive ingredientsincluding, tocopherol, an anti-oxidation agent designedto protect the fragile active ingredient). 11. Vascepa\u00ae, the product highlighted in Figure 2, is the only drug approved by the FDA that containspurified E-EPA. See List of FDA-Approved Icosapent Ethyl (E-EPA) Drugs in Orange Book, Exhibit 16 (icosapent ethyl is an alternate name foreicosapentaenoic acid in ethyl ester form). Vascepa\u00ae ismanufactured and marketed by Amarin. There alsobranded and generic FDA-approved drugs that containApp. 112 omega-3 mixtures in their ethyl List of FDA-Approved Om ega-3 Ethyl Ester Drugs in the Orange Book, Exhibit 17. FDA has approved these drugs for use as an adjunct to diet to reducetriglyceride levels in adult patients with severehypertriglyceridemia. See, e.g., Vascepa\u00ae Full Prescribing Information, Exhibit 15; Lovaza\u00ae Full Prescribing Information, Exhibit 18. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (too much fat in the blood) is adisease that can lead to inflammation of the pancreas,which can cause life-threatening complications. SeePancreatitis, Patient Care & Health Information, MayoClinic (accessed August 4, 2017), Exhibit 19. Severe hypertriglyceridemia can also raise or indicateincreased risk of heart disease. See High Cholesterol- Medicines To Help You, FDA Website (accessed August4, 2017) (noting that \"[t]ri glycerides are another form of fat in your blood that can raise your risk for heartdisease\"), Exhibit 20. 12. Since the launch of these FDA-approved drugs, companies have been increasingly falselylabeling and promoting products that containchemically heightened levels of EPA as \"dietarysupplements.\" See Jennifer Grebow, Ultra-High Concentrates and the Next Omega-3, Supply Side WestReport, Nutritional Outlook, Oct. 14, 2015, Exhibit 21 (\"Omega-3 suppliers . . . are now taking territory . NUTRA Ingredients-usa.com, Oct. 21,2013, Exhibit 22. This recent free-riding is not surprising, and it is likely that it has occurred everApp. 113 since E-EPA first gained recognition in the marketplace as a \"drug\" in the mid-1980s, as discussed in paragraphs 80-83. 13. The ethyl ester components of the FDA- approved drugs ( i.e., E-OM3, E-EPA, and E-DHA) can also be further chemically altered into the re-esterified triglyceride (rTG) form using enzymes in a chemicalprocess called Food-grade enzymesseparate the ethanol molecule from the fatty acid,creating a free fatty acid (\"FFA\") molecule and a freeethanol molecule. When glycerol is reintroduced to thesolution, the enzymes then re-esterify the fatty acidsback onto a distinctionsbetween re-esterified forms ( e.g., rTG-OM3 and rTG-EPA) are further explained in paragraphs 49-50, and inFigure 3, in Section IV. 14. The Proposed Respondents are falsely labeling and/or promoting Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products for use in, or as \"dietarysupplements.\" Exhibits 1-B - 7-B, 8-A-ii - 12-M-ii . As \"new drugs\" under the FDCA.This false labeling and/or promotion of theSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products constituteApp. 114 unfair trade practices or unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 337 because they deceive or havethe capacity to deceive a substantial segment ofpotential consumers, and that deception is material topurchasing decisions in violation of Section 43(a) of theLanham Act. False labeling and/or promotion alsomisbrands the products under the standards set forthin Section 502 of the FDCA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352. 15. Moreover, such false labeling and/or promotion is unfair to Amarin and otherpharmaceutical companies that have invested thenecessary resources to brin g competing drug products to market, and it serves as a disincentive for drugcompanies to invest resources in drug development inthe future. In particular, falsely labeling and/orpromoting products as \"dietary supplements\" enablesthe Proposed Respondents to avoid the drug approvalprocess and the associated time and investmentnecessary to conduct clinical trials to show that theirproducts are safe and effective for each intended useand to obtain FDA approval for each intended use. See21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355. Disregarding the FDA drug approvalprocess also enables the Proposed Respondents to avoidthe following: (i) limiting the indications for theirproducts to those that have been approved by FDA, see id. \u00a7 355(a); (ii) applicable user fee costs associated with manufacturing drugs, id. \u00a7 379h; and (iii) applicable costs associated with complying withFDA's drug registration, id. \u00a7 360, listing, id., and labeling and manufacturing requirements, id. \u00a7\u00a7 502(f), 501(a)(2)(B). In addition, it allows the Distributors to avoid the need to sell their products pursuant to aApp. 115 prescription by a licensed healthcare professional, see id. \u00a7 353(b). 16. Amarin has a domestic industry. Amarin specializes in developing effective therapies, approved by FDA, to treat disease, with a focus onhypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease.Amarin developed Vascepa\u00ae, a prescription drug thatlists icosapent ethyl as the drug's active pharmaceutical ingredient (\"API\") - legally - byinvesting the necessary resources to conduct clinicaltrials to show that the dr ug is safe and effective. Amarin then obtained FDA approval for the drug. See List of FDA-Approved Icos apent Ethyl Drugs (E-EPA) in Orange ethyl, Vascepa\u00ae's API, is the ethy l ester form of EPA, namely E-EPA. The FDA approved Vascepa\u00ae for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adultpatients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. See Vascepa\u00ae Full Prescribing Information, Exhibit 15. Amarin markets and sells Vascepa\u00ae in the UnitedStates as a prescription drug. Vascepa\u00ae is the onlyFDA-approved purified E-EPA mixture on the UnitedStates market. See List of FDA-Approved Icosapent Ethyl Drugs (E-EPA) in Orange Book, Exhibit 16. Vascepa\u00ae is a low-cost drug from a consumerperspective. According to Amarin's records, on average,the monthly cost of Vascepa\u00ae is typically less than$200, and this cost is mostly covered by insuranceplans. Exhibit 23. In addition, the majority of patients covered by insurance who obtain prescriptions forVascepa\u00ae pay a monthly co-p ay charge of $9.99 or less. Confidential Exhibit 24. In fact, a consumer withcommercial insurance can pay as little as $9.00 for aApp. 116 90-day supply prescription of Vascepa\u00ae. Exhibit 25. Finally, Amarin makes substantial investments in encapsulation, packaging, logistics, sales and marketing, along with substantial investments in laborconducting clinical trials in support of Vascepa\u00ae.Exhibit 23 . 17. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products compete with Vascepa\u00ae and injure Amarinbecause, like Vascepa\u00ae, they are chemically modifiedto deliver heightened EPA. Exhibits 9-O, 9-V, 12-D ester form Vascepa's activeingredient. Moreover, the Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products are often marketed and used totreat the same diseases fo r which Vascepa\u00ae has been, and is being, developed. See Tables 1 and 2. The Proposed Respondents' importation and sale ofSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products has injuredand/or threatened Amarin with substantial injury by(i) damaging the Vascepa\u00ae brand by exploitingVascepa\u00ae's status as an FDA-approved drug,(ii) causing lost sales and market share to Vascepa, and(iii) diminishing profitability and eroding prices.Amarin also has the capacity and/or inventory tosupply the entire U.S. market demand for theSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products (andsimilarly situated products), and ProposedRespondents' unfair acts prevent Amarin from makingthese sales, as discussed in paragraphs 225-229. 18. Finally, because false labeling and promotion enables purported \"dietary supplement\" products toApp. 117 evade the drug approval proc ess, it also endangers the public health. Indeed, form er-Attorney General Lynch observed the following with regard to \"dietary supplements\": What many Americans don't know is thatdietary supplements are not subject to testing [by FDA] before they reach the store shelves -meaning that every day, millions of Americansare ingesting substances whose safety andefficacy are not guaranteed. Some of thesesupplements are simply a waste of money,promising results that they can't deliver oradvertising ingredients that they don't contain.And too often, these supplements don't justabuse consumer trust - they also endangerpublic health. Some contain harmfulingredients, causing consumers to fall ill. Othersfalsely claim to cure illness and disease, leadingpatients to use them as a substitute of proventherapies they may need. But whether thesesupplements are deceptive or dangerous, the factremains that too many companies are makingprofits by misleading - and in some casesharming - American consumers. Former-Attorney General Lynch DiscussesDepartment's Efforts to Protect Consumers FromUnsafe Dietary Supplements, Department of Justice,Office of Public Affairs, March 8, 2016 (emphasisadded), Exhibit 26. Then-Attorney General Lynch's remarks were in reference to the Department ofJustice's (\"DOJ's\") \"dietary supplement\" enforcementsweep in November 2015, which it conducted with theApp. 118 FDA and other federal partners. See Justice Department and Federal Partners Announce Enforcement Actions of Dietary Supplement Cases,Nov. 18, 2015, Exhibit 27 . 19. Although Section 337 and the Lanham Act are both designed to protect commercial interestsagainst unfair methods of competition by authorizingprivate parties to sue competitors - they can alsoindirectly protect the public, particularly where FDAand other government entities have not acted, or havenot acted to the full extent of their authority. Given the government's limited resources, it simply cannotpursue all deceptively labeled and deceptivelypromoted products. 20. Indeed, FDA has primary responsibility for policing the \"labeling\" of \"dietary supplements\" and the\"labeling\" and \"advertising\" of unapproved \"newdrugs.\" See Memorandum of Understanding Between the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and DrugAdministration, 225-71-8003, Sept. 9, 1971, Exhibit and\"advertising\"). Yet, according to a recent PBS\"Frontline\" documentary, produced in collaborationwith The New York Times, FDA has only about 25 people in the division that oversees products positionedas \"dietary supplements,\" and more than 85,000 ofthese products are sold each year. As reported in thatprogram, \"[FDA] target[s] companies they consider themost risky, but agree the problem remains much biggerthan that.\" See Frontline: Supplements and Safety, PBS and The New York Times, Exhibit 29 ; see alsoApp. 119 Complainant's Brief On Jurisdiction, Confidential Exhibit 30 .

IV. THE PRODUCTS AT ISSUE 42. The Proposed Respondents' Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products th at are the subject of this investigation contain derivatives of naturally occurring omega-3 fatty acids. Omega- 3 fatty acids are a category polyunsaturated fatty acids that include EPA andDHA. Omega-3 fatty acids are marketed, legally andillegally, in the United States in a number of differentmixtures and molecular forms. Common mixtures andmolecular forms include th e following: (i) common fish oil (i.e., a natural omega-3 mixture (\"nTG-OM3\")), (ii) purified EPA mixtures in their ethyl ester form (\"E- EPA\"), (iii) purified re-esterified (\"rTG-EPA\"), (iv) omega-3 mixtures ethylester omega-3 involving a number of chemicalreactions. 43. Upon information and belief, all of the Synthetically Produced Omeg a-3 Products identified in this complaint contain E-EPA, rTG-EPA, E-OM3(where the predominant component is E-EPA) or rTG-OM3 (where the predominant component is rTG-EPA).Exhibits 8-A - 12-M ; see also Section VII.App. 124 44. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish and are most prevalent in oily fish , such as salmon, tuna, lake trout, mackerel, menhaden, sardines, anchovies, and herring. Oil in these fatty acids can be extracted by: (1) cooking and pressing the fish to separate the water and oil from the proteins and solids, (2) removing thewater from the oil, and (3) polishing the oil ( i.e., deacifying, degumming, and washing the oil severaltimes). When this oil is used for human consumption,it is also bleached and deodorized. At this point, thenTG-OM3 has been extracted from the fish throughphysical processes only - no chemical bonds have beenbroken or created. The resulting oil is common fish oilin nTG form, and depending upon the fish from whichthe oil was derived and the environmental conditionsin which the fish were raised, the ratio of nTG-EPAand nTG-DHA can differ. Before it is sold, however,common fish oil is generally blended and standardizedto contain approximately 180 mg of nTG-EPA and 120 mg of nTG-DHA per gram (1000 mg) of oil. Though theratio of EPA to DHA may vary slightly, this oil is oftenreferred to as 18:12 fish oil. The numbers 18:12represent the approximate ratio of nTG-EPA to nTG-DHA by weight: 18% of the o il, by weight, is nTG-EPA; and 12% of the oil, by weight, is nTG-DHA (therefore,30% of the oil, by weight is nTG omega-3 fatty acids).The remaining 70% of the oil has other constituents,typically, most predominantly, saturated fat, otheromega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 and omega-9 fattyacids. See Figure 1 (in Section I, and repeated below). 45. It is not possible to produce natural marine oil with a collective concentration of nTG-EPA andnTG-DHA that is greater than approximately 30% byApp. 125 weight of the oil. Oils with a higher concentration of EPA and DHA than approximately 30% must bechemically synthesized. Synthetic oils with higherconcentrations of EPA and/ or DHA that are available today are commonly in either the ethyl ester form orthe re-esterified triglyceride form. 46. The first step in the process of synthesizing common fish oil to yield higher concentrations of EPAand DHA involves a chemical reaction wherein theglycerol backbone of each triglyceride molecule in thefish oil is removed, resulting in \"free fatty acids\"(\"FFA\"), including FFA-EPA and The FFA-EPA and FFA-DHA arethen chemically reacted with ethanol through a as esterification. Esterification changes thefatty acids FFA-DHA becomes E-DHA. 47. The resulting ethyl ester form allows for substantial heightening of the level of the E-EPA orother components. The fatty acid level can beheightened using a number of different physicalprocedures, the two most common of which aremolecular distillation and supercritical fluidtechnology. These technologies allow the manufacturerto choose which fatty acid levels to heighten, and toeither manipulate the ratio of E-EPA to E-DHA or topurify the product into substantially only E-EPA. 48. Synthetically produced ethyl ester fatty acids, such as E-EPA, can also be chemically converted to there-esterified triglyceride form using enzymes in achemical process called glycerolysis. Food-gradeenzymes separate the ethano l molecule from the fattyApp. 126 acid, creating a FFA and a free ethanol molecule. When glycerol is reintroduced to the solution, the enzymesthen re-esterify the fatty acids back onto a glycerolbackbone, creating (rTG) oil. 49. Omega-3 mixtures in their ethyl ester form, regardless of whether they are characterized as E-OM3mixtures or more purified E-EPA or E-DHA mixtures, are different from omega-3 mixtures in their naturaltriglyceride, or nTG, form in a number of ways. Forexample, the ratio of EPA to DHA in ethyl estermixtures is often significantly different from the ratioin naturally occurring (nTG) mixtures. In addition, the EPA and DHA levels in the ethyl ester mixturestypically are much higher than they are in naturalmixtures. Also, the E-EPA and E-DHA molecules arechemically altered from the nTG-EPA and nTG-DHAmolecules and become chemically distinct as a result ofsuch alteration. These types of differences are materialbecause they can affect the efficacy and safety of the ethyl ester mixture, compared to the nTG mixture ( e.g., concentration can lead to greater efficacy and, forexample, higher levels of DHA have been associatedwith certain unwanted effects, particularly in diseasedpatients with severely high le vels of triglycerides in the blood). The differences between the complex mixture ofmultiple constituents that comprise common fish oilproducts and the pharmacologically designed highlypure synthesized E-EPA product, Vascepa\u00ae, areillustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The differences betweenthe E-OM3 and nTG-OM3 molecules, and theircomponents, are illustrated in Figure 3.App. 127 Figure 1. Leading Common Fish Oil Supplement with 30% nTG-OM3.* * See R. Preston Mason and Samuel C.R. Sherratt, Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil dietary supplements contain saturated fats and oxidized lipids that may interferewith their intended biological benefits, Biochemical andBiophysical Research Communications (2016), 1-5.Exhibit 14. Figure 2. Vascepa\u00ae (E-EPA)* *Vascepa\u00ae, Full Prescribing Information, Exhibit 15 (reflecting that FDA has labeled Vascepa\u00ae 1 gram capsules as containing 1 gr am of E-EPA. The capsules also contain trace amounts of inactive ingredientsincluding, tocopherol, an anti-oxidation agent designedto protect the fragile ingredient).App. 128 Figure Conversion of nTG-OM3 to E-OM3 to rTG- OM3 nTG-OM3 to E-OM3 Disclaimer - The triglyceride molecules shown in thescheme are merely representative of certain molecularspecies that would be expected to be present in bothnatural fish oil and rTG oil. They do not represent theonly molecular species in these mixtures. Thesemixtures would contain a variety of fatty acid residues,in addition to DHA, EPA, st earic and palmitic acid. The scheme is intended to repres ent, qualitatively, the type of chemical transformation that occurs in each step.App. 129 50. Omega-3 mixtures in their rTG form, regardless of whether they are characterized as rTG- OM3 mixtures or the more purified rTG-EPA or rTG-DHA mixtures, are also different from omega-3mixtures in their natural tr iglyceride, or nTG, form in a number of ways. For example, the ratio of EPA toDHA in rTG-OM3 mixtures is often different from the ratio in naturally occurring (nTG) mixtures. Inaddition, the EPA and DHA levels in the rTG mixturesare typically much higher than they are in naturalmixtures. This is because th e re-esterification process adds, on average, one extra fatty acid to eachtriglyceride molecule. Further, nTG and rTG typicallyhave different molecular structures. When the EPA,DHA, and other fatty acids, are re-attached to theglycerol molecule, during the chemical re-esterificationprocess, they randomly atta ch to one of three different points on the glycerol molecule: SN-1, SN-2, or SN-3.Even though the pattern of attachment is random, based on statistical probability, more EPA, DHA, andother fatty acids attach to the SN-1 and SN-3 points than the SN-2 point. In nTG, however, the EPA and DHA are typically bound to the SN-2 position. Finally,during the re-esterification process, not all fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, reattach to the glycerolmolecule as triglycerides. Thus, large percentages ofthe oil, often approximately 40%, are in di-glyceride ormono-glyceride form. Notabl y, di-glycerides and mono- glycerides are not components of natural fish oil, nTG,at all. In nTG-OM3 mixtures (common fish oil), 100%of the oil is in triglyceride form. As described above,these types of differences are material because they canaffect the efficacy and safety of the rTG mixture,compared to the nTG mixture ( e.g., concentration canApp. 130 lead to greater efficacy and, for example, higher levels of DHA have been associated with unwanted effects,particularly in some diseased patients with abnormallyhigh levels of triglycerides in the blood). Thedifferences between the rTG-EPA and nTG-EPAmolecules, as well as the differences between the rTG- DHA and nTG-DHA molecules are illustrated in Figure3. 51. Upon information and belief, all of the Proposed Respondents' Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products contain E-EPA, OM3. Exhibits 1 - 12 . Upon information and belief, all of these products are synthesized (i.e., chemically altered) using the same basic chemical processesdescribed above, and as such, they are distinct fromcommon fish oil, i.e., nTG-OM3. V. JURISDICTION 52. The Commission had jurisdiction over this investigation for the reasons set forth in Complainant'sBrief On Jurisdiction. Exhibit 30 . VI. UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR ACTS OF PROPOSED RESPONDENTS A. Proposed Respondents' Importation And Sale Of The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products Violate The LanhamAct 53. The Proposed Respondents' importation and sale of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products,and their false or misleading representations aboutthose products, constitute unfair acts or unfair methodsApp. 131 of competition under Section 337, and violate Section 43(a) of the federal Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a),and the federal common law of unfair competition. 54. Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act provides that: [a]ny person who, on or in connectionwith any goods or services, or anycontainer for goods, uses in commerce anyword, term, name, symbol, or device, orany combination thereof, or any falsedesignation of origin, false or misleadingdescription of fact, or false or misleadingrepresentation of fact, which - . . . (B) incommercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature, characteristics,qualities, or geographic origin of his orher or another person's goods, services, orcommercial activities, shall be liable in acivil action by any person who believesthat he or she is or is likely to bedamaged by such act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). 55. The elements of a false advertising/promotion claim under the Lanham Act are (i) a false ormisleading statement of fact is being made by thedefendant about a product; (ii) the statement isdeceiving or has the capacity to deceive a substantialsegment of potential consumers; (iii) the deception ismaterial, in that it is likely to influence a purchasingdecision; (iv) the defendant is causing the falsestatement to enter interstate commerce; and (v) theApp. 132 complainant has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the statement. See Hewlett-Packard Co. v. NU-Kate Int'l, Inc., 155 F.3d 571 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 1997)); see also Marcinkowskav. IMG Worldwide, Inc., 342 F. App'x 632, 636 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ( citing Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., 315 F.3d 264, 272 (4th Cir.2002)). 56. When a complainant can show that a statement is \"literally false,\" or false on its face,however, the consumer deception is presumed, suchthat proving the third element is not necessary. See Clock Spring, L.P. v. Wrapmaster, Inc., 560 F.3d 1329, n. 10 (Fed. Cir. 2009). A st atement may be \"literally false\" due to a material omission, among other reasons.See, e.g., Pfizer In c. v. Miles Inc., 868 F.Supp. 437 (D. Ct. 1994) (holding that an omission that is likely todeter physicians from using an FDA approved drug ismaterial and makes the advertisement's statement \"aliteral falsity\"). 57. In addition, parties other than those making false statements can be contributorily liable forLanham Act violations. See, e.g., Duty Free Ams., Inc. v. Estee Lauder Co., 797 F.3d 1248, 1273 (11th Cir. 901 F. Supp. 456 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding company liable toMerck for false advertising). The elementsof a contributory false advertising/promotion claiminclude showing that (1) a third party directly engagedin false advertising/promotion that injured the plaintiffand (2) the respondent at issue contributed to thatconduct by knowingly inducing or causing the conduct,App. 133 or by materially participating in it. See Duty Free Ams., 797 F.3d at 1277. 1. Proposed respondents are making false statements about the Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products by labeling and/orpromoting them as \"dietarysupplements\" when they are actuallyunapproved \"new drugs\" 58. The Distributors of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products are unlawfully importingor selling their products with labeling, advertisingand/or other promotional materials (\"PromotionalMaterials\") that are literally false. Among other things,the labeling for all of the Distributors' SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products falsely asserts that theproducts are or it falsely impliesthat they are \"dietary supplements\" using somemodification of 12-M-ii . Indeed, the term \"dietary supplement\" or a modification of that term using thename of the ingredient in the product is required toappear on \"dietary supplement\" labeling by law. 21U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321(ff)(2)(C), 343(s)(2)(B). 59. In addition, all of the Manufacturers (except Ultimate) are unlawfully importing or selling theirproducts with Promotional Materials that are literallyfalse because they assert that the products are for usein, or as \"dietary supplements.\" Exhibits 1-B - 7-B . 60. Labeling and/or promoting Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products for use in, or as \"dietaryApp. 134 supplements\" is literally false because these products (i) cannot meet the definition of \"dietary supplement\"in Section 201(ff) of the FD CA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff) and (ii) are being referred to as \"dietary supplements\" tohide the fact that they are actually unapproved \"newdrugs.\" a. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products cannot meetthe definition of \"dietarysupplement\" in the FDCA 61. None of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products meets the definition of \"dietary supplement\"in the FDCA because none of the a \"dietary ingredient.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1).Moreover, although the failure to bear or contain a\"dietary ingredient\" is sufficient to preclude a productfrom being a \"dietary supplement,\" the SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products that emphasize E-EPA in their manufacture or marketing are also excluded fromthe definition of \"dietary supplement\" by Omega-3 Products do not meetthe definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because they donot bear or contain a \"dietaryingredient\" 62. The definition of \"dietary supplement\" in the FDCA applies only to products that, among otherthings, bear or contain one or more of the following\"dietary ingredients\": \"(A) a vitamin, (B) a mineral,App. 135 (C) an herb or other botanica l, (D) an amino acid, (E) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or (F) aconcentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, orcombination of any ingredient described in clause (A),(B), (C), (D), or (E).\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1). Products marketed with ingredients that do not fall within thecategories of \"dietary ingredients\" listed in Section201(ff)(1) of the FDCA, 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1), cannot be marketed as, or for use in, \"dietary supplements.\" Seeid. 63. The Synthetically E-OM3, and rTG-OM3 of \"dietary ingredients\" under theSection 201(ff)(1) of the FDCA. As an initial matter, E- EPA, rTG-EPA, E-OM3, E- EPA, and rTG-OM3 are not vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other botanicals, andtherefore, they do not fall under subsections201(ff)(1)(A)-(D). Moreover, they do not fall undersubsections 201(ff)(1)(E) or (F) either. a) The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products do notfall under subsection201(ff)(1)(E) of the \"dietaryingredient\" definition 64. Unlike nTG-OM3 and nTG-EPA, which naturally occur in fish oil, E-EPA, rTG-EPA, E-OM3,and rTG-OM3 do not fall under subsection not \"dietary substance[s] for use by man tosupplement the diet by increasing the total dietaryintake.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(E). According to FDA,App. 136 when the chemical structure of a dietary ingredient is altered, for example, by the \"addition of new chemical groups as in esterification,\" it: creates a new substance that is differentfrom the original dietary ingredient. Thenew dietary ingredient is not consideredto be a dietary ingredient merely becauseit has been altered from a substance thatis a dietary ingredient, and therefore, isin some way related to the dietaryingredient. Dietary Supplements: New Dietary IngredientNotifications and Related Issues: Guidance forIndustry (Draft), August 2016 (NDI Guidance), at 41(emphasis added), Exhibit 31. This is a well-settled FDA policy that previously has been articulated inFederal Register notices and implemented in rejectionsof new dietary ingredient notifications. See, e.g., 81 Fed. Reg. 61700, 61702 (Sept. 7, 2016), Exhibit 32 , (noting that vinpocetine \"is a synthetic compound,derived from vincamine, an alkaloid found in the Vinca minor plant\" because it undergoes transesterification and/or dehydration of vincamine in ethanol); FDALetter to AIBMR Life Sciences, Inc., dated March 19,2014, Exhibit 33 (finding that synthetic fish oil fatty acid esters were \"not constituents of a dietarysubstance for use by man under Section 201 (ff)(1)(F)\"). 65. FDA refers to these chemically altered ingredients - these new substances - as \"synthetic\" or\"synthetically produced\" ingr edients, and it uses those terms interchangeably to refer to ingredients that aresynthesized from natural starting materials as well asApp. 137 unnatural starting materials. See, e.g., NDI Guidance, at 37-41, Exhibit 31 ; see also 81 Fed. Reg. at 61702, Exhibit 32; FDA Warning Letter to Quincy Bioscience Manufacturing Inc., dated Oct. 16, 2012, Exhibit 34 (concluding that synthetic apoaequorin manufacturedfrom \"rapidly dividing host cells,\" which are a \"dietary ingredient\"); FDA Letter toSyntech (SSPF) International, dated December 6, 2004, Exhibit 35 (finding that betaphrine, an ingredientchemically synthesized from substances that arethemselves \"dietary ingredients,\" is not a \"dietaryingredient\" under any subsection in Section201(ff)(1)(A)-(F) of the Act). 66. Because E-EPA, rTG- EPA, E-OM3, and rTG- OM3 are each chemically altered, or synthesized fromcommon fish oil, they are synthetically produced, orsynthetic. As such, they cannot fall under subsection201(ff)(1)(E), unless they themselves are commonlyused in conventional food. 67. For more than 15 years, FDA has consistently found that synthetic substances do not fall undersubsection 201(ff)(1)(E), or subsections 201(ff)(1)(C) and(F) of the \"dietary for thatmatter, unless the synthetic substance itself iscommonly used in conventional food. And whenpurported \"dietary supplements\" have contained asynthetic ingredient that is not common inconventional foods, FDA has taken action. For example,the agency has (i) brought enforcement actions on this basis, see, e.g., 69 Fed. Reg. 6787, 6793 (Feb. 11, 2004),App. 138 Exhibit 36 (citing United States v. 1009 Cases *** No. 2:01CV-820C (D. Utah filed October 22, 2001)); (ii) denied citizen petitions on this basis, see, e.g., Letter from FDA to Ullman, Shapiro, & Ullman LLP, Docket No. FDA-2009-P-0298, dated Feb. 23,2011, Exhibit 37 (citizen petition response stating that synthetic homotaurine may not be marketed asa \"dietary supplement\" because it is not a \"dietaryingredient\"); (iii) advised other federal agencies on this basis, see, e.g., Letter from Dennis E. Baker, Associate Commissioner of Regulatory Affairs, FDA, to Laura M. Nagel, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office ofDiversion Control, Drug EnforcementAdministration, June 21, 2001 (Nagel Letter),Exhibit 38 (concluding that synthetic ephedrinealkaloids are not \"dietary ingredients\"); (iv) announced in the Federal Register that certain ingredients cannot be sold as \"dietary supplements\"on this basis, 69 Fed. Reg. 6793, Exhibit 36 (acknowledging that synthetic ephedrinehydrochloride \"and other synthetic sources ofephedrine cannot be dietary ingredients becausethey are not constituents or extracts of a botanical,nor do they qualify as any other type of dietaryingredient\"); (v) issued warning letters on this basis, see, e.g., FDA Warning Letter to ATS Labs, LLC, dated February 3, 2016, Exhibit 39 (finding that 1,3- dimethylbutylamine (\"DMBA\") is not a \"dietaryingredient\" because it is synthetic and to the best ofApp. 139 FDA's knowledge it is not used in conventional foods); FDA Warning Letter to DBM Nutrition,dated Nov. 30, 2015, Exhibit 40 (finding that picamilon, \"a unique chemical entity synthesizedfrom the dietary ingredients niacin andaminobutyric acid\" does not fall within any of the\"dietary ingredients\" categories in the statute, andtherefore, is not a \"dietary ingredient\"); FDAWarning Letter to Quincy BioscienceManufacturing Inc., dated Oct. 16, 2012, Exhibit 34 (finding that synthetic apoaequorin is not a \"dietary ingredient\"); FDA Warning Letter toSupplementstogo.com LLC, dated March 8, 2006,Exhibit 41 (finding that methasterone, a synthetic steroid, is not a \"dietary ingredient\"); and (vi) rejected new dietary ingredient notifications on this basis, see, e.g., FDA Letter to Syntech (SSPF) International, dated December 6, 2004, Exhibit 35 (finding that betaphrine, a chemically synthesizedsubstance is not a \"dietary ingredient\"). In addition,FDA recently reiterated this position in 2016 draftguidance on \"new dietary ingredients.\" See NDI Guidance at 38, Exhibit 31 . 68. The FDA's long-standing position is based on a plain language interpretation of the definition of\"dietary supplement\" in the text in subsection201(ff)(1)(E) - namely, \"a diet ary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the totaldietary intake.\" See NDI Guidance, at 38, Exhibit 31; Nagel Letter, Exhibit 38. According to FDA, Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary, provides that the term \"dietary\" means \"of or relating to the diet\" andApp. 140 \"diet\" means \"an organism's usual food and drink.\" See NDI Guidance, at 38, Exhibit 31; Nagel Letter, Exhibit 38. Reading those definitions in conjunction with the phrase, \"for use by man,\" FDA construes theterm \"dietary substance\" \"a substancecommonly used as human food or drink.\" See NDI Guidance, at 38, Exhibit 31 ; Nagel Letter, Exhibit 38. FDA also maintains that the last phrase in subsection(E), \"to supplement the diet by increasing the totaldietary intake,\" provides further evidence thatCongress intended the term \"di etary substance\" to refer to \"foods and food components that humans eat as partof their usual diet\" because \"[o]ne cannot increase the'total dietary intake' of something that is not part ofthe human diet in the first place.\" See NDI Guidance, at 38, Exhibit 31 ; Nagel Letter, Exhibit 38 . 69. Upon information and belief, E-EPA, rTG- EPA, E-OM3, and rTG-OM3 are not common inconventional food in the United States. Each issynthetically produced. b) The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products do notfall under subsection201(ff)(1)(F) of definition 70. Similarly, E-EPA, E-OM3, and rTG-OM3 do not fall under subsection 201(ff)(1)(F)because each is a synthetically produced substance,and upon information and belief, none of theingredients is a concentrate, constituent, extract, orcombination of a \"dietary substance\" that falls undersubsection 201(ff)(1)(E), or subsections 201(ff)(1)(A)-(D)App. 141 for that matter. Notably, in 2014, FDA specifically rejected a new dietary ingredient notification for aproduct dubbed \"synthetic fish oil fatty acid esters\"- in part, because the proponent of the ingredient had notsubmitted evidence sufficient for FDA to determinewhether it met the definition of \"dietary ingredient.\"See FDA Letter to AIBMR Life Sciences, Inc., dated March 19, 2014, Exhibit 33. In reaching this conclusion, FDA stated that the synthetic fish oil fatty acid esters at issue were \"not constituents of a dietarysubstance for use by man under Section 201(ff)(1)(F).\"Id. This approach by FDA is consistent with its conclusion that \"[o]ne cannot increase the 'total dietaryintake' of something that is not part of the human dietin the first place.\" NDI Guidance, at 38, Exhibit 31; Nagel Letter; Exhibit . i exclusionary clause) also excludes from the definitionof \"dietary supplement\" any \"article\" that is approvedas a or authorized for study as a \"new drug\" (where substantial clinical investigations have beeninstituted), that was not before such approval orauthorization legally marketed as a \"dietarysupplement\" or as a food. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ft)(3)(B). AsApp. 142 explained below in paragraphs 80-83, E-EPA first gained recognition in the market place by being studiedas a drug in the mid-1980s, and upon information andbelief it was not legally marketed as a \"dietarysupplement\" or a food prior to that time. Thus, asexplained below, E-EPA products, as well as productscontaining E-OM3 that emphasize E-EPA in the waythat they are manufactured or promoted, are excludedfrom the definition of \"dietary supplement\" undersubsection 201(ft)(3)(B) of the FDCA. 72. The relevant \"article\" for the purposes of the exclusionary clause is dictated by the circumstancessurrounding the manufacture and marketing of thepurported \"dietary supplements\" FDA'sadministrative determination); FDA AdministrativeDetermination on Cholestin, dated May 20, 1998, at 10,Exhibit 42. In the seminal case on the exclusionary clause, Pharmanex, Inc. (\"Pharmanex\") marketed aproduct that contained red yeast rice as a \"dietarysupplement.\" See FDA Administrative Determination on Cholestin, dated May 20, 1998, at 1, Exhibit 42. FDA, however, determined that Cholestin was not a\"dietary supplement,\" but rather an unapproved \"newdrug\" under the FDCA. See id. FDA reasoned that Cholestin did not meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because Cholestin contained lovastatin,an active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug. See id. at 7, 10. As such, products containing lovastatin wereexcluded from the definition of \"dietary supplement\" bythe exclusionary clause. See id. According to FDA, lovastatin was the relevant \"article\" for the purposes ofApp. 143 the exclusionary clause, as opposed to the finished Cholestin product, because of the \"particularcircumstances surrounding the not the traditional foodproduct red yeast rice.\" Id. at 10. 73. Notably, the Tenth Circuit upheld FDA's determination that an \"article\" for the purposes of theexclusionary clause can be either a finished drugproduct or a component of a drug product. See Pharmanex v. Shalala (\"Pharmanex II\"), FDA Determinationon Cholestin, dated May 20, 1998, Exhibit 42 . This interpretation ensures that substances that havegained recognition in the marketplace as drugs cannotbe marketed as, or incorporated into, \"dietarysupplements.\" See FDA Administrative Determination on Cholestin, dated May 20, 1998, at 6, Exhibit 42 . 74. The exclusionary clause encourages and protects investment in drug development and theresulting innovation. The Tenth Circuit and FDA haveobserved, respectively, that permitting \"manufacturersto market dietary supplements with componentsidentical to the active ingredients in prescriptiondrugs\" would undermine the FDCA's incentivestructures for drug development, see Pharmanex II, 211 F.3d at 1159, and it would \"serve as a disincentive tothe often significant investment needed to gain FDAapproval of new drugs.\" See FDA Administrative Determination on Cholestin, dated May 20, 1998, at 4-5, Exhibit 42. Protecting drug innovation is such aApp. 144 critical underpinning of the FDCA that Congress later enacted a separate exclusionary clause to prohibitsubstances that have gained recognition in themarketplace by being studied as, or approved as drugs,from being incorporated into conventional food as well,unless those substances were first marketed in a food. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(ll)). 75. In this case, consistent with the FDA's decision in Pharmanex and the underlying principle of the exclusionary clause, E-EPA is the relevant \"article\"when the purported \"dietary supplements\" at contain E-EPA and (ii) emphasize E-EPA in the waythat they are manufactured or promoted. In thoseinstances, it is clear that the Proposed Respondents areimporting or selling E-EPA, not common fish oil, ornTG-EPA. To adequately protect investment in drugdevelopment and the resulting innovation, E-EPA,which gained recognition in the marketplace as a \"newdrug\", as explained in paragraphs 80-83, cannot bemarketed as, or incorporated into, \"dietarysupplements.\" 76. The affected products are identified in Exhibits 1-A - 4-A, 6-A - 7-A, most predominant component in these purified E-EPAproducts and E-OM3 mixtures. Id. Upon information and belief, these products are manufactured byfollowing the same basic steps that drug companiesfollow, as summarized in paragraphs 42-51 of thecomplaint. In addition, as demonstrated in theattached charts, these prod ucts are typically promotedApp. 145 not just for their EPA content - but for their chemically concentrated EPA content - which would not be possible but for the ethyl ester form. Tables 3 and 4 . The chemical cleaving of the glycerol backbone from the nTG-OM3 and the reaction with the ethanol to form E-EPA or E-OM3 enables EPA to be substantiallyheightened to a level beyond that which exists innature. EPA in its natural triglyceride form cannot beheightened to the same level. 77. Moreover, the esterification of EPA - i.e., the ethyl ester form - allows these products to beconcentrated and differentiates these products fromcommon fish oil or other natural sources of EPA. Aconsumer would have to consume a likely intolerableamount of common fish oil or common krill oil in aneffort to even get the same dosage of E-EPA inVascepa\u00ae, a highly pure form of E-EPA. For example,a 300 mg capsule of MegaRed\u00ae Omega-3 Krill Oilcontains approximately 50 mg of natural EPA in eachcapsule, see MegaRed Website, Exhibit 43, whereas a 1 gram capsule of Vascep a\u00ae contains 1000 mg of E- EPA. See Vascepa\u00ae Full Prescribing Information. Exhibit 15. Given that the FDA-approved dose of Vascepa\u00ae to reduce triglyceri de levels in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is 4000 mg per day(e.g., two, 1 gram capsules twice a day), consumers would have to take approximately 80 capsules ofMegaRed\u00ae Omega-3 Krill Oil daily to get a similardose of EPA from that prod uct as they would get from four, 1 gram capsules of Vascepa\u00ae. 78. For this reason, companies often tout their chemically manipulated products containing E-EPA asApp. 146 being comparable to drugs that contain E-EPA ( e.g., \"Most fish oils are not the same as Lovaza. But some Are! A few over-the counter pharmaceutical grade fishoils [sic] are just as potent, pure and effective atreducing triglycerides as Lovaza,\" see Omega Via Website, Exhibit 44; see also OmegaVia Website 2, Exhibit 45 (making implicit comparisons ofOmegaVia's so-called \"pharmaceutical grade fish oil\"products to both Vascepa\u00ae and (another FDA-approved drug product)). 79. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products that contain E-EPA, and emphasize thatcomponent in the manufacture and/or promotion of theproduct, are excluded from the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" under subsection of - E-EPA - gained recognition in themarketplace by being studied as a \"drug,\" as explained below. And upon information and belief, SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products that incorporate E-EPAare not saved from exclusion from the \"dietarysupplement\" definition by the \"prior market clause\"because E-EPA was never lega lly marketed as food or as a \"dietary supplement.\" 80. E-EPA first gained recognition in the marketplace as a drug when it was clinically studied asa drug in the United States in the mid-1980s, if notearlier. Studies on E-EPA, in E-OM3 mixtures, beganto proliferate after the Biomedical Test MaterialsProgram (\"BTM Program\") was created in 1986. See Sylvia B. Galloway, Ph.D., Biomedical Test MaterialsProgram: Drug Master Files for Biomedical TestApp. 147 Materials, Produced From Refined Menhaden Oil, and Their Placebos, United States Department ofCommerce, October 1989 (1989 BTM Report), Exhibit 46, at 1-1, 2-1, 2-2. The BTM Program was created by the National Oceanogr aphic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\") and the National Institutesof Health (\"NIH\")/Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and MentalHealth Administration (\"ADAMHA\"), and it providedstandardized test materials to help researchers betteridentify the role of different forms of omega-3 fattyacids on health and disease. See id. at 1-1. The standardized test materials included an E-OM3mixture that contained E-EPA as its principalcomponent. See id. at 2-3. Specifically, fatty acid ethyl esters, as well asother components. See id. Notably, the test materials, by chemically converting the EPA to ethyl ester form,increased the level of EPA in the mixture byapproximately 26%. Typically, common fish oil contains18% EPA. The availability of the test materials wasannounced on a number of occasions in the NIH Guidefor Grants and Contracts, starting on May 29, 1987;requests from researchers were received by June 1987;and the BTM Program began shipping materials bySeptember 1987. See id. at 2-1. Notably, in a February 1988 announcement, the program was explicit that\"[i]n accordance with federal regulations, an[investigational new drug (\"IND\")] number will berequired for the use of these materials in humanstudies.\" NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, Vol. 17,No. 5, Feb. 12, 1988, Exhibit 47 at 1; see also 1989 BTM Report, Exhibit 46, at 2-1. In 1989, the BTMApp. 148 Program also made purified mixtures of E-EPA and E- DHA available for study. See P.H. Fair, Biomedical Test Materials Program: Distribution ManagementManual, Department of Commerce, Dec. 1989 (1989BTM Distribution Manual), Exhibit 48. The E-EPA mixture contained >95% ethyl esters (of were<1 % and omega-6 fatty acids were <1%). See id. at 5. 81. Upon information and belief, no \"dietary supplement\" or food containing E-EPA was legallymarketed prior to these studies. In the late 1980s, FDAwas skeptical that any omega-3 products, even thosecontaining common fish oil (i.e., nTG-OM3), were marketed legally. Many, if not all, of the omega-3products at the time, were marketed with promotionalclaims that rendered them unapproved new drugs. In1988, FDA sent more than 50 letters to manufacturersand distributors of omega-3 products citing them forthat illegal practice. See, e.g., FDA Letter to Barth Vitamin Corp., dated April 1988 (and related letters),Exhibit 49. For example, an FDA letter to American Health Products stated that the promotional materialdistributed with a product, known as SuperEPA(i) suggested that the product may be useful in \"theprevention or treatment of cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, heart disease, platelet aggregation,immune system effects, and the lowering of blood levelsof cholesterol and triglycerides\" and (ii) rendered theproduct an unapproved \"new drug\" under the FDCA.See FDA Letter to American Health Products, dated May 18, 1988, Exhibit 50 .App. 149 82. In addition, in the late 1980s and in the 1990s (at least before the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, P.L. 103-417, amended the FDCA), no omega-3 supplements had been authorizedfor use by FDA as food ingredients, and agencystatements reveal that the agency considered them tobe unsafe \"any use of which results or may reasonably beexpected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becominga component or otherwise affecting the characteristicsof any food\" that is not (i) generally recognized as safe(\"GRAS\") or (ii) used in food prior to January 1, 1958, and shown to be safe through scientific procedures orcommon use. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(s). Substances fallingwithin the definition of \"food additive\" are deemed\"unsafe\" as a matter of law and marketing them isillegal when FDA has not approved them throughregulation. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 348(a)(2), 342(a)(1)(C)(i). In1990, FDA sent a letter to a trade association statingthat: We have continued concerns about anyfood use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fattyacids. We are unaware of any history ofuse of these subs tances as food ingredients prior to 1958, and FDA hasnot listed omega-3 polyunsaturated fattyacids as approved food additives or asbeing generally recognized as safe[GRAS]. Thus, addition of thesesubstances to foods may render thosefoods adulterated under 21 U.S.C.342(a)(2)(C).App. 150 See FDA Letter to R. William Soller, dated June 20, 1990, Exhibit 51. Further, when FDA affirmed natural menhaden oil to be GRAS in 1997, the agency noted that it declined to make the same determination in1989 because the oil contained high levels of theomega-3 fatty acids, EPA an d DHA, which were known to have physiologic effects, such as effects on bloodclotting. 62 Fed. Reg. 30751, 30752 (June 5, 1997),Exhibit 52. In other words, in 1989, FDA did not believe that nTG-OM3 in menhaden oil, or itscomponents nTG-EPA or andas such, nTG-OM3, nTG-EP A, and nTG-DHA could not have avoided the designation of \"food additive\" at thattime. If nTG-OM3, nTG-EPA, and nTG-DHA could not have avoided the designation of\"food additive\" until 1997, there is no basis to supportthe lawful marketing of E-OM3 and E-EPA as GRASingredients prior to that time. 83. Accordingly, for purported \"dietary supplements\" containing E-EPA to be saved fromexclusion from the \"dietary supplement\" definition, aproduct must be identified that contained E-EPA that (i) was marketed before the proliferation of E-EPAclinical studies in the mid-1980s, (ii) was not anunapproved new drug, based on the manner in whichit was promoted, (iii) did not contain an unsafe \"foodadditive,\" and (iv) was not otherwise illegallymarketed. Upon information and belief, no such\"unicorn\" exists.App. 151 b. Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products are actually unapproved \"new drugs\" under the FDCA 84. Section 201(g)(1) of the FDCA defines the term \"drug\" as (A) \"articles\" recognized officialUnited States or officialNational Formulary (\"NF\") beencombined into one publication, the \"USP/NF\");(B) \"articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure,mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in manor other animals;\" (C) \"articles (other than food)intended to affect the structure or any function of thebody of man or other animals;\" and/or (D) \"articlesintended for use as a component of any articlesspecified in clause (A), (B), or (C).\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 see also describi ng \"disease\" claims under subsection (B)). 85. Products that meet the definition of \"dietary supplement,\" however, are subject to a safe harbor - they may be promoted with claims indicating that theyare intended to affect the structure or function of thebody without invoking drug status. 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 321(g)(1). But, because the Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products are not \"dietary supplements,\" theyare not subject to that safe harbor. Thus, theSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products are \"drugs\"if they meet any of the four prongs of the \"drug\"definition contained in Section 201 (g)(1)(A)-(D) of theFDCA - including if they are intended to affect theApp. 152 structure or function of the body. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(1)(A)-(D). 86. FDA need not deem products to be \"drugs,\" for them to be \"drugs.\" Products are \"drugs\" if they meet any of the four prongs of the definition of \"drug\"in the FDCA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(1). Drug sponsorsoften take steps toward drug approval before any FDA involvement at all. Typically, basic scientists collectdata from animal studies. If the data look promising,the drug company develops a prototype drug, and itseeks permission from FDA to begin clinical testing inhumans by way of an IND application. See id. \u00a7 355(i). Once the clinical trials are conducted, the sponsor maysubmit an NDA, and if FDA believes that the drug issafe and effective, that the proposed labeling isappropriate, and that manufacturing methods assurethat the drug's identity, st rength, quality, and purity, then the agency w ill approve the drug. See id. \u00a7 355(d). At that point, the drug may be legally marketed. Inother words, it is incumbent upon the sponsor of a\"drug\" to recognize that a product is a \"drug\" pursuant to the definition in the FDCA, and to comply withFDA's regulatory requiremen ts for \"drugs\" accordingly. See generally, Susan Thaul, How FDA Approves Drugs and Regulates Their Safety and Effectiveness,Congressional Research Service, June 25, 2012,Exhibit 53 . 87. Sponsors of products that meet the definition of \"drug,\" that fail to comply with FDA's drug approval process are engaging in a prohibited act. The FDCA expressly prohibits the introduction or delivery forintroduction of an unapproved \"new drug\" intoApp. 153 interstate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 And, as a practical matter, all unapproved \"drugs\" are also unapproved \"new drugs.\" Products that meet the definition of\"drug\" are \"new drugs\" under Section 201(p) of theFDCA if they are not generally recognized by qualifiedexperts as safe and effectiv e for their intended uses. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p). To be so \"g enerally recognized,\" the Supreme Court has found that, among other things,there must be a consensus of expert opinion that a drugis safe and effective based on \"substantial evidence,\" asthat term is defined in Section FDCA. SeeWeinberger v. Hynson, Wescott & Dunning Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 632 (1973) (citing 21 U.S.C. 355(d)). Notably, the Hynson decision effectively incorporates FDA's \"new drug\" approval standard for efficacy into the \"newdrug\" definition. See id. Since 1975, FDA has opposed virtually every attempt to deem a \"new drug\" asgenerally recognized by qualified experts as safe for theuses mentioned in the labeling by any mechanism otherthan FDA approval. See David G. Adams, et al., Food and Drug Law and Regulation (3d. 2015), at p. 298,Exhibit 54 . In other words, practically speaking, to avoid designation as a \"new drug,\" a product thatmeets the definition of \"drug,\" must be approved byFDA. 88. Some sponsors of products that are \"drugs,\" pursuant to the \"drug\" definition, may attempt toillegally evade the drug approval requirements byhiding the identity of these products with false labels,such as \"dietary supplement,\" or even \"medical food\" -because products that actually meet those definitionsare exempt from certain \"drug\" requirements, includingApp. 154 premarket review. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 321(g), (ff), 360ee(b)(3). But if the products do not ac tually meet the definitions of those terms in the statute, and they meet the definition of the term \"drug ,\" then they are unapproved \"new drugs.\" Because and\"medical foods\" are not subject to premarket review,FDA would not review the labeling of those productsbefore the products are marketed or have the occasionto consider whether the products are actuallyunapproved \"new drugs.\" And, once the products are on the market, FDA still may not be aware of thestatements made in the labeling or have the occasion toconsider whether the products are actually unapproved\"new drugs.\" Accordingly, the sponsors' falsestatements may go undetected. 89. When FDA detects such false labeling and has the requisite resources to pursue the violation, it may send a warning letter to the violator. For example,in late May and early June of this year, FDA sent threeseparate warning letters to different companies thatcited them for selling products containing syntheticsteroids as \"dietary supplements\" when in fact (1) theproducts did not meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement,\" and (2) the products were actuallyunapproved \"new drugs.\" See FDA Warning Letter to Flex Fitness Products and Big Dan's Fitness, datedMay 25, 2017, Exhibit 55; FDA Warning Letter to Hardcore Formulations, dated June 5, 2017, Exhibit 56; FDA Warning Letter to AndroPharm LLC, dated June 5, 2017, Exhibit 57 . 90. FDA has taken similar actions against approved \"new drugs\" falsely labeled as \"medicalApp. 155 foods.\" For example, FDA took action in May 2017 against Enzymotec Ltd. (and one of its suppliers) forfalsely positioning three omega-3 fatty acid products - Vayarol\u00ae, Varyarin\u00ae, and Vayacog\u00ae - as \"medicalfoods,\" when they were actually unapproved \"newdrugs.\" See BRIEF-Enzymotec Ltd- FDA issued import alert that included vayarin vayacogproducts, Reuters.com, May 10, 2017, Exhibit 58;Import Alert 66-41, Detention Without PhysicalExamination of Unapproved New Drugs Promoted inthe U.S., dated June 19, 2017, Exhibit 59; Enzymotec Ltd., SEC Form 6-K, dated May 2017, Exhibit 60; FDA Warning Letter to Rainbow Gold Products, Inc.dated May 4, 2017, Exhibit 61 (citing Vayarin\u00ae as an unapproved \"new drug\"). 91. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products come in molecular forms ( e.g., E-EPA, rTG-EPA, E-OM3, and rTG-OM 3) and, typically, in two different physical forms ( i.e., in liquid form, as an oil for use in or as a \"dietary supplement,\" or in anencapsulated form, for use as a \"dietary supplement\").Each Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Product is a\"drug\" because it triggers on e or more elements of the \"drug\" definition, and the elements in the \"drug\"definition triggered by each product depend on themolecular and physical form of the product. App. 156 i. All of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products meet the definition of a) Encapsulated E-OM3 92. The encapsulated E-OM3 products subject to this complaint are \"drugs\" because they meet at least one of the four prongs of the \"drug\" definition. See id. With regard to the first pr ong, subsection 201(g)(1)(A) of the Vol. 2 (2017), at 5430-5433. Exhibit 62. Notably, to be \"recognized\" in the USP, products needonly meet the definition of a product named in theUSP; they need not comply with compendial identitystandards. (USP40-NF35), at xiii,\u00a7 2.30. Exhibit 63. (Recognized products that do not meet the compendialidentity standards are \"drugs\" that are adulterated,misbranded or both. See psules that include E-DHA as well as five other omega-3 fatty acids in ethyl ester esterform). (USP40-NF35), Vol. 2 (2017), Exhibit 62, at 5430-5433. Upon information and belief, all of the encapsulated E-OM3 products identified inthis complaint (and attachments hereto) meet thatdefinition. Accordingly, they are all \"recognized\" in theUSP, and therefore, are \"drugs.\" 93. With regard to the second and third prongs of the \"drug\" definition, subsections 201(g)(1)(B) andApp. 157 201(g)(1)(C) of the FDCA, all of the Proposed Respondents' E-OM3 capsules named in this complaint(except those sold by Ultimate) are clearly intended toaffect disease and/or the structure/function of the body.Under FDA's regulations, evidence that a product isintended to be used as \"drug\" includes advertising,labeling, or \"other oral or written statements\" by theentities that are legally responsible for the labeling ofthe drug, as well as the circumstances surrounding thedistribution of the product. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.128. As set forth in Section VII below, the Promotional Materialsassociated with each of these products (except thosesold by Ultimate) indicate that the products areintended to affect disease and/or the structure functionof the body. Moreover, upon information and belief, thecircumstances of sale corroborate that intent. 94. With regard to the fourth prong of the \"drug\" definition, subsection 201(g)(1)(D) of the FDCA, uponinformation and belief, the encapsulated E-OM3products sold by Ultimate are intended for use as acomponent of a \"drug.\" b) E-OM3 in Oil Form 95. The E-OM3 products in oil form are \"drugs\" because they meet at least one of the four prongs of the\"drug\" definition. With regard to the first prong,subsection 201(g)(1)(A) of the FDCA, \"Omega-3-AcidEthyl Esters\" (in oil form) are named in the drugUSP/NF, see USP/NF (USP40-NF35), Vol. 2 (2017), at 5428-5430, to the USP/NF, Acid Esters\" are of ethylesters, principally E-EPA and E-DHA, that may alsocontain one of five other omega-3 fatty acids. See id.App. 158 Upon information and belief, all E-OM3 sold by the Proposed Respondents in oil form meet this definition.Therefore, they are recognized in the USP/NF, and assuch are \"drugs.\" 96. With regard to the second and third prongs of the \"drug\" definition, subsections 201(g)(1)(B) and201(g)(1)(C) of the FDCA, all of the ProposedRespondents' E-OM3 oil named in this complaint(except that sold by Ultimate) is clearly intended toaffect disease and/or the structure/function of the body.As set forth in Section VII below, the PromotionalMaterials associated with each of these products(except those sold by Ultimate) indicate that theproducts are intended to affect disease and/or thestructure function of the body. Moreover, uponinformation and belief, the circumstances of salecorroborate that intent. 97. With regard to the fourth prong of the \"drug\" definition, subsection 201(g)(1)(D) of the FDCA, uponinformation and belief, the E-OM3 oil sold by Ultimateis intended for use as a component of a \"drug.\" c) E-EPA, rTG-EPA, and rTG- 98. E-EPA, rTG-EPA, and rTG-OM3, as well as other forms of E-OM3, are \"drugs\" because they meetone or more of the prongs of the definition of \"drug\" inthe FDCA. With regard to the second and third prong,namely subsections 201(g)(1 )(B) and 201(g)(1)(C), most of these products are intended to affect disease and/orthe structure/function of the body. As set forth inApp. 159 Section VII below, the Promotional Materials associated with each of these products (except thosesold by Ultimate and Nordic Pharma) indicate that theproducts are intended to affect disease and/or thestructure function of the body. Moreover, uponinformation and belief, the circumstances of salecorroborate that intent. 99. With regard to the fourth prong, subsection 201(g)(1)(D) of the FDCA, upon information and belief,when these substances are sold by Ultimate and NordicPharma, they are intended for use as a component of a\"drug.\" ii. All of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Productsare unapproved \"new drugs\" 100. All Synthetically also \"new drugs\" under Section 201(p) ofthe FDCA because they are not generally recognized byqualified experts as safe and effective for their intendeduses. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p). 101. As mentioned above, as a practical matter, for a drug to be generally recognized by qualified expertsas safe and effective for its intended uses, it has to beFDA-approved. None of the Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products is an FDA-approved drug. See List of FDA Approved Icosapent Ethyl Drugs (E-EPA) inOrange Book, Exhibit 16 (listing Products); List ofFDA-Approved Omega-3 Ethyl Ester Drugs in theOrange Exhibit 17 (same). Thus, they are all \"new drugs\" - and indeed, unapproved \"new drugs.\"App. 160 2. The other elements for false advertising and contributory false advertising under the Lanham Actare met 102. The Promotional Materials associated with all of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products(except for those sold by Ultimate) indicate that theproducts are for use in, or as \"dietary supplements,\"Exhibits 1-B - 7-B, 8-A-ii. - 12-M-ii. As explained above, falsely labeling or promoting these products as\"dietary supplements\" is literally false for two reasons:(1) the products do not meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff), and (2) calling theproducts \"dietary supplements\" hides material factthat the products are actually unapproved \"new drugs.\" 103. Because these statements are literally false, they have the capacity to deceive a substantial segmentof potential consumers, and this deception is presumedto be material to consumer purchasing decisions.Indeed, the express use of a false moniker and the failure to disclose the unappr oved \"new drug\" status of the products is undoubtedly material. If consumersknew that the products were illegally marketedunapproved \"new drugs\" and that, as such, it wasunclear whether the products were safe and effective,it would influence the cons umers' purchasing decisions. 104. All of the Proposed Respondents (except Ultimate) are causing the lit erally false statements to enter interstate commerce, Exhibit 1-B - 7-B and 8- A-ii - 12-M-ii . Finally, the false statements of the Proposed Respondents (except Ultimate) about theirApp. 161 products have injured, or are likely to injure, Amarin, as discussed in paragraphs 217-238. 105. Further, upon information and belief, as set forth in Section VII, Ultimate and Nordic Pharma Inc. are contributorily liable under the Lanham Act forknowingly inducing or causing the entities distributingtheir products, respectively, Nature's Bounty andNordic Naturals, to falsely advertise their products as\"dietary supplements,\" or for materially participatingin that illegal conduct. B. Proposed Respondents' Importation And Sale Of The Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products Violate Section 337Based On The Standards Set Forth InThe FDCA 106. The importation and sale of the Proposed Respondents' Synthetica lly Produced Omega-3 Products constitute unfair acts or unfair methods ofcompetition under Section 337 based upon thestandards set forth in the FDCA. As discussed inparagraphs 61-83, none of Proposed Respondents'Synthetically Produced addition, the products are actuallyunapproved the FDCA. also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f). The introduction, or delivery for introduction, intointerstate commerce of any unapproved \"new drug\"violates the standards set fo rth in Section 505(a) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7\u00a7 (c)App. 162 107. As explained in paragraphs 86-87, products that meet the definition of \"drug\" in the FDCA, id. \u00a7 321(g), must follow the requirements in the FDCA and its implementing regulations that apply to \"drugs,\"regardless of whether FDA has acknowledged that theproducts are \"drugs.\" As explained below, none of theSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products follows anumber of these requirements, and as such, they aremisbranded drugs in violation of the standards setforth in Section 502 of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352, and adulterated drugs, in violation of Section 501 of theFDCA, id. \u00a7 351. 108. Section 502(a) of the FDCA prohibits \"labeling\" that is \"false or misleading in \u00a7 352(a); see also U.S.C. \u00a7 the term \"labeling\" as \"all labels and otherwritten, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any articleor any of its containers or wrappers, or(2) accompanying such article\"). In addition, Section502(n) of the FDCA similarly prohibits promotionalmaterial other than labeling from being false ormisleading. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352( n); 21 C.F.R.\u00a7 for all of the Distributors' SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products is false, at minimum,because it falsely asserts th at the products are \"dietary supplements,\" or it falsely implies that they are\"dietary supplements\" by using some modification ofthat term. Exhibits 8-A-ii - 12-M-ii . Similarly, the Promotional Materials associated with theManufacturer's products (except for Ultimate'sproducts) are false because they provide that theproducts at issue are for use in, or as \"dietarysupplements.\" Exhibits 1-B - 7-B .App. 163 109. Further, Section 502(f) of the FDCA provides that drugs are misbranded if their labeling fails to bear \"adequate directions for use.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f).\"Adequate directions for use\" means \"directions underwhich the layman can use a drug safely and for thepurposes for which it is intended.\" 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.5.According to FDA, Prescription drugs can only be used safelyat the direction, and under thesupervision, of a licensed practitioner.Therefore, it is impossible to write\"adequate directions for use\" forprescription drugs. FDA-approved drugswhich bear their FDA-approved labelingare exempt from the requirement thatthey bear adequate directions for use by alayperson. But otherwise, all prescriptiondrugs by definition lack adequatedirections for use by a layperson. See, e.g., FDA Warning Letter to Flex Fitness Products and Big Dan's Fitness, dated May 25, 2017, Exhibit 55 (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 353(b)(1)(A), because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of theiruse, or the collateral measur es necessary for their use. See id. Indeed, all products containing synthetically produced omega-3 that have been approved by FDA are prescription drugs. See List of FDA-Approved Icosapent Ethyl (E-EPA) Drugs in FDA-Approved Omega-3 Ethyl Ester Drugs in theApp. 164 Orange Book, Exhibit 17. As explained in paragraphs 84-101, all of the Distributors' Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products are intended for \"drug\" uses (i.e., to affect the structure/function of the body and/or to affect disease), Exhibits 8-A-iii - 12-M-iii, 8-A-iv - 12-M-iv ; Table 1. Those uses have not b een approved by FDA, and therefore, the labeling for the products at issuedoes not, and cannot, contain adequate directions forthose uses. Accordingly, those products are misbrandedin violation of Section 502(f). 110. Further, upon information and belief, all of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products aremisbranded drugs under Section 502(o) of the FDCAbecause they were manufactured, prepared,propagated, compounded, or processed in anestablishment not duly registered under Section 510 ofthe FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or the products at issue were not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) ofthe FDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j). Id. \u00a7 352(o). 111. In addition, upon information and belief, all of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products areadulterated for failure to comply with current goodmanufacturing practices for drugs, in violation of thestandards set forth in Section 501(a)(2)(B) of theFDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). 112. The introduction, or delivery for introduction, into interstate commerce of any unapproved \"new drug\"that violates Section 505(a) of the FDCA, and/or any adulterated or misbranded drug that violates Sections501 and/or 502 of the FDCA, is prohibited by Section30l(d) and (a) of the FDCA. Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d).App. 165 113. Finally, the drugs,\" and adulterated an d misbranded \"drugs,\" from entering the United States under Section 801(a) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 381(a), when the \"drugs\" have been manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, orprocessed in a foreign establishment that is notregistered in accordance with Section 510(i) of theFDCA. Upon information and belief all of the productssold by the Manufacturers were manufactured,prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed insuch a foreign establishment. Section 801(a) requiresFDA to (1) sample any drugs that have beenmanufactured in an unregistered establishment, and(2) examine samples to determine whether any appearto be misbranded, adulterated, or unapproved newdrugs. See Cook v. FDA, 733 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2013). If FDA finds an apparent FDCA violation (e.g., that a product is an unapproved, misbranded, andadulterated \"new drug\"), it must refuse the drugadmission to the United States. See id. VII.

Id. \u00a7\u00a7 321(g), (p), addition, Croda's E-OM3 oil and its rTG- OM3 oil are (1) falsely promoted for use in \"dietarysupplements\" when they cannot legally be used for thatpurpose and they are actually unapproved \"new drugs,\"in violation of the standards set forth in Section 502(n)App. 186 of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(n), Exhibits 6-B-i - 6-B-iv; (2) upon information and belief, as explained in paragraph 110, misbranded drugs under Section 502(o)of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(o), because they were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, orprocessed in an establishment not duly registeredunder Section 510 of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) of theFDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j); and (3) upon information and belief, as explained in paragraph 111, adulterated drugsbecause they were not manufactured in compliancewith current good manufacturing practices for drugs, inviolation of the standards set forth in Section501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B).). 154. Croda also violates the standard set forth in Section 301 of the FDCA. Section 301 of the FDCAprohibits the introduction, or delivery for introduction,into interstate commerce of any unapproved \"new drug\" that violates Section 505(a) of the FDCA, and/or anyadulterated or misbranded drug that violates Sections501 and/or 502 of the FDCA. Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d). 155. In addition, Croda violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the provisions of theLanham Act. Specifically, Cr oda is falsely stating that its E-OM3 oil and its rTG-OM3 oil can be used in\"dietary supplements,\" Exhibits 6-B-i - 6-B-iv, when these products are actually unapproved \"new drugs\";these literally false statements have the capacity todeceive consumers and are likely to influencepurchasing decisions; Croda caused these falsestatements to enter interstate commerce; and asApp. 187 discussed in paragraphs 217- 238, Amarin is likely to be injured as a result. TASA 156. Proposed Respondent Tecnologica de Alimentos S.A. (\"TASA\") is a manufacturer of Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products. Complainants have obtained data from Datamyne, Inc. showing that TASA shipped to the United States 16.61metric tons of oil, including \"Concentrate Omega 3 EE33/22\" on or about July 17, 2017; 32.37 metric tons ofoil, including \"Omega 3 Fish Oil EE 33-22,\" on or aboutJuly 6, 2017; 17.10 metric tons of oil, including \"Omega 3 Fish Oil EE 33-22\" on or about June 7, 2017; 16.23 metric tons of oil, including \"Fish Oil EE 33-22\" on orabout May 15, 2017; and 80 drums of \"PeruvianRefined Anchovy Omega 3 Fish Oil EE 33-22\" in March2017.

Omega-3concentrates according to the needs of our customerswith different concentration levels of EE and TG.\"Exhibits 7-A-i and, upon information and belief \"TG\" stands for rTG-OM3. See id. 158. TASA violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates certain standards in the FDCA.Specifically, the E-OM3 oil sold by TASA cannot meetthe fromthe definition of \"dietary supplement\" by theApp. 188 exclusionary clause, id. \u00a7 321(ff)(3), as explained in paragraphs 71-83. In addition, as explained in paragraph 95, it is a \"drug\" because, upon information and belief, it is a drug recognized in the USP/NF.Exhibit 64. It is also a drug because it is intended to affect the structure/function of the body and to affectdisease, as evidenced by, among other things,structure/function and disease promotional claimsmade by TASA. For example, TASA'sstructure/function claims include the following: \"HIGHOmega levels related to . The 1% increase in the Omega-3 Index I related to an increase of 1.23 inthe substitution test (LDST).\" Exhibit 7-C ; Table 2. In addition, TASA's disease claims include: Low Omega-3 consumptionCONTRIBUTES to study (GBD2013), which quantifies thehealth of the population andopportunities for prevention, concludesthat low levels of omega-3 intake mayincrease the risk of disease . . . Exhibit 7-D-i ; Table 2. As explained in paragraphs 100-101, this product is also an unapproved \"new drug\"under the FDCA. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 321(g), (p), 355(a). 159. Similarly, rTG-OM3 oil sold by TASA cannot meet the definition of \"dietary supplement\" because itis not a \"dietary ingredient ,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1), as explained in paragraphs 61-71. Rather, it is a drugbecause it is intended to affect the structure/function ofthe body and to affect disease, as evidenced by, amongApp. 189 other things, the same structure/function and disease promotional claims made by TASA cited above. Asexplained in paragraphs 100-101, this product is unapproved under the addition, TASA's E-OM3 oil and its rTG- OM3 oil are (1) falsely promoted for use in \"dietarysupplements,\" by TASA, wh en they cannot legally be used for that purpose and they are actually unapproved\"new drugs,\" in violation of the standards set forth inSection 502(n) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(n), Exhibits 7-B- i - 7-B-ii ; (2) upon information and belief, as explained in paragraph 110, misbranded drugs under Section502(o) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(o), because they were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, orprocessed in an establishment not duly registeredunder Section 510 of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) of theFDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j); and (3) upon information and belief, as explained in paragraph 110, adulterated drugsbecause they were nor manufactured in compliancewith current good manufacturi ng practices for drugs, in violation of the standards set forth in Section501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B).). 161. TASA also violates the standard set forth in Section 301 of the FDCA. Section 301 of the FDCAprohibits the introduction, or delivery for introduction,into interstate commerce of any unapproved \"new drug\" that violates Section 505(a) of the FDCA, and/or any adulterated or misbranded drug that violates Sections501 and/or 502 of the FDCA. Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d).App. 190 162. In addition, TASA violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the provisions of the Lanham Act. Specifically, TASA is falsely stating thatits E-OM3 oil and its rTG-OM3 oil can be used in\"dietary supplements,\" Exhibits 7-B-i - 7-B-ii , when these products are actually unapproved \"new drugs;\"these literally false statements have the capacity todeceive consumers and are likely to influencepurchasing decisions; TASA caused these falsestatements to enter interstate commerce; and asdiscussed in paragraphs 217- 238, Amarin is likely to be injured as a result.

Accordingly, the Sundown Naturals\u00ae SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products containing concentratedfish oil are imported. 168. Nature's Bounty violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates standards established inthe FDCA. Specifically, the E-OM3 capsules sold byNature's Bounty cannot meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because E-OM3 is not a \"dietaryingredient,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1), as explained inparagraphs 61-71, and it is excluded from the definition of \"dietary supplement\" by the exclusionary clause, id. \u00a7 321(ff)(3), as explained in paragraphs 71-83. Inaddition, as explained in paragraph 92, the capsulesare \"drugs\" because, upon information and belief, theyare recognized in the USP/NF. Exhibit 62. The capsules are also \"drugs\" because they are intended toaffect the structure/function of the body and to affectdisease, as evidenced by, among other things,structure/function and disease promotional claimsmade by Nature's Bounty ( Table 1 (listing structure/function claims and disease claims for all ofDistributors' products)). 169. Similarly, the rTG-OM3 capsules sold by Nature's Bounty cannot meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because rTG-OM3 is not a \"dietaryingredient,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 as explained inparagraphs 61-71.

Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d). 173. Nature's Bounty also violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the provisions of theLanham Act. Specifically, Nature's Bounty is falselystating on the product labels for all of its E-OM3 andrTG-OM3 products that they are \"dietarysupplements,\" Exhibits 8-A-ii - 8-N-ii , when these products are actually unapproved \"new drugs;\" theseliterally false statements have the capacity to deceiveconsumers and are likely to influence purchasingdecisions; Nature's Bounty caused these falsestatements to enter interstate commerce, Exhibits 8- A-ii - 8-N-ii ; and as discussed in paragraphs 216-237, Amarin is likely to be injured as a result. Nordic Naturals 174. Proposed Respondent Nordic Naturals is a U.S. distributor of Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products.

In addition, at least one unit each of Nordic Naturals Complete Omega XTRA and NordicNaturals ProOmega Blood Sugar has been sold in theUnited States. Confidential Exhibit 70. Accordingly, the Nordic Naturals Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products containing concentrated fish oil are imported. 176. Notably, many of these products ( i.e., those designated as \"Professional Product\") are marketeddirectly to health care professionals ( see, e.g., Exhibits 9-AA-i-a, 9-UU-i-a ). But, at least as a general matter, the purported \"Professional Products\" also areApp. 199 available to the general public on Amazon.com, see, e.g., Exhibits, 9-O:-vi, 9-II-vi-a, 9-AA-vi-a, 9-GG-vi-a . 177.

Upon information and belief, given that all of the products listed abovecontain EPA in concentrations above, or in ratiosdifferent from, common fish oil, see id., all of these products contain rTG-OM3. 178. Nordic Naturals violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the standards establishedin the FDCA. Specifically, th e products containing rTG- OM3 sold by Nordic Naturals cannot as in paragraphs 61- 71. These products are also \"drugs\" because they are intended to affect thestructure/function of the body and to affect disease, asevidenced by, among other things, structure/functionand disease promotional claims made by NordicNaturals for those products . For example, the Nordic Naturals website contains structure/function claimsthat apply to all of the products, such as \"Extensiveresearch has documented the health benefits of EPAand DHA, which include not only a healthy heart, but brain and cognitive function, joint mobility, eye health,pregnancy and lactation, healthy skin and hair, and anormally functioning response.\" 9 - UU-iii-b. Similarly, the website contains diseaseApp. 200 claims that apply to all of the products such as \"Protects against age-relate d oxidative the progression of age-related memory loss,\"\"Supports internal systems that operate inresponse to physical stress,\" \"Omega-3 consumptionmay reduce the risk of allergies in children,\" and\"Omega-3 consumption may reduce the risk of colds ininfants.\" - 9-U-iv, . Other structure/ function and disease claims for these products arelisted in Table 1. 179. In addition, the Nordic Naturals rTG-OM3 products are (1) falsely labeled as \"dietarysupplements,\" in violation of the standards set forth inSection 502(a) and/or (n) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 352(a), (n), when they canno t legally be used for that purpose and they are actually unapproved \"new drugs,\"Exhibit 9-A-ii - 9-UU-ii ; (2) misbranded as a matter of law, in violation of Section 502(f), as explained inparagraph 109, because they are \"prescription drugs\"that have not been approved by FDA, and therefore,the labeling fails to contain adequate directions for use,21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1), 353(b)(2); ofthe FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(o), because they were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, orprocessed in an establishment not duly registeredunder Section 510 of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) of theFDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j); and (4) upon information and belief, adulterated drugs because th ey were not manufacturedApp. 201 in compliance with current good manufacturing practices for drugs, in violation of the standards setforth in Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). 180.

Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d). 181. Nordic Naturals also violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the provisions of theLanham Act. Specifically, Nordic Naturals is falselystating on the product labels for all of its products thatthey are \"dietary supplements,\" Exhibits 9-A-ii - 9- UU-ii , when these products are actually unapproved \"new drugs;\" these literally false statements have thecapacity to deceive consumers and are likely toinfluence purchasing decisions; Nordic Naturals causedthese false statements to enter interstate commerce,Exhibits 9-A-ii - 9-UU-ii ; and as discussed in paragraphs 217-238, Amarin is likely to be injured asa result. Pharmavite LLC/Nature Made 182. Proposed Respondent Pharmavite LLC is a U.S. distributor of Nature Made-branded importedSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products. Inparticular, Pharmavite sells at least the followingSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products in theUnited States under the Nature Made brand: Fish-OilOne Per Day Burpless (E-OM3), Exhibit 10-A ; FishApp. 202 Oil One Per Day (E-OM3), Exhibit 10-B ; Fish Oil Pearls (E-OM3), Exhibit 10-C ; Full Strength Mini Omega-3 (E-OM3), Exhibit 10-D ; Omega-3 with Xtra Absorb (E-OM3), Exhibit 10-E ; Triple Omega (E- OM3), Exhibit 10-F; and Ultra Omega-3 (E-OM3), Exhibit 10-G . 183. According to the applicable country of origin markings on the Nature Made Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products, Norway is the country of origin ofthe fish oil used in Full Strength Mini Omega-3product, Exhibit 10-D-vi-b, and the Omega-3 with Xtra Absorb product, Exhibit 10-E-vi-b. Colombia is the country of origin of the fi sh oil used in the Fish Oil Pearls product, Exhibit 10-C-vi-b . Canada is the country of origin of the fish oil used in the Fish Oil OnePer Day, Burpless product, Exhibit 10-A-vi-b and the Fish Oil One Per Day product, Exhibit 10-B-vi-b . The Triple Omega product also is imported into the UnitedStates. Although the Triple Omega product does notcontain country of origin markings visible on theNature Made website, there are no known commercial-grade fish oil concentration production facilities in theUnited States. Confidential Exhibit 70. In addition, at least one unit of Nature Made Fish Oil Pearls hasbeen sold in the United States. Confidential Exhibit 70. Accordingly, the Nature Made Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products are imported. 184. Pharmavite violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the standards established in theFDCA. Specifically, the E-OM3 capsules sold byPharmavite cannot meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because E-OM3 is not a \"dietaryApp. 203 ingredient,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1), as explained in paragraphs 61-71, and it is excluded from the definition of \"dietary supplement\" by the exclusionary clause, id. \u00a7 321(ff)(3), as explained in paragraphs 71-83.. Inaddition, as explained in paragraph 92, the capsulesare \"drugs\" because, upon information and belief, theyare recognized in the USP/NF. Exhibit 62. The capsules are also \"drugs\" because they are intended toaffect the structure/function of the body and to affectdisease, as evidenced by, among other things, thestructure/function and disease promotional claimsmade by Pharmavite. See Table 1 (listing structure/function claims and disease claims for all ofDistributors' products). 185. For example, structure/function claims on Pharmavite's website for Nature Made's fish oilproducts include the following: \"A regular intake ofEPA and DHA can play a positive role in your health.When made available to the body, EPA and DHA areincorporated into cell membranes (such as heart cells)and help support flexible cell membranes,\" and \"EPAand DHA . . . help support a heart.\" Exhibits 10-A-iii-b - 10-G-iii-b ; Table 1. Pharmavite's website for all of Nature Made's fish oil products also includes, for example, the disease cl aim, \"Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPAand DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk ofcoronary heart disease.\" Exhibits 10-A-iv-b - 10-G-iv- b; Table 1. Notably, FDA has exercised enforcement discretion over this claim when it is used to promotedietary supplements and conventional foods. Exhibit 73. As explained in paragraph 184, however, Pharmavite's E-OM3 products are not \"dietaryApp. 204 supplements,\" and clearly, they are not conventional foods. Accordingly, they are not subject to FDA'senforcement discretion policy for this claim. Otherstructure/function and disease claims for theseproducts are listed in Table 1. 186. In addition, Pharmavite's E-OM3 products are (1) falsely labeled as \"dietary supplements,\" inviolation of the standards set forth in Section 502(a)and/or (n) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a), (n), whenthey cannot legally be used for that purpose and theyare actually unapproved \"new drugs,\" Exhibits 10-A-ii - 10-G-ii ; (2) misbranded as a matter of law, in violation of the standards set forth in Section 502(f), asexplained in paragraph 109, because they are\"prescription drugs\" that have not been approved byFDA, and therefore, the labeling fails to containadequate directions for use, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1),353(b)(2); (3) upon information and belief, misbrandeddrugs under Section 502(o) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(o), because they were manufactured, prepared,propagated, compounded, or processed in anestablishment not duly registered under Section 510 ofthe FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j); and (4) upon information and belief, adulterated drugsbecause they were not manufactured in compliancewith current good manufacturing practices for drugs, inviolation of the standards set forth in Section501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). 187.

Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d). 188. Pharmavite violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the Lanham Act. Specifically,Pharmavite is falsely statin g on the product labels for all of its E-OM3 products that they are \"dietarysupplements,\" Exhibits 10-A-ii - 10-G-ii, when these products are actually unapproved \"new drugs;\" theseliterally false statements have the capacity to deceiveconsumers and are likely to influence purchasingdecisions; Pharmavite caused these false statements toenter interstate commerce, Exhibits 10-A-ii - 10-G-ii ; and as discussed in paragraphs 217-238, Amarin islikely to be injured as a result. Innovix Via 189. Proposed Respondent Innovix Pharma Inc. (\"Innovix Pharma\") is a U.S. distributor of Via-branded imported Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products.

Specifically, the rTG-OM3and rTG-EPA products \u00a7 321(ff)(1), as explained in paragraphs 61-71. These products are also \"drugs\" because they areintended to affect the structure/function of the bodyand to affect disease, as evidenced by, among otherthings, structure/function and disease promotionalclaims made by Innovix Phar ma for those products. For example, the Innovix Pharma website containsstructure/function claims that apply to . Similarly, the website contains disease claims that apply to all of theproducts such as: Omega-3 Than Prescription Lovaza\" (comparison to drugs are disease claims, 21 C.F.R.\u00a7 \"Clinically effective dose fortriglycerides,\" Other structure/function and disease claims for these products are listed in Table 1. 192. In addition, Innovix Pharma's rTG-OM3 and rTG-EPA products are (1) falsely labeled as \"dietarysupplements,\" in violation of the standards set forth inSection 502(a) and/or (n) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 352(a), (n), when they canno t legally be used for that purpose and they are actually unapproved \"new drugs,\"Exhibit 11-A-ii - 11-B-ii ; (2) misbranded as a matter of law, in violation of the standards set forth in Section502(f), as explained in para graph 109, because they are \"prescription drugs\" that have not been approved byFDA, and therefore, the labeling fails to containadequate directions for use, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1),353(b)(2); (3) upon information and belief, misbrandeddrugs under Section 502(o) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(o), because they were manufactured, prepared,propagated, compounded, or processed in anestablishment not duly registered under Section 510 ofthe FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j); and (4) upon information and belief, adulterated drugsbecause they were not manufactured in compliancewith current good manufacturing practices for drugs, inviolation of the standards set forth in Section501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B).App. 208 193. The introduction, or delivery for introduction, into interstate commerce of any unapproved \"new drug\" that violates Section 505(a) of the FDCA, and/or any adulterated or misbranded drug that violates Sections501 and/or 502 of the FDCA, is prohibited by Section301(d) and (a) of the FDCA. Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d). 194. Innovix Pharma also violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the Lanham Act.Specifically, Innovix Pharma is falsely stating on theproduct labels for all of its rTG-OM3 and rTG-EPAproducts that they are \"dietary supplements,\" Exhibits 11-A-ii - 1-B-ii , when these products are actually unapproved \"new drugs;\" these literally falsestatements have the capacity to deceive consumers and are likely to influence purchasing decisions; InnovixPharma caused these false statements to enterinterstate commerce, Exhibits 11-A-ii - 11-B-ii; and as discussed in paragraphs 217-238, Amarin is likely tobe injured as a result. Carlson 195. Proposed Respondent J.R. Carlson Laboratories, Inc. (\"Carlson\" ) is a U.S. distributor ofimported Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products. Inparticular, Carlson sells at least the followingSynthetically Produced Omega-3 products in theUnited States: Women's Omega Multi (uponinformation and belief, rTG-OM3), Exhibit 12-A; Very Finest Fish Oil Liquid (upon information and belief,rTG-OM3), Exhibit 12-B ; Super Omega-3 Gems (E- OM3), Exhibit 12-C ; Elite EPA Gems (E-EPA), Exhibit 12-D ; Elite Omega-3 Gems (E-OM3), Exhibit 12-E; Oil Q 100 mg (E-OM3), Exhibit 12-F ;App. 209 Inflammation Balance (upon information and belief, rTG-OM3), Exhibit 12-G ; Maximum Omega 2000 (upon information and belief, rTG-OM3), Exhibit 12- H; MCT & Omega-3 (upon information and rTG- 12-I ; Men's Omega Multi (E-OM3), Exhibit 12-J ; Super Omega-3 Gems, Fish Gelatin (E- OM3), Exhibit 12-K; Omega 3-6-9 (upon information and belief, rTG-OM3), Exhibit 12-L ; Super 2 Daily (upon information and belief, rTG-OM3), Exhibit 12- M. Notably, Carlson's omega-3 product brochure expressly states that its omega-3 products of (1) non-concentrated re-esterified a mixture of both the na tural triglyceride form and the more 196. According to the Carlson Promotional Materials, the concentrated fish oil used in the CarlsonOmega-3 Products is sourced from Norway. Exhibits 12-A-vi - 12-M-vi . In addition, at least one unit each of Carlson's Elite EPA Ge ms and Elite Omega-3 Gems has been sold in the United States. Confidential Exhibit 70. Accordingly, the Carlson SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products are imported. 197. Carlson violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates certain standards established by theFDCA. Specifically, the E-OM3 capsules and oils soldby Carlson cannot meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because E-OM3 is not a \"dietaryingredient,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1), as explained inApp. 210 paragraphs 61-71, and it is excluded from the definition of \"dietary supplement\" by the exclusionary clause, id. \u00a7 321(ff)(3), as explained in paragraphs 71-83. In addition, as explained in paragraphs 92 and 95, the E-OM3 capsules and the oil are \"drugs\" because, uponinformation and belief, they are recognized in theUSP/NF. Exhibits 62 and 64 . The E-OM3 products are also \"drugs\" because they are intended to affect the structure/function of the body and to affect disease, asevidenced by, among other things, structure/functionand disease promotional claims made by Carlson. See Table 1 (listing structure/function claims and disease claims for all of Distributors' products). 198. Similarly, the rTG-OM3 products sold by Carlson cannot meet the definition of \"dietarysupplement\" because rTG-OM3 is not a \"dietaryingredient,\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 as explained inparagraphs 61-71. The products are also \"drugs\"because they are intended to affect thestructure/function of the body and to affect disease, asevidenced by, among other things, structure/functionpromotional claims made by Carlson for those products.See Table 1 (listing structure/function claims and disease claims for all of Distributors' products). 199. For example, a Carlson brochure accessible from Carlson's website provides the followingstructure/function claims, which apply to all of theCarlson Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products:\"EPA and DHA are required by our bodies and aid inour well-being by promoting and supporting:*Cardiovascular health . Other structure/function claims for these products are listed in Table 1. 200. In addition, Carlson's products are (1) falsely labeled as \"dietary supplements,\" in violation of thestandards set forth in Section 502(a) and/or (n) of theFDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a), (n), when they cannot legally be used for that purpose and they are actuallyunapproved \"new drugs,\" Exhibits 12-A-ii - 12-M-ii ; (2) misbranded as a matter of law, in violation of thestandards set forth in Section 502(f), as explained inparagraph 109, because they are \"prescription drugs\"that have not been approved by FDA, and therefore,the labeling fails to contain adequate directions for use,21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1), 353(b)(2); ofthe FDCA, id. \u00a7 352(o), because they were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, orprocessed in an establishment not duly registeredunder Section 510 of the FDCA, id. \u00a7 360; and/or not included in a list as required by Section 510(j) of theFDCA, id. \u00a7 360(j); and (4) upon information and belief, adulterated drugs because they were not manufacturedin compliance with current good manufacturingpractices for drugs, in viol ation of the standards set forth in Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). 201. The introduction, or delivery for introduction, into interstate commerce of any unapproved \"new drug\"that violates Section 505(a) of the FDCA, and/or any adulterated or misbranded drug that violates SectionsApp. 212 501 and/or 502 of the FDCA, is prohibited by Section 30l(d) and (a) of the FDCA. Id. \u00a7 331(a), (d). 202. Carlson also violates Section 337 of the Tariff Act, because it violates the Lanham Act. Specifically, Carlson is falsely stating on the product labels for all of its Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products that theyare \"dietary supplements,\" Exhibits 12-A-ii 12-M-ii , when these products are actually unapproved \"newdrugs;\" these literally false statements have thecapacity to deceive consumers and are likely toinfluence purchasing decisions; Carlson caused thesefalse statements to enter interstate commerce,Exhibits 12-A-ii - 12-M-ii ; and as discussed in paragraphs 217-238, Amarin is likely to be injured asa result. VIII. C L A S S I F I C A T I O N O F T H E RESPONDENTS' PRODUCTS UNDER THE HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE 203. The Proposed Respondents' products are imported under the following HTS 204. Complainants are not aware of any related litigation.App. 213 X. DOMESTIC INDUSTRY 205. Amarin Corporation plc is a biopharmaceutical compa ny focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular health. Two of AmarinCorporation's wholly owned subsidiaries areComplainants in this Ireland. Amarin Pharma a Delawarecorporation and is located in Bedminster, New Jersey.Amarin Ireland is organized under the laws of theRepublic of Ireland and is headquartered in Dublin,Ireland. Amarin has made significant expenditures in the United States. The details of these expendituresare set forth below and in the Confidential Declarationof Michael W. Kalb, Senior Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer of Amarin Pharma, attached asConfidential Exhibit 23 . 206. Amarin Pharma has full time employees and leases property located at 1430 Route 206, Bedminster, New Jersey. Amarin's administrative, commercial,research and development, supply chain, andregulatory activities, among other business services,take place in its Bedminster, NJ location. The detailsof Amarin's U.S.-based employment and physicalfacilities at its Bedminster, NJ location are containedin Confidential Exhibit 23, at \u00b6 4. 207. Amarin has entered into agreements with three commercial API encapsulators for theencapsulation of Vascepa\u00ae. These companies havequalified and validated their manufacturing processesand are capable of manufacturing Vascepa\u00ae in eachcase consistent with the stringent requirementsApp. 214 applicable to manufacturing of drugs sold in the United States. The details of Amarin's U.S.-basedencapsulation expenditures in 2016 and the first andsecond quarters of 2017 are contained in Confidential Exhibit 23, at \u00b6 5. 208. Amarin also has entered into packaging arrangements with two commercial API packagers forthe packaging of Vascepa\u00ae. These companies havequalified and validated their manufacturing processesand are capable of packaging Vascepa\u00ae in each caseconsistent with the stringent requirements applicableto manufacturing of drugs sold in the United States.The details of Amarin's U.S.-based portion of thesepackaging expenditures in 2016 and the first andsecond quarters of 2017 are contained in Confidential Exhibit 23, at \u00b6 6 . 209. Amarin also has entered into a Logistics Service Agreement with a U.S.-based company. Thisagreement provides for inbound receipt of product,warehousing, order acceptance, order fulfillment andshipment of orders, among other services. The detailsof the U.S.-based portion of Amarin's logisticsexpenditures in 2016 and the first quarter 2017 arecontained in Confidential Exhibit 23, at \u00b6 7. 210. Amarin markets Vascepa\u00ae in the United States through its direct sales force of approximately150 sales professionals, incl uding sales representatives and their managers. Amarin also employs variousmarketing and medical affairs personnel to supportAmarin' s commercialization of Vascepa\u00ae. In additionto 215 with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. (\"Kowa\") that provides for no fewer than 250 salesrepresentatives to promote Vascepa\u00ae in the UnitedStates. Total sales and marketing expenses forVascepa, including the Kowa co-promotion fee, arecontained in Confidential Exhibit 23, at \u00b6 8 . 211. To comply with the stringent regulatory requirements for the sale of a drug in the UnitedStates, Amarin undertook substantial risk and hasmade substantial investments in labor dedicated toresearch and develop Vascepa\u00ae to its current state.Amarin' s program for developing Vascepa has lastedover a decade, and the details of the total U.S.-basedlabor expenses dedicated to research and developmentduring 2016 and the first and second quarters of 2017are contained in Confidential Exhibit 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. 212. Significantly, the Vascepa\u00ae development programs include three key human clinical trialsentitled MARINE, ANCHOR, and REDUCE-IT. Eachclinical trial was undertaken under a special protocolassessment (\"SPA\") agreement with FDA involvingyears of costly regulatory interactions and SPAamendments. Such agreements reflect FDA'sconcurrence on the vigorous testing the company hadto successfully complete even to be considered for FDA approval of Vascepa\u00ae. 213. The MARINE clinical trial demonstrated that Vascepa\u00ae was safe and effective for use as an adjunctto diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patientswith severe (TGs $500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia, commonly known as very triglyceride levels, and itApp. 216 supported FDA's July 26, 2012 approval of the drug for that indication. 214. Likewise, the ANCHOR clinical trial demonstrated that the product was safe and effective for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceridelevels in adult patients with persistent high (TGs 200-499 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in addition to statintherapy. 215. The REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes trial is an 8,175-patient clinical trial evaluatingwhether treatment with Vascepa\u00ae will reduce majorcardiovascular events in patients who, despitestabilized statin therapy, have elevated triglyceridelevels and other cardiovascular risk factors. The resultsof this important trial could help healthcareprofessionals save millions of lives and lead toimproved medical care for tens of millions of patients.If successful, the REDUCE-IT study has the potentialto significantly change the treatment paradigm forcardiovascular risk reduction, the leading cause ofdeath in the United States. In a 2014 letter to Amarin,John Jenkins, M.D., then FDA's Director, Office of NewDrugs, Center for Drug Ev aluation and Research (now retired) stated that completed REDUCE-IT study \"datawould be of significant public health value.\" Dr.Jenkins went on to state, \"I strongly urge Amarin tocomplete the trial and I know [FDA's clinical datareview division for cardiovascular-focused drugs], isready and willing to work with Amarin to address anyissues that may arise as you work to that end.\" See FDA Letter to Amarin Pharma, dated September 11,2014. Exhibit 74.App. 217 216. Amarin manages the REDUCE-IT study through a Contract Research Organization with the exception of costs for clinical trials management andcosts for internal management. Amarin expects toreport results from the REDUCE IT study in thesecond or third quarter of 2018. Amarin's totalhistorical and expected costs of conducting theREDUCE-IT study are more than $200 million, most of it in the United States, and are set forth inConfidential Exhibit 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Amarin's total R&D expenses since 2007, including expenses for allthree studies, are contained in Confidential Exhibit 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. XI. SUBSTANTIAL INJURY 217. The Proposed Respondents have engaged in unfair acts and unfair me thods of competition, the threat or effect of which is to substantially injure Amarin's domestic industry in manufacturing, selling,and distributing its Vascepa\u00ae capsules. Theimportation and sale of Proposed Respondents'Synthetic Omega-3 Products by means of their unfairacts and unfair methods of competition have injuredAmarin's domestic industry or threatened it withinjury by (i) damaging the Vascepa\u00ae brand byexploiting Vascepa\u00ae's status as an FDA-approved drug,(ii) causing lost sales and market share to Vascepa\u00ae,and (iii) diminishing Amarin's profitability andVascepa\u00ae's eroding prices. A. Damage To The Vascepa\u00ae Brand 218. Amarin has spent considerable time, money, effort, and resources developing the Vascepa\u00ae brand.App. 218 As described in paragraphs 205-216 above, it developed Vascepa\u00ae in compliance with the FDCA and obtainedFDA approval of its drug. It conducted the successfulANCHOR and MARINE trials, and is conductingREDUCE-IT trial as part of its development ofVascepa\u00ae. To expand marketing claims for its drug bydemonstrating its effect on cardiovascular riskreduction, Amarin has invested and expects to investmore than $200 million since 2011 on its REDUCE-ITstudy alone. Confidential Exhibit 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Through this substantial pharmacological developmentrisk, effort and investment, Amarin has built and iscontinuing to build a successful, branded FDA-approved pharmaceutical product that helps patientswho have been diagnosed with persistent high or veryhigh triglyceride levels. 219. By contrast, Proposed Respondents market their Synthetic Omega-3 Products as non-prescription\"dietary supplements,\" which exploits the Vascepa\u00aebrand and creates non-prescription competition andproduct substitution by the Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products marketed illegally as \"dietarysupplements.\" These products are largely untested andmuch less stringently regula ted, despite the fact that they are accompanied by claims by the ProposedRespondents that such products reduce triglyceridelevels. By labeling and promoting SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products as \"dietary supplements\" when, in fact, they are unapproved \"new drugs,\" Proposed Respondents are diluting the Vascepa\u00ae brandand its status and notoriet y as an FDA-approved drug and profiting from Amarin's substantial efforts andinvestments - all without using their own resources,App. 219 investing their own time or money, or exerting similar efforts of their own. 220. For example, a 2015 article on the NutraceuticalsWorld website entitled Omega-3s: Turning the Tide & Watching the Current, explained how Omega-3 manufacturers exploit the presence ofVascepa\u00ae and other prescription drugs in the marketat the expense of Amarin and the Vascepa\u00ae brand. Thearticle explains that \"[t]he presence in the market ofprescriptions forms of omega-3 esters such as Lovaza,Vascepa and Epanova gives an extra level of confidence even in the absence of [a Reference Daily Intake] orunqualified health claim.\" Exhibit 75. 221. In another article entitled Lovaza: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, a Nordic Naturals sales manager was quoted as saying that the presence of FDA-approvedpharmaceuticals in the market is \"very positive\"because \"it validates the use of omega 3s in a clinicalapplication.\" Exhibit 76. Another market participant agreed, noting that if pharmaceutical companies\"want[] to spend millions of dollars advertising thehealth benefits of fish oil on TV, it can do nothing butbenefit all of us. I'm in.\" Exhibit 76. 222. The Proposed Respondents' conflation of Amarin's FDA-approved Vascepa\u00ae product with theirSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products has the marketplace about the distinctionbetween \"drugs\" and \"dietary supplements\" to Public Mind \"What's In The Experts Are Stumped,\" reported that \"[a]mong thoseApp. 220 physicians and pharmacists who had recommended a non-prescription omega-3 product to patients, morethan four in five (85%) believed incorrectly that theyhad recommended an FDA-approved OTC product. . . .\" Exhibit 77. Notably, there are no legally marketed OTC drugs containing omega-3 fatty acids. 223. Companies like Proposed Respondent Innovix Pharma intentionally add to the confusion bypromoting their products with claims that make directcomparisons to FDA-approved drugs ( e.g., \"Most fish oils are not the same as Lovaza. But some Are! A fewover-the counter pharmaceutical grade fish oils [sic] arejust as potent, pure and effective at reducingtriglycerides as Lovaza,\" see OmegaVia Website, Exhibit 44; see also OmegaVia Website 2, Exhibit 45 (making implicit comparisons of OmegaVia's so-called\"pharmaceutical grade fish oil\" products to bothVascepa\u00ae and Lovaza\u00ae)). 224. These and other statements made by the Proposed Respondents in conjunction with theimportation and sale of the Synthetically ProducedOmega-3 Products have damaged or diluted theVascepa\u00ae brand causing injury and threatened injuryto Amarin. B. Lost Sales And Market Share 225. Amarin has lost sales and market share as a result of Proposed Respondents' unfair acts and unfairmethods of competition in multiple channels ofdistribution. The Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products can be purchased off the shelf at retailestablishments, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, bigApp. 221 box stores, and over the Internet, without restriction. In addition, the Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products can be purchased through doctorprescriptions. By contrast, Vascepa\u00ae can only bedistributed pursuant to a prescription. 226. The ubiquitous presence of the Proposed Respondents' products in retail and consumerdistribution channels has injured or threatened Amarinwith injury. For example, in 2012, Amarincommissioned Hall & Partners, a New York City-basedmarket research firm to conduct a consumer direct-to-consumer market research program for Vascepa\u00ae. Thesample included a total of 810 individuals and very hightriglycerides (500+ mg/dL). Wh en asked \"[w]hich of the following medications are you currently taking to treathigh triglycerides, whether treated alone or withanother condition?,\" 41% responded that they took aprescription omega-3 product and 54% responded thatthey took a fish oil dietary supplement. Confidential Exhibit 78. 227. Proposed Respondents' unfair acts and unfair methods of competition also have resulted in lost salesand lost market share for Amarin's Vascepa\u00ae product in the physician prescription channel of distribution. Inparticular, a TVG Marketing Research & ConsultingStudy conducted in late 2015 indicates that physiciansare more than three times more likely (28 percent to 8percent) to recommend \"Omega-3 Fish Oil DietarySupplements\" instead of prescribing Vascepa\u00ae whentreating patients with elevated triglycerides. Confidential Exhibit 79. Moreover, certainApp. 222 Distributors, like Nordic Natu rals, have an entire line of purported \"Professional Products,\" that are specifically marketed to healthcare professionals.Exhibits 80. Proposed Respondents have induceddoctors to recommend and patients to purchaseRespondents' products in the mistaken belief that theyare equivalent to FDA-approved products, with thethreat or effect of lost sales and lost market share toVascepa\u00ae. 228. Proposed Respondents' sales of Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products resulting from unfair actsand unfair methods of competition have injured orthreatened Amarin with injury. In the absence ofProposed Respondents' unfair acts and unfair methodsof competition, sales of Vascepa\u00ae would displace asignificant percentage of Proposed Respondents' salesof Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products in thedirect-to-consumer channel seek prescriptions for Vascepa andother FDA-approved triglyceride-lowering drugs. Andin the absence of Proposed Respondents' unfair actsand unfair methods of competition, sales of Vascepa\u00aeor other FDA-approved prescription triglyceride-lowering drugs would displace all of ProposedRespondents' sales of Synthetically Produced Omega-3Products in the physician prescription channel ofdistribution. 229. Amarin has the capacity and/or inventory to supply the entire U.S. market demand for theSynthetically Produced Omega-3 Products (andsimilarly situated products), and ProposedApp. 223 Respondents' unfair acts prevent Amarin from making these sales. Confidential Exhibit 70 at \u00b6 23. C. Lost Profits And Price Erosion 230. Proposed Respondents' unfair acts and unfair methods of competition have contributed to Amarin'slost profits and to the price erosion of Vascepa\u00ae. FDAregulates \"drugs\" more stringently than \"dietarysupplements\": drugs are subject to FDA approval, 21U.S.C. \u00a7 505; and drug approval triggers the need forcomplying with the FDCA's drug registration andlisting requirements, 21 drugmanufacturing \u00a7 379h. Moreover, FDAregulates drug labeling, promotional materials, andadvertising stringently. FDA reviews drug labeling andapproves claims that can be made regarding theproduct's use and conditions of use. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321(p), 505; 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314. 81. And promotional materials and advertising are submitted to FDA at the time ofdissemination. Further, prescription drugs, such asVascepa\u00ae can only be distributed pursuant to aprescription. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b). 231. By illegally importing and se lling Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products, theProposed Respondents are able to avoid the substantialcosts of obtaining FDA approval, maintaining FDAapproval ( i.e., certain user fees), and complying with FDA's drug registration, listing, labeling/advertising,and manufacturing requirements. By contrast, Amarinhas had to incur substantial costs in obtaining andmaintaining. FDA approval for Vascepa\u00ae, and forcomplying with FDA's various requirements.App. 224 232. All of Amarin's product revenue is derived from product sales of 1-gram and 0.5-gram size capsules of Vascepa\u00ae, net of allowances, discounts,incentives, rebates, chargebacks and returns. Amarinsells product to a limited number of major wholesalersand selected regional wholesalers and specialtypharmacy providers (c ollectively \"Vascepa\u00ae Distributors\") who resell the product to retailpharmacies for purposes of their reselling the productto fill patient prescriptions that are issued byauthorized medical professionals. The commerciallaunch of 1-gram size Vascepa\u00ae capsules in the UnitedStates occurred in January 2013 and a smaller 0.5-gram size capsule was introduced in October 2016.Since 2014, Amarin has recognized revenue based onsales to its Vascepa\u00ae Distributors. Net productrevenues based on sales of Vascepa\u00ae to distributorstotaled $79.3 million and $58.1 million during the sixmonths ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Amarin's revenues would have been higher but for theProposed Respondents' unfair acts and unfair methodsof competition. 233. Amarin has not yet reached profitability on sales of Vascepa\u00ae, and anti cipates incurring losses for an indefinite period of time. For the fiscal years endedDecember 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, Amarin reportedlosses of approximately $86.4 million, $49.1 million,and $56.4 million, respectively, and the company hasan accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2016 of $1.2 billion. For the three months ended March 31, 2017and 2016, Amarin reported losses of approximately$20.9 million and $29.8 million, respectively.App. 225 234. This cumulated deficit in operating losses is typical of pharmaceutical companies that introduce a new drug into the market. Th ey reflect the fact that to legally enter the pharmaceutical market with a druglike Vascepa\u00ae involves years of development, hundredsof millions of dollars in research and developmentcosts, and several years of operating losses, as well as the risk of development failure. Pharmaceuticalcompanies like Amarin typically recover theirdevelopment costs over time through increasingvolumes of sales. Amarin 's losses, however, are exacerbated by Proposed Respondents' conduct. Putdifferently, Amarin's operating losses would have beensmaller, or Amarin would have become profitable morequickly, but for the Proposed Respondents' unfair actsor unfair methods of competition. 235. The details of Amarin's production volumes and inventories of Vascepa\u00ae are contained inConfidential Exhibit 70, at \u00b6\u00b6 121-23 . Amarin has entered into long-term supply agreements withmultiple FDA-approved API suppliers andencapsulators, which include the potential for capacityexpansion aimed at creating sufficient volumes to meetfuture demand for Vascepa\u00ae. Amarin's ability to meetthose growth projections (and to achieve profitability)is inhibited by Proposed Re spondents' unfair acts and unfair methods of competition. 236. Proposed Respondents' sales of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products resultingfrom unfair acts and unfair methods of competition alsohave had a substantial adverse impact on Vascepa\u00aepricing. While Vascepa\u00ae pricing may be affected byApp. 226 insurance coverage and offered discounts, the fact that Vascepa\u00ae and Proposed Respondents' products are soldin the same or similar channe ls of distribution also has adverse impacts on Vascepa\u00ae pricing. AmarinCorporation plc 2016 10K Statement at 41, attached asExhibit 81. 237. The adverse price effects of the Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products also is evident fromAmarin's coupon discount sales program. According tothat program, a consumer with commercial insurancecan pay as little as $9.00 for a 90-day supplyprescription of Vascepa\u00ae. Exhibit 25. The percentage of Vascepa\u00ae prescriptions covered by Amarin's couponprogram is set forth in the attached Confidential Exhibit 23. Amarin's coupon program was designed tomake Vascepa price competitive with SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products and to discouragephysicians and pharmacists from directing consumersto purchase Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Productsbased on price. As a result, Amarin has suffered priceerosion from the unfairly traded SyntheticallyProduced Omega-3 Products with respect to at least thesales covered by Amarin's coupon program. 238. In sum, the Proposed Respondents' importation and sale of Synthetically Produced Omega-3 Products has injured and/or threatened Amarin withsubstantial injury by (i) da maging the Vascepa\u00ae brand by exploiting Vascepa\u00ae's status as an FDA-approveddrug, (ii) causing lost sales and market share toVascepa, and (iii) diminishing Amarin's profitabilityand eroding Vascepa\u00ae's prices.App. RELIEF WHEREFORE, of the foregoing, Complainants request that the Commission: A.

DMSLIBRARY01\\30934728.v1App. 232 APPENDIX E DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire AvenueSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002 OCT 06 2017 Hon. Lisa R. International E Street, S.W.Washington, DC 20436 Form, DocketNo. 3247 Dear Secretary Barton: On behalf of the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), we write to express FDA'sviews to the Commission on the above-referencedComplaint. 1 FDA respectfully submits that the 1 The Office of Unfair Impor t Investigations (\"OUII\"), Complainants (Amarin Pharma, Inc. and Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd.), and the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a tradeApp. 233 Commission should decline to initiate the requested investigation. As pled, Complainants' claims-unfair methods of competition under the Tariff Act based onfalse advertising under the Lanham Act and violationsof the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\")-can succeed only if the Commission finds thatRespondents' products are unapproved \"new drugs\"rather than \"dietary supplements\" under the FDCA.The Complaint here is predicated on open questions oflaw and policy on which FDA has not reached finalconclusions. 2 Any such findings by the Commission on those issues may conflict with later determinations byFDA. Further, through the Complaint, Complainantsattempt an unlawful private FDCA enforcement actionbased on Complainants' a llegations, not on FDA's findings. As detailed below, because Congress hasauthorized only FDA to initiate FDCA enforcementactions, the FDCA precludes claims that would requirethe adjudicator to interpret, apply, or enforce theFDCA. For Complainants to succeed on any of their claims, the Commission would have to do all three ofthose things. association representing dietary supplement manufacturers, have sought FDA's views on this matter. 2 As explained below, Complainants' suggestion that their arguments here \"do not turn on open questions of law or policy\" under the FDCA, see Amarin Juris. Br. at 24, is mistaken.App. 234 A. FDA Has Not Determined Whether The Challenged Products Are Drugs Or Dietary Supplements. The FDCA and its implementing regulations set forth the legal definitions of \"drugs,\" \"new drugs,\" and\"dietary supplements,\" as well as legal requirementsfor, among other things, the distribution of suchproducts in interstate commerce. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321(g)(1), (p), 355, (dietary supplements). Congress has delegated toFDA the authority to determine whether products \"dietary supplements.\"See, e.g., generally Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 627 (1973) (\"The he art of the new procedures designed by Congress [for determining whether aproduct is a 'new drug'] is the grant of primaryjurisdiction to FDA.\"); Hi-Tech Pharms, Inc. v. Hodges Consulting, Inc., 230 F. Supp. 3d 1323, 1331 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (the determination of whether a productmarketed as a \"dietary supplement\" is instead a \"newdrug\" is one that \"Congress has delegated exclusivelyto the FDA\"). The FDA statutory scheme is undeniably \"complex.\" 3 For example, to be a dietary supplement, a 3 See, e.g., Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GMBH & Co. v. FDA, 195 F. Supp. 3d 366, 380 (D.D.C. 2016) (noting FDA's \"long experience in administering this complex statute\"); Hi-Tech Pharms, Inc., 230 F. Supp. see also Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. at 627 (noting that Congress created an \"expert agency\"\u2014FDA\u2014to administer the FDCA).App. 235 product must, among other things, contain one or more \"dietary ingredients.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 32l(ff)(1). \"Dietaryingredients\" include, among other things, \"a dietarysubstance for use by man to supplement the diet byincreasing the total dietary intake,\" or \"a concentrate,metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any\"other dietary ingredient or ingredients. 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 321(ff)(1)(E)&(F). 4 And a manufacturer wishing to market a dietary supplement which contains a \"newdietary ingredient\" (\"NDI\")\u2014defined as a dietaryingredient that was not marketed in the United Statesbefore October 15, 1994\u2014must submit a pre-marketnotification to FDA unless the NDI and any otherdietary ingredients in the dietary supplement \"havebeen present in the food supply as an article used forfood in a form in which the food has not beenchemically altered.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 350b; see also 21 190.6. Because of this complex statutory scheme, determinations of whether a product is a dietarysupplement require case-specific analysis, as verysmall differences in factors such as an ingredient'schemical structure or history of presence in the foodsupply can mean the difference between dietary-ingredient status and non-di etary-ingredient status. In other words, the determination requires, among otherthings, a careful and thorough scientific review of theingredients of the product at issue as well as review ofthe history of those ingredients. Any determination bythe Commission on those i ssues in this case may 4 See also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(A)-(D)&(F) (addressing additional substances that qualify as \"dietary ingredients\").App. 236 conflict with later determinations by FDA on the same issues. Moreover, FDA is in the process of developing a guidance document for industry on when a dietarysupplement ingredient is an NDI, when themanufacturer of a dietary ingredient or supplementshould submit an NDI notification, the evidence neededto document the safety of an NDI, appropriate methodsfor establishing the identity of an NDI, and relatedissues. FDA guidance documents \"describe the agency'sinterpretation of or a policy on a regulatory issue,\" 21C.F.R. \u00a7 10.115(b), and are one of the tools Congressgave to the agency for the administering the FDCA, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(h)(1)(A) (the with public andthose documents \"present the views of the Secretary onmatters under the jurisdiction of the Food and DrugAdministration\"). FDA initially published a draft guidance document on NDI issues for public comment in 2011. See 76 F.R. 39111, Draft Guidance for Industry; Dietary Supplements: New Dietary Ing redient Notifications and Related Issues; Availability (Jul. 5, 2011). FDA received thousands of comments on the initial draft guidance,and issued a revised draft guidance in 2016. See 81 F.R. 53486, Dietary Supplements; New Dietary Ingredient Notifications and Related Issues: RevisedDraft Guidance for Industry; Availability (Aug. 12,App. 237 2016).5 To date, FDA has received over 300 comments on the revised draft guidance, some of which address issues raised in the Complaint. Accordingly, aCommission finding on issues raised in the Complaintcould conflict with later-finalized FDA guidance. In the revised draft guidance, FDA stated its willingness to compile an authoritative list of pre-October 15, 1994, dietary ingredients based onindependent and verifiable data to be supplied byindustry. Comments submitted regarding the reviseddraft guidance generally support the idea that FDAshould develop a list of pre-October 15, 1994, dietaryingredients, but reflect varying opinions on thestandard of evidence for demonstrating that aningredient was marketed before October 15, 1994, andon the process by which ingredients should be added tothe list. Because FDA believes that public discussion ofthese issues will be beneficial to the agency indeveloping the list, FDA held a public meeting on these issues on October 3, 2017. See 82 F.R. 42098, Development of a List of Pre-Dietary SupplementHealth and Education Act Di etary Ingredients; Public Meeting; Request for Comments (Sept. 6, 2017). A Commission finding on issues raised in the Complainthere could conflict with any later FDA-finalized list ofpre-October 15, 1994, dietary ingredients. Furthermore, FDA is concerned that initiation of the investigation requested by Complainants could 5 The 2016 revised draft guidance is available on FDA's website at www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidan ceregulation/guidancedocum entsregultory info rmation/ucm515733.pdf .App. 238 create an incentive for other parties to file similar complaints about other FDA-regulated products. FDA'sregulatory authority is not limited to foods (whichinclude dietary supplements) and drugs. Undercomplex statutory and regulatory regimes, FDA alsoregulates a broad range of other types of products,including biologics, blood products, cosmetics, medicaldevices, medical foods, radiation-emitting devices,tobacco products, vaccines, and animal drugs. Just likein this case, Commission investigations involving thosetypes of products would present the possibility of theCommission reaching findings that conflict with FDAfindings. Accordingly, even if Complainants have pled a viable claim (which, as explained below, they have not),FDA believes that the Commission should decline toinitiate an investigation under principles of comity toFDA\u2014the federal agency that has the congressionally-delegated authority to determine the status of theproducts at issue. Complainants contend that therequested investigation will not intrude on FDA'sjurisdiction because the Tariff Act provides that theCommission will \"consult with, and seek advice from,\"relevant federal agencies, including FDA. See Amarin Juris. Br. at 18 (quoting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(b)(2)). Butthe Tariff Act also of investigations \"at the earliestpractical time\" after initiation of the investigation. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(b)(1). FDA respectfully submits thatconsultation with FDA during such an expeditedprocess is not an adequate substitute for FDA's normalregulatory process.App. 239 B. Private Parties Have No Private Right of Action Under The FDCA Because FDA is the expert agency responsible for determining whether products comply with the FDCA, Congress gave FDA a number of enforcement tools toaddress the distribution of products in violation of theFDCA. For example, FDA may initiate a civil injunction action against a firm distributing suchproducts. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a)-(d), 332. In such an action, a district court can enjoin the firm fromcontinuing to distribute the product at issue. See, e.g., United States v. Lane Labs-USA, Inc., 324 F. Supp. 2d 547 (D.N.J. 2004). Other enforcement mechanismsinclude seizure of violative products, civil moneypenalties, and criminal prosecution of individuals andfirms. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331, 333, 334; see also, e.g., Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 835 (1985) (discussing enforcement mechanisms available to FDA); UnitedStates v. Undetermined Quanti ties of Articles of Drug, 145 F. Supp. 2d 692 (D. Md. 2001) (seizure ofunapproved new drugs); United States v. Kaminski, 2008 WL 1886008 (S.D. Ohio Ap r. 28, 2008) (criminal prosecution for distribution of unapproved new drugs). 6 6 FDA may take other steps short of enforcement action to address products that appear to be violative. For example, FDA may issue import alerts to detain violative products at the border. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 381(a). FDA may also issue a Warning Letter to the firmidentifying violations of the FDCA and asking the firm to takevoluntary corrective action. See FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual, p. 4-2 (Mar. 2017) (available at www.fda.gov ). A Warning Letter is \"informal and advisory,\" and \"FDA does not considerWarning Letters to be final agency action.\" Id. at 4-3; see also Holistic Candlers and Consumers Ass'n v. FDA, 664 F.3d 940 (D.C.App. 240 But while Congress gave FDA these and other tools to enforce the FDCA, Congress prohibited private parties from bringing actions to enforce the FDCA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337(a) (\"all such proceedings for the enforcement, or to restrain violations, of [the FDCA]shall be by and in the name of the United States\"); see also, e.g., Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' (2001) (\"The FDCA leaves no doubtthat it is the Federal Government rather than privatelitigants who are authorized to file suit fornoncompliance with the [FDCA.]\"); In re Darvocet, Darvon & Propoxyphene Prods. Liab. Litig., 756 F.3d 917, 936 (6th Cir. 2014) (\"because the FDA hasexclusive power to enforce the FDCA, there is noprivate right to enforce the statute\"). The reason that the FDCA prohibits private enforcement actions\u2014including unfair trade practiceand false advertising actions that seek to enforce theFDCA\u2014is straightforward. FDA cannot administer andenforce the FDCA effectively if core FDA issues\u2014suchas whether a product is a \"new drug\" or a \"dietarysupplement\" under the FDCA\u2014are decided in actionsbrought by private parties. After all, \"Congress'sdecision to centralize authority to determine thelegality of drug sales in the FDA was obviouslyintended to provide uniformity of administration\" of theFDCA, JHP Pharms., LLC v. Hospira, Inc., 52 F. Supp. 3d 992, 1005 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (quotation and citationomitted), and allowing private parties to bringenforcement actions\u2014either in courts or in other Cir. 2012) (finding that FDA Warn ing Letter was not final agency action).App. 241 federal agencies\u2014threatens such uniformity of administration. See also Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. at 624 (noting FDA \"cannot administer the Act intelligently and rationally unless it hasauthority to determine what drugs are 'new drugs'under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)].\"). Indeed, in keeping with these principles, less than a year ago (and more than two years after the SupremeCourt's POM Wonderful decision) the Commission's Staff correctly recognized: \"the Staff believes that a cause of action is likely not precluded by the FDCA if it does not require the Commission to directly apply, enforce, or interpret the FDCA.\" See Staff Response to Respondents' Motion for Summary DeterminationDismissing Claims Precluded by the FDCA in In the Matter of Certain Potassium Chloride Powder Prods.,Inv. No. 337-TA- 1013, EDIS Doc. I.D. 593245 4 (Oct. 21, 2016) (emphasis added). A fortiori, the FDCA would preclude such a claim if\u2014as is the case here\u2014 it required the Commission to directly apply, enforce, orinterpret the FDCA. Similarly, even after POM Wonderful, courts continue to routinely recognize that because the FDCAprohibits private enforcement actions, the FDCA\"preclude[s] Lanham Act claims\" where, \"in order todetermine the falsity or misleading nature of therepresentation at issue, th e court would be required to interpret and apply FDCA statutory [and] regulatoryprovisions.\" Hi-Tech Pharms, Inc., 230 F. Supp. 3d at 1330 (quotation and citation omitted). See also, e.g., Intra-Lock Intern., Inc. v. Choukroun, 2015 WL 11422285, May 4, 2015) (\"because theApp. 242 FDCA forbids private rights of action under the statute, a private action brought under the LanhamAct may not be pursued when the claim would requirelitigation of the alleged underlying FDCA violation incircumstances where the FDA has not itself concludedthere was such a violation\") (quoting PhotoMedex, Inc. v. Irwin, 601 F.3d 919, 924 (9th Cir. 2010)); Church & Dwight Co, Inc. v. SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics,104 F. Supp. 3d 348, 361 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\"POM Wonderful did not disturb the longstanding proposition that private parties may not use the Lanham Act as avehicle to enforce the FDCA. That is, because theFDCA does not contain a private right of action, claimsthat require a court to interpret, apply, or enforce theFDCA remain precluded.\"); 7 Catheter Connections, Inc. v. Ivera Med Corp., 2014 WL 3536573, *4 (D. Utah. Jul. 17, 2014) (\"because no private right of action existsunder the FDCA, a plaintiff may not use the LanhamAct as an alternative vehicle by which to seek redressfor an FDCA violation,\" and Lanham Act \"claims thatrequire direct interpretation and application of theFDCA are not properly recognized because such 7 Although Complainants' \"Jurisdictional Brief\" relies heavily on POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 134 S. Ct. 2228 (2014), that case is inapposite here. In POM Wonderful, the Court ruled that the FDCA did not preclude a private party from bringing a Lanham Act claim alleging that certain fruit juice labeling wasmisleading even though FDA regulates juice labels. Unlike thiscase, however, POM Wonderful did not require the tribunal to interpret, apply, or enforce the FDCA. And, as the above-citedcases demonstrate, even after POM Wonderful, courts have adhered to the principle that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims when those claims amount to attempts to interpret, apply, or enforce the FDCA.App. 243 matters are more appropriately addressed by the FDA\") (quoting Cottrell, Ltd. v. Biotrol, Int'l, 191 F.3d 1248, 1254-55 (10th Cir. 1999)). The Complaint requires interpretation, application, and enforcement of th e FDCA. Specifically, Complainants' claims\u2014whether styled as a Tariff Actclaim, a Lanham Act claim, or an FDCA claim\u2014alldepend on the allegation that the products at issue arefalsely labeled as \"dietary supplements\" because theydo not meet the FDCA definition of \"dietarysupplements\" and instead meet the FDCA definition of\"new drugs.\" See, e.g., Complaint at \u00b6 60 (alleging that labeling the products \"as 'dietary supplements' isliterally false because these products (i) cannot definition of 'dietary supplement\" in section 201(ff)of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 and (ii) are being referred to as 'dietary supplements' to hide the factthat they are actually unapproved 'new drugs.\"'); \u00b6 120(alleging that Tariff Act and Lanham Act claim isbased on false statements that the products can beused in \"'dietary supplements ' when these products are actually unapproved 'new drugs.\"'). 8 In short, in order to resolve any of Complainants' claims, the Commissionwill necessarily have to step into the shoes of the FDAto interpret, apply, and enforce the FDCA. But theFDCA precludes such action. 8 See also, (all citing the FDCA).App. 244 Finally, we note that FDA has, in the past, addressed questions regarding the regulatory status of certain products through the agency's citizen petitionprocess. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 10.25(a), primary determinations onissues within in statutory mandate\"); 10.30; 9 see also, e.g., 70 F.R. 69976, Request for Comment on Status of Pyridoxamine (Nov. 18, 2005); FDA Response to Citizen Petition, Docket No. FDA-2005-P-0259 at p.3 (Jan. 12,2005) (\"FDA has concluded that a product containingpyridoxamine is not a dietary supplement under theAct because pyridoxamine is excluded from the dietarysupplement definition under the prior market clause in21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii).\"). 10 For these reasons, FDA respectfully requests that the Commission decline to initiate the requestedinvestigation.
