The distinction affirms that the outpatient medical oncology servic es at both the comprehensive cancer center and JMOH, an RPCI community practice in Jamestown, N.Y., meet nationally recognized standards for quality cancer care. For the fifth consecutive year, the superior clinic al care provided by the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at RPCI was recognized by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) . The CIBMTR's report showed that RPCI continues to achieve higher than expected one-year survival ratings for allogeneic blood and marrow transplants. RPCI's accreditation by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therap y (FACT) was renewed. FACT is an internationally recognized accr editing body for hospitals and medical institutions offering cellular therapy. The designa tion, which applies to allogeneic and autologous transplant services for both adult and p ediatric patients, indicates that an institution has met the most rigorous standards in every aspect of cellular therapy, from clinical care and donor management to cell collection, processing and storage. Roswell Park has held FACT accreditation continuously since 2002. In the first quarter of the year, 17 of the most pr omising preliminary cancer research projects at RPCI received more than $1 million in funding generated by donations and fundraising events. The researchers received the funds following an int ernal, peer-reviewed competitive process that is led by the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation , the not-for-profit that raises funds and manages all donations made to RPCI.

Katerina Gurova, MD, PhD , Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cell S tress Biology, received two awards from the NCI that focus on tumo r-initiating cells, or cancer stem cells. These types of tumor cells are to blame for cancer' s seemingly endless ability to produce new tumor cells, resulting in relapse after treatment a nd in metastatic disease. One grant is a five- year, $2.01 million award to explore how curaxins, a novel class of anticancer agents, kill cancer stem cells while not harming normal stem cells. Dr. Gurova's other grant, a two-year, $419,884 awar d, funds research that seeks a better understanding of the role of FACT in development of cancer. Using genetic tools to turn FACT on and off, she and her colleagues hope to determine w hether targeting FACT can also eradicate cancer without harming normal stem cells. Another multimillion-dollar grant was awarded to Mikhail Nikiforov, PhD , Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cell Stress Biology, who recei ved a five-year, $2.02 million award from the NCI for his investigation into the role of a recent ly discovered transcriptional factor, Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9), in melanoma genesis. KLF9 is a pro tein that induces oxidative stress. This project will explore how it's involved in melanoma progress ion, and aims to identify new targets for treating metastatic melanoma, one of the most aggre ssive and poorly understood human cancers. Other Roswell Park researchers awarded grant fundin g during the third quarter of 2015 are: John Krolewski, MD, PhD , Professor of Oncology in the Center for Personali zed Medicine and the Department of Cancer Genetics, who received a t wo-year, $667,992 award from the NCI to investigate the effects of androgen-deprivation the rapy (ADT), a common approach for treating prostate cancer. In particular, this study will exa mine the role of molecules that mediate the effect of ADT and act between cancer cells and the surrounding cells, known as the tumor microenvironment. Dr. Krolewski hopes that identify ing the molecules involved can lead to the development of novel prostate cancer therapies. Dominic Smiraglia, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Genetics, received a three-year, $639,476 award from the U.S. Department of Defense for research that targets the methionine salvage pathway as a metabol ic point of leverage, a potential Achilles heel for prostate cancer based on inherent and uniq ue metabolic stress that can be exploited. Dr. Smiraglia and colleagues will test a novel ther apeutic approach for increasing the metabolic stress in prostate cancer cells while concurrently blocking the mechanism that they use to relieve that stress. This work may lead to new trea tment strategies to complement existing approaches. Deborah Erwin, PhD , Director of the Office of Cancer Health Dispariti es Research, received a three-year, $354,262 supplemental grant from the NC I to expand NCI-Supported Community Outreach Capacity Through Community Health Educator s of the National Outreach Network.

Lauren Burkard-Mandel , a predoctoral trainee in the Department of Immuno logy, received a four-year, $138,448 fellowship award from the NCI f or a study of a population of immune cells, known as macrophages, that adopt pro-metastatic fun ctions. Her project explores a novel role of a cancer-derived substance known as thymic strom al lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the mechanisms that underlie such aberrant macrophage b ehavior. Identification of this \"cancer- TSLP-macrophage axis\" may offer new opportunities t o treat patients with breast cancer. Beth Pflug, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Urology, received a one- year, $125,346 award from the U.S. Army Medical Res earch and Materiel Command (USAMRAA) within the Department of Defense to explore the mec hanism by which benzodiazepines block an enzyme that's associated with prostate cancer aggre ssiveness and progression. Her project seeks to understand how benzodiazepines inhibit the fatty-acid synthase (FASN) pathway, inducing tumor cell death, and to develop an FASN i nhibitor for therapeutic use. Michael Fiandalo, PhD , a postdoctoral Research Affiliate in the Departme nt of Urology, received a two-year, $123,642 award from USAMRAA to investig ate a way to enhance existing androgen- deprivation therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. He aims first to develop a high- throughput androgen-metabolism-inhibitor screen, an d then to develop an inhibitor that works against four enzymes, to improve tumor regression a nd extend survival. James Mohler, MD , Chair of the Department of Urology and Associate Director/Senior Vice President for Translational Research, received a on e-year, $112,746 subcontract award from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center as part of a grant from the NCI to study whether intensive cholesterol-lowering intervention will reduce the l evels of cholesterol and testosterone in the prostate and, secondarily, decrease the growth rate of prostate cancer. The work could lead to a large clinical trial of cholesterol-lowering drugs to decrease the chance that men who choose active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer wi ll ever need treatment. Rodney Haring, PhD, MSW , Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences, received a two- year grant of $78,306 from the Aetna Foundation.

Investigators at RPCI have garnered nearly $7 million in research grants during the fourth quarter. The awards include a five-year, $2.4 milli on grant from the NCI to optimize a particular approach for administering photodynamic therapy (PD T), a form of cancer therapy that was developed at Roswell Park in the 1970s. Gal Shafirstein, DSc , Professor of Oncology, Director of Photodynamic T herapy Clinical Research and a member of the Department of Cell Stress Biolo gy, will lead that effort to improve interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) in patien ts with head and neck cancers that have started to spread to other tissues. PDT involves ad ministration of a light-sensitizing drug that collects in cancer cells followed by illumination w ith a non-burning laser to kill cancer cells. This project will employ RPCI's novel treatment planning capabilities and integrated image-guided dosimetry system to define \u2014 for the first time \u2014 t he optimal laser settings for treating patients with I-PDT. Other Roswell Park researchers who were awarded gra nt funding in late 2015 are: Gary Smith, PhD , Professor of Oncology, and Yue Wu, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology, both from the Department of Urology, received a fiv e-year, $2 million award from the NCI for research to define the mechanisms that regulate how androgens move through blood vessel walls into prostate cancer cells, where they drive cancer growth. It's anticipated that the team's findings will identify androgen-uptake mechanisms t hat can be targeted to achieve a prostate- limited androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate c ancer, minimizing the systemic side effects of conventional androgen deprivation. Fumito Ito, MD, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Department of Surgical Oncology and the Center for Immunotherapy, received a five-y ear, $832,594 award from the NCI for his work with adoptive T-cell therapy, which uses a pat ient's own tumor-specific immune cells to fight cancer. Although the therapy has emerged as o ne of the most effective treatments for melanoma, lymphoma and leukemia, it's difficult to generate the large numbers of young T cells needed. Dr. Ito's preclinical study will test the s afety and efficacy of rejuvenated tumor-specific T cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult cells reprogrammed into embryonic-like cells. James Mohler, MD , Associate Director and Senior Vice President for Translational Research and Chair of the Department of Urology, received a two- year, $450,000 award from the New York State Department of Health to award internally to r esearch projects that represent an innovative approach to an important problem in pros tate cancer.

These resources, which include 14 laboratorie s, centers and/or facilities (such as the Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Clinical Data Netwo rk and Data Bank and BioRepository), serve the common needs of cancer researchers. Providing s tate-of-the-art science tools through these cores allows cancer research to be conducted more e fficiently and with higher quality so that RPCI researchers can better compete for the limited federal funding and better serve the needs of the region. RPCI-led research showed a twofold increase in the prevalence of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) K113 and K115 in African-Ameri can women compared to European American women. These HERVs are present in the huma n genome and may offer certain protection against breast cancer. Li Tang, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology at Roswell Park, is the first author and Christine Ambrosone, PhD , Senior Vice President, Population Sciences and Chair of the Department of Cancer Prevention an d Control at Roswell Park, is the senior author of \"Associations between insertional polymor phisms of human endogenous K115 breast cancer risk in African-Ame rican and European women,\" which was presented at the American Association for Cancer R esearch (AACR) Annual Meeting 2015. In the largest study of its kind to date, RPCI-led research found a potential biological mechanism of cancer in a multiethnic cohort of breast cancer survivors. Song Yao, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Prevention and Control at Roswell Park, is the first author and Marilyn Kwan, PhD, Research Scientist II in the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, is the senior autho r of \"Genetic variations associated with breast cancer-related lymphedema in a prospective m ultiethnic cohort,\" which was presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2015. A first-of-its kind cancer vaccine, SurVaxM , has demonstrated safety and tolerability in patie nts with recurrent or progressive malignant brain tumor s, according to results of a phase I study conducted by RPCI researchers. The findings were pr esented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2015. The study title is \"Phase I study of SurVaxM in pat ients with survivin-expressing recurrent malignant gliomas.\" This immunotherapeutic vaccine will now be evaluated in a larger phase II clinical trial to assess its effectiveness for pati ents with advanced brain tumors and a new phase I clinical trial for multiple myeloma patients. Sur VaxM was developed by Robert Fenstermaker, MD , Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery and Michael Ciesielski, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology, Department of Neurosurgery. RPCI researchers have identified common inherited g ene alterations that appear to make some patients more at risk of neurotoxicity when treated for breast cancer. The research was presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2015. Christine Ambrosone, PhD , Senior Vice President of Population Sciences and Chair of the Department of Cancer Prevention and Control at RPCI, is the senior author of \"A genome-wide association stu dy identifies novel loci associated with taxane-related sensory neuropathy in breast cancer patients enrolled in a cooperative group clinical trial.\" RPCI researchers examined the characteristics of ge netic variants in human toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), and have found that these genetic variants may predict antitumor responses to entolimod, an immunotherapeutic agent with antitumo r activity. TLR5 plays a critical role in early immune response and is expressed in a wide va riety of tumors and in normal tissues at common sites of metastases (eg, liver, lung). The r esults were presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2015. Andrzej Wierzbicki, PhD , a postdoctoral fellow at Roswell Park, along with Araba Adjei, PhD , former Associate Professor of Oncology in the De partment of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at RPCI, and colleagues, conducted the study \"Functional characterization of human toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) genetic variants\" (abstract 5492). Alex Adjei, MD, PhD , former Senior Vice President for Clinical Research at RPCI , also is a co-author of this study. RPCI researchers have made new findings about the c auses and impacts of RNA modification or \"editing.\" Innate immune cells \u2014 the body's first l ine of defense \u2014 possess the ability to extensively change genetic information by means of RNA modification as a response to factors associated with inflammation. Further, aberrations in this process may predispose humans and other mammals to viral infections, cancer or other chronic diseases, according to the study, which was published in Nature Communications . A team led by Bora Baysal, MD, PhD , Associate Professor in the Department of Pathology & Laborato ry Medicine, in collaboration with the research group of Santosh Patnaik, MD, PhD , Assistant Professor in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, determined that inflammatory factors such as hypoxia, or a low-oxygen environment, and interferons, cellular proteins that signal the presence of a pathogen, cause innate immune cells to change their gene transcript sequences in a process mediated by an enzyme, APOBEC3A. The latest research from the team that discovered t he novel anticancer agent FL118 highlights distinctive characteristics of this small-molecule compound and provides insights into its ability to overcome the persistent problem of treatment res istance. In findings reported in Molecular Cancer , Fengzhi Li, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and colleagues provide new eviden ce that FL118 may be more effective than two structurally similar injectable drugs and, addi tionally, may be effective as an oral agent. The study, entitled \"FL118, a novel camptothecin deriva tive, is insensitive to ABCG2 expression and shows improved efficacy in comparison with irinotec an in colon and lung cancer models with ABCG2-induced resistance,\" is available at molecula r-cancer.com. Long-term and frequent use of aspirin is associated with significantly decreased risk of cervical cancer, according to a study led by researchers at RPCI and published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease . Aspirin use was associated with a 47% reduced ris k of cervical cancer among frequent users \u2014 those who used aspirin seven or more times a week, regardless of duration \u2014 and 41% reduced risk among long-term fre quent users \u2014 those with five or more years of frequent use. Acetaminophen use was not as sociated with decreased risk of cervical cancer. A research team led by Kirsten Moysich, PhD , Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Prevention and Control at Roswell Park, r eported the results from the first U.S.-based study to examine the association between regular us e of aspirin or acetaminophen. The review of pathology reports for breast cancer c an have a significant impact on patient care. In a study authored by Thaer Khoury, MD , Professor of Oncology in the Department of Pathology at RPCI, and Yousef Soofi, MD , formerly of RPCI, and published in The Breast Journal , the Roswell Park pathology team shared results on t he review of 500 breast core biopsy cases provided by referring institutions in a single cale ndar year. In 20% of cases examined, a pathological diagnosis change was made. A pathologi cal diagnosis is the foundation upon which all other treatment decisions are made for patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The cases in the study were defined as reflecting a minor discordance when the change in diagnosis did not impact the patient and a major discordance when patient care was impacted through a change in therapy modality. Dr. Khoury and colleagues foun d that 8% of the cases had a major discordance and 13% had a minor discordance. The ch ange of diagnosis from benign to malignant or vice versa, while less common, was ide ntified in 1% of the cases examined. Scientists looking to better understand the mechani sms behind the origin and spread of melanoma tumors have uncovered a possible role for a decades-old antibacterial agent in treating these aggressive and increasingly common c ancers. In findings reported in the journal Cell Death and Differentiation , the researchers demonstrate that a particular enz yme, guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), drives melanoma grow th, and propose a new pharmaceutical strategy for targeting that protein. Researchers le d by Mikhail Nikiforov, PhD , Professor of Oncology, investigated the role of GMPS, a key enzy me in guanylate metabolism, in melanoma development and metastasis. The authors evaluated t he effects of GMPS depletion and explored the possibility of targeting GMPS by angus tmycin A, also known as decoyinine. While this compound was discovered in the early 1950s as a potential antibiotic, it has never been experimentally investigated as an antitumor agent n or investigated at all in clinical settings. Dr. Nikiforov and colleagues demonstrate in this latest study that GMPS levels are increased in human metastatic melanoma specimens and that pharma ceutical inhibition of GMPS by angustmycin A has the potential to be effective as a targeted anti-melanoma therapy for tumors carrying either of the two most common mutations: B RAFV600E and NRASQ61R. RPCI opened a new specialty pharmacy dedicated to t he prescription needs of cancer patients. The pharmacy, located on the first floor of the mai n hospital, is designed to be a one-stop location providing patients with their oncology-rel ated and supportive medications. Patients will now be able to fill their prescriptions on-site at the time of their appointments or they may choose to have the medications delivered directly t o their home (within a 150-mile radius of the Institute). The pharmacy can fill prescriptions for supportive medications prescribed by Roswell Park physicians, as well as provide over-the-counte r medications. The Roswell Park Pharmacy is staffed by board-certified oncology pharmacists who are members of the patient's multidisciplinary care team. As such, the Roswell P ark pharmacists provide information about oral chemotherapy medications; follow-up consultati ons; therapeutic drug monitoring; drug interactions medication recon ciliation; and safety checks. These oncology experts also help patients understand thei r prescription coverage benefits. A collaborative team of researchers led by Alex A. Adjei, MD, PhD, FACP , formerly of RPCI shared results from the first clinical study of the anticancer effects of the novel agent entolimod at the ASCO's 51st Annual Meeting in Chicago. Their findings confirm preclinical evidence that the agent, which is derived from salmonella flagell in, is worthy of further investigation as treatment for some of the most common and most resi lient solid-tumor cancers. Toll-like receptors are a family of proteins that help genera te immune responses against cancer and other pathogens. Entolimod, the lead drug candidate of Cleveland BioLabs Inc. , of Buffalo, N.Y., activates toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and has been shown to have immunotherapeutic effects in preclinical cancer models. Hatoon Bakhribah, MD , a Drug Development Fellow in RPCI's Department of Medicine, presented results of this p hase I clinical study at ASCO. Dr. Adjei and colleagues evaluated the agent's safety, tolerabili ty, pharmacokinetics, immunoactivity and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with a n umber of different advanced cancers, including colorectal, non-small-cell lung, anal and urothelial bladder tumors. RPCI researchers have developed an accurate, indivi dualized post-operative survival calculator and integrated the technology into a mobile applica tion compatible with smartphone technology for oncologists and patients diagnosed w ith colon cancer. Information about the calculator was presented at the ASCO 51st Annual Me eting in Chicago. The study's first author, Emmanuel Gabriel, MD , a Fellow in the Department of Surgical Oncology a t RPCI, and colleagues used the National Cancer Database to ana lyze 16 patient-specific demographics, tumor and treatment-related variables and their imp act on survival among 230,520 colon cancer patients who received treatment from 2004 to 2006. Senior author on the study is Steven Nurkin, MD , Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Department of Surgical Oncology at RPCI. The incidence of melanoma, a deadly form of skin ca ncer, has increased by more than 250% among children, adolescents and young adults since 1973, according to award-winning research to be presented by RPCI at the ASCO 51st Annual Mee ting in Chicago. The research has been recognized with an ASCO Merit Award . Analyzing SEER data, RPCI scientists determined t hat the number of cases of melanoma diagnosed in children, adolescents and young adults increased by 253% from 1973 to 2011. Survival rates also have in creased \u2014 from 80% for the period 1973- 1980 to 95% in 2011. Female young adults appear to be at particular risk for melanoma, a trend that may be due to known risk factors such as high- risk tanning behaviors. Demytra Mitsis, MD , is lead author of the study and a Fellow in the Dep artment of Medical Oncology at Roswell Park. While squamous anal carcinomas are rare, repre senting only about 2% of digestive-system cancer diagnoses, these cancers, which are associat ed with the human papillomavirus (HPV), sometimes prove very difficult to treat, recurring or developing metastases following standard treatment. Seeking to identify new targets and ther apeutic options for this disease, a multi- institutional team led by Patrick Boland, MD , Assistant Professor of Oncology at RPCI conducted a multiplatform biomarker analysis in conjunction w ith Caris Life Sciences that revealed several actionable targets. The study was presented at the ASCO 51st Annual Meeting in Chicago. A large cooperative-group study directed by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has confirmed previous evidence that the drug lenalidom ide delays time to disease progression for patients with multiple myeloma and is an important treatment option for patients with this rare but increasingly common cancer of the blood and mar row. Updated results of the ongoing study, which is led by Philip McCarthy, MD , and Sarah Holstein, MD, PhD , of RPCI, was highlighted during a poster discussion session at t he ASCO 51st Annual Meeting in Chicago. A study led by the University at Buffalo (UB) and RPCI has identified beliefs and personality traits that are associated with higher levels of di stress in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. The findings support the value of emotion al and informational support for patients and perhaps early counseling for some who are the most distressed. Factors that were associated with greater distress included a lack of confidence in deciding how to treat the cancer; being concerned that the cancer will progress; feeling th at one's masculinity was under threat; and tendencies to be less optimistic and resilient. The study, \"Factors Associated with Emotional Distress in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patient s,\" was first published online in Psycho- Oncology in January 2015. The results are from a larger lon gitudinal study of prostate cancer patients, \"Live Well Live Long!\" The research was b ased on assessments of 1,425 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at five different ce nters. Heather Orom, PhD, is the study's lead author and an assistant professor of community heal th and health behavior in UB's School of Public Health and Health Professions. Willie Underwood III, MD, MPH , an Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Urology at Roswell Pa rk, served as principal investigator on the study. A second set of analyses from the same study revealed that emotional distress may motivate men diagnosed with prostate cancer to choo se surgery. Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) is a potenti ally curative treatment for patients with leukemia or other life-threating blood diseases. Wi th a goal of increasing survival rates, a research team led by RPCI investigators verified pa tient outcome data submitted by more than 150 U.S. transplant centers over an 11-year period to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) . The detailed investigation \u2014 published in the jou rnal Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation \u2014 offers insight into different causes of death. The results of this genome-wide association study l ed to the development of a first-of-its-kind definition of specific causes of mortality after un related-donor, or allogeneic, BMT. Theresa Hahn, PhD , of the Department of Medicine and Lara Sucheston- Campbell, PhD, formerly of the Department of Cancer Prevention and Population Scie nces, are co-principal investigators of this study, which is supported by a NIH award for $5.18 million, the largest R01 research grant in Roswell Park's history. More than 150 news organizations from around the co untry have published stories about the award-winning research conducted by Roswell Park sc ientists and recently presented at the ASCO's annual meeting. Demytra Mitsis, MD , a Hematology-Oncology Fellow, and Nikhil I. Khushalani, MD, formerly of RPCI, co-authors of the study, found th at the incidence of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, has increas ed by more than 250% among children, adolescents and young adults over a period of four decades. OmniSeq, LLC an RPCI spin-off company and began commercializing its suite of innovative products that support a physician-driven, collabora tive approach to genomic diagnostics \u2014 matching cancer patients to therapies tailored spec ifically to them. Collectively known as OmniSeq SM Precision Medical Technology , OmniSeq provides oncology groups, hospitals, and healthcare systems with the first-ever fusion of cl inical genomics and a comprehensive information technology solution that provides easy access to actionable insights about their patient's condition and available treatment options . Like Roswell Park, OmniSeq is based in Buffalo, NY. Early age at menarche, or first menstrual cycle, co uld play a role in the disproportionate incidence of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers diagnosed among African-American women, according to a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . The study is a result of a multicenter collaborative research effort that formed the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium (AMB ER) , which includes Christine Ambrosone, PhD , Senior Vice President of Population Sciences and Chair of the Department of Cancer Prevention and Control at RPCI, Andrew Olsha n, PhD, Professor and Associate Director for Population Sciences at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Julie Palmer, ScD, Professor of Epidemi ology at the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University. AMBER researchers investigated t he epidemiologic and genetic causes for more aggressive breast cancer in African-American w omen. They combined four epidemiologic studies with large numbers of African-American part icipants: The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) , the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) , the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS) , and the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS) . The researchers conclude that age at menarche may be critical even in the development of ER-negative breast cancer, regardless of having children, and that the origins of ER-negative vs. ER-positive breast cancer at the cellular and molecular level may be different. A major unsolved mystery in immunity relates to the mechanisms underlying the protective action of fever. A review of the current understand ing of how fever impacts the immune system is offered by researchers from RPCI and published i n the recent journal of Nature Reviews Immunology . New insights regarding the benefit of the heat co mponent of a natural fever response are being exploited by the research progra ms of Sharon Evans, PhD , and Elizabeth Repasky, PhD , both Professors of Oncology in the Department of Immunology, to boost the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In the largest multi-institutional study to date, p atients diagnosed with bladder cancer and treated with robot-assisted surgery (ROS) experienc ed similar results to those who underwent a traditional open operation, according to research l ed by scientists at RPCI. The study results were recently published in the journal of the European Association of Urology . Khurshid Guru, MD , Director of Robotic Surgery in the Department of Urology at RPCI, reported that research results found that robot-assisted radical cystectom y provides similar early oncological outcomes while reducing operative blood loss. This research continues to document the viability of this type of minimally invasive surgery, according to James Mohler, MD , Associate Director and Senior Vice President for Translational Research at Roswell Park. Ovarian cancer patients and survivors may benefit f rom exercise during and after treatment while under the care of their physician, according to results of a comprehensive literature review published online in Gynecologic Oncology . Cannioto, EdD , Research Associate, both in the Department of Can cer Prevention and Control at RPCI, investigated the relationship betw een physical activity and risk factors for ovarian cancer. Twenty-six peer-reviewed research s tudies were included in the analysis. The majority of case-control studies demonstrated evide nce of a protective effect of exercise relative to ovarian cancer risk with significant re ductions of 30% to 60% among the most active women. However, cohort studies showed mixed results . Some of the most exciting recent advances in cancer treatment have involved adoptive T-cell therapy, in which a patient's immune cells are retr ained to recognize and attack tumor cells. New findings reported by RPCI researchers in the jo urnal Nature Communications help explain why these approaches have been so effective, reveal ing a critical role for a particular signaling protein and opening up several possible strategies for improving these emerging cancer therapies. Visualizing blood vessels in real time, the researchers, led by Sharon Evans, PhD , Professor of Oncology, observed that the chemokine receptor CXCR3 must be present on the T cells, or T lymphocytes, in order for these importa nt cancer-fighting cells to be delivered to tumors. The scientists, who included collaborators from the University of Rochester Medical Center/Wilmot Cancer Center , the University of Chicago and Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School , were surprised to find that CXCR3 molecules serve the same function in both human melanoma cells and in precli nical models of melanoma, and that other, similar chemokine receptors do not possess this abi lity. These results suggest that the mechanisms governing T-cell homing are more complex than previously realized, and that T cells may respond differently to trafficking cues dependi ng on the disease setting. Cigarette smokers appear to be influenced by electr onic cigarette advertising, according to a study published online in the journal Tobacco Induced Diseases . Danielle Smith, MPH , Senior Research Associate and Andrew Hyland, PhD , Chair, both of the Department of Health Behavior at RPCI, conducted a pilot study to examine whether or not exposure to ads for e-cigarettes influenced interest in trying e-cigarettes among a sample of 600 smokers and non-smokers from 18 - 65 years of age. Tobacco cessation provided significant survival ben efit for lung cancer patients who quit smoking shortly before or after diagnosis, despite the severity of the disease. Results of the RPCI study were published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology . RPCI has a unique Tobacco Assessment and Cessation Service (TACS) that conducts a standardized tobacco use assessmen t for lung cancer patients treated in the Thoracic Ce nter, and automatically refers patients who smoke to a dedicated tobacco cessation counseling s ervice. Using data from TACS, 250 patients participated in the study. Those who had recently s topped smoking (50 patients), or quit after their first contact with TACS (71 patients) had red uced mortality rates compared to patients who continued to use tobacco. The median survival f or patients who reported they had stopped smoking was 28 months compared with 18 months for t hose who continued to use tobacco. The survival advantage for those who stopped smoking wa s adjusted for demographics, disease stage and other health characteristics. Study resul ts also suggested that there may be a survival benefit even if a patient has not completely quit t obacco use, but continues to attempt to quit after a cancer diagnosis. Mortality rates for those who relapsed were similar to current users. Mary Reid, MSPH, PhD , Director of Cancer Screening and Survivorship at Roswell Park, is senior author on the study. It has long been known that rates of breast and cer vical cancer screening among Latinas are low compared to rates for U.S. women overall. A study l ed by researchers at RPCI found that age and fear of cancer diagnosis are among the reasons why Latina women do not continue participation following breast and cervical cancer education prog rams. The research was published in the Journal of Health Communication: International Pers pectives. This research is a secondary analysis of a large randomized, controlled study re ported earlier and was designed to specifically understand the characteristics of women who were lo st to attrition for follow-up telephone calls following participation in the multisite, peer-led education program Esperanza y Vida (EyV) . Deborah Erwin, PhD , is Principal Investigator of the study and Direct or of the Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research at Roswell Park. Argos Therapeutics Inc. , an immuno-oncology company focused on the develop ment and commercialization of immunotherapies for the treatm ent of cancer based on the Arcelis technology platform, announced the initiation of a single-center pilot clinical trial of AGS-003 as a neoadjuvant immunotherapy, or treatment to shrink a tumor before surgery, in patients with localized renal-cell carcinoma. The study is being conducted at RPCI, and is designed to enroll a maximum of 10 patients who will be treated with AGS -003 before nephrectomy in order to assess immune-system response and tumor effects. Thomas Schwaab, MD, PhD , Chief of Strategy, Business Development & Outreach, Associat e Professor of Oncology, in the departments of urology and immunology and urology c linic director at RPCI is principal investigator for the AGS-003 pilot study. Argos is evaluating AGS-003 in the phase III ADAPT trial in combination with standard targeted therapy for t he treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The ADAPT trial is fully enrolled; inter im data analyses are expected next year, with final data expected in the first part of 2017. Dr. Schwaab is a member of Argos' inaugural Scientific Advisory Board and receives compensation from Argos for this service. The Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine opened its new Frozen Section/Cytology Fast Stain Suite in August 2015. This area services the urgent need s of the operating room and endoscopy areas. Having these la bs in proximity to the Surgical Suites and the Endoscopy Center\u2014where tissue specimens are obt ained\u2014streamlines communication between medical and surgical teams, enhances proced ures and improves diagnosis. The new suites also include new technology that allows the pathologist to project an image of what he or she sees under the microscopic onto any PC on the R PCI network. This allows the pathologist to conference remotely with other pathologists and/or with the surgeon or endoscopist in real time. This results in decreased procedure time and also decreases the number of biopsies needed to obtain a diagnosis. In addition to improv ing the continuum of care for RPCI's patients, the suite enhances the Institute's educational miss ion by allowing trainees, including fellows, residents and medical students to view diagnostic m aterial in real time as the patient is undergoing a procedure giving immediate feedback to correlate the clinical impression with the pathology findings. One patient's journey undergoing three Blood and Ma rrow Transplants while struggling with myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disease that can lead to acute leukemia, has provided new insights into mechanisms that may reduce some negat ive transplant side effects. The case study was published as a Letter to the Editor in Bone Marrow Transplantation , an online journal which is part of Nature Publishing Group. The key finding of this report highlights the ability of the normal donor blood and marrow cells to eliminate th e malignant cells while leaving the patient's normal cells alone, not causing the negative side e ffect of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). This is the first case describing a prolonged remis sion with JAK2 negativity whose transplant initially did not take after BMT. Philip McCarthy, MD is the senior author of the article and Director, Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, Depar tment of Medicine. He is collaborating with his colleague, Xuefang Cao, MD, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Immunology. A paradox of cancer therapy is that sometimes treat ment can make the disease worse. John Ebos, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology, Departments of C ancer Genetics and Medicine at RPCI has published a review in the journal Cancer Research that explains this phenomenon in preclinical studies and details examples of when tr eatment helped cancer metastases spread and grow. Understanding these mechanisms may hold c lues as to why the benefits of certain cancer treatments in humans are often more limited than preclinical models predict. A broader exploration of this phenomenon may help explain tre atment failure and provide clues on how to improve patient treatment outcomes. Christine Ambrosone, PhD , Senior Vice President of Population Sciences and Chair, Cancer Prevention & Control, and Chi-Chen Hong, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology, are featured authors invited to offer 'state of the science' ana lysis along with their perspectives on the advances and future directions in breast cancer res earch in the book, Improving Outcomes for Breast Cancer Survivors. This new publication was e dited by Patricia Ganz, MD, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, and published by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Nearly three million U.S. breast cancer survivors m ust adjust to a new normal. The publication focuses on patient-centered outcomes of breast canc er, highlighting specific patient populations, their unique needs and experiences, as well as issues such as quality of life and psychosocial concerns. Dr. Ganz noted that the cont ributing authors' research reveals the depth and breadth of scientific research on breast cancer outcomes. New officers for the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Me dicine (ASRA) began their terms at the 40th Annual Regional Anesthesiol ogy and Pain Medicine Meeting, and the President of the prestigious organization is Roswel l Park's Oscar DeLeon, MD , Chief of the Division of Pain Medicine and Professor of Oncology . ASRA is the largest subspecialty medical society in anesthesiology. Its mission and vision a ddress the clinical and professional educational needs of physicians and scientists, ensuring excell ence in patient care, utilizing regional anesthesia and pain medicine, and investigating the scientific basis of the specialty. A history of oral contraceptive use and having at l east one child increased longevity by nearly three years in patients diagnosed with ovarian canc er, according to a RPCI study published online ahead of print in the International Journal of Gynecological Cancer . Kirsten Moysich, PhD , is senior author of the study and Professor of Onco logy in the Department of Cancer Prevention and Control at Roswell Park. A history of oral cont raceptive use was associated with a 35-month improvement in survival (81 versus 46 months) in 38 7 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer between January 1982 and December 1998 at RPCI. Thi s association was even more pronounced when adjusted for age at diagnosis, stage of diseas e and ovarian cancer subtype. Additionally, patients who reported a single live birth lived mor e than four and a half years longer than those who never gave birth. However, the survival advanta ge was not significantly different between those who did and did not take oral contraceptive p ills. An innovative vaccine therapy developed at RPCI is being tested in a multisite clinical trial involving 50 patients with newly diagnosed glioblas toma brain tumors. The phase II study, now accruing patients at both Roswell Park and the Cleveland Clinic , will assess the effectiveness of the SurVaxM vaccine in combination with standard chemotherapy a s treatment for this often- fatal cancer. Though relatively rare, glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor. The SurVaxM vaccine, developed by Roswell Park faculty members Robert Fenstermaker, MD , and Michael Ciesielski, PhD , targets survivin, a cell-survival protein that's present in the vast majority of cancers, including glioblastoma. A peptide mimic, the vaccine is engineered to treat survivin-expressing cancer cell s as foreigners, inciting a specific immune response. Preclinical studies suggest that the appr oach may be worthy of additional study in melanoma, ovarian and prostate tumors and perhaps i n other survivin-expressing cancers. In an article for the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics , J. Brian Szender, MD , Clinical Chief, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, reviewed the state of the sci ence regarding the surgical removal of the fallopian tubes as an option to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. The fallopian tubes have been proposed as one of the places where ovarian cancer develops. More and more medical experts are recommending removal of the fallopian tubes aft er childbearing among women undergoing other surgeries as a way to reduce the risk of ovar ian cancer. The fallopian tubes may be the origin of up to half of ovarian cancers, and removi ng the fallopian tubes when women have completed childbearing may reduce the rate of ovari an cancer in the population by 20-40 percent. However, as the general population of wome n is at low risk for developing ovarian cancer, fallopian tubes would only be removed from willing patients who are undergoing surgery for other reasons. Significant differences in attitudes toward smoking cessation are reported between two generations of smokers in Northern Appalachia (whic h includes 14 New York state counties) in new research from RPCI. The qualitative study about beliefs, attitudes and experiences of current and former smokers in Northern Appalachian communities, published online ahead of print in the Journal of Community Health , contributes novel information about smoking cessation. Martin Mahoney, MD, PhD , is senior author of the research and Professor of Oncology in the Department of Medicine at RPCI. Elisa Rodriguez, PhD , is lead author of the study and Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Of fice of Cancer Health Disparities Research and the Center For Personalized Medicine at RPCI. Three-quarters of women treated for ovarian cancer face relapse of their disease. And while those who respond well to initial therapy do tend t o survive longer, they require additional treatment for recurring cancer just as frequently a s other women whose initial treatment response was not so pronounced. This is a key concl usion of new research from RPCI, published online ahead of print in the journal Gynecologic Oncology , which contributes new information about the dynamics of recurrent ovarian cancer. Thi s study analyzed two time frames: the time from the start of chemotherapy to when the disease reoccurs and the time from the end of one chemotherapy regimen to the commencement of the nex t. Kevin Eng, PhD , is lead author of the study and Assistant Professor of Oncology in the De partment of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Roswell Park. J. Brian Szender, MD, MS , is senior author and a fellow in Gynecologic Onco logy at RPCI. Martin Morgan, PhD , joined RPCI as an Associate Member of the Departm ent of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. He remains Director of the R/Bioconductor Project , an open-source, open- development software system created to provide tool s for high-throughput analysis and comprehension of genomic data \u2014 a resource now base d at Roswell Park. Dr. Morgan joins Roswell Park and the University at Buffalo's School of Public Health and Health Professions, where he will serve as Research Professor in the De partment of Biostatistics, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, where he was Principal Scientist within the Division of Public Health Sciences. He's been invol ved with R/Bioconductor since 2005 and has led the project since 2008. In separate studies presented at the European Cancer Congress (ECCO 2015) , which was held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO 2015) , researchers from RPCI reported promising findings about a pair of breakthrough drugs in cancers that have in the past proven to be notoriou sly difficult to treat. Saby George, MD, FACP, Associate Professor of Oncology, was co-author on the landmark CheckMate 025 phase III study (abstract 3LBA) compa ring the effectiveness of the anti-PD-1 targeted immunotherapy drug nivolumab (brand name O pdivo) with standard chemotherapy (everolimus, brand name Afinitor) in advanced kidne y cancer, and presenting author on a related study of nivolumab in patients treated beyo nd the progression of their disease. The findings from the phase III study, which was stoppe d early because evidence showed a clear benefit of treatment with nivolumab, were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recen tly granted Breakthrough Therapy status to nivolumab based on t hese striking findings, which mark the first time an agent has demonstrated, as a primary endpoi nt, an overall survival benefit compared to standard of care in second-line metastatic renal ce ll carcinoma. Wen Wee Ma, MBBS , presented new findings on MM-398, a nanoliposomal irinotecan (also known as nal-IRI), in collaboration with NAPOLI-1 i nvestigators and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, led by Dr. Bambang Adiwijaya as the clinical pharma cologist. Dr. Ma also presented the results of a phase Ib study of dovitinib plus standard chem otherapy (gemcitabine and capecitabine) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, concludin g that this combination merits further study. The key to immune-based cancer therapies lies in th e ability to exploit some weakness within the tumor and its environment or to elude cancer's offenses. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports , researchers led by a group from the RPCI Center for Immunotherapy have shared new insights about a subset of T cells that appear to d o both those things, inhibiting cancer growth at the same time that they enhance the tumor-killing p owers of other immune cells. The researchers identified a subset of CD4+ \"helper\" T cells that they call \"tumor-recognizing CD4+ T cells\" or TR-CD4 because of their unique ability to recognize and respond to cancer cells. These special CD4+ T cells are antigen-specific: they rec ognize the tumor antigen NY-ESO-1, which is expressed by many solid tumors, including ovarian, melanoma, prostate, lung, breast and synovial sarcoma cancers. Kunle Odunsi, MD, PhD , Cancer Center Deputy Director, Executive Director of Roswell Park's Center for Immunotherapy is senior author on the new study. Kara Kelly, MD was appointed as the new leader of the joint progr am in pediatric hematology/oncology, a partnership of Women & Child ren's Hospital of Buffalo (WCHOB), RPCI, UBMD Pediatrics and the University at Buffalo (UB). WCHOB, RPCI and UB have provided pediatric hematology and cancer care through a comp rehensive and collaborative program for more than 40 years. Dr. Kelly came to RPCI from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Her appointments as Chair of Pediatric Oncology, Profes sor of Oncology and the Waldemar J. Kaminski Endowed Chair of Pediatrics at RPCI and Me dical Director of the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Service Line at WCHOB, a Kaleid a Health facility, took effect on February 15, 2016. Dr. Kelly also assumed the responsibiliti es of Division Chief of Hematology and Oncology at both UBMD Pediatrics and the Department of Pediatrics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, where she was appointed research professor. Kelly is recognized nationally and internationally as an expert in the treatment of pediatric lymphoma and leukemia and serves as the chairperson of the Hodgkin lymphoma committee of the Children's Oncology Group. Kelly brings a wealt h of knowledge in clinical trials and integrative medicine to the Western New York commun ity, with a keen interest on how nutrition and diet may help children being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) better tolerate their therapy. Her focus on helping patien ts and their families cope with cancer therapy led her to co-author Integrative Strategies for Can cer Patients: A Practical Resource for Managing the Side Effects of Cancer Therapy (Hacken sack: World Scientific Publishing, 2012). There has been great progress in recent decades in the treatment of pediatric cancers, with high cure rates possible today for several childhood mal ignancies. Prognosis remains poor, however, for children diagnosed with a number of pediatric c ancers, and many existing therapies are associated with long-term side effects that impact survivors' life expectancy and/or quality of life. Writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine , an international team of scientists from the Children's Cancer Institute-Australia (CCIA), RPCI and Incuron LLC report significant progress toward addressing these persistent challen ges. The CCIA's Daniel Carter, PhD , Glenn Marshall, MD, and co-authors report that they have identified a new treatment approach for a highly aggressive and usually fatal subtype of neur oblastoma, a cancer of nerve cells that is one of the most frequent solid tumors in children. The researchers provide evidence that the protein complex FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) represents a new and promising biomarker candidate and a target for treatment of this aggres sive, treatment-resistant disease. They observe that a FACT-targeting drug candidate \u2014 CBL0 137, which was developed by the biotech company Incuron, in collaboration with scientists f rom RPCI \u2014 has demonstrated significant antitumor activity in preclinical models of neurobl astoma. CBL0137 is a small molecule that belongs to a class of agents called curaxins, which were invented by a group that included paper co-author Andrei Gudkov, PhD, DSci , Senior Vice President for Basic Science at Roswel l Park and founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Incuron. A majority of youths who report having used tobacco say their first experience using tobacco involved a flavored product. That's the key finding of new research based on the first large U.S. study to survey users about a wide variety of tobac co products, and its implications for public health and health policy are significant, say the s tudy's authors. Writing in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, Bridget K. Ambros e, PhD, MPH, of the Center for Tobacco Products, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and co lleagues outline their analysis of flavored tobacco use as reported by U.S. youth participating in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study , a study of 45,971 U.S. adults and youth. Andrew Hyland, PhD , Scientific Principal Investigator of the PATH Study and a co-author on the new study, notes that most of the young tobacco users responding to the s urvey also reported that they were currently using flavored tobacco products. Two studies from JAMA , the Journal of the American Medical Association, report that fewer men are being screened for prostate cancer. These f indings are concerning, says James Mohler, MD , Chair of the Department of Urology at Roswell Par k and also Chair of the NCCN's Prostate Cancer Guidelines Committee, particularly since the y also noted a pronounced decrease in the numbers of men being diagnosed with early-stage pro state cancers. Dr. Mohler advised that PSA testing should be personalized and used more freque ntly in men who are African American, who have brothers or fathers who have been diagnosed wi th prostate cancer, or who have BRAC mutations or Agent Orange exposure. RPCI transfuses more than 17,000 blood products eac h year. Thanks to committed donors, RPCI successfully meets the needs of its patients. Throu ghout the fiscal year, the Donor Center at Roswell Park facilitated more than 1,000 whole blood donations a nd more than 4,000 platelet donations. Large studies have shown improved survival for pati ents with esophageal cancer who receive both chemotherapy and radiation ahead of surgery to remove their tumors. However, looking to isolate the driving factors behind these favorable responses, a group of surgeons and biostatisticians from RPCI found that this approach was much more effective in patients whose esophageal cancer had spread to the lymph nodes. Th is suggests the possibility that this treatment option might not be the best choice for p atients with no evidence of lymphatic spread, according to the study, which was published in JAMA Surgery . The researchers, led by Moshim Kukar, MD , Assistant Professor of Oncology, and Emmanuel Gabriel, MD, PhD , Clinical Fellow, of the Department of Surgical Onco logy at Roswell Park, conducted a retrospective analysis using American College of Su rgeons National Cancer Data Base records from 1998 to 2006. They looked primarily at overall survival three years after diagnosis of esophageal cancer. As secondary outcomes, they also looked at surgical margin status, postoperative length of stay, unplanned readmission rate and mortality within 30 days of surgery. The researchers plan to use the study resu lts in a survival calculator they are developing that they hope will predict outcomes for individual patients with esophageal cancer, based on unique factors and circumstances. Acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as acute rena l failure, is one of the main contributors to death and disability worldwide, yet no preventive t reatment for the condition has been established. In a new study published in the journa l Cell Death and Differentiation , a team of researchers led by scientists from RPCI reports tha t they have identified 10 genes whose inhibition appears to protect kidney cells. The fin dings point the way to strategies for preventing AKI, perhaps through treatment with existing, well- tolerated drugs, and may also help to evade drug resistance in cancer therapy. The research tea m, led by Eugene Kandel, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cell Str ess Biology at Roswell Park, used high- throughput functional-genomics technology to uncove r 10 genes, interference with which protects kidney epithelial cells in ischemia-like c onditions. Further experiments have shown that chemical inhibition of the product of one of the ge nes \u2014 TACR1 \u2014 reduces the extent of ischemic AKI in laboratory models. The team also fo und that some of these same genes are involved in how cells respond to not only ischemia but other damaging stresses as well, including those triggered by anti-cancer therapy. The size of a surgically removed tumor is generally thought to relate to the risk of the cancer spreading to other regions of the body. But because tumor cells may metastasize at different times and the rate of spread is difficult to assess , the relationship between tumor size and the relative risk of recurrence after surgery is challe nging to calculate. Writing in the journal Cancer Research , scientists at RPCI and Inria, the French National Institute for computer science and applied mathematics in Bordeaux, France, demonstrat e that mathematical models can provide useful clues about the impact of surgery on metasta sis and may help to predict the risk of cancer spread. The mathematical modeling confirmed a stro ng dependence between presurgical primary tumor size and postsurgical metastatic grow th and survival. The study's senior author is John Ebos, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology in the department s of Cancer Genetics and Medicine at RPCI. In the five decades since camptothecin was first is olated from the bark of a tree used in traditional Chinese medicine and identified as a po werful anticancer agent, several thousand chemicals with similar structures and functions hav e been investigated. And while two of these analog compounds, irinotecan and topotecan, have be en approved in the U.S. as treatments for cancer, both are associated with significant shortc omings. Researchers from RPCI have reported findings about a new synthetic form of camptothecin , known as FL118, that appears to have greater potency, longer efficacy and fewer adverse side effects than irinotecan and topotecan. Writing in the American Journal of Translational Research, a team led by Fengzhi Li, PhD , Associate Professor of Oncology, of the Roswell Par k Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics has documented the findings of their l atest preclinical study of FL118, which was shown to effectively eliminate human colon and head -and-neck xenograft tumors that were developed to be resistant to both irinotecan and to potecan. More than a dozen RPCI researchers were invited to present findings at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 57th Annual Meeting & Exposition, a four-day meetin g in Orlando, Fla. Among them were four teams invited to deliver podiu m presentations detailing what they learned from their latest research projects. Lara Sucheston-Campbell, PhD , formerly of RPCI, gave an oral presentation on a genome-wide associat ion study (GWAS) conducted to determine whether outcomes for patients receiving blood and m arrow transplant (BMT) could be improved by identifying genetic factors in both transplant r ecipients and their unrelated donors. This GWAS, named the DISCOVeRY-BMT (Determining the Infl uence of Susceptibility Conveying Variants Related to One-Year Mortality after BMT) p roject, is the largest study of its kind and the first GWAS of survival following BMT from an unrela ted donor. This effort was supported by the largest Research Project (R01) grant ever awarded t o RPCI researchers by the NIH and one of its member agencies, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute . A podium presentation by Theresa Hahn, PhD , detailed additional findings from the same DISCOVeRY-BMT GWAS. Dr. Hahn and colleagues examine d genotype profiles for thousands of BMT recipients and their unrelated donors. Dr. Hahn is a Professor of Oncology in the Department of Medicine. Kyle Runckel, a predoctoral trainee in the Department of Immunolo gy, gave an oral presentation from Roswell Park at the ASH 2015 meet ing, reporting findings from a study in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most com mon form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The addition of rituximab as a frontline treatment for this disease, in combination with other agents, has significantly improved outcomes for patients wi th relapsed/refractory DLBCL, but drug resistance remains an issue for many patients. Adam Utley , a Predoctoral Trainee in the Department of Immuno logy, was a presenter from RPCI at the ASH 2015 meeting.

However, MRI-detected lobular neoplasi a, occurs far less commonly and the rate of upgrade to breast cancer is unknown due to the rari ty of this scenario. Lead author on the study is Thaer Khoury, MD, FCAP , Professor in the Department of Pathology and Labo ratory Medicine at RPCI. Dr. Khoury and RPCI's Prasanna Kumar, MD , Assistant Professor in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology, were able to collect a large number of cases thanks to collaborative work with other institutions including University of Pit tsburgh Medical Center, Washington University, and Montefiore Medical Center. RPCI scientists report a novel enzyme inhibitor, Pe vonedistat, demonstrated effectiveness in the laboratory against Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), a ra re and aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The study was published in a recent issue of the journal Blood , a medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Lead researcher on the study is Francisco Hernandez- Ilizaliturri, MD , Clinical Chief for Lymphoma and Myeloma at Roswel l Park. Researchers in the Department of Pharmacology and T herapeutics at RPCI offer greater clarity of how a novel class of cancer-targeting agents cal led BET (Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal) inhibitors stimulate cell death in laboratory model s of human cancers, specifically B-cell lymphomas. These findings were reported in a recent issue of issue of Cell Death and Disease. Senior author of the research is Leigh Ellis, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology. Dr. Ellis and the team of Roswell Park scientists also provided n ew insights into how BET inhibitors are capable of killing cancer cells and demonstrated th eir promise as a potential anti-cancer therapy option for patients with treatment-resistant B-cell lymphoma. A research team from the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at RPCI has discovered a new class of small-molecule compounds that are good candidates for development of novel targeted therapies in the treatment of leu kemia and lymphoma. This new class of compounds drives cancer cells to suicide, the resea rchers report in the peer-reviewed journal Cell Death and Diseas e. The study's senior author is Xinjiang Wang, PhD , Assistant Professor of Oncology. An analysis of 145 different electronic-cigarette f lavoring products reveals that many e-cigarette users may be exposed to a potentially harmful chemi cal. In a research letter published online in the peer-reviewed journal Thorax , a research team led by Maciej Goniewicz, PhD, PharmD , reports that high levels of the respiratory irritan t benzaldehyde were detected in the vapor from most of the flavored nicotine products they studied , with the highest concentrations in vapor from cherry-flavored products. The authors, who inc lude researchers from the Institute of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health and the Medical University of Silesia , both in Poland, measured benzaldehyde levels for 145 dif ferent flavored nicotine products using an automatic smoking simulator and calculated daily ex posure to users from 163 e-cigarette puffs. Their analysis detected benzaldehyde in the vapor f rom 108 (74%) of the flavored products studied, and found concentrations of the chemical t hat were 43 times higher in cherry-flavored products than in other flavors. Dr. Goniewicz, the paper's senior author and Assistant Professor of Oncology in Roswell Park's Department of Health Behavior, notes that this research was focused on a single toxicant and should be interpre ted as a first step in understanding the potential health effects from flavored e-cigarettes . Successful recruitment and retention efforts, new c ollaborations with regional partners and setting the stage for new clinical and scientific i nitiatives all marked the first 12 months that Candace S. Johnson, PhD served as President and CEO of RPCI. In the year since Dr. Johnson was appointed, outpat ient visits were up 6 percent, overall operating revenues were up 7 percent, revenues from clinical activity were up 13 percent, and the numbers of new patients turning to the Institut e for the first time were up 21 percent.

Ernstoff, MD , was appointed Professor and Chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology in the Department of Medicine i n the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo (U B), and Chair of the Department of Medicine and Senior Vice President of Clinical Investigation at RPCI. Ernstoff also will serve as chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UBMD Internal Me dicine, the clinical practice plan of the UB Department of Medicine. The appointments took ef fect on April 1. In 2014, Ernstoff became the Director of the Melanoma Program at Cleveland C linic's Taussig Cancer Institute. From 1991 to 2014, he served as Associate Professor of Medici ne and Professor of Medicine at Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine and Dartmouth-H itchcock Medical Center. During much of his tenure, Ernstoff was the director of the Melano ma Program at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center and the Section Chief of Hematology/Oncology . Ernstoff was previously a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine, where he directed the Hematology/Oncology fellowship training program; he also was an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale University and Director of its Cli nical Research Office. Ernstoff's clinical research is focused on the treatment of melanoma an d genitourinary cancers. A member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Melanoma Comm ittee, he is also a member of the International Melanoma Working Group. For nearly a decade, RPCI has collaborated with Cleveland BioLabs Inc. (CBLI), a Buffalo-based company, to support the development of a drug that has applications as both a cancer immunotherapy and a radiation countermeasure. They recently published the latest findings from these combined efforts in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) . This preclinical research, by a team of scientist s led by Andrei Gudkov, PhD, DSc, Chief Scientific Officer of CBLI and Senior Vice P resident of Basic Science at Roswell Park, provides new insight on ho w CBLI's most advanced drug candidate, entolimod (also known as CBLB502), works with an or ganism's immune system. They report that entolimod, which belongs to the class of agents cal led toll-like receptor 5 agonists, suppresses cancer metastasis and induces immune activity by si mulating a cascade of cell-signaling events involving three different types of immune cells. A team of RPCI researchers has developed and evalua ted the first intravital microscopy system shown to be safe for use in humans. Writing in the journal Nature Communications , the scientists report that their proprietary technology enabled them, for the first time ever, to visualize tumor blood vessels in real time. In a sm all study involving patients with melanoma tumors, the researchers show that this approach to viewing malignancies in real time during surgery is not only feasible, but that it revealed unexpected findings about the vasculature of human tumors, with potentially significant implicat ions regarding the delivery of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A team led by Joseph Skitzki, MD, FACS, Chair of the Melanoma/Sarcoma Disease Site Researc h Group at Roswell Park, designed and constructed a mobile platform for performing IV M in humans in the operating room. While most surgical microscopes allow for 15X magnificati on, their IVM platform enables magnification of 100X or higher. In their newly pub lished feasibility study, the investigators report their findings from IVM observation of the t umors of 10 patients with melanoma. Ovarian cancer, one of the deadliest malignancies, is actually a constellation of different cancers that may originate in other organs and should not b e treated as a single disease, concludes a new congressionally mandated report on the state of ovarian cancer incidence, treatment and research. The report, published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine , also highlights persistent serious disparities in delivery of care across different groups of women in the U.S ., and suggests promising areas for further research. Kunle Odunsi, MD, PhD, FRCOG, FACOG , Deputy Director and Chair of Gynecologic Oncology at RPCI is co-author on the study. The rep ort notes that the five-year survival of women with the most common and fatal type of ovaria n cancer, high-grade serous carcinoma, has increased from 36 percent to nearly 46 percent over the past four decades as a result of advances in specialty care and the development of e ffective first-line chemotherapy. Seven RPCI teams were invited to present their rese arch at the 69th annual Cancer Symposium of the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) , March 2-5 in Boston, Mass: Emmanuel Gabriel, MD , Clinical Fellow, and faculty member Moshim Kukar, MD , Assistant Professor of Oncology, both of the RPCI Department of Surgical Oncology developed two novel calculators for esophageal cancer patients that ide ntify who will derive a survival benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation and predict individualiz ed three-year overall survival from multimodality therapy. The model included patients from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) and incorporated data on age, disease grade and sta ge and neoadjuvant chemoradiation, among other factors. Roswell Park researchers led by Steven Nurkin, MD, MS, FACS , developed a user-friendly point- of-care mobile risk calculator to assist in decisio n-making regarding the potential benefit of surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HC C). The analysis was based on National Cancer Data Base records for 5,455 HCC patients. Th is web-based tool accurately predicted overall survival at one, three and five years. Sign ificant factors associated with survival included age, sex, Charleson-Deyo score, histology, grade, t umor size, node status, clinical stage, AFP level, presence of cirrhosis, surgery, margin type and adjuvant therapy. Ongoing research using this calculator will incorporate perioperative outc omes into the decision-making process. Community Support & Advocacy Empire State Development (ESD) President, CEO & Com missioner Howard Zemsky and RPCI President & Chief Executive Officer Candace S. Johnson, PhD , announced that following the NYS Trade Mission to Cuba , RPCI has signed an agreement with Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology (CIM) to develop a unique lung cancer vaccine, CimaVax, with a clinical trial in the United States. RPCI has partnered with the CIM thr ough academic and preclinical research exchanges since 2011. Leaders from business and higher education joined N ew York's trade mission to Cuba on April 20 and 21 - the first Governor-led state trade mission to Cuba since President Obama began the process to normalize diplomatic relations between t he United States and Cuba. Roswell Park was represented on the trade mission by Dr. Johnson , who is also Wallace Family Chair in Immunology at the Institute, and Jacobs Family Chai r in Immunology Dr. Kelvin Lee . Pactimo , a Colorado sports apparel company, debuted a new \"Riding to Cure Cancer\" cycling jersey in support of The Ride For Roswell , the largest single-day cycling fundraiser in Nort h America. For each jersey that's sold, Pactimo will donate $25 to Roswell Park. Funds raised through jersey sales will support the Institute's c utting-edge research and patient care programs. Donations are further used to improve the patient and family experience, support new clinical treatments, provide proper clinical sp ace to meet the growing demand for cancer services and educate the next generation of cancer scientists and clinicians. More than 35 Roswell Park employees participated in the Undy Run/Walk . In addition, a table of educational information was available to all par ticipants of this event. Organized by the Colon Cancer Alliance, the Undy Run raises awareness with in the Western New York community about colon cancer screening and prevention. Roswell Park oncologists applauded actress Rita Wil son for drawing attention to the importance of second opinions regarding cancer diagnosis and t reatment. As she announced her recent double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery follow ing a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, Wilson noted that her cancer was confirmed only whe n she sought a second opinion. Roswell Park breast surgeons Dr. Helen Cappuccino , Assistant Professor of Oncology, and Dr. Shicha Kumar , Assistant Professor of Oncology, praised Wilson f or sharing her experiences to educate others. Both said they always encourage patients to seek out additional medical opinions before finalizing any plans for cancer treatment. In the early part of the 20th century, most people died of infectious diseases, with tuberculosis and influenza heading the list. But even as antibio tics, better hygiene and sanitation drove down those death rates, a new and largely preventable th reat moved in: obesity. Today the top two causes of death in the U.S. are heart disease and c ancer, with diabetes closely following, and obesity is strongly associated with all three. Rodney Haring, PhD, LMSW , Assistant Professor of Oncology, Office of Cancer Health Disparities Resea rch, is working to change that trend, especially among Native Americans, who have higher- than-average rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, and specific types of can cer. With an $86,000+ award from Roswell Park's Cancer Center Support Grant, he's creating a workplace program to educate Native Americans about maintaining a healthy weight to pre vent the life-threatening diseases that obesity can cause. Candace S. Johnson, PhD , President & CEO of RPCI and Wallace Family Chair in Translational Research, was the featured speaker at the Women in STEM Seminar and Networking event on Wednesday, May 6. Dr. Johnson offered remarks in a presentation titled \"Women in STEM: Progress and Challenges.\" The program is an opportu nity to bring people together who support women who are looking for or already have careers i n the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. The event is hosted by Buffalo Women in STEM and the WNY STEM Hub , an organization that facilitates collaborations amo ng business, education, community organizations, arts and cultural organizations, and government entities to advance the interdisciplinary teaching and learning of science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics in support of sustained economic and in tellectual vitality in our five-county region. RPCI and the University at Buffalo (UB) have been granted accreditation by the Commission on Dental Accreditation for a newly created general-practice dental reside ncy program. Students in the one-year program will rotate between the UB Den tal and RPCI Dental Services. The training program is designed to provide qualified graduates of dental schools with a fundamental knowledge of the multidisciplinary care of oncology patients, along with in-depth practical training in dental care for these patients. Residen ts will receive instruction and hands-on education in the treatment of patients who have bee n recently diagnosed with head and neck cancers, as well as education in comprehensive dent al treatments for patients who are either undergoing active cancer therapies or are in remiss ion. Residents also will have the opportunity to participate in current research projects involvi ng the early detection of oral cancer in high-risk patients. University at Buffalo faculty will overse e the residents' academic and clinical training. Residents at Roswell Park will spend approximately 70% of their time in the clinical care of patients, under the supervision of academic and pra cticing dental clinicians specializing in oncology. RPCI's Breast Cancer and Gynecologic Oncology Teams engaged with more than 1,000 women at the La Femme Women's Expo on April 26, 2015. Information and resources were shared on the prevention, detection and treatment of all types of cancer. Dr. Sara Majewski , Dr. Stacey Akers , Dr. Amy Early , Kilian Salerno , Young , Dr. Tracey O'Connor , Dr. Emese Zsiros and Dr. Wong Moon attended to answer questions from the public. Addi tionally, 10 Roswell Park cancer survivors walked down the runway and were ho nored by the crowd. On May 1, 2015 Roswell Park hosted a free skin cancer screening event open to the public. More than 200 attendees received screenings from Ro swell Park physicians. The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imagi ng, Eastern Great Lakes Chapter (SNMMI-EGLC) , held its annual meeting at RPCI on May 8 and May 9, 2015. The title of the meeting was: Education and Advocacy, Nuclear/Molecu lar Imaging and the Future. The keynote presenter for the meeting was Robert Wah, MD , President of the American Medical Association (AMA). Research found no racial or ethnic disparities amon g patients who participate in the Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Program at RPCI. The results were published in the journal Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation . Theresa Hahn, PhD , Professor of Oncology in the Department of Medicine at RPCI and senior author of the study, notes that while rates of hematologic malignancy referrals and use of BMT for minorities may appear low (less than 10%), they closely reflect both the racial distribution o f all BMT cases and the general population within the 8 Western New York counties surrounding the Buffalo cancer center. The population- based cohort study included more than 1,100 patient s, primarily from eight Western New York counties. Race and ethnicity were based on self-rep ort at the time of initial registration at RPCI. The study also examined participation in various re search initiatives, including clinical trials, scientific surveys and contributions to the RPCI DataBank and Biorespository . Participation in clinical trials was similar for European Americans (62%) and African Americans (57%). A high proportion of African Americans (95%) provided a bi ospecimen for future research, which was identical to the rate for European Americans. Howev er, European Americans are more likely than African Americans to participate in survey res earch (43% versus 17%, respectively). Potential reasons for this difference may include t he length of the survey (45-47 pages), how often patients are asked about research participati on and who approaches them. Further studies will help illuminate this finding. Philip McCarthy, MD , Director of the BMT program at Roswell Park was a co-author of the study. Following unprecedented success of a new Canada rou te for The Ride For Roswell, interest in the new Empire State Ride and exciting biker-friendly re-development plans, RPCI announced a long-term commitment for its biking events to route through or conclude in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Niagara Falls, N.Y. Mayor Paul Dyster joined Mitch Flynn, Founder of The Ride For Roswel l, at an announcement and shared his biker-friendly redev elopment plans with The Ride team. The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) hosted a capitol briefing titled \"Electronic Cigarettes: What You Don't Know Can Hur t You\" in room H-137, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC on Thursday, May 14. The event was h osted in collaboration with Representative Jackie Speier (CA) and Senator Richa rd Blumenthal (CT). Maciej Goniewicz, PhD, PHarmD , Assistant Professor of Oncology, Department of He alth Behavior at Roswell Park was a featured panelist. The event offered insights regar ding the complex regulatory issues and public health concerns surrounding electronic cigarettes. RPCI joined a coalition of leading public health or ganizations calling for inclusion of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the New York State Clean Indoor Air Act . The organizations announced their support during a May 13 news confer ence in the New York State Legislative Office Building in Albany. In addition to Roswell P ark, the organizations are the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN); American H eart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA); American Lung Association (ALA); the Medical Society of the State of New York (MSSNY); Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids (TFK); League of Women Voters (LWV); New York Health Plan Association (HPA); County Health Offici als of New York (NYSACHO); New York Chapter American College of Physicians Services Inc .; Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights; New York State Academy of Family Physicians; and the Ne w York State Public Health Association. Mark Travers, PhD , Research Scientist in the Department of Health Be havior and Director of the Air Pollution Exposure Research Laboratory at Roswe ll Park spoke at the news event. RPCI teamed up with Country 106.5 WYRK for the Taste of Country concert on Friday, June 1 2. Country music fans got their chance to purchase lig ht-up cowboy hats to benefit life-saving cancer research. The total raised by lighting up Co ca-Cola Field was $20,000. Led by Dr. Ermelinda Bonaccio , Director, Mammography, and other members of the R oswell Park Breast Cancer Team, Roswell Park employees joi ned Team Roswell at breast cancer awareness events throughout the summer and fall of 2015, including the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure ( 28 Team Roswell members), American Cancer Society Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk (35 Team Roswell members) and Bosom Buddies Walk (58 Team Roswell members). Each event raised awareness and funds for breast cancer detection, treatment and research. Roswell Park Cancer Institute was named a beneficia ry of the J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge in Buffalo . The annual 3.5-mile run took place June 25 in Del aware Park and on behalf of the more than 11,000 entrants expected, J.P. Morgan mad e a $15,000 donation to Roswell Park's Angel Fund , which assists cancer patients who are in need of financial assistance. There are times when some of the more than 31,000 patient s and their families at Roswell Park experience extraordinary financial distress causing them additional challenges following their cancer diagnosis and while receiving their personal ized cancer treatment. The Angel Fund Program makes funds available to assist those patie nts. The program provides services such as travel to and from appointments, meals, gas, lodgin g, and sometimes co-pays \u2014 to serve as a bridge until Medicare coverage begins \u2014 for qualify ing low-income patients. The Department of Psychosocial Oncology administers the fund accordin g to legal and regulatory requirements. Roswell Park had another large presence at the race with a team of 113 employees. In addition, Roswell Park once again created inspiring t-shirts for Team Roswell members to wear with pride. Many teens with cancer are unable to attend their h igh school's prom because of their diagnosis. But in Western New York, a social suppor t program at Roswell Park called Teens Living with Cancer (TLC) is helping to ensure that these teens don't have to miss the milestone occasion. TLC hosted its second annual prom for tee n cancer survivors and patients. The event allows the teens to enjoy prom with other high scho olers who understand what they're going through. Kunle Odunsi, MD, PhD , Cancer Center Deputy Director, Executive Director of the Center for Immunotherapy, and Chair of the Department of Gynec ologic Oncology at RPCI was a featured presenter during the special consortia of the 2015 annual meeting of the New York State Stem Cell Science Program (NYSTEM) , Thursday, May 14 at Rockefeller University, New Y ork, NY. At Roswell Park, Dr. Odunsi is the lead investigator o f a prestigious grant of nearly $12 million from NYSTEM which is designed to develop new therapies for adva nced ovarian cancer. The four- year, $11.9 million grant to RPCI is one of three n ew state awards totaling $36 million to support innovative approaches for developing stem-cell base d therapies for diseases that are notoriously hard to treat. Andrew Hyland, PhD , Chair of the Department of Health Behavior at RPC I was a featured speaker at the New York State Cancer Prevention Summit , Wednesday, May 20 in New York City. The Summit brought together national experts in medicine, public health, scientific research and public policy to explore ways to save lives and reduce the overall burden of cancer. Dr. Hyland offered information and insights in toba cco use prevention during the discussion session, titled Cancer Prevention in Action: Using Policy to Support Cancer Prevention. Substantial progress has been made to decrease toba cco use since the first U.S. Surgeon General's Report on smoking, yet tobacco use remain s the leading cause of preventable deaths in New York State. Dr. Hyland calls upon the health care community to renew its commitment to tobacco control. Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation (ECHDC) celebrated the early success of the Queen City Bike Ferry. Since its launch in May 2015, the ferry has already surpassed 10,000 riders. The brand new multihull craft carries pedestrians and t heir bikes across the Buffalo River from Canalside to the First Buffalo Marina. A very speci al 8-year-old boy was invited to represent the 10,000 th passenger of the Queen City Bike Ferry. Luke Gwore k, who is being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia at RPCI, came aboard with hi s family to make the river crossing. Luke is a member of Carly's Club for Kids & Cancer Research in WNY, which offers support programs and fun activities for children diagnosed with canc er. The Ride For Roswell , the single largest fundraising event in Western N ew York and North America's largest single-day cycling fundraiser, co ncluded its 20th year by raising a total of $4.5 million for cancer research and patient-care progra ms at RPCI. Ride Weekend involved more than 8,000 participants, 2,000 volunteers and count less other supporters, and the event once again set a fundraising record. Over the past 20 ye ars, The Ride has raised more than $30 million for RPCI, and more than 80,000 riders and 20,000 vo lunteers have participated in the event. The weekend began on Friday with the Peloton, a 12-mile route from Roswell Park to UB that is reserved for top fundraisers. Before departing, the riders stood outside of RPCI with names of patients in their hands while reaching up to the ho spital windows in a salute to cancer patients who were looking out. The Peloton riders then rode in two-by-two formation from RPCI through the City of Buffalo and into UB Stadium as part of Roswell Park's Celebration of Hope.
