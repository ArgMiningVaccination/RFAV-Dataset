Have you ever had moments where you are feel lacklustre, not sure of your direction, or if you are sure, not sure how to get there? As we move through our day we accumulate energy. Some is of benefit to us, uplifts us and sets us on the right path with all the confidence to step forward. Some depletes our energy resources and we can find ourselves in states of doubt, fear, lethargy, insecurity or ego which can be just as draining. Energy is moving around us and within us all the time. We are energy and therefore we can be affected by every interaction we have. Self-talk can be the most impactful. Are you aware of your thoughts and how they can impact on your energy reserves? Other interactions can also impact our energy levels and how we feel about life. That may be communicating within our relationships, with loved ones, communicating in business, with clients and the broader community. You may also be involved (thinking about) world-wide issues. The question is are you aware of what you are picking up along the way? How is it affecting you? Most of us want to feel energised, optimistic and focussed every day, especially Mondays! So to clear the depleting energy that we can collect in our travels, and to refocus our attention on feeling energised, uplifted, focussed and directed... I am offering a series of Monday Morning kick-starters. A FREE environmental energy cleanse every Monday morning at 9.30am on zoom.
