Besides subscribing to a number of inter - national conventions and treaties in the area of specific sustainable development, Angola is a signatory to the main interna - tional agreements focusing on sustainable development. With the adoption of Agenda 2030, in Sep - tember 2015, by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution A/RES/70/1 , which includes the 17 Sustainable Develo - pment Goals , covering diverse but inter - connected areas, in the three sustainabi - lity dimensions - social, economic and en - vironmental - emphasizing the principle of leaving no one behind and the eradication of poverty, the Member States advocated a new global partnership, based on a spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual res - ponsibility, putting people at the centre of development, with the Agenda consti - tuting a Plan of Action for People, Planet and Prosperity, and aiming to strengthen universal Peace and Partnerships at the global level. The Long-Term Strategy for Angola in Horizon 2050, in the pipeline, will be the main document of the global vision for Angola and its role at the international le - vel. The National Development Plan 2018-2022 (NDP 2018-2022), materializes in the period 2018 to 2022 a vision of the Long-Term Strategy, the so-called Angola 2025, integrating several specific policies, or - ganized into action programs, implemen - ted through activities and projects. The assessment made, based on the Rapid Integrated Assessment ( RIA ) system in 2018, revealed that the NDP 2018-2022 programs are aligned with a high number of SDGs, and of programs focused on fi - ghting poverty, representing an overall alignment of 52%. The Angolan government, through the NDP 2018-2022, has thus responded to the SDGs in an integrated way, identifying them in their prioritization areas to the relations with the United Nations Agenda VII2030, as well as, with the African Union Agenda 2063. Given the interconnected and indivisi - ble nature of the SDGs, they are evident in various and multiple areas of the NDP 2018-2022. The principle of leaving no one behind is present in the NDP 2018-2022, particularly in relation to concerns about gender equality and the creation of bet - ter living conditions for Angolans, and it aims to address people's needs, fighting inequalities, promoting Human Rights and the combined efforts of a multitude of ac - tors, namely NGOs, the private business sector, academia, social and development partners, and civil society. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major disrup - tion factor, whose effects on all SDGs will be felt abruptly and with some duration, increasing the risk of setbacks in the pro - gress already achieved and the failure of programmed and desired progress, at a global level. In Angola, as in other countries, measures are being directed at (i) preservation of hu - man life, containment of the spread of the contagion; (ii) mitigation of the socio-eco - nomic impact; and (iii) recovery with ac - tions aimed at sustainable development. Key actions should be taken to fulfil the promise of achieving the SDG targets by minimizing the socio-economic impact of COVID-19, and it is necessary to: a. Mob ilize everyone and everywhere; b. De mand urgency and comprehensiveness; c. En hance the ideas and identify the solutions. The Republic of Angola is committed to countering the situations of hunger, pover - ty and other vulnerabilities that the coun -try still experiences, namely by promoting the improvement of basic conditions of health, education, access to energy, water and sanitation, reducing social and gender inequalities, addressing climate change and disaster risks in a sustainable manner, among other actions. The main short and medium term challen - ge of the Government of Angola for the implementation of the SDGs is to continue to balance the need to keep the economy under control, especially to maintain ba - lanced fiscal accounts, external accounts, and the stability of the purchasing power of the national currency, while supporting economic recovery and private sector development, and the implementation of social programs to combat poverty and unemployment, exacerbated by the CO - VID-19 economic and health crises, and cli - mate change. Angola has another medium and long-term challenge of accelerating its economic diversification efforts beyond oil and dia - mond exploration and reducing its structu - ral vulnerability, recognized in the request to postpone its Least Developed Country (LDC) graduation to 2024, approved by the United Nations General Assembly in Fe - bruary 2021. Another major challenge for the develop - ment of Human Capital has to do with im - proving the quality of education and pro - fessional skills of young people, as well as technology transfer in order to promote a more sustainable and resilient develop - ment that contributes to economic diver - sification. Angola still faces challenges in terms of basic infrastructure, namely in relation to access to water and energy, as well as the promotion and protection of the environment.VIIIAngola is a country with political stabili- ty and lasting peace, which is an optimal condition for progress, sustainable deve - lopment, and the well-being of its people. With the support of the international com - munity in general and development part -ners in particular, this territory will be able to achieve considerable progress in 2030 with the implementation of the SDGs, and the Government of Angola and its institu - tions are committed to do everything pos - sible to achieve this goal. His Excellency the President of the Republic of Angola JO\u00c3O MANUEL GON\u00c7ALVES LOUREN\u00c7OIXNOTE FROM THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL AFFAIRS By preparing and presenting the first Voluntary National Review (VNR), the Government of the Republic of Angola joins the list of governments that share their experiences and success stories about the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implicitly reiterates the commitment made at the United Nations General As - sembly on September 25, 2015, when the Resolution A/RES/70/1 on the 2030 Agen - da for sustainable development, entitled Transforming Our Word, was adopted. The Republic of Angola, in presenting its VNR for the first time, also commits to vo - luntary and participatory periodic monito - ring and review of its implementation. This report was prepared in a context in which important national reforms are taking place in Angola, especially regarding the diversification of the structure of its eco - nomy, the strengthening and decentrali - zation of public administration, the fight against corruption, and the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law. In order to ensure such review was ela - borated in an effective and participative manner, a Platform was launched compo -sed of representatives of the Angolan go - vernment, at central, provincial and local levels, the National Assembly, the Court of Auditors, the National Institute of Sta - tistics, agencies of the United Nations system, international development part - ners, civil society organizations, the priva - te sector, as well as academia and similar institutions, with the objective of (i) enga - ge in dialogue to accelerate and prioritize the SDGs; (ii) consult and address the stra - tegies, instruments, actions and programs to be adopted for the implementation of the SDGs; (iii) track and monitor the SDGs, including periodic reporting; (iv) dissemi - nate the SDGs; (v) and mobilize financing for the SDGs. The VNR that is presented here intends to be the starting point for regular follow-up and monitoring of the performance of the indicators, supported by efficient systems to be developed with this initiation of the process, and until 2030. The elaboration of the VNR is an opportunity to reflect on best practices to improve statistical infor - mation and data on development and thus strengthen, on an ongoing basis, robust and efficient systems. XThe COVID-19 pandemic has become a ma - jor disruption factor, whose effects on all SDG targets will be felt abruptly and with some duration, increasing the risk of set - backs in the progress already achieved and the failure of planned and desired pro - gress at the global level. Even so, Angola continues to face the cha - llenge of fighting poverty and hunger and ensuring the protection of the most vul - nerable. Economic and social inequalities are, in turn, reflected even more strongly in environmental imbalances, with climate change likely to significantly weaken eco - nomic progress and worsen inequalities. The Government of Angola will use the pre - sentation of this VNR to gain experience at the global level, and particularly among developing countries, as well as to raise awareness to areas where greater public and private investment is needed. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 requires deep involvement of all society stakeholders in their ownership and implementation, sin - ce partnerships and mutual accountabili - ty at all levels - national and international - are essential to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth. In this process of preparing and drafting the VNR, we would like to thank the com - mitment and dedication of the various go - vernment institutions, international deve - lopment partners, academics, non-gover - nmental organizations, private sector and civil society, and in particular the United Nations system and agencies in Angola for the key role it plays in assisting the coun - try and the SDGs implementation process, safeguarding the principle of Leaving No One Behind. Her Excellency the Minister of State for Social Affairs CAROLINA CERQUEIRAXINOTE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS IN ANGOLA Angola's first Voluntary National Re - view represents an important mi - lestone for the country. This report is the result of a consultative and participatory process led by the Ministry of Economy and Planning involving seve - ral Ministries, Government departments, civil society and UN Agencies. The report is an important first step and outlines the progress made thus far in Angola's path towards achieving the Sustainable Develo - pment Goals. The creation of the national SDG platform in 2020 and the submission of this VNR re - port in 2021 to the High Level Panel Forum reflect the country's commitment to sus - tainable development and represent the strides made in establishing mechanisms to consolidate, coordinate, monitor and accelerate actions aimed at achieving the ambitious targets set out in the Agenda 2030. The findings of this first Voluntary Natio - nal Review clearly demonstrate the need to redouble efforts in order to bring about critical socio-economic transformations through investments in key areas such as infrastructure, economic diversification, provision of basic social services, and most importantly, in human capital. With an abundance of resources, none greater than its young and dynamic popu - lation, coupled with the commitment to the SDGs which we have witnessed through this VNR process, Angola has a promising future. The entire United Nations team in Angola reaffirms our commitment to con - tinue to support efforts towards achieving the SDGs and leaving no one behind. Her Excellency the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Angola ZAHIRA VIRANIXIIThe Republic of Angola is committed to the United Nations Agenda 2030 and to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), because the Government of Angola implements a development model aimed, first and foremost, at improving the we - ll-being of Angolans' lives, and based, at the same time, on environmental protec - tion and economic prosperity. The Republic of Angola presents its Vo - luntary National Review (VNR) on the implementation of the SDGs of the Uni-ted Nations Agenda 2030 for the first time, committing to a voluntary and par - ticipatory monitoring and review of its implementation. The Review was prepared at a time when important national reforms are taking place in Angola, especially for the diver - sification of the structure of its economy, the strengthening and decentralization of public administration, the fight against co - rruption, and the consolidation of demo - cracy and the rule of law. The Republic of Angola is committed to re - verting the situations of hunger, poverty and other vulnerabilities that the country still ex - periences, namely by promoting the impro - vement of basic conditions of health, educa - tion, access to energy, water and sanitation, reducing social and gender inequalities, ad - dressing climate change and disaster risks in a sustained manner, among other actions. Overall, Angola's public policies are aligned with the targets of the SDGs. The process of drafting of the first Voluntary National Review (VNR) The drafting of the country's SDG im - plementation report is also an output of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) report and the 2018 SDG baseline indicators report. With the indication to the United Nations that it would submit its VNR by 2021, Angola intends to strengthen its position of adherence to the principles of the 2030 Agenda. This Voluntary National Review is inten - ded to be the starting point for regular fo - llow-up and monitoring of the performan - ce of the indicators, supported by efficient systems to be developed with this process inception, until 2030. The drafting of the VNR is an opportunity to reflect on best practices to improve statistical informa - tion and data on development and thus strengthen, on an ongoing basis, robust and efficient systems. Under the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic and coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and Planning, in articulation with the United Nations System in Angola, a Plat - form for monitoring the implementation of the SDGs, abbreviated as the SDG Platform , EXECUTIVE SUMMARY XIIIwas established in June 2020, with the parti - cipation of several relevant stakeholders. As part of the SDG Platform, working groups, jointly led by elements of the Go - vernment of Angola, the United Nations, and development partners and non-go - vernmental organizations, academia, and other national institutions have been esta - blished to coordinate data collection and analysis on a selected set of SDGs. The elaboration methodology of the VNR follows the United Nations guidelines in this area, and therefore involves a set of relevant actors in the data collection, com - pilation and analysis, oriented towards the Agenda 2030 indicators. Angola's response to the SDGs Regarding public policies , the Angolan go - vernment, responded to the SDGs in an in - tegrated manner through its Medium-Term Plan, called National Development Plan for the period 2018-2022 (abbreviated as NDP 2018-2022), identifying them in its prioriti - zation areas vis-a-vis to the United Nations Agenda 2030, as well as the African Union's Agenda 2063. Given the interconnected and indivisible nature of the SDGs, they are evident in several and multiple areas of the NDP 2018-2022. The principle of leaving no one behind is embedded in the 2018-2022 NDP , namely, in relation to concerns about gender equality and the creation of better living conditions for Angolans. Summary of SDGs implementation progress As a result of the research and analysis of indicators by the SDG Platform, both the availability and quality of data, as well as the progress regarding the implementa - tion of the SDGs in Angola, it is identified that the country, in a global way, is still far from the desired targets. The main successes for the indicators are especially in the areas of Education, Heal - th, Gender Equality, Social Protection, Jus - tice and Human Rights, and Environment and are related to the investments made in these areas, through assertive programs and policies and budget allocations. As for the shortcomings , the need to im - plement a data production, compilation and analysis process, specifically oriented towards the SDGs, stands out. In relation to the Goals that should deser - ve continued effort , we highlight those related to the Economy and Employment, sustainability of Industry and Innovation, access to clean and sustainable Energy and Water, better Cities and Communities, and the consolidation and expansion of Partnerships that sustain the successes already achieved. New and Emerging Challenges The main short and medium-term cha - llenge for the Government of Angola with the implementation of the SDGs is to con - tinue to balance the need to keep the ma - croeconomy under control, especially to maintain balanced fiscal accounts, ex - ternal accounts, and the stability of the national currency's purchasing power, while supporting economic recovery and the implementation of social programs to combat poverty and unemployment, exa - cerbated by the COVID-19 health crisis and climate change. XIVThe Republic of Angola has another me - dium and long-term challenge in acce - lerating its economic diversification efforts, beyond oil and diamond explora - tion, and reducing its structural vulnera - bility, recognized in the request to pos - tpone its graduation from Least Develo - ped Country (LDC) to 2024, approved by the United Nations General Assembly in February 2021. Another major challenge for the develop - ment of Human Capital has to do with im - proving the quality of education and pro - fessional skills of young people, as well as technology transfer, in order to promote a more sustainable and resilient develop - ment that contributes to economic diver - sification. Angola still faces challenges in terms of basic infrastructure , namely in relation to access to water and energy, as well as the promotion and protection of the environment. The Republic of Angola continues to face the challenge of combating poverty and hunger and ensuring the protection of the most vulnerable. Economic and social in - equalities are, in turn, reflected even more starkly in environmental imbalances, with climate change likely to significantly weaken economic progress and worsen inequalities. In the context of climate change , disaster risk reduction, environmental degradation and biodiversity, Angola is exposed to an in - crease in productive insecurity, especially for small rural producers, with consequen - ces for increased food insecurity. Droughts and the effects of El Ni\u00f1o in the south of the country as well as environmental degrada - tion in the cities are trends to be taken into account in the coming years. The country will use the presentation of this VNR to learn from experiences at a global level and particularly among deve - loping countries, as well as to present the areas where greater public and private in - vestments are needed, whose need for at - traction is one of the gaps that the country must be able to fill. Best practices and lessons learned These encompass the development and implementation of comprehensive pro - grams in the areas of economics (e.g. the Program to Support Production, Export Diversification and Import Substitution, PRODESI and PROPRIV ), local develop - ment (e.g. the Integrated Plan of Interven - tion in the Municipalities, PIIM ) or social and cash transfers ( Kwenda and Valor Crian\u00e7a) . Also the policies and the institutions for gender equality have shown that the country is able to sustai - nably pursue improving the basis for grea - ter gender equality and for dealing with related issues such as domestic violence. Both the long-term reforms in the area of gender or justice and human rights and the social support programs for the most vulnerable have the potential to transform Angola's economy and society and are the - refore likely to set an example for other developing countries' contexts. Resources needed to implement the 2030 Agenda The preparation and elaboration of the future Medium-Term Plan, the National Development Plan for the period 2023 to XV2027 (NDP 2023-2027) will be an opportu - nity to align recovery plans with national development programs and the State Bu - dget. It will also allow for the identifica - tion of what financial resources are nee - ded and what may be the contributions of the private sector and international cooperation. The process of public administration de - centralization , which is transferring grea - ter competencies to the State's Local Go - vernment Bodies, is also an opportunity to improve data collection, analysis and pu - blication of the SDGs at the provincial and municipal level and to strengthen capaci - ties and processes for this purpose. Regarding the Angolan statistical sys - tem , the need remains, not only to impro - ve the alignment of data production with the 2030 Agenda, but also to study how to harmonize the systems for collecting, compiling and sharing data from different sectors. XVI 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 1THE S DG S A ND D EVELOPMENT I N ANG OLA THE SDGS AND DEVELOPMENT IN ANGOLA 1 UNECA (2017) Integrating Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into national d evelopment plans: Emerging issues for African least developed countries . Addis Ababa: Economic Commission for Africa.The 2030 Agenda, adopted in September 2015 by the United Nations General As - sembly through Resolution A/RES/70/1 , incorporates 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), successors to the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ), which cover di - verse but interconnected areas. The SDGs integrate three dimensions of sustainabi - lity - social, economic and environmental. The Agenda emphasizes the orientation of leaving no one behind and the eradication of poverty, which is Goal 1. It advocates a new global partnership based on a spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual respon - sibility, putting people at the center of de - velopment. It is an action plan for People, Planet and Prosperity; and it also aims to strengthen universal Peace and Partners - hip at the global level. The SDGs have a very significant corres - pondence with the African Union's Agenda 2063 , estimated at about 67% 1. The SDGs that most strongly correspond to the goals of Agenda 2063 are SDG2 - Zero Hunger, SDG5 - Gender Equality, SDG7 - Afforda - ble and clean energy, SDG16 - Peace, jus -tice and effective institutions. The African Common Position on the Post 2015 Deve - lopment Agenda bridges the gap between the 2030 and 2063 agendas. The Long-Term Strategy for Angola in the 2025 Horizon is the main document of global vision for Angola and its role at the international level. It is organized around five strategic policy options and six strate - gic axes. The National Development Plan 2018-2022 (NDP 2018-2022), materializes the vision of the Long-Term Strategy, An - gola 2025, in this period, integrating seve - ral specific policies, the latter being orga - nized into 70 action programs, implemen - ted through activities and/or projects. The Republic of Angola, participated in the United Nations 70th General Assembly held in New York from 25 to 27 September 2015, where the 2030 Agenda for Sustai - nable Development was adopted. The as - sessment made based on the Rapid Inte - grated Assessment system in 2018 revea - led that the NDP 2018-2022 programs are aligned with 78 SDG targets , out of a total 01 of 1502, with 30 of the 70 programs focu - sed on fighting poverty, representing an overall alignment of 52%3. In addition to being a signatory to a num - ber of international conventions and 2 The assessment in Angola was based on 150 of the 169 SDG targets. 3 M EP (2020) Alignment of the SDGs with the NDP 2018-2022 . Ministry of Economy and Planning, June 2020. treaties on sustainable development of a specific nature, Angola is a signatory to the main international agreements fo - cusing on sustainable development. Table 1. Main international agreements in the development area Addis Ababa Action Agenda 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change 2020 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 Agenda 2030 2015 Samoa Pathway 2015 Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action 2011 The Republic of Angola has committed not only to the implementation of the SDGs, but also to the robust, voluntary, effective, participatory, transparent and integrated monitoring and review of the implementa - tion of the 2030 Agenda (paragraphs 72-77 of the 2030 Agenda). This constitutes a vi - tal contribution to implementation and will help countries maximize and track pro - gress in the implementation of the Agen - da to ensure that no one is left behind. In view of this commitment, Angola has deci - ded to prepare the first National Voluntary Review, to be presented in 2021 during the High Level Political Forum (HLPF) of the United Nations Economic and Social Coun - cil (ECOSOC). At this meeting, Angola pre - sents a national review on the implemen - tation of the SDGs and identifies lessons learned to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. VNR shows how the policies and programs of the Government of Angola place a focus on the poorest, the most vulnerable, and those furthest behind . The government is committed to this commitment to the SDGs, particularly as part of the country's para - digm shift towards more inclusive, integra - tive, and partnership-driven development. The country is also committed to impro - ving its sustainable development repor - ting and monitoring systems . The Na - tional Report on the SDGs is a key instru - ment of the national review process. The report identifies not only shortcomings in the implementation of the SDGs, but also available data and strategies, as well as global, regional and national cha - llenges. In addition to describing trends in SDG indicators, it also analyzes the underlying causes of the trends, indi-cating policy suggestions to overcome 3THE S DG S A ND D EVELOPMENT I N ANG OLA obstacles and address emerging cha - llenges. The systematization of the VNR output will contribute to promote evi - dence-based strategic development and information transparency. On the other hand, the production of the report allows for the development of existing sustai - nable development monitoring platforms and processes to avoid duplication and respond to national and sub-national cir - cumstances, capacities, needs and prio - rities, minimizing the reporting burden on national administrations. The elaboration of the VNR is, in itself, also a valuable opportunity to disseminate the SDGs in Angola , among governmental and non-governmental instances and, abo - ve all, among the population. To this end, several activities have been carried out in addition to participatory meetings under the SDG Platform, which was responsible for drafting the VNR. A United Nations Mission (Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support - MAPS ) was in Angola in March 2018 at the request of the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP), with the main objective of suppor - ting the Government of Angola to promote dialogue on the incorporation of the SDGs into the NDP 2018-2022. The National Institute of Statistics (INE), with support from United Nations Develo - pment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), orga - 4 INE (2019) Pobreza Multidimensional nos Munic\u00edpios de Angola. Luanda: Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica. 5 UNICEF/CLEAR, 2019 nized from May to July 2019 a set of four regional workshops to disseminate the SDGs to INE provincial services and Offi - ces of Studies, Planning and Statistics (GEPE) of the 18 provinces of the country 4. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) supported the monitoring of the SDGs through the trai - ning and implementation of the Food In - security Experience Scale in the employ - ment survey and Platform for the elabora - tion of the National Plan for Investment in Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition. Globally, the United Nations in Angola has also developed a set of strategies known as SDG accelerators , designed to guide efforts towards achieving the SDGs, ge - nerating greater impact, using fewer re - sources and increasing efficiency and in - tegration between spheres of activity. In July 2020, two workshop sessions were organized to disseminate information to Platform members, ministry focal points, parliamentary representatives, represen - tatives of United Nations (UN) agencies, development partners, representatives of the private sector, academic institutions and civil society. The United Nations Office in Angola, in partnership with MEP , also organized the course Incorporating Evaluation into the National Voluntary Review Republic of An - gola in October 2020, and participants in the working groups had access to guides on how to write this type of report 5.5METHODOLOGY AND REPORT PREPARATION PROCESS The elaboration of the VNR followed the methodology proposed by the United Na - tions Department of Economic and So - cial Affairs (UNDESA) for 2021 as well as the updated guidelines for presentations at the HLPF . The elaboration of the VNR was coordinated by the Ministry of Eco - nomy and Planning, in coordination with the United Nations in Angola, involving governmental and non-governmental ac - tors, members of the SDG Platform. The process of preparation and drafting of the VNR involved different levels and sectors of government and non-gover - nment, which contributed to data co - llection and review throughout. Thus, it was intended to engage such important actors as the National Assembly, natio - nal oversight or human rights bodies, civil society (national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, youth, and business sector), the United Nations team, the European Union Delegation, and other multilateral and bilateral organizations present in the country. The Platform has the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic, assisted by a multidisciplinary coordination group that includes a national leadership team, led by the Presidency of the Republic and a coordination/operational group, led by the MEP , consisting of all key Ministry De - partments, INE and the UN System. The platform is thus inclusive, encompas - sing ministries and respective Angolan government departments and services, members of the National Assembly, the set of United Nations agencies in Angola, and other private sector and non-gover - nmental stakeholders, such as academia and, more broadly, representatives of ci - vil society. Under the coordination of the Ministry of Economy and Planning and in articula - tion with the Coordination of the United Nations System in Angola, the Tech nica l Group was established on March 27, 2020 for the creation and management of the SDG Platform and for the elaboration of the VNR. Four working groups were also established. 02 6Figure 1 S DG Platform At the beginning of 2021, the organization and dynamics of the Platform's Working Groups were revised, and their composi -tion was distributed by the areas of Eco - nomy and Production, Democracy and Stability, Social Welfare, and Environment.

During the mon - ths from October 2020 to April 2021, the groups were collecting evidence from the INE, relevant ministries and bodies and, through systematic sharing of progress and blockages in relation to data collection and compilation, it was possible to collect about 80% of the necessary information, corresponding to the information available and from reliable sources. One of the great challenges for Angola for the elaboration of the VNR is precisely the availability of quantitative and qualitative data , on the one hand aligned to the SDG indicators and, on the other hand, regularly and systematically updated. Another cha - llenge is the limited access to public infor - mation and reports (quarterly, semester or annual) of the activities of the different sectors of government that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. To ensure that the Goals are achieved, it is necessary to use a huge amount of reliable data and statistics and to define the indicators in an appropriate and inclusive way in order to track their progress. The SDG indicators were adopted at the 48th Session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2017 and in July of the same year by the General Assembly. The 2020 review of the SDG indicators ai- med to reformulate, eliminate and/or in - sert new indicators and followed on from the 2020 global review. The framework includes 247 global indicators, including 231 unique indicators, without duplication, which are divided into two tiers according to data availability and level of methodolo - gical development. Given the constraints posed by the availa - bility of data, namely its systematic collec - tion and compilation over time, the prepa - ration of the VNR required reflection on the baseline to be used in the analysis of the Goals. The year 2015 was established as the baseline for gauging the evolution of the indicators, since the national Census had been conducted in 2014 and, in 2018, Angola had prepared a baseline indicator report of the SDGs based on an important statistical instrument, the 2015 Multiple In - dicator and Health Survey (IIMS). VNR was counting on the very timely con - duct of a new survey in 2020. However, the preparation of the report was direct - ly and indirectly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the internal restructuring process of government institutions that started at the same time. Data collection for this major nationwide survey, the IIMS, was scheduled to take place in July 2020, but was postponed to 2021 given the con - text of constraints imposed by the pan - demic. Thus, the information-sharing and discussions involved in preparing the re - port required additional efforts in terms of ensuring the operation of efficient repor - ting systems and the most comprehensive data collection possible. A significant pro - portion of key indicators are referenced to the latest IIMS, but much more is collected from a variety of sources - and the use of proxy data - and some information has also been obtained from studies nearing completion, such as the Second National Communication and the review of Natio - nally Determined Contributions (NDCs).9PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE SDGS 6 INE (2018) Sustainable Development Goals - Baseline Indicators Report - Agenda 2030 .

Out of a total of 231 indicators of the sin - gle SDGs (non-repeated), it was possible to identify and present information on 190 for Angola, on average more than those co - llected in 2018 6. However, the availability of indicators is still heterogeneous, which sig - nals the need to strengthen the statistical system to respond to the SDGs, as well as to ensure constant monitoring and evaluation of progress and greater disaggregation of indicators by gender, age, economic sector, area of residence, province, municipality and other variables. It is important to note that the availability of indicators refers only to their existence and collection carried out, and should not be confused with the achievement of the goals indicated in the SDGs. Additionally, it should be noted that some compiled indicators are out of date or were calculated by approximation (proxy ). Table 3.

SDG 1 NO POVERTY SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its for - ms, everywhere, including different di - mensions of poverty, i.e. multidimensio - nal poverty. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development re - cognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sus - tainable development. 3.1.1. Angola's Context According to World Bank (WB) estimates, in 2018, 49.9% of the Angolan population lived below the international poverty line (extreme poverty) of USD 1.90 per day per person (2011 PPP) 7. On the other hand, the Expenditure, Income and Employment Survey (IDREA) 2018-2019 showed that 32.3% of the population lived below the na - tional poverty line 8. 7 World Bank.

Washington DC: World Bank. 10 Du e to the transparency and robustness of the IPM-A, it is possible to update the indicators that make up the Index through the next IIMS.The Angola Multidimensional Poverty Index (IPM-A), which is the national measure of multidimensional poverty, includes diffe - rent indicators of household deprivation re - lated to four dimensions: health, education, employment, and quality of life. Based on the 2015-2016 IIMS data, the IPM-A results show that 54.0% 9 of the Angolan population lived in multidimensional poverty in that period. Considering that target 1.2 aims to at least halve this proportion, the country's aim is to attain a percentage of multidimen - sional poverty less than or equal to 27.0% by the year 2030 10.

Multidimensional poverty in Angola, calculated based on 2015-2016 IIMS data. The IPM-A includes 16 indicators in the dimensions of education, health, employment, and quality of life.11PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S The pandemic of COVID-19 is an unpre - cedented event that poses additional challenges to poverty eradication. The World Bank estimates that the pandemic will reverse the worldwide reduction in extreme poverty that occurred between 1990 and 2017. By 2020, between 88 and 115 million people worldwide may have fa - llen into poverty as a result of the effects of COVID-19. In this regard, the global goal of reducing the proportion of people li - ving below the international poverty line by 3% by 2030 appears to be difficult to achieve 11. The commitment to SDG 1 also implies re - doubling efforts to ensure significant mo - bilization of resources from a variety of sources to implement programs and po - licies to end poverty in all its dimensions (target 1.a). It is also important to note that due to the notorious impacts of climate change , it is estimated that between 68 and 132 million people in the world could become poor by 2030. A key element of poverty eradi - cation is to increase the resilience of the poorest and most vulnerable and reduce their exposure to climate-related extre - mes and other economic, social and en - vironmental shocks and disasters (target 1.5). Between 2012 and 2016, drought cau - sed by climate change in southern Angola, in the provinces of Cunene, Namibe and Hu\u00edla, generated economic losses corres - ponding to 0.08% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reaching USD 452.4 mi - 11 W orld Bank (2020) Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2020: Reversals of fortune .

In 2020-2021, Angola was again hit by a strong drought in different provinces of the country, whose effects are already manifest among rural populations and for which high economic losses are also estimated. Until the first quarter of 2021, there were 184,180 contributors, 2,088,833 insu - red and 165,987 pensioners 13 enrolled in the mandatory social protection system, which corresponds to about 7.4% of the population in the same year 14. This limited coverage of mandatory social protection is also related to the wide extent of the in - formal economy - about eight out of every 10 people employed in Angola have an in - formal job 15. In Angola the proportion of population with access to appropriate drinking water sour - ces in 2018-2019 was 51.6% (66.9% in urban areas, 29.2% in rural areas); the proportion of population with access to appropria - te sanitation facilities in the same period represented 68.6% (91.8% in urban areas, 34.4% in rural areas) 16. 3.1.2.

In the same period, it was also possible to assist 92,590 families (454,880 people) in vulnerable situations with basic food baskets, as well as assist 26,175 el - derly people in the community with food and non-food items 18. The Kwenda project is an important and decisive step to protect the most vulnera - ble populations, since it aims to reach poor families in all the municipalities of Angola, 1.6 million families, 32% of the population. It has the support of the World Bank and it was launched in May 2020 with the purpo - se of making direct cash transfers to poor families. The program aims to benefit up to 1.6 million poor and vulnerable families in the country and strengthen the social protection system (covering 32% of the population). Each beneficiary family receives a lump sum of AOA 25,500 (corresponding to 26% of the poor household consumption) quarterly for one year. In addition to cash transfers, the program supports investments in produc - tive and human capital for a subset of cash transfer recipients. As of March 31, 2021, the program has reached 24 municipalities in 17 provinces, registered 375,854 households using the Unified Social Registry, and 6,243 families in six municipalities have received the benefits (approximately 29,000 peo - ple). Kwenda plans to support nationwide 1,608,000 households in poverty and vul - nerability with a quarterly income of AOA 25,500 for a period of 12 months. By 2021, the program aims to make at least one payment 13PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S to 300,000 households and register 400,000 more in 20 municipalities. According to the 2014 Census, people with disabilities represent 2.5% of the Angolan population, i.e. 656,258 people. The Minis - try of Social Action, Family and Promotion of Women (MASFAMU) has supported 717 people in situations of greater vulnerabi - lity 19 with means of locomotion and tech - nical assistance. In the context of the pro - tection and promotion of the rights of the child, 8,512 children in vulnerable situa - tions were assisted in 2020, hosted in 109 Reception Centers and in foster families 20. The European Union's development coo- peration in Angola is closely aligned with the SDG 2030. European Union support in Angola has focused on food and nutrition security, sustainable agriculture, educa - tion and vocational training, trade support, decentralization and social inclusion, ma - king a contribution to eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. In particular, the FRESAN (Strengthening Resilience and Food and Nutrition Security in Angola) program strengthens the capacities of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agri - culture and Fisheries to provide food se - curity and nutrition services to the popu - lation, focusing on three provinces in sou - thern Angola. It seeks to achieve in parti - cular SDG 1 and other SDGs (2, 13, 5, 12). In the area of decentralization, the European Union project, PASCAL, seeks to accelera - te progress towards sustainable develop - ment in the country and aims at promoting inclusive, responsive and effective institu - tions at local and national levels. 19 Ditto. 20 Di tto. 21 Di tto. 22 Di tto.The APROSOC project (Support to Social Protection in Angola) strengthens social action interventions to support people in situations of greater social vulnerability in Angola, such as, among others, the el - derly, people with disabilities, women and children. It is a project that aims to con - tribute to the achievement of SDGs 1 and 10 by supporting MASFAMU and Provincial Governments to improve programs, poli - cies and technical capacities and skills in the social protection sector, so that the government can increasingly respond effectively to the needs of the most vulne - rable people. In 2019, under the APROSOC pilot project, two quarterly payment ses - sions were held, with each child receiving the equivalent of AOA 3,000. Children from zero to five years of age benefit from the program, making a total of AOA 9,000, per family. Between the months of August and December 2019, 11,473 children benefited from support through social cash trans - fers 21. In 2020, the project was expanded vertically (supplement from 3,000 Kwan - zas to 5,000 Kwanzas per child per month) and two payment cycles (each equivalent to six-month transfers) took place in the provinces of Moxico, Bi\u00e9 and U\u00edge. The payments have benefited until the first quarter of 2021 more than 22,000 children from nearly 10,000 families, in an effort to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the pandemic 22. Additionally, an emergen - cy cash transfer project was launched in Luanda Province in 2020, funded by the Swedish International Development Coo - peration Agency (SIDA) and implemented by the Provincial Government of Luanda 14 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTand MASFAMU, reaching 1,400 children (up to five years old) from 800 families. Angola has adopted the Angola Multidimen - sional Poverty Index (IPM-A) as the national index to measure multidimensional pover - ty in the country. This Index includes four dimensions - health, education, quality of life, and employment - with indicators that express the different deprivations faced by people living in poverty. Progress on the IPM-A will be constantly monitored and eva - luated to guide policy decisions to improve people's living conditions and promote hu - man development. The commitment to con - duct new IIMS and IDREA surveys will make it possible to monitor and update the mone - tary and multidimensional poverty indica - tors, ensuring comparability in methodology and allowing progress to be assessed so that the IPM-A becomes a key public policy tool. It is worth noting that the multidimensional poverty indicators cover areas related to di - fferent SDGs that are interlinked - for exam - ple SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10. The pandemic of COVID-19 is a reminder of the relevance of the socioeconomic de - terminants of health , i.e., the social and economic factors that influence health and that can be altered by political or indi - vidual decisions. For example, workers in informal markets are more vulnerable to exposure to COVID-19 and have no social protection. Firm commitment to SDG 1 also implies re - doubling efforts to ensure significant re-source mobilization from a variety of sour - ces to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions (target 1.a). It should be noted that the Abuja De - claration of 2001 includes a commitment by African countries to devote 15% of their national budgets to health spending. The Maputo Declaration makes a commitment to allocate at least 10% of the national bu - dget to agriculture. On the other hand, the Education 2030: Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action for the implementa-tion of SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable lifelong learning education, in - cluding a budgeted expenditure for educa - tion of between 15% and 20% of the GBS. In addition, the commitment to access to information on budgeting and execution should be strengthened to ensure budget transparency. As indicated, to address the needs of the most vulnerable groups, Angola must the - refore focus on following up and monito - ring the results and impact of ongoing pro - grams, especially with regard to poverty reduction. Considering the different initia - tives promoted by the government for the eradication of poverty, it will be necessary to ensure that impact evaluations of so - cial programs are carried out. It is also ne - cessary to redouble efforts to expand and improve the collection of information on monetary and multidimensional poverty among the most vulnerable groups, inclu - ding refugees, asylum seekers and inter - nally displaced persons. 15PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.2. SDG 2 ZERO HUNGER SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promo - te sustainable agriculture. The Declara - tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that eradica - ting poverty in all its forms and dimen - sions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indis - pensable requirement for sustainable development. 3.2.1. Angola's Context In recent years, Angola has made great strides in its commitments to eradicate hunger. About 32.2% of the population lives below the poverty line , with rural areas being the most affected. Between the 2004-2006 and 2017-2019 biennia, the prevalence of undernourishment (inability to acquire enough food, defi - ned as a level of food intake insufficient to cover energy needs for an active and healthy life) went from 52.2% to 19%, i.e., from 10.5 million undernourished people to 5.7 million. This means that in order to achieve the goals of Agenda 2030 it is 23 INE (2019) Final Report of the Survey on Expenditure and Revenue . IDR/IDREA - 2018/2019.necessary to redouble efforts leading to the eradication of hunger - Zero Hunger - for the 5.7 million undernourished peo - ple in Angola. With regard to food and nutrition, despite advances in some health indicators in re - cent years, the challenges are still great. Severe food insecurity affects almost two million households 23, with rural areas and female-headed households being the most affected. Malnutrition and micro - nutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent. Between 2007 and 2015, chronic malnutri - tion among children under five increased from 29% to 38%, placing Angola below the region's average, whose prevalence is 29.1%. Anemia is considered, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) para - meters, a serious public health problem (40%). The last survey conducted in women in 2007 showed that anemia in pregnant women was 57% and among non-pregnant women 52.3%. In children, data from 2015 showed a prevalence of anemia among under-fives of 65% and the results also showed that only 13% of chil - dren had a minimum acceptable diet (qua - lity and frequency). Regarding malnutri - tion , 47% of women of childbearing age (15-49) suffer from anemia. Approxima - tely 5% of children under five suffer from acute malnutrition and 38% from chronic malnutrition . On the other hand, the dou - ble burden of malnutrition is becoming increasingly relevant, with the overlap and simultaneity of malnutrition, obesi - ty and micronutrient deficiencies both at the individual and household levels. The prevalence of obesity did not represent very high values until 2016 - only 6.8% - 16 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTbut the increase by 1.2 percentage points between 2012 and 2016 drew attention to the problem. It should be noted that 3.4% of children suffered from overweight ac - cording to INE 24, while 5% suffered from acute malnutrition in 2016. Only a 53% of the population (32% in rural areas) had access to improved water sources, which affects 16% of children, particularly in re - lation to diarrhea 25. Nutrition programs still have a low level of coverage. Only 6% of children receive vita - min A megadose supplements and 11% re - ceive iron supplements. Iron and folic acid supplementation among pregnant women also needs to be improved: 25% of preg - nant women receive no supplements and only 32% receive supplements for more than 90 days, as recommended by the WHO. As for sustainable agricultural produc - tion in Angola, the sector is strongly based on family farming and livestock, which are the basis of agriculture in the country, re - presenting about 91% of all national pro - duction. These activities are developed by peasants using family labor, selling the surplus of their production to the market. Currently, family farming is responsible for the production of about 80% of cereals, 90% of roots and tubers, and 90% of pul - ses and oilseeds. Corporate agriculture, in turn, comprises medium and large scale investments oriented towards the market and national self-sufficiency, with the ob - jective of developing economies of scale and ensuring quality and competitive pro - 24 INE (2016) Survey of Multiple Indicators and Health 2015-2016.

Angola's vulnerability and exposure to climate change have been felt over time, with frequent episodes of extreme cli - matic phenomena such as droughts, floods or accentuated temperature va - riability in some areas of the country that condition the Angolan economy, produc - tion and the well-being of the population. Drought and its secondary effects on the food and nutritional security of the population have impacts on the nutritio - nal status of the population, causing an increase in cases of child malnutrition and an increase in the demand for qua - lity health and nutrition services. Angola is a country prone to cyclical droughts due to climate change that affects main - ly the southern provinces of the country and more severely the semi-arid areas of Cunene, Hu\u00edla and Namibe provinces. The persistent phenomenon of El Ni\u00f1o has had negative impacts on rainfall, in - creasing the number of people in food insecurity due to considerable losses in agricultural production and livestock, further exacerbating poverty and the economic condition of families 27. 3.2.2.

Both models of agricultural development - family farming and corporate farming - are necessary and decisive for the coun - try's development, and Angola intends to act to overcome the constraints each fa - ces. Given this context, the Agriculture Development Program aims to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector by promoting the sustainable transfor - mation of subsistence production and the progressive increase of market-oriented production, with a view to achieving food security by fighting hunger and poverty, boosting national agro-industry, reducing production dependence, and diversifying the economy. Angola's National Adaptation Program - me of Action (PANA) 28 identifies agricul - ture, forestry, fisheries and coastal areas, human health, infrastructure and energy as the main sectors affected by climate change. The same document also iden - tifies that the main threats and expected impacts of climate change are floods, droughts, soil erosion and rising sea levels. The National Strategy for Climate Chan - ge (ENAC 2020-2035) 29, highlights actions for sustainable agriculture and fishing, as well as sustainable forest management and land use changes to combat land de - gradation and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental issues are a cross-cutting concern in the Long-Term Development Strategy (ELP Angola 2025). In accordan - ce with this strategic framework and gi - ven the specific conditions of Angola, the executive's vision for the sustainability of natural resources and the environment is translated into a set of actions aimed at preserving and restoring ecosystems, en - suring their sustainable exploitation, figh - ting desertification, preventing and rever - sing land degradation processes and en - hancing biodiversity, for the improvement of the quality of life of citizens and future generations. 19PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S Thus, the Environmental Sustainability Policy , contained in the NDP 2018-2022, defines priorities for intervention, highli - ghting the programs for Risk Prevention and Environmental Protection and Bio - diversity and Conservation Areas, which among other objectives, target the risks that affect in particular the most vulnera - ble populations and cause significant los - ses in economic activities, particularly in agro-livestock, as well as the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity. The Government of Angola conducted a review of the 2018-2022 NDP , based on state reform, in order to align the Plan with the goals and targets advocated in the SDGs. More than 70 action programs were adapted and the targets were reor - ganized. This government action was an opportunity to review international and regional commitments, to organize deve - lopment plans, programs and projects for a more efficient results-oriented manage - ment that allows to monitor progress and assess impacts on the population. For SDG 2, one of the main national programs in the NDP 2018-2022 is the PRODESI , who - se purpose is to accelerate the diversifi - cation of the economy and import substi - tution by increasing domestic production and prioritizing value chains, mainly within sustainable agriculture. The main policies for agriculture and fisheries are Angola's Medium-Term Development Plan for the Agricultural Sector (PDMPSA 2018-2022) and the Integrated Plan for the Accelera - tion of Family Agriculture and Fisheries (PIAAPF 2020). The indicators show that Angola still has many challenges in the field of fighting hunger. The government addresses these challenges by inviting all the different ac -tors in civil society to be part of the fight against hunger and all forms of malnutri - tion through the development of plans and targets aimed at combating them, increa - sing local production and productivity in a sustainable way, and strengthening the role of women in rural areas. Similarly, the measures taken to improve multi-sectoral and inter-sectoral coordination , integra - tion and collaboration are aimed at crea - ting a holistic intervention to ensure the achievement of the SDGs. The elaboration of the National Strategy for Food Security ( ENSAN II ) is at a final stage, whose vision and general objective is to achieve an Angola free of malnutrition by 2030, with a view to the progressive realization of the right to adequate food, leaving no one behind. Both the govern - ment, through its different sectors, and non-governmental organizations can im - plement the ENSAN II taking into account the new economic, environmental and so - cial scenario in Angola to achieve national, regional and global goals. The challenges linked to inter-sectoriality and the creation and functioning of go - vernance bodies for national food secu - rity should be considered as opportunities to strengthen the country's institutional review processes and new governance paradigms. On the other hand, the iden - tification of new priority sectors for eco - nomic development as well as Angola's current priorities should be included in the Long-Term Strategy for 2050. Lastly, the alignment of government policies and programs with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the CAADP ( Comprehensive Afri- ca Agriculture Development Programme ) Cooperation Framework and the SDGs leads to the need to adjust the country's 20 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTvision to ensure food and nutritional secu - rity for all citizens. Further, the principle of moving forward together and no one being left behind should motivate govern - ment, civil society, and the private sector towards sustainability. First, there is a need to value the results of sectoral programs and projects and their contribution to achieving national food security objectives. This should be done through the efforts of all parties in - volved and the mutual cooperation of the entities involved in food security actions. Angola must also be able to guarantee effective access to quality food in ade - quate quantity and variety for all people, strengthening measures to regularize food prices and the purchasing power of families by improving infrastructure, im - plementing social protection programs, improving distribution chains and points, as well as the location of markets. It will be fundamental to guarantee the access of local producers to high value-added markets by improving the quality of infras - tructure, including ports, roads, railways, communication facilities, food preserva - tion and storage, among others, which fa - cilitate the functioning of markets and the - refore influence people's physical access to food. In this regard, resources should be promoted and mobilized to expand so - cial infrastructure programs and projects (electric power, water reservoirs, foun - tains, community and household rainwater collectors) targeted at communities most affected by climate change. In a more general scope, private initiatives and public incentives for acquisition and access to production factors should be fostered, facilitating access to land, water, seeds of improved and adapted varieties, tools, fertilizers, correctives, pesticides, aquaculture feed, and other inputs for agriculture and fishing (family and sma - ll-scale), and promoting nutrition-sensiti - ve production. In a complementary scope to agricultu - ral production, social protection should be strengthened in a decentralized way for the most vulnerable or at-risk people through the implementation of a national solidarity fund, and the environmental re - silience of the agricultural sector should be promoted through universal coverage to ensure protection for small producers. The private investments to be made in An - gola should be encouraged by the State to be promoters of increased productivity in order to foster more interconnections with agribusiness.21PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.3. SDG 3 GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustai - nable Development recognizes that impro - ving health indicators is a global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sus - tainable development. 3.3.1. Context of Angola Health and social well-being are priorities of the Angolan government highlighted in the Human Development Pillar of the Na - tional Development Plan (NDP 2018-2022). The gradual increase in public investment in health has allowed an expansion of ac - cess to services, until the first quarter of 2021, 60% of the population had access to health services, according to the Minis - try of Health (MINSA). Another important area that translates the effect of resour - ce availability has been the increase in health professionals in the sector, in order to mitigate the insufficiency in quantity and quality, especially in peripheral areas 30 DNSP/MINSA (2020) Programa de Sa\u00fade Sexual Reprodutiva. Luanda: MINSA.(between 2015 and 2019, it went from one doctor or nurse to 1.34 doctors and 10.62 nurses per 10,000 population). In 2020, the entry process for new professionals was continued to fill 7,000 vacancies, of which 1,242 doctors, 2,757 nurses, 1,691 diag - nostic and therapeutic technicians, 779 hospital support and 531 from the general regime. Currently, the sector has 77,419 professionals, of which 4,133 are doctors, of which 1,623 are specialists, 32,980 are nurses, 7,534 are diagnostic and therapeu - tic technicians, and 32,772 are general and hospital support technicians. Regarding health data, the maternal mor - tality ratio measured in the 2015-2016 IIMS was 239 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, and until the first quarter of 2021, administrative data obtained by registe - ring births performed in health facilities record 248 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. According to MINSA data, the maternal mortality ratio increased from 291.97 per 100,000 live births in 2018 to 287.89 per 100,000 in 2019 30. Despite the methodological difference for the mea - surement of this indicator, the increase in maternal mortality may be linked to the difficulties still existing in access to qua - lity health services, the persistence of high rates of teenage pregnancy, low edu - cation of women, gender inequalities, in addition to the limited coverage of family planning and the poor availability of health professionals. Until the first quarter of 2021, there was also a reduction in the number of institu - tional deliveries compared to previous years, attributable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the closure of routine services in several heal -22 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTth units during the State of Emergency, combined with the users' fear of attending health units during the pandemic. As for the proportion of deliveries assisted by qualified health personnel, until this pe - riod and according to information provided by the Health Information System, only 14% of expected deliveries were perfor - med in health facilities, falling far short of the recommended target of 55% program - med for the year 31. The poor performance of this indicator is, in part, justified by the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, highli - ghted earlier. Regular data collection from the provinces has been a challenge that may be contributing to the underestima - tion of information on institutional delive - ries. Cultural factors, such as resistance to delivery and postpartum care by men, may also underlie the very low uptake of delive - ries attended by skilled health personnel 32. An aspect also of concern has been the ob - served decline in pregnant women's access to prenatal care , as measured by adheren - ce to the first appointment. According to administrative data available for the period 2016-2018, pregnant women's access to the first consultation has dropped from 81% in 2016 to 57% in 2017 and to 45% in 2018. The same was true for the proportion of preg - nant women expected to complete four consultations, which reduced from 44% in 2016 to 31% in 2017 and 24% in 2018. For the calculation of birth coverage, con - sidering as denominator the pregnant wo - men who had access to health services, measured by the first consultation, these represented 66.65% of pregnant women who had an institutional delivery, the same percentage in the year 2018 which was 31 Ditto. 32 MI NSA (2020) Programa de Sa\u00fade Sexual Reprodutiva, 2020. Luanda: MINSA. 66% of pregnant women who went to the first consultation and returned for institu - tional delivery. Regarding vaccination , Angola has been extending the number of health units offe - ring vaccination, highlighting that in the period from 2015 to 2019, vaccination posts increased from 1,347 to 1,643 . From 2017 to 2019, the inactivated polio vaccine (injecta - ble) was introduced as part of the commit - ment to eradicate polio in the region and the world. In terms of infrastructure im - provements, 58 solar cold chain equipment were installed in 15 provinces, the central cold chain was expanded to three cham - bers, and temperature recording (multi-log) systems for remote monitoring of vaccine storage were installed in three provinces. The management capacity of the Expan - ded Vaccination Program (EPI) was streng - thened with the provision of 34 computers and 40 tablets to improve the working con - ditions of provincial and municipal supervi - sors and improve the program's information system. Regarding vaccination coverage of BCG, administered at birth, these increased from 58% in 2016 to 90% in 2017 and 96% in 2018. The triple-dose vaccines, which are good indicators for assessing vaccination coverage, went, for example, from 74% co - verage to 73% and 82% in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively (Pentavalent and pneu - monia vaccine, three doses). In the same period, routine vaccination intensification activities were carried out in municipalities with low coverage, as well as polio vaccina - tion campaigns in provinces with emergen - ce of vaccine-derived cases. To improve program performance, municipal teams were formed and trained in three provin -23PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S ces where polio environmental surveillance monitoring was implemented. The Child Health Program monitors three communicable diseases in under-fives, namely, severe pneumonia, acute diarr -heal diseases with severe dehydration, and severe malnutrition. The selected proxy indicators of average incidence of these diseases for the period 2014-2018 are described in the table below: Table 4. Average incidence of communicable diseases in children under five (2014-2018) DiseaseAverage incidence per 100,000Mortality Rate Severe malnutrition 682,27 19,66 7,31 Source: MINSA, Epidemiological Bulletin, 2019. A decline in the incidence of pneumonia and diarrhea with severe dehydration is observed between 2014 and 2017, which coincides with the introduction of the pneumo 13 and rotavirus vaccines. To mi-nimize the situation of the mentioned di - seases, the health sector in its under-five strategy has as main pillars the promotion of early and exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age and continued until two years of age, with the gradual introduc - tion of a balanced diet. Vitamin A is also administered during routine vaccination starting at six months of age and in polio vaccination campaigns. In 2020, 2,867,852 doses of vitamin A were administered to children between the ages of six months and five years. Regarding HIV-AIDS surveillance, it is be - ing implemented but there is not yet an effective system of individual notifica - tion of HIV-AIDS cases, implemented in all health facilities in the country, which would allow new cases to be counted (wi-thout duplicates). Estimates of new HIV-AIDS cases in 2020, calculated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV-AIDS (UNAIDS) Spectrum program, are still pre - liminary: in the year 2019, it corresponded to 0.9/1,000 population. The trend in HIV-AIDS incidence, by the same estimates, is one of stability over the last ten years. Regarding routine data, to assess the co - verage of testing, treatment and viral su - ppression, there has been great progress in the last three years in the information system, with the adoption of integrated instruments for registration and data co - llection (HIV-AIDS, TB, SSR) and the use of the DHIS2 platform. However, constra - ints related to the quality of records and reports persist, in addition to deficient means for sending data (equipment, trai - ned human resources and internet), which impact the results of the indicators. During the year 2020 the malaria Inciden - ce rate was 250/1,000 population, higher compared to the year 2019, which recorded 234/1,000 population. According to the Na - tional Malaria Control Program (2020), the rise in cases, is due to the reduction in in - tegrated preventive interventions, namely 24 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTIntegrated Vector Control and the distribu - tion of Long-Lasting Insecticide Treated Mosquito nets, partly due to the situation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also had an effect on the reduction in the number of consultations for all causes, in - cluding malaria. Administrative coverage of contraceptive use remains low at around 9%. Through the National Institute for An - ti-Drug Fight ( INALUD ), 10,529 drug users were controlled in Angola in 2019, of which 6,782 use cannabis sativa and alcohol, whi - le 3,747 use multi-drugs. Although it is no - 33 DNSP/MINSA (2018) Mental Health Program. Luanda: MINSA. 34 MI NSA (2020) Programa de Sa\u00fade Sexual Reprodutiva, 2020. Luanda: MINSA. table that there are several difficulties in collecting and sending statistical data in certain provinces, the effort made by the Local Intervention Units (UIL) to make them available is visible. The data of the mental health program for 2018 still records 8.4 suicides per 100,000 population 33. Regarding the overall status of non-com - municable diseases, Angola has selec - ted three causes for monitoring, namely hypertension, diabetes and traffic acci - dent trauma. In the table below you can see the distribution of these diseases in the years 2018-2019. Table 5. Non-communicable diseases (2018-2019) 2018 2019Cases Deaths Incid./ 100,000 Mort./ the three non-communicable diseases, hypertension is the main cause of morbi - dity, with an incidence of 997.96 per 100 thousand population. However, traffic ac - cidents, despite having a lower incidence, have a mortality rate of 8.27 per 100 thou - sand population. Among other reasons for the increase in the maternal mortality rate in 2020 is the weak financing of health facilities at the municipal level, insufficient to cover ope - rating costs for campaigns to mobilize women to adhere to institutional delivery and increase access to delivery rooms for pregnant women. Also, the low coverage of specialized nurses in delivery rooms in the most remote areas 34. The proportion of women with their family planning needs met also showed a drastic reduction considering the available admi -25PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S nistrative data, from 24% according to the 2015-2016 IIMS to 7.8% in 2020 according to MINSA data 35. Access to health insurance is relatively low in Angola, averaging 0.9%, of which 1.4% refers to the proportion of population residing in urban areas and 0.1% for popu - lation residing in rural areas 36. WHO has identified 20 Neglected Com - municable Diseases (NTDs), 16 of which are prevalent in Angola. The most frequent in the country are Onchocerciasis (River Blindness), Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia), Soil-transmitted Helminths Elephantiasis), Leprosy, Trypanoso - miasis (Sleeping sickness), and Rabies. The 35 Ditto. 36 INE (2019) Inequality and Poverty Quick Fact Sheet . I DR/IDREA - 2018/2019. Luanda: National sis, of the most frequent, namely Schistosomiasis, Lymphatic Filariasis/Loasis, Onchocercia - sis, Trachoma, and Geohelminthiasis, are amenable to preventive chemotherapy. The country carries out a mapping of ne - glected diseases every five years, and the last mapping was carried out in 2018. Some of the neglected diseases are included in the National Epidemiological Surveillance System of mandatory notification, such as schistosomiasis, leprosy, trypanosomia - sis, onchocerciasis, dengue, and rabies. Table 6. Evolution of NTDs (2017-2019) 2017 2018 2019 2017 Regarding Trachoma, a pre-assessment of the records of surgical interventions was performed in the period 2009 to 2016, and a total of 863 cases were diagnosed, of which 189 (22%) were intervened. For the diseases amenable to prophylactic treatment, the fo -llowing campaigns were developed during 2020: for Lymphatic Filariasis, prophylactic treatment with Ivermectin and Albendazole administered to 1,977,831 people (28% therapeutic coverage). For Onchocerciasis, administration of Ivermectin to 3,509,327 26 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTpeople (39.15% coverage of endemic areas). For Schistosomiasis and Helminthiasis, Praziquantel was administered to 437,818 (3.62%) and the second dose for Helmin - thiasis with only Albendazole to 2,404,442 individuals) (7.11% therapeutic coverage. The improvements in the control of these diseases are due primarily to government efforts and funding from the World Health Organization. Respiratory diseases and in over-fives has a high incidence, 2,366.22/100,000 popu - lation. However, mortality from this cause was 3/100,000 in 2018 and 3.17/100,000 in 2019. Regarding waterborne diseases, there was an outbreak of small intensity in 2018 with 1,416 cases and 18 deaths and only 19 cases and no deaths the following year. With regard to typhoid fever, which has the same transmission mechanism, there was an incidence of 1,577.25/100,000 population in 2018 and a low mortality rate (0.78/100,000); in 2019 the incidence is down slightly (1,450.72/100,000) and a mortality rate of 0.86/100,000. In the area of zoonoses , human rabies stands out, since in the period 2018-2019 it increased from 216 cases to 257 (an inci - dence of 0.74/100,000 to 0.52/100,000), all ending in death. Of note, efforts have been made by the government, both in relation to animal control and vaccination of hu - mans after exposure. Dengue fever in the 2018-2019 period went from 2,502 cases (incidence of 855/100,000 population) to 489 cases (incidence of 1.62/100,000). 3.3.2.

The Ministry of Health has been able to mobilize domestic resources , internatio - nal cooperation, in addition to loans, to improve health interventions. As of 2017, for example, the procurement of vaccines with GBS resources stands at about USD 20 million per year. The involvement of the First Lady of the Republic, in the scope of the Born Free to Shine campaign , aimed at reducing the transmission of HIV-AIDS from mother to child, has been remarkable for the sec - tor in order to mobilize society in general about the need for testing for the human immunodeficiency virus.Also, the creation of mental health nuclei in several provinces has improved the re - porting of mental forum illnesses/events. In response to the pandemic of COVID-19, the Government of Angola increased and strengthened the capacity of the natio- nal public health system by increasing the number of molecular biology labora - tories, a total of six for the entire coun - try, equipping hospital units and building field hospitals, in addition to acquiring cutting-edge materials and equipment. In 2020, 5,581 beds were acquired, above the annual target (500 beds). This per - formance resulted from the increase in inpatient capacity in health units, espe - cially in units undergoing rehabilitation and expansion, namely, in the emergen - cy room of the Children's Hospital, in the quarantine and treatment areas of CO - VID-19 (Special Economic Zone, Barra do Kwanza, Calumbo 1 and 2), in response to the improvement in the health services. Additionally, the Bi\u00e9 General Hospital and Photo by Francisco Ven\u00e2ncio on Unsplash29PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S the Maternal-Child and Provincial Hospi - tals of Lunda Sul were inaugurated. The decision to increase the number of health professionals, with a focus on a more balanced distribution of them throu - ghout the country, came in response to a need to improve health services. The Presidential Decree establishing the new organizational chart of MINSA, with emphasis on the creation of the Depart - ment of Primary Health Care to replace the former department of reproductive health, expands the scope of the work of the National Directorate of Public Health with regard to addressing universal health coverage. Comparing 2020 with 2018, especially in relation to the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV-AIDS Program and driven by the Born Free to Shine cam - paign support, there is an increase in HIV-AIDS testing coverage in pregnant women from 46% (2018) to 62% (2020). Coverage for HIV-AIDS testing in pregnant women in antenatal care increased from 56% (2018) to 93% (2020). Over the same period, an - tiretroviral treatment coverage relative to the estimated number of pregnant wo - men living with HIV-AIDS increased from 36% (2018) to 71% (2020). This progress has reduced the estimated Mother-to-Child HIV-AIDS Transmission Rate from 28% in 2018 to 19% in 2020 (preliminary Spectrum data). The biggest barriers lie in attracting pregnant women for prenatal care and ins - titutional delivery, in addition to follow-up of the HIV-exposed child. In the last two years, the country has invested in expan - ding the supply of viral load molecular vi-rology tests for treatment monitoring and 37 INE (2017) Survey of Multiple Indicators and Health 2015-2016 . L uanda: National Institute of Statistics.for early infant diagnosis, with acquisition of equipment and supplies. There was also a reduction in mortality due to road traffic injuries in the 2018-2020 period following investments made by the government in road prevention campaigns and the creation of the Integrated Center for Public Safety. One of the major challenges to achieve SDG 3 is multisectoral articulation , with special emphasis on the Ministries of Youth and Sports, Education and Social Action, Fami-ly and Promotion of Women, which act on the determinants that directly reflect on the health of the population, with empha - sis on maternal, neonatal, child and ado - lescent health and nutrition. Since Angola is an eminently young country, with a ma - jority female population, the emphasis of the mentioned sectors should naturally be on the application of the Demographic Di-vidend approach, the social mobilization of girls in the communities for the dissemina - tion of qualified information on sexual and reproductive health; the inclusion of Sexual Education themes in the curricula of pri - mary and secondary schools, creating me - chanisms for the retention of girls in school; and the intensification of actions for gen - der equality and equity and the prevention of gender-based violence. Another challen - ge is the repositioning of people-centered Family Planning and a strong involvement of men in this perspective. The main SDG 3 indicators 37 for this VNR were based on the 2015-2016 Multiple Indi - cator Cluster and Health Survey as baseline. Due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pan - demic, the IIMS 2020 was not conducted and for the purpose of monitoring the progress 30 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTof the indicators, the report considered the Statistical Yearbooks and Epidemiological Bulletins of the Ministry of Health, data ge - nerated by specific programs such as Spec - trum, as well as proxy indicators. Another important aspect to note is that the Health Information System in Angola is in a transi - tional phase, relying on both a manual sys - tem and digital data production. The two systems are not harmonized, and there is information that appears in one that does not appear in the other. Additionally, it is ob - served that a large part of the health units have not been able to report the information, whether manual or digital. Despite the progress made in terms of the existence of favorable and current natio - nal plans and strategies, increased public health sector capacity in managing CO - VID-19 and improved government capacity in establishing partnerships and mobili - zing domestic and external resources, the reduction of maternal , child and adoles - cent mortality rates in particular and the integrated package of women's, newborn, child and adolescent health services re - main a major challenge to meeting the SDG 3 targets. Another major challenge in the sector lies in a functional and harmonized health information system, especially at the level of data production units, inclu - ding the operationalization of the various strategies defined at the national level. For the operationalization of the deconcen - tration/decentralization of health services, it is important to allocate human, financial, and material resources for the implemen - tation of programs prioritized by the gover - nment at the municipal level, with empha - sis on improving maternal and child health. There are already all the guiding instruments that standardize the quality of care to be provided to the prioritized groups. On the other hand, there is an expansion of several health structures under construction in the different municipalities included in the PIIM . The timeliness of investment in family planning in order to achieve 52% coverage, as described in the Demographic Dividend study, will have a beneficial spillover effect, ranging from slowing population growth, with falling maternal and infant mortality, to preventing teenage pregnancy, causing gir - ls to be retained in school, and increasing the opportunities for more than half of the population to contribute concretely to the harmonious economic and social growth of the country. Joining the Family Planning 2030 initiative, reaffirming commitments to allocate financial and programmatic re - sources for interventions to provide infor - mation and modern methods of contracep - tion, including for adolescents and young women, should be a priority for the sector. The restructuring of the mother, child and adolescent health programs, based on primary health care, including community health, aiming to achieve universal heal - th coverage is another desirable option, along with the continuity of external fun - ding and support from other national and international stakeholders and donors. The COVID-19 prevention measures, which are universal, have benefited the preven - tion of other communicable diseases, such as respiratory infections, the fecal-oral transmission diseases, also benefiting from the massive training of Infection Con - trol and Prevention technicians and the use of personal protective equipment in the country. The pandemic showed the go - vernment's capacity to organize itself and respond to adverse situations with quality, relying on the support of various partners. 31PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.4. SDG 4 QUALITY EDUCATION SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive, equita - ble, quality education and promote life - long learning opportunities for all. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sus - tainable Development recognizes that education at all levels and the supports for its improvement are a pillar of sustainable development. 3.4.1. Context of Angola In Angola, no data are available to measu - re student learning due to the lack of na - tional examinations. The country did not participate in the international projects promoted by the United Nations Educa - tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on learning assessment. For this reason, we used the indirect indicator to measure learning, the net school atten - dance rate . The data from the Ministry of Education for the year 2020 indicate a net school attendance rate in primary educa - tion of 76.1%. As a consequence, at least 23.9% of children in the 6-11 age group are outside elementary school. Regarding the completion rate in Primary Education (Goal 4.1.4) , the value verified in the years 2015 and 2019 for men exceeded 100%, due to the mismatch between age and classes. This mismatch is due to the early, late entry or repetition of students in the different classes. This is a phenome - non that affects mostly boys. Comparing the data for the 2015 and 2020 school years, the elementary school com - pletion rate has maintained an average around 56.2%. Despite continued efforts by the sector to increase the completion rate, retention in primary education is high. In the Lower Secondary Education, the value verified in the year 2015 shows significant differences between boys and girls, that is, 57.89% boys compared to 44% girls, which corresponds to 76 gir - ls completing for every 100 boys. For the year 2019, we have seen a growth in the completion rate for both genders, being 69.70% for girls and 79.97% for boys. Despite the effort in improving the com - pletion rate of girls, the difference seen in 2015 still remains in 2019. This indicator shows that retention in the Lower Secon - dary Education is still high, as a result of grade repetition and dropout. As for the Upper Secondary Education, the value recorded in the year 2015 for girls was on average 14.9% and 20% for boys, which represents on average 75 girls who com - plete for every 100 boys (in 2019, 82 girls for every 100 boys). This shows the efforts that the sector has been making on behalf of girls, although it still remains low relati - ve to boys. It also shows that retention in the Upper Secondary Education is worr - ying due to the high number of repeats and school dropouts. For children aged 24-59 months who are on track to develop in terms of health, learning and psychosocial well-being (tar -32 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTget 4.2.1), no data are available to calculate this indicator. Therefore, a proxy indicator was used to measure this target, the pres - chool coverage rate for children aged 3-5 years. Angola has about 2.9 million chil - dren of pre-school age (3-5 years), which is equivalent to 9.5% of the total popula - tion. However, only 11 % of school-age chil - dren had access to preschool education according to the 2015-2016 IIMS survey. Preschool education attendance is higher in urban areas (12%) than in rural areas (8%). Preschool attendance increases with household socioeconomic quintile, being lowest in the first quintile (7%) and highest in the fifth socioeconomic quintile (19%). The IDREA 2018-2019 survey results show, however, that the preschool attendance rate increased to 12.4% in 2018. Still, cove - rage is low due to insufficient educational infrastructure to meet the demand for this group. Similarly, the participation rate in organized learning activities one year be - fore the official entry age for primary edu - cation/at the Beginner level (target 4.2.2) is also low and needs to be improved, with the 2015-2016 IIMS pointing to a participa - tion rate of 25%. As for the participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training (target 4.3.1), the figure found in 2015 covers only the 15-24 age group, with a participation rate of 56%. This rate is worrying considering that young people are the driving force for the development of any country. The proportion of youth and adults with information and communica - tion technology skills (target 4.4.1) is also relatively low. For the evaluation of this in - dicator, an indirect indicator was used be - cause no data is available. This is the pro - portion of the population in the age group 15-49 who use the Internet. The 2015-2016 IIMS survey showed that only 37% of men and 18% of women use the Internet, with usage being higher in urban areas (49% for men and 25% for women) compared to 7% of men and 1% of women in rural areas. The assessment of parity indices (target 4.5.1) showed that school attendance ra - tes by gender are relatively balanced, as per the 2015-2016 IIMS results. The IDREA 2018-2019 survey confirms the said ba - lance, recording parity indices of 1.02 and 0.98 respectively (parity range 0.95-1.05). In secondary education there was an im - provement in girls' attendance between 2016 (IIMS) and 2018 (IDREA), with a parity index growing from 0.85 to 0.90, implying a reduction in the range and a narrowing of the girl/boy disparity. By areas , the two surveys show that ur - ban areas still continue to be favored, with more pupils attending elementary school compared to rural areas. According to IIMS, the rural/urban ratio was 0.89, de - creasing to 0.84 according to IDREA, with access opportunities still more in favor of urban areas. In secondary education, the IIMS showed a rural/urban ratio in ter - ms of attendance of 0.66, while the IDREA showed it dropping to 0.34. Wealth level also has an influence on chil - dren's attendance at elementary school. In 2016 (IIMS survey), there were 93 chil - dren from the first quintile attending ele - mentary school, compared to 100 children from the fifth quintile. In 2018, according to IDREA, this ratio has dropped to 70, reflecting the financial inability of some households to support children in elemen - tary school attendance and consequent - ly increasing the number of children out of school. As for secondary education, in 33PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 2016 (IIMS survey) there were 63 children in the first quintile attending this level, com - pared to 100 children in the fifth quintile. In 2018, according to IDREA, this ratio has dropped to 20, which again reflects the fi - nancial inability of some households. In the absence of a direct indicator, the analysis of the population achieving at least a certain level of proficiency in lite - racy and numeracy (target 4.6.1) was done through data on the proportion of men and women aged 15 years and older who have completed at least primary education. According to the 2015-2016 IIMS survey, about 62% of men and 42% of women aged 15 years and older have completed at least primary education. Regarding access to basic services in schools (target 4.a.1), the indicators show that the situation has not improved be - tween 2016 and 2019. Despite the efforts made, most schools (more than 70%) ex - perience difficulties in terms of access to services. Regarding access to water , in primary education a slight growth was noted, from 19% in 2016 to 23% in 2019. In Lower Secon - dary, indicators show that access to water grew in the same period by only 3%, which corresponds to more than 50% of schools without access to water. In Upper Secon - dary, access grew in the only 9%, which represents that less than 45 % of schools do not have access to water. However, this does not translate into improved water supply in the universe of existing schools. The situation is worse at the level of Upper Secondary because of the demanding le - vel of teaching activities, compromising, for example, practical laboratory classes. With regard to access to the Internet for pedagogical purposes, 97% of elemen - tary school could not get an Internet con - nection in 2016 versus 96% in 2019 while in Lower Secondary there was a growth of 4% and in Upper Secondary of 32% in the same period (in the latter, only 26% of schools did not have computers for peda - Cynthia Matonhodze/UNDP34 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTgogical purposes). Regarding the question of access to computers for teaching pur - poses, in spite of the growth registered in 10% of elementary school, the situation continues to be worrying, since more than 80% of schools do not have computers, affecting the teaching and learning pro - cess. In the lower secondary, an increase of 33% was registered, but nearly 50% of the schools lack computers for teaching purposes. The analysis of the proportion of teachers with the required average qualifications (target 4.c.1), in accordance with the cu - rrent Basic Law of the Education System (Law 32/20), which indicates as a minimum requirement to teach in Primary and Se - condary Education a Degree in Education Sciences, highlighted that in 2016, a per - centage of teachers qualified to teach in Primary and Secondary Education was above 60%, while in 2019 the values were below 20%. The decrease is explained by the implementation of the Basic Law, ac - cording to Presidential Decree 160/18 (arti-cles 17, 19 and 21). As for the status of global education for citizenship and education for sustai - nable development (Goal 4.7.1), both are contemplated in various regulations that guide education policies in Angola, namely the National Education Development Plan PNDE - Educar Angola 2030 , which inte - grates a specific approach on these in - dicators in the topic of Policy Measures. Because this indicator is new, it did not appear in the SDG 2018 baseline report for 38 INE (2018) Sustainable Development Goals - Baseline Indicators Report - Agenda 2030 . L uanda: National Institute of Statistics. 39 INIDE - National Institute for Educational Research and Development (2020) Primary Education Programs . L uanda: INIDE; INIDE - Instituto Nacional de INIDE. It is intended to establish a fra - mework for this indicator considering the existing data. For this purpose, a quick survey is underway on the information re - garding these subjects at the level of curri-cula, teacher training and student assess - ment and in the curricula there are themes related to citizenship and environment 39. In the education sector, the environmen - tal context is a barrier in the teaching and learning process, both in rural and ur - ban areas. According to the PNDE Educar 2030 , the concern with defining a strategy to create itinerant schools and train itine - rant teachers stems from environmental factors such as drought, rainfall, among others. In some regions of the country such as Hu\u00edla or Cuando Cubango, the rains have caused delays in the enrollment process because only during the period when the rains are less intense do parents and guar-dians show up at schools. The sector faces a major challenge in raising resources to adapt the teaching and learning system to these populations and to climate change. Climatic factors also indirectly affect the quality of learning because, in addition to hindering or preventing access to school, they affect the health and mobility of stu - dents and teachers, causing them not to attend school, to arrive late, or to have to leave early, failing to meet the full school timetable. This phenomenon was docu - mented in a study on some countries in 35PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S sub-Saharan Africa that have adverse cli - matic situations40. Currently, with the COVID-19 situation and the adjustments that schools have had to make to maintain social distance and re - duce the school day, effective learning time is increasingly compromised. This requires creative and innovative measures 40 UNICEF (2020) Time to Teach .to prioritize and ensure learning in alterna - tive contexts. 3.4.2. Plans, Actions and Perspectives The Government of Angola through the NDP 2018-2022 implements different pro - grams to promote quality education, hi - ghlighting the following: Government Policies LeaderImpact on SDG 4 indicators4.1.1 4.1.24.2.14.2.24.3.14.4.14.5.14.6.14.7.14.A.1 4.B.14.C.1Primary Education Quality and Development ProgramMED General Secondary Education Development ProgramMED National Development Plan for Education Educar Angola 2030MED PNFQ 2013-2020 MED The National Development Policy for the Education Area is determined by the Go - vernment of Angola's Agenda 2025, rein - forced by the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, within the framework of its Objective 4 given its fra - mework in the government's policy objec - tives. In the context of the policy objecti - ves in the current framework of priorities for the Education and Teaching System, seven programs have been identified that determine the policy actions and mea - sures underway until 2022. These policy measures put into perspective the pro - jects and actions for the following years, until 2030, formulated in the PNDE Educar Angola 2030 and based on the new Basic Law for the Education and Teaching Sys -tem: (i) Development of Pre-School Edu - cation; (ii) Development of Primary and Secondary Education; (iii) Intensification of Adult Literacy; (iv) Improvement of the Technical-Vocational Training System; (v) Development and Structuring of the Tra - ining of Teachers and of Specialists and Researchers in Education; (vi) Consolida - tion of Educational Reform; (vii) Encoura - gement of Entrepreneurship in Secondary Education. An important milestone is the creation of a regulatory framework for children with disabilities. According to the National De - velopment Plan for Special Education from the Inclusive Perspective (2020), out of a total of 18,740 schools, there are 21 spe -36 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTcial education schools and 775 inclusive schools (based in regular schools). Howe - ver, it remains a challenge for schools to have the physical adaptations to allow ac - cess to children with disabilities, but also to create the conditions for regular schools to be open to the inclusion of children with disabilities, with the support of guidance and resource centers for inclusion that rai-se awareness and support families, provide guidance and resources for the timely diag - nosis of disability and access to education for children in regular schools. Considering the principle of equity and the SDGs' commitment to leave no one behind, there has been significant progress in gen - der parity (indicator 4.5.1) at the secondary level of education, which has increased from 0.85 to 0.90. However, this same level of education still presents major challen - ges in achieving parity in other variables such as geographic area and wealth quin - tile, where the imbalance continues and has deepened significantly. Other vulnerable populations, such as chil - dren with disabilities, children from trans - humant populations, and ethnic groups, deserve special consideration and highli - ght the critical importance of inclusion in education policy in order to reach margi - nalized groups and leave no one behind, developing initiatives ranging from im - proving the information system for proper statistical recording to specific programs to create conditions for access, learning, and permanence in education. Among the various reflections on inclusion, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness of the School Meals program and ensure its universalization, as a strategy to com - 41 PIIM (2020) Annual Infrastructure Technical Report, December 2020. 42 ME D (2020) Plano Nacional de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de Quadros. Luanda: MED. bat school failure and increase retention rates of students in primary education. PIIM has actively contributed to the expan - sion of the school network in all provinces of Angola, allowing more children, youths and adults to access the education sys - tem. Under PIIM, 811 new schools are being built 41. Angola faces several challenges in the sector, rested the teaching staff , consis - ting mostly of education agents, without the minimum pedagogical preparation. There is an overall insufficiency of tra - ined teachers with pedagogical aggre - gation. Data available from six provinces in 2010 show that 32% of teachers in the beginning, 27% of teachers in elementary school, 10% in lower secondary education and 12% in upper secondary education, have not received teacher training 42. The - se challenges relate to the insufficient su- pply of teacher training , in quantity and quality, with greater predominance in the preschool and general education (primary education) subsystems. The NDP 2018-2022 provides for at least 30 teachers with a master's degree to train preschool edu - cation teachers, at least 30 teachers with a master's degree to train teachers for pri - mary education, at least 30 teachers with a master's degree to train teachers for specific subjects in secondary education, at least 390 teachers with a degree to train teachers for technical vocational educa - tion, 433 teachers with a degree in Special Education and Adult Education. The proportion of children starting school late is declining, but still remains high. Many children in the country and especia -37PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S lly in rural areas participate in migration/ transhumance and other temporary activi - ties, and are thus deprived from attending school. School dropout, exacerbated by the prolonged closure of schools and the fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these trends. The high num - ber of children who are out of school even before the pandemic requires targeted and effective short-term approaches. Accor - ding to the 2018 Human Capital Index for Angola, the number of years of effective learning is only 4.1 (out of 7.9), which is the average number of years an 18-year-old Angolan spends in pre-primary, primary and secondary education. This translates into a loss of 3.8 years, which may be even greater in the wake of the pandemic. Angola still struggles with the absence of a system of systematic evaluation of performance and improvement of lear - ning outcomes. Associated with this is the absence of mechanisms for distance pedagogical monitoring and follow-up by principals and teachers to ensure access and quality of learning in circumstances where distance learning replaces or com - plements school-based teaching. The development of the Education sector requires the intervention of several areas and the participation of different actors for its effective realization. The line mi - nistry recognizes the great challenges that affect the sector, whether at the na - tional, regional, or even international le - vel. Awareness of these challenges has made it possible to define priority plans for the sector and responses in the face of emergency situations in the current conjuncture. The approval of the Proposal for the Re - gulation of the Typology of Education and Teaching Institutions is an action that fun - damentally aims to define standards or models of school construction for the im - provement of operating conditions. School mapping aims to update infor - mation on school infrastructure, its geo - graphical location, its physical condition and its actual needs. This action that the sector intends to carry out in 2021 aims to contribute to improving the operation of public schools, particularly in Primary Education, based on programs for building and/or expanding schools and improving basic services, contributing directly to the Primary Education Quality Improvement and Development Program and the Lear - ning for All Project (PAT I and II). The elaboration of school charts in 18 pro - vinces of Angola is also a priority action of the sector, since the results of these studies allow, among other objectives, to rationalize resources and increase the ac - cess of children to the education system. Cynthia Matonhodze/UNDP38 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT3.5. SDG 5 GENDER EQUALITY SDG 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls. The De - claration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustai-nable Development places emphasis on the social and economic empowerment of women and girls, indicating improvements in gender equality as a key factor for sus - tainable development. SDG 5 deepens the commitment to gender equality and wo - men's empowerment with a focus on ri-ghts and opportunities, access to econo - mic and technological resources, access to sexual and reproductive health, political participation, employment, leadership and decision-making at all levels, and the eli - mination of all forms of discrimination, vio - lence and harmful practices such as early and child marriage and genital mutilation. 3.5.1. Country context Women empowerment and gender equali - ty are intrinsic and are the basis for achie - ving sustainable development. Gender statistics have the particularity of clearly portraying the disparities between men and women at different socioeconomic levels in the country. The existing inequa - lities between men and women in Angola are still a reality, reflected in family, social, and political relationships. In general, in Angolan society, in urban and rural areas, women are considered to be the pillars of family and domestic life and are responsi - ble for raising children and managing and performing family chores. The data from the 2014 Census shows that 52% of the population are women. In terms of age, the female population follows the national trend, with 51% of the population being under 15 years of age and presenting a young structure, with an average age of 21 and a median age of 15. In numbers, this means that of the population aged 15-24, 18.4%, or 2,441,539 are female; for the 25-64 age group, the percentage goes up to 32.8%, or 4,356,274 people. Updated data from the 2015-2016 IIMS re - vealed that 32% of women had experien - ced physical violence since the age of 15; 8% had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lives and 34% of women aged 15-49 and married, had at some point experienced marital, physical or sexual violence. The same data reveal that violen - ce against women also results from social perceptions about the position and role of women in society and within the family. Among the legal definitions of domestic violence , non-payment of alimony is the type of violence with the highest inciden - ce, increasing in recent years to more than 80% of the recorded cases, followed by physical violence, whose numbers add up to more than 50% of the recorded cases of violence. In 2019, a total of 3,796 cases were recorded, with 367 of family aban - donment, 133 of parental runaway, 307 of non-compliance with allowance, 173 of failure to provide alimony, and 180 of phy - sical violence. Sexual violence has been on 39PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S the rise, with 4,570 cases recorded in the same year. More recent data indicate that family abandonment is the type of violence with the highest incidence, having increased to more than 80% of the total cases registe - red, followed by physical violence, whose figures constitute more than 50% of the cases registered. The 2019 data, collec - ted and analyzed by MASFAMU, where the data from the Provincial Family Counseling Centers, data from MASFAMU, Ministry of Interior (MININT), National Children's Ins - titute (INAC) and the Organization of the Angolan Women (OMA) are included, make up a total of 12,547 cases. In 2020, the MASFAMU provincial offices registered a total of 5,436 cases of domestic violence. Regarding violence against children, 3,796 were registered in 2020, being 367 of fami - ly abandonment, 133 of paternal runaway, 307 of non-compliance with allowance, 173 of failure to provide food, 138 of economic violence and 180 of physical violence 43. MASFAMU, in the context of COVID-19 laun - ched the hot line SOS Crian\u00e7a (15015) which has registered 79,793 reports of violence against children since its inception. Early marriage and pregnancy are other problems that negatively affect the lives of girls in Angola, influencing their cog - nitive and social development, which is reflected in school dropout rates, lack of resources, and increased poverty within families. In Angola, in the 2017/2018 pe - riod, only 11 cases were reported, whereas in the 2019/2020 period, 267 marriages of girls under the age of 18 were reported, re - presenting an increase of 256 cases. 43 MASFAMU (2020) Administrative data. Luanda: MASFAMU. In accordance with its mandate, the go - vernment holds a key role regarding the in - tegration, empowerment and affirmation of women in social, political and economic life. Under the framework of the NDP 2018-2022, the government's programs tar - geting gender equality and equity issues have focused on reducing inequalities and improving quality of life by accelerating li - teracy, which mostly affects women, parti-cularly in rural areas. The programs aim to reduce high poverty rates and the unem - ployment rate, promote gender equali - ty, access to employment and vocational training, and organize awareness actions about the role of women in economic life and its impact on communities. Thus, programmatic areas have been defi - ned for women to achieve financial auto - nomy and a sustainable economic struc - ture through, for example, the Program for Enhancing the Family and Increasing Fami - ly Skills, Support for Gender Issues and the Promotion of Women, Support for Victims of Violence, Promotion of Rural Women, Economic and Productive Structuring of Rural Communities. A Ministry of Public Administration, Labor and Social Security (MAPTSS) data report that by 2019, 24,586 women have been inserted into the formal labor market and a total of 107,312 women have been trained in various professional courses. However, in Angola, the official data pro - duced by INE for the fourth quarter of 2020 on employment and unemployment indicators indicate that the unemployment rate in the population aged 15 or older, estimated at 30.6% is higher for women (32.1%) than for men (29.1%). The unemplo - yment rate for 15-24 year-olds was 55.3%, 40 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTwith no significant difference between men and women. In general, women sti - ll work in low-skill jobs and earn relatively less. The vast majority of employed peo - ple are in informal employment (74.5% in 2019), and this proportion is higher among women (79.5%) compared to men (43.7%). The majority of women and young girls are employed in the informal market, which is especially due to the low level of literacy and technical formal education that rele - gates them to commercial and similar acti - vities, which do not require higher qualifi - cations. As such, they do not benefit from the rights applicable in current legislation, such as maternity leave, social protection and decent wages, in addition to being vulnerable to high professional instability. Especially in urban areas, women have to manage their time in a multifaceted way, distributing it between domestic respon - sibilities and income generation, whether in the formal or informal labor market. At the household level, according to the 2014 Census, 38% of households were managed by women. Environmental issues, especially disas - ters , affect women in a variety of ways. Because women suffer disproportionate - ly from poverty, they will also suffer more when the effects of an unstable climate cause droughts or floods. While existing evidence emphasizes women's vulnerabi - lity to climate change, there is also much that highlights that women play an impor - tant role in supporting families and com - munities to mitigate the effects of and adapt to climate change. Indeed, women have led - and continue to lead - many of the most innovative responses to environ - mental challenges in Angola. Families affected by disasters are also one of the reference groups of the gender equality intervention. To assist these fa - milies, made up mostly of women, support was provided to 32,632 citizens who be - nefited from assistance in food and non-food items in 2019. The province of Cunene suffers the most from the impact of the effects of drought, while Moxico, Kwan - za Norte and Bengo, from the intense ra - ins. More than 60,000 women refugees in Lunda Norte and vulnerable in the context of drought in southern Angola have been supported with dignity and reproductive health kits ensuring good menstrual heal - th and safe births in emergency settings. 3.5.2.

At the regional and international levels, Angola has adhered to the principal ins - truments in favor of advocacy and the ful - fillment of women's human rights and de - velopment, which it has adopted internally and complemented with national initiati - ves. Of these instruments, the following stand out: >Un ited Nations Charter, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966); >In ternational Convention on Econo - mic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966); >Con vention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Wo - men - CEDAW (1981); >Con vention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987); >Af rican Charter on Human and Peo - ples' Rights (Adopted 1981, entered into force 1986); >Vi enna Declaration and Programme of Action of the Second World Confe - rence on Human Rights (1993); >Be ijing Platform for Action of the World Conference on Women (1995); >Mi llennium Declaration - Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, 2000); >Con vention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008); >Af rican Charter for Democracy, Elec - tions and Governance (Adopted 2011, effective 2012); rican Agenda 2013-2063. Regarding the national level , equality is one of the principles enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of Angola. The country has made significant progress, especially since 2013, in creating a positive legal, policy and programmatic framework, which has allowed for a growing and con - certed commitment, with both public, civil and private institutions, to address gender inequality and advance women's develop - ment in Angola. Created in 2017, the Minis - try of Social Action, Family and Promotion of Women ( MASFAMU ) is an auxiliary body of the President of the Republic and holder of executive power, whose principles and priorities aim to design, put forward and execute policies for combating poverty and for the social protection of vulnerable population groups, as well as the defense and welfare of the family, development of communities and ensuring gender equality and promotion of women's rights. In 2013, the National Policy for Gender Equality and Equity (approved by Presi - dential Decree 22/13), is a multisectoral instrument aimed at accelerating the par - ticipation of women and men in the politi - cal, economic-social and family domains at all stages. The Law 25/11 - Law Against Domestic Violence and its Regulation, es - tablish the legal regime for the prevention of domestic violence, protection and as - sistance to victims. Also of note are Pre - sidential Decree 26/13 - Executive Plan to Combat Domestic Violence, Presidential Decree 143/17, the National Action Plan for the Implementation of Resolution 1325, among others. Currently, women are represented in 29.6% in Parliament; 39% in Central Gover - tions; 27.4% in diplomacy. In the Judiciary, 43PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S they represent 34.4% in the Public Prose - cution, 38% in the Judicial Magistracy, and 31% in the Legal Profession. The Law on Political Parties (Law 22/10) provides for the statutes and programs of political parties to include mandatory ru - les that encourage the promotion of equal opportunities and equity between men and women, as well as gender representa - tion of not less than 30%. The situation of women in Angolan socie - ty was transversally considered in the Na - tional Development Plan 2013-2017 (PND 2013-2017) , with particular attention to the formulation of the National Popula - tion Policy according to the following prio - rities: a National Gender Equality Policy that promotes equal opportunities, rights, and responsibilities for men and women; (i) promotion of gender equality in access to employment and professional training; and (ii) gender awareness with attention to the role of women in political, economic, social, and community life. In the NDP 2018-2022 the focus for gen - der equality and women's empowerment is centered on Axis i) human development and well-being, whose programs and pro - jects contemplate: the Gender Promotion and Women's Empowerment Program, the Program for the Prevention and Support of Victims of Domestic Violence, the Integra - ted Program for Local Development and Combating Poverty, with availability of 36 million Kwanzas annually for the realization of actions for women's empowerment; the Productive Inclusion and Income Gene - ration Program, with greater incidence in families headed by women which corres - ponds to 35% of the population (IIMS 2015-2016); the Municipalization of Social Action Program; the Monetary Social Transfers Program. Angola is engaged at all levels, contribu - ting to gender equality with the creation of policies and policy measures to achieve equality and ensure the active participa - tion of women in all spheres of society, in accordance with the commitments made. It has therefore elaborated instruments such as the National Policy for Gender Equality and Equity (approved by Presi - dential Decree No. 222/13 of December 24, 2013), Law 25/11 of July 2011 (Law Against Domestic Violence and its Regulation), Presidential Decree No. 26/13 of May 8 (Executive Plan to Combat Domestic Vio - lence), Presidential Decree No. 143/17 of July 26, the National Action Plan for Im - plementation of Resolution 1325, among others. Throughout its 40 years as a free and so - vereign state, Angola has made efforts to materialize its commitments to gender equality and women's empowerment, as well as to materialize the objectives and goals of the Beijing Platform for Action in the 12 critical areas defined, through the ratification and approval of various ins - truments, decrees, and laws for the pro - motion of gender equality, empowerment, and human rights of Angolan women. In 2011, the Angolan Parliament passed Law No. 25/11 of July 14 against Domestic Violence aimed at legislating this field of the private sphere. According to article 3 of this law, domestic violence adopts the following forms: a) sexual violence; b) pa - trimonial violence; c) psychological violen - ce; d) verbal violence; e) physical violence; f) family abandonment, including paternity and maternity avoidance and non-pay - ment of alimony. 44 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTAngola has registered advances in the pro - motion of equality and equitable access between men and women in the develop - ment process and in the fight against dis - crimination and gender-based violence. These advances are inscribed in policies and action plans that define political and legal frameworks for combating the viola - tion of women's human rights, strengthe - ning national structures for intervention in favor of social, cultural, economic, and po - litical integration. In the review process of the NDP 2018-2022, the sensitivity to the mainstreaming of the gender approach in the different axes has increased as has the discussion with key actors for an inte - gration of the gender sensitive approach in the planning and budgeting process. The weight of female representation in parliaments is measured by the percen - tage of women in this political space. The country shows progress in combating the under-representation of women in this central decision-making and policy-ma - king structure for the achievement of po - litical participation and empowerment goals. According to national data for 2016, of the 220 seats in the National Assembly, distributed among the five parties with parliamentary representation, 138 are men, which corresponds to 63.2%, and 36.8% (82 seats), are women. Between 2015 and 2017, the percentage of women parliamentarians registered consecutive increases, as shown in Figure 2. On the other hand, in subsequent years there has been a shy decline in women's participa - tion at the parliamentary level, but in con - trast, the number of women in central and local governments has been favorable for women. Figure 3 Women's participation in Parliament Source: MASFAMU. Currently, women are represented with 29.6% in Parliament; 39% in central go - vernment, 12% are Secretaries of Sta - te; 22.2% direct provincial governments, 19.5% are Vice-Governors, 25.6% direct municipal administrations and 27.4% hold diplomatic positions. Within the judicial power, 34.4% of the positions in the Public 45PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S Prosecution are occupied by women, 38% in the Judicial Magistracy and 31% in the Legal Profession. Figure 4 P articipation of women in positions at central and local level Source: MASFAMU Progress has been made in strategies to implement concrete programs aimed at reducing poverty among Angolan fami - lies, such as promoting employment and income-generating activities for women (encouraging the development of small and medium-sized enterprises), training women from associations and coopera - tives in techniques for transforming and processing agricultural products, produ - cing soap, honey, and techniques for arts and crafts, baking, decorating, cutting and sewing. Also benefited were 65,778 fami - lies in entrepreneurship on the one hand and, on the other, access to basic social services, including education and health with a strong rural focus in 2019. Microcredit and other financial instru - ments for women have emerged since the 1990s as successful strategies for eco - nomic empowerment and have expanded economic opportunities for some women living in poverty, particularly in peri-urban and rural areas. The evolution of the main microcredit indicators shows a growth in the number of beneficiaries with access to this instrument. According to 2012 data, a total of 517,072 families were directly be - nefited, indirectly covering 3,256,260 peo - ple, of which more than 80% are women. To increase the skills of families to em - power women, more than 8,000 Family Counselors and gender activists were tra - ined in the country in 2019. Women's participation in security and peace prevention is another field that has been strengthened by Angola's presen - ce at the United Nations Security Council Meeting, under Agenda 1325 Women, Pea - ce and Security and the Resolution 1325 Action Plan, approved in the Angolan go - vernment's Council of Ministers in May 2017 The lack of gender sensitive information and disaggregated data hinders an effec - tive analysis of the situation of women, men, boys and girls in Angola. Overall, An - gola needs to collect and develop syste - matic information to monitor the evolving status of girls and women. Angola should 46 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTseek to ensure that data on violence against women includes all age groups, in - cluding women over 49. On the other hand, it is necessary to gua - rantee the existence of data on the time spent on unpaid care and domestic work, classified by sex and age, in order to as - sess inequalities and develop measures that promote gender equity. It will thus be necessary to strengthen a uniformed system for collecting data on violence against women in order to avoid discre - pancies between the information collec - ted by the various institutions, as well as to align the discourse of violence against women beyond the domestic sphere. It is planned to develop a Gender Observatory in Angola to promote the importance and mainstreaming of gender in statistics, to monitor and evaluate compliance with in - ternational, regional and national goals and objectives in the promotion of gender equality, and to strengthen the availability of public information. The legal and policy framework is con - ducive to promoting gender equality and non-discrimination against women and girls and empowerment. It is also progres - sively aligned to signed and ratified inter - national and regional mechanisms. As part of the ongoing action for the transforma - tion of the gender situation in the country, more expeditious implementation of exis - ting legal and policy provisions is needed. Despite the progress achieved, the coun - try should promote the continuous inte - gration and mainstreaming of the gender perspective in sectoral programs, plans and projects. Given the transversal cha - racter of the efforts for gender equality, it is important to establish greater coordina - tion and strengthen the relations between the technical departments of MASFAMU, with technical departments of other public ministries and with other civil and private entities. It is also necessary to ensure a gender sensitive approach in the elabora - tion of the State Budget. Cynthia Matonhodze/UNDP47PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.6. SDG 6 CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION SDG 6 aims to ensure the availability of water, its sustainable management and sanitation for all. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are fundamental to sustaina - ble development. 3.6.1. Context of Angola Angola is a country rich in water resources. The hydrographic network of Angola is qui - te dense, and most of the underground wa - ter resources are found in the southwest of the country, more specifically in Cunene (40%), Namibe (30%) and Hu\u00edla (15%), ma - 85%, and also in Benguela (7%) and Cabinda (3%). In the remaining provinces, the number of abstractions is quite small 44. The Angolan hydrographic system is composed of 77 hydrographic basins, distributed over five main drainage 44 Government of Angola (2013) National Strategic Plan for Water (PNEA).

The Atlantic slope covers 40.1% of the country's others); the Zaire slope, 23.2% (most the country's total area; the Kalahari/ Cu\u00edto stand out; the Zambezi slope, which covers 19.7% of the country's total area (rivers of the East and tributaries of the Zambezi: Luena, Lungu\u00e9-Bungo, Cuando). The country thus has significant hydro - power potential, estimated at up to 18 GW for the entire country, largely concentra - ted in the basins of the Kwanza, Longa, Queve, Catumbela and Cunene rivers 45. According to the Ministry of Energy and Water, the water coverage rate in urban areas (provincial capitals, municipal head - quarters and more populated communal headquarters) rose from 66% in 2016 to 71.5% in 2020. Also according to the same source, the water supply coverage rate in rural areas, rose from 66% in the year 2017 to 70.4% in the year 2020. The WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Pro - gramme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) 46 found, based on household surveys, that access to improved water sources in the country increased from 36% in 1990 to 50% in 2008, 38% in rural areas. Regarding sanitation, the program estimated that the evolution between 1990 and 2008 was from 25% to 57% (18% in rural areas). 48 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTAmong the main risk situations related to water resources, floods, erosion and de - sertification stand out. These risks occur all over the country, but floods and drou - ghts mainly affect the southern region of the country (Benguela, Hu\u00edla, Namibe, Cunene and Cuando Cubango provinces. They are cyclical events that when occur affect a considerable number of people. Erosion occurs mainly in the Central Pla - teau, as well as in the east of the country, as a result of deforestation, and also in the coastal region, mainly in Cabinda, Luanda, Cuanza Sul, Benguela and Namibe, due to the interaction between river discharges and maritime currents (coastal erosion). Desertification occurs predominantly in the coastal strip, in provinces under the influence of the Kalahari Desert and/or under the influence of the Benguela cold current. According to the reports of the National Civil Protection and Fire Service, the number of people affected annually by these risks is estimated to exceed 100,000. Floods are the predominant natural risk, affecting on average about 100,000 peo - ple every year, approximately 0.4% of the country's total population in 2016 47. The affected people are mainly concentrated in the most urbanized provinces - Luan - da Cabinda and Huambo. Floods also sig - nificantly affect GDP in areas, on average 0.7% of total GDP each year at the national level 48. However, at present, the pressure on the quality of water courses, resulting from polluting sources of industrial origin is incipient in most of the Angolan terri - tory, and the sources of pollution asso - 47 C IMA/UNISDR (2018) Angola's Disaster Risk Profile . 48 Di tto. 49 Di tto. 50 Di tto. 51 Di tto.ciated with agricultural49 practice are also minor. The studies consider that the main source of contamination of the water en - vironment, particularly of surface water courses is the discharge of effluents he domestic origin and leachates resulting from the indiscriminate disposal of was - te 50. The level of water stress was calcu - lated in 2014 at 2% by UN-Water while the degree of integrated water resources ma - nagement was in 2020 at 61%. With regard to sanitation , as the rejection and treatment of wastewater is an integral part of the urban cycle of water use for hu - man consumption, it is estimated that 80% of water consumed becomes wastewater. Thus, it is estimated that at the national le - vel in 2014, wastewater volumes of around 159.5 hm 3/year were generated. These need to be conveyed through wastewater dra - inage networks to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) before being discharged into the water environment. According to the diagnosis made in the PNA 51, it can be referred that the current use of the coun - try's Hydrographic Units is compatible with a state called almost natural, that is, cha - racterized by natural rivers with minor mo - difications of the aquatic habitat. 3.6.2.

Water , 12, 53 Di tto.The Ministry of Energy and Water (MINEA) is the ministerial department with respon - sibility for the implementation of the Water and Sanitation Policy, liaising in particular with the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Environment (MCTA). The MCTA coordina - tes the Basic Sanitation Improvement Pro - gram, while the execution of actions and projects is the responsibility of MINEA, Mi - nistry of Health (MINSA), Ministry of Public Works and Spatial Planning (MINOPOT), Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MI - NAGRIP), Ministry of Territorial Adminis - tration and State Reform (MAT), Provincial Offices of Infrastructure and Technical Services, Provincial Offices of Environ - ment and Waste Management, Municipal Directorates, Provincial Governments and Municipal Administrations. Over the years, especially since the end of the civil war, Angola has integrated inter - national programs and provisions for the management of water resources. Among these, Angola ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1990 (Resolution 18/90), which defines and codi - fies concepts inherited from customary in -ternational law regarding maritime affairs, such as territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, continental shelf and others, and establishes the general principles for the exploitation of the sea's natural resources, such as living resources, those of the soil and those of the subsoil. Still at the inter - national level, the signing of the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses (of the Southern African Development Commu - nity, SADC), signed by Angola in August 2000, stands out. Its objective is the coo - peration, coordination and sustained de - velopment of shared water resources in the SADC region and its utilization. Between 2007 and 2012, the government implemented the Water for All program , geared towards the 52Millennium Develop - ment Goals. The program aimed to provide water to 80% of the peri-urban population and rural communities, guaranteeing a mi - nimum of 40 liters of water per capita dai - ly. By 2015, however, the program had rea - ched only 50.3% of the target population 53. There are also several provisions for the management of water and water resour -50 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTces in the country. On the one hand, the Environment Framework Law (Law 5/98) regulates the sector in a comprehensi - ve manner. More specifically, Angola has defined a Water Law (Law 6/02), which applies to inland waters, both surface and underground, and establishes the general principles of the legal regime inherent to the use of water resources. With regard to water ownership, this same decree es - tablishes that waters, as a natural resour - ce, are the property of the State, and the State's right to waters, as inalienable and imprescriptible natural resource, also spe - cifying that the right to use the public wa - ter domain is granted in order to guarantee its preservation and management for the benefit of the public interest. Years later, Presidential Decree 261/11 - Regulation on Water Quality, approves the regulation that establishes the standards and criteria for assessing water quality, according to its main uses, from the pers - pective of public health protection, inte - grated management of water resources and environmental preservation. Presi - dential Decree 141/12 , in turn, approves the Regulations for the Prevention and Control of Pollution of National Waters and Presidential Decree 9/13 approved the PNEA - National Strategic Plan for Water, 2013-2017. Beyond the Presidential Decree 30/16 - Strategic Plan of Prevention and Reduc - tion of Disaster Risks - the Presidential Decree 196/13 established the PESGRU - Strategic Plan for Urban Waste Manage - ment in Angola, Presidential Decree 82/14 established the General Regulation for the Use of Water Resources and Presidential Decree 83/14 , the Regulation for Public Water Supply and Wastewater Sanitation. The most recent guidance on water ma - nagement is that contained in Presiden - tial Decree 126/2017 , which approves the current National Water Plan (PNA) while Presidential Decree 138/20 defines the National Environmental Quality Program. Finally, Presidential Decree 140/20 appro - ves the National Strategy for Community and School-Led Total Sanitation in Angola 2019-2030. The PNA establishes as fundamental axes i) the integrated planning of the country's water resources in the short (2017), me - dium (2025) and long-term (2040); ii) it fo - resees the establishment of a national in - frastructure investment program, suppor - ting the development of the water cluster, adequately sustained from a technical, social, environmental and political point of view iii) strengthening research and deve - lopment related to the various aspects of water use, seeking to adjust technical and scientific development to Angola's reality and ensuring the necessary training of te - chnicians from central and provincial bo - dies through links with educational institu - tions and research centers of recognized credibility; iv) strengthening and moderni - zing the institutional, legal and regulatory framework related to the water issue; v) evaluating or strengthening economic and financial mechanisms to support public and private investment and those resul - ting from models based on public-private partnerships. As for the participation of local commu - nities in water and sanitation manage - ment, Presidential Decree 140/20 appro - ves the National Strategy for Community and School-Led Total Sanitation in Angola 2019-2030. Some long-term initiatives, however, have already started in the coun -51PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S try several years ago, although not in all provinces. The Community Water Mana - gement Model ( MoGeCa ) project, aimed to improve water governance by implemen - ting the community management model of water systems in rural and peri-urban communities in Cunene, Huambo, Cuan - za-Sul and Luanda between 2014-2020. As a result, 82,416 people gained access to improved water services, 464 water ma - nagement committees were established, and five communities certified as free of open defecation areas. Other outcomes include, for example, work in the area of hand hygiene, particularly in school settings, the construction of impro - ved community latrines, and the training of municipal sanitation technicians. Finally, it is also important to highlight that policies and strategies under development, inclu - ding the National Housing Policy, and the In - formal Settlements Improvement Strategy 54 MINEA (2013) National Strategic Plan for Water (PNEA). Presidential Decree 9/13. 55 Di tto.(more details in SDG 11), will be frameworks that will provide important guidelines for programs and initiatives regarding water supply and sanitation, especially for the most vulnerable population groups. At the country level and calculated for 2017 54, water requirements are mainly dis - tributed as follows: 12% for public supply; for irri - gation and 5% relate to water transfers un - der cross-border agreements. This corres - ponded in that year to a water requirement by the population of 440.56 hm 3/year, with wastewater accounting for 80% of the con - sumption. The annual operation and main - tenance costs for water services to the population (although including industrial, commercial/service and public consumers) were around 257.4 million USD, and the an - nual investment costs were 100.2 million USD (costs for a served population of about 63% of the total population) 55. Ministry of Economy and Planning of Angola52 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTOn the other hand, the world's wastewa - ter, 80% of which is returned to the envi - ronment without adequate treatment, is a valuable resource from which clean water, energy, nutrients, and other resources can be extracted. Angola has the conditions to ensure this circularity and potential of its water resources. Besides the ongoing programs and pro - jects, Angola is committed to improving and expanding its water supply networks for the population and economic activi-ties. It has also been developing sanita - tion programs in several provinces 56. The environmental quality of water in Angola, as well as the evolution of the efficiency of water use are not yet estimated through systematic monitoring. Cooperation in transboundary basins is another potential area for development in the water sector and access to drinking 56 Government of Angola (2019) Sanitation Project, Wastewater Treatment Plant and Expansion of the Water S upply System of Sumbe City.

SDG 7 AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affor - dable, secure, sustainable and modern energy for all. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development re - cognizes that access to clean and sustai - nable energy is a fundamental aspect of sustainable development. 3.7.1. Context of Angola Access to sustainable, reliable and re - newable energy (electrical, thermal, me - chanical, etc.) and clean fuels is a prere - quisite for meeting many of the challenges Angola faces today, such as fighting multi-dimensional poverty and hunger, defining a diversified, sustainable and inclusive strategic development; and promoting the quality of well-being of its population and resilience to the impacts of climate change. The energy sector in Angola is characteri - zed by the production of crude oil (respon- 59 Dombaxe, Marcelina Nova of Lisboa. 60 IRENA - International Renewable Energy Agency (2017) Renewable Energy and Jobs - Annual Review 2017 . 61 E uropean Commission (2016) Putting energy efficiency first: consuming better, getting cleaner . sible for about one third of the country's GDP and more than 90% of total exports, and therefore highly vulnerable to crude oil price fluctuations), by the production of gas and imports of refined fuels, and by increasing demand for electricity, which is mainly generated by thermal and hydro power. The sector is also characterized by large losses due to 59energy inefficiency ; dependence on substantial and unsustai - nable subsidies ; significant gaps in rural electrification ; and high potential for the development of renewable energies such as solar, wind and biomass. Investments in renewable energy tech - nologies and supply systems, create new economic opportunities, generating new jobs, reducing dependence on imported fuels and vulnerability to fossil fuel price fluctuations. In 2016, renewable energy (RE) was estimated to create 9.8 million di - rect and indirect jobs worldwide and this could increase to 24 million by 2030 60 and investment in energy efficiency could ge - nerate between 2.5 and four times more jobs than investment in oil and natural gas 61. With just twice the amount of energy generated today, Angola could provide an economy three times larger than today. Angola has vast renewable natural re - sources with an abundance of water re - sources, extraordinary solar radiation, strong winds, and areas of potential raw material cultivation for the production of biofuels, and can therefore develop clean, renewable energies such as hydroelectric, solar, wind, and biomass. Renewable ener - gy solutions are becoming cheaper, more 54 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTreliable and more efficient, offering great opportunities for Angola. Woody biomass and charcoal continue to be one of the most used forms of energy in rural and urban Angola, representing an in - come generation in rural areas 62. However, the current lack of regulation of this sec - tor generates serious environmental pro - blems through uncontrolled deforestation. 62 G overnment of Angola and UNDP (2015) Sustainable Energy for All: Rapid Assessment Gap Analysis , Angola.3.7.2.

The ministry also assumes an im - portant role in promoting research activi - ties in relevant sectors and in drafting laws necessary for the promotion of the sec - tor's activities. MINEA is also responsible for the Regulatory Institute of the Angolan Electricity Sector (IRSEA) and the com - panies PRODEL, in charge of generation; RNT, in charge of transmission; and the 55PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S National Electricity Company (ENDE), in charge of energy distribution. To fulfill its objectives, it articulates its actions with other relevant complementary ministries, such as MINOPOT and MCTA. The institu - tion responsible for issues related to bioe - nergy from the use of forests (firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating) is M I N A G R I P. The PND 2018-2022 includes in its Axis 3 - Infrastructure Necessary for Develo - pment - two fundamental programs: the Program for Expansion of Access to Elec - tricity in Urban Areas, Municipality Seats and Rural Areas, aimed at increasing the electrification rate in an equitable manner throughout the national territory; and the Program for Consolidation and Optimiza - tion of the Electricity Sector, which aims at the optimization and sustainable mana - gement of the electricity sector, establi - shing objectives concerning, respectively, generation, transmission and distribution/trading, as well as renewable energy and private sector participation in investments in the sector. In the set of legal frameworks developed over time, of particular note are Presiden - tial Order No. 82/10 on the Model Conces - sion and Power Purchase Agreements for Small Hydroelectric Power Plants - Mi - ni-Hydro - and, more recently, Presidential Decree No. 43/21 authorizing independent electricity production. Both complement the General Electricity Law 27/15 and pave the way for expanded renewable energy production. The long-term vision Angola Energia 2025 establishes the strategic policy for the national response to a strongly growing energy consumption, but less dependent on oil production. The National Atlas and Strategy for New Renewable Energy sets the direction for renewable energy develo - pment. The implementation of these po - licies is done through sector Action Plans 2018-2022. In terms of specific projects in the sec - tor, we highlight government partnerships with international organizations, namely: Promoting Sustainable Energy Access for Rural Communities in South-Eastern Angola (UNDP/Global Environment Facility - GEF), Africa Minigrids Program (African Development Bank - AfDB / Global Envi - ronment Facility - GEF), Sustainable Ener - gy for All - Angola (SE4ALL ) and Power Africa, among others. Data provided by DNE/MINEA, indicate that the annual electricity production capaci - ty in Angola between 2015 and 2020 grew from 9,716.10 GWh (45.67% Thermal and 54.33% Hydro) to Thermal and 0.30% Hybrid, 42.52 (solar/diesel), and distributed energy also grew from 8,360.30 GWh in 2015 to 11,600.24 GWh in 2020. This has increa - sed hydro (renewable) energy production by 43% and distributed energy by almost 40%, thanks mainly to the construction of the Cambambe and La\u00faca Hydroelectric Power Plants; the construction of the new thermal power plants (Saurimo, Luena and Cu\u00edto) the construction of the Soyo Combi - ned Cycle Thermal Power Plant; the small scale isolated project Aldeia Solar 3 \u00aa Fase , to supply solar energy in rural areas, which has so far benefited about 55 communes; and the construction of the interconnec - tion line between the northern and central systems that interconnect 10 provinces. The installed capacity of renewable ener - gy in Angola has grown by 2,716 megawatts (MW) of hydro, and 1.44 MW of solar over a 56 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTfive-year period63. The actual production capacity is less than that installed due to losses and the risks of stoppage or reduc - tion of power generated in thermal plants due to their aging. Energy consumption recorded a growth rate of 38.75% between the years 2015-2020, with a rate of change of 27.92% in view of the high level of availability of elec - tricity generation in Angola 64. In terms of energy consumption by sectors, the pro - portion of consumption of the civil sector is large, accounting for 45% of total de - mand. Next comes the service sector, with about 32%, and the industrial sector with about 9% 65. Renewable energy production represented 89% of total energy genera - tion in Angola in 202066. National forecasts for electricity demand growth are four times the 2017-2018 pro - duction level and providing 60% of the po - pulation with electricity by 2025 implies major challenges, such as an expansion of power distribution capacities through rural areas (which can be done through isolated systems). Other important cons - traints in the sector are the elimination of subsidies, the scarcity of national and provincial data compiled and publicly ac - cessible that would allow a good characte - rization of the situation; the lack of clarity in organizational terms and competencies in the attributions of certain institutions (such as GAMEK and PRODEL); the lack of financial resources and the lack of incen - tives for private investment in renewable energy projects. There is also the need for technological improvement, investments 63 MINEA (2021) Administrative data. 64 Di tto. 65 M INEA (2000) Angola 2025: long-term vision for the electricity sector .

G lobal Insights, Eight editionin improving energy efficiency, the need to develop favorable policy and regulatory frameworks , lack of recognized business models, lack of market and connection data, limited capacity of key players. Providing access to reliable energy to final consumers remains a significant challen - ge because the transmission and distri - bution network in the country needs to be upgraded or expanded and the internal connection between the four energy pro - duction systems (North, Central, South and East) and the connection with neigh - boring countries has yet to be made 67. The distribution network also suffers signifi - cant energy losses due to illegal connec - tions and the poor application of revenue collection from final consumers for its maintenance. The current development of a national electrification strategy can help identify actions to address some of the indicated constraints. To encourage private sector participation in rural electrification, the government is seeking to create an agency for rural electrification, the National Ins - titute for Rural Electrification (INEL), and an associated Rural Electrification Fund (FER). Current patterns of environmenta - lly impactful consumption and production can be improved by encouraging more efficient energy use and a transition from fossil to renewable energy sources . The MCTA / National Directorate of En - vironment and Climate Change (DNAAC) took action to approve funding under the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for a 57PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S project to promote renewable energy for the populations of the southwest of the country. This project aims to establish bu - siness models for private sector participa - tion in providing renewable energy access services (solar) to vulnerable populations in communities not served by the natio - nal electricity distribution grid. Another project supported by the World Bank will build seven solar farms in six different pro - vinces, two in Benguela and the others in Lunda Sul and Luanda Norte, Bi\u00e9, Huambo, and Moxico, which will have a total combi - ned capacity of 370 MW. Two of the farms will be connected to Angola's main power grid, while the remaining five will be isola - ted and focused on providing power to ru - ral communities, some of which currently run on diesel generators 68. The work on the interconnection line between the central and southern regions, which will culminate in the integration of the provin - 68 W orld Bank (2021) Regional Off-Grid Electricity Access Project (ROGEAP) . ces of Hu\u00edla and Namibe into the national grid is in the preparation phase. Other existing opportunities are the ex - ploitation of natural gas resources and their domestic availability under the re - cent approval of a new legal framework for the exploitation of natural gas reserves, which represent a significant opportunity for the efficient and reliable production of electricity that can sustain a national in - dustrial base and support the diversifica - tion of the economy. The national strategy for new renewable energy is strongly committed to biomass as an alternative energy source, set at a target of 500 MW by 2025. The govern - ment's strategy in this subsector is main - ly focused on 300 MW hydrothermal pro - jects, which take advantage of existing forest areas in the central region of the country.

To re - duce the country's economic risks associa - ted with oil price volatility and achieve sus - tainable, low-carbon development goals, it is also important to invest in the diversifi - cation of energy sources by fostering the development of renewable energy. National forecasts for energy demand growth are four times the level of its 2017- 2018 production 69. Providing 60% of the population with energy by 2025 implies an expansion of transmission and distribu - tion capacities. It is also necessary to es - tablish appropriate legislative frameworks to create a favorable business environ - ment and reduce existing risks in order to attract private investment. Angola should also improve energy access and distribu - tion in rural areas of the country and pro - mote energy efficiency measures as well as projects and programs that favor in - 69 Government of Angola (2000) Angola 2025: long-term vision for the electricity sector .

The government aims to increase the pro - portion of renewable energy, particular - ly solar, to at least 7.5% of total installed capacity by 2025, according to its Angola Energy 2025 energy policy. The program aims to achieve a national electrification rate of 60% by 2025, which implies a total of 9.9 GW of additional installed capacity, with hydro and gas (large scale) accoun - ting for 66% and 19% of this merger, res - pectively. In addition, the Action Plan sets out the Ministry's ambition to achieve an installed capacity of 500 MW of renewable energy (i.e. solar, wind, biomass and small hydro) by 2022, 800 MW by 2025, and to is - sue at least 40 power distribution licenses for isolated systems. The plan also highli - ghts that rural electrification targets will be achieved primarily through off-grid sys - tems (micro and mini-grids, >80%), with the remainder through grid extension. The government's premise is to promote in - vestments and attract investors to carry out renewable energy production projects in Angola.59PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.8. SDG 8 DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH SDG 8 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that economic growth and improved working conditions are essen - tial for sustainable development. SDG 8 has a primary focus on the world of work and economic development. It there - fore seeks, by 2030, to promote sustai - ned, inclusive and sustainable economic growth; full and productive employment; and decent work for all. Through this perspective, the overarching goal is to achieve formal, productive employment and decent work for all women and men by 2030. 70 Quick Fact Sheet: Angola Employment Survey IV quarter 2020, INE, page 9. 71 I nformal Employment defined by INE as: a person 15 years of age or older, employed in the private sector, in cooperatives, associations, churches, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) or on their own account, who is in one of the following situations: i) works without a written contract; ii) works in any unit producing goods or services, not registered with public bodies; iii) does not benefit from any social support (paid annual leave, health insurance); and iv) is not registered with social security. 72 IN E (2020) Unemployment Rate in the Country (IEA - IV Quarter 2020). Luanda: National Institute of Statistics.3.8.1. Angola's Context In the fourth quarter of 2020, the employed population aged 15 and over was estimated at 10,749,488 people, with 5,318,995 men and 5,430,493 women. The employment rate was estimated at 62.8%, being in ru - ral areas, significantly higher than in urban areas (79.4% and 51.4%, respectively) 70. Informality predominates in rural areas (93.3%), among women (90.3%) and among youth aged 15-24 (77.1%). The rate of infor - mal employment 71in the non-agricultu - ral sector, was about 59.9% in 2019, with women showing the highest rate, about 79.5%, compared to 43.7% among men 72. Due to the weight of the informal economy in the economic activity a significant part of the employed population is concentra - ted in informal sector activities and, there - fore, with low compensating wages. The - refore, promoting the competitiveness of companies in the domestic market and in exports is an essential precondition to en - sure the diversification of the economic structure, reduce the trade balance defi - cit, broaden the tax base, facilitate market integration on a regional and international scale, which will have positive effects on economic growth, result in the creation of better paid jobs, and consequently reduce poverty. Meanwhile, despite significant progress towards macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, Angola continues to 60 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTsuffer from the effects of lower oil prices and production levels, with a GDP con - traction of 5.2% in 202073, a negative GDP growth rate (-0.04%) and rising unemplo - yment, particularly among youth. To ad - dress the complex macroeconomic fra - mework, the Government has undertaken several interventions: i) in March 2015, it began implementing the Measures to Address the Current Economic Situation (Presidential Decree 56/15 of March 5); ii) in 2016, it outlined the Guidelines for the definition of a Strategy for Exiting the Cri - sis Derived from the Fall in the Price of Oil on the International Market (Presidential Decree No. 40/16 of February 24); iii) in October 2017, an Interim Plan was drawn up to be implemented by March 2018, con - taining policy measures and actions to im - prove the economic and social situation, 73 INE (2020) Seasonally Adjusted Quarterly National Accounts.

At the end of 2018, an agreement was reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for an Extended Financing Program for the period 2018-2021, with the amount of $3.7 billion, increased in the year 2020 by an additional $765 million, making a total of about $4.5 billion. 3.8.2. Plans, Actions and Perspective The Government of Angola through the NDP 2018-2022 implements different pro - grams to promote decent work and econo - mic growth, highlighting the following: Government Policies Employability MAPTSS Improvement of Work Organization and Working ConditionsMAPTSS The program coordinated by the Ministry of Public Administration, Labor and Social Security (MAPTSS) under the 2018-2022 NDP aims to protect workers' rights and promote safe and secure work environ - ments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular migrant women, and people in precarious employment. In the period from 2020 to 2022, the Program for the Improvement of Work Organization and Working Conditions prioritizes two themes: >Red uce risky situations and labor in - fractions through better functioning labor inspection in all provinces; >Pr omote the creation of appropria - te working conditions in terms of hygiene, safety and health at work, with a view to reducing the number 61PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S of work accidents and occupational diseases. The Long-Term Strategy (ELP) Ango - la 2025 establishes the need to define an Employment Promotion Policy aimed at promoting access for all Angolans to pro - ductive, qualified, remunerative and so - cially useful employment and to ensure the sustained enhancement of national human resources . It intends, in particular, to pro - mote youth employment, combat adult long-term unemployment, promote gen - der equality in access to employment, en - courage the creation of adequate working conditions, and promote new models of work organization (namely in the formal sector). The priorities set under employment poli- cy and working conditions are: >Imp rove the institutional basis of employment and human resources policies, promoting a better match between job supply and demand; >Cr eate mechanisms to bring the pro - fessional training system closer to the labor market, not only by adjus - ting curricula to needs, but also by inserting trainees in companies; >Pr omote youth employment and their transition from education to working life; >Su pport the creation of micro and small enterprises by promoting mi - crocredit and subsidized credit in banking institutions; >To p romote the formalization of eco - nomic activity, aiming at a better structuring of the labor market and the creation of fairer competitive conditions; >Pr omote the modernization of work organization, protect workers' rights, and promote safe work environments for all workers. With the globalization of the economy, the labor market has evolved dynamically in Angola, driven by the national reconstruc - Ministry of Economy and Planning of Angola62 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTtion effort that has attracted new com - panies, some of which are multinational. By stimulating the transformation of the economy, the development of the private sector, and the increase in productivity, especially in the sectors of agriculture, li - vestock, forestry, fisheries, and marine resources, mining, oil and gas exploration and processing, manufacturing, and tou - rism, the government has supported ac - tions that foster employability, especially for the youngest, through processes to generate employment in these sectors and facilitate their insertion in the labor market. Within the scope of international cooperation, the Trade Support Program (ACOM ) initiated in 2020 in conjunction with the European Union stands out. Un - der this program, EUR 12,000,000 were made available, divided into two phases: in the first phase (already completed), used for the technical assistance and reinforce - ment component, with EUR 3,786,317 ha -ving been disbursed for Train for Trade in the second phase (underway). Angola shall continue to promote the ge - neration of youth employment, combat adult long-term unemployment, promote gender equality in access to employment, encourage the creation of adequate wor - king conditions and promote new models of work organization, namely in the formal sector. Priority must be given to the defi - nition of a policy to promote employment with a view to promoting access by all An - golans to productive, qualified, well remu - nerated and socially useful employment and to ensure the sustained development of national human resources. The defini-tion of an employment policy for the next few years shall also have the objective of reducing the levels of informality in the Angolan economy and the progressive for - malization of informal activities, contribu - ting to the promotion of decent work and to guaranteeing workers' rights.63PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.9. SDG 9 INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SDG 9 aims to build resilient infrastruc - ture, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develo - pment Declaration points to sustainable industrialization, innovation and improved infrastructure as key pillars of sustainable development. Building and maintaining adequate economic and social infrastruc - ture - energy, transport, telecommuni-cations and water supply and sanitation, housing, hospitals, schools - and the exis - tence of a national innovation system ca - pable of incorporating, adapting and pro - ducing new technologies are important for sustainable development. 3.9.1. Context of Angola Investment in industry, innovation and infrastructure is an important factor for economic growth and sustainable deve - lopment. In this sense, the Angolan go - vernment has been giving some attention to SDG 9, not only to meet its targets, but also as an internal commitment to resu -me economic growth with social inclusion, towards development. Angola, due to the wealth of resources at its disposal, offers a multiplicity of oppor - tunities for the manufacturing industry. It is a major generator of employment and therefore a determinant for the satisfac - tion of some of the most important natio - nal aspirations. However, Angola is not ex - periencing a significant transformation of its economy through long-term changes in terms of the relative importance and con - tributions of the different economic sec - tors - agriculture, industry, and services - in terms of production and share of capital and labor (indicator 9.2.1). The development of manufacturing in - dustry in Angola requires coherent and continued investment in the satisfaction of basic needs imposed by the exercise of activities, so that the conditions for sti - mulating the re-industrialization process necessarily include the creation of infras - tructure to support the industrial location: energy, water, WWTPs, infrastructure industrial areas, communications, road links. In the current economic context the national private sector does not have the capacity to promote the creation of these infrastructures and it is also not feasible that foreign entities may be interested, through initiatives under their own res - ponsibility, in the establishment of indus - trial centers. Angola has invested in the development of the industrialization process in such a way that it is not in conflict with the environ - ment and the socio-cultural framework, nor does it waste resources or penalize assets, among which, of course, human assets stand out. According to the World Bank, CO2 emissions from the manufactu -64 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTring and construction sector decreased its contribution from 32% in 2002 to less than 8% in 2015, while transportation increased from 24% to 44% in the same period. The value of Kg CO2 per unit of value added in manufacturing fell from 8.0 in 2009 to 6.3 in 2016.3.9.2.

Angola's National Policy for Technolo - gical Science and Innovation (PNCTI), as well as its main management instru - ments, namely the National Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation (ENCTI) and the ENCTI Coordination Me - chanism, through the decrees 201/11 of July 20th, 196/11 of July 11th, and 224/11 of August 11th, are the expansion of the government's will to insert technological science and innovation into the country's development strategy. Several ministries are active in the areas of industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is the entity responsible for defining and imple - menting the National Plan for Industrial Development and the Program for the Pro - motion of Manufacturing Production. The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Te - chnology and Innovation is the entity res - ponsible for the definition and implemen - tation of the National Policy and Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. Several ministries intervene in the infras - tructure construction policy, but the Mi - nistry of Public Works and Spatial Planning is responsible for all public construction policy in Angola.

Angola's National In - dustrial Development Plan sets as a goal the sustained growth of manufacturing's share of GDP , rising from a baseline value of 6.1% in 2018 to more than 9% in 2025. Figure 5 A ngolan economic structure in terms of value added (VAIT/GDP) Source: National Accounts, National Institute of Statistics (INE) In terms of contribution to the GDP , it should be noted that the value added of the manufacturing industry is still below 7% and even below the agricultural sec - tor, limiting its fundamental role in increa - sing productivity and the downstream and upstream linkages of employment and reducing inequalities. This is a positive performance, but still below the region: in the same period, the SADC member states registered an average value of 11.5%; the sub-Saharan African countries reached the 10% plateau and South Africa had a share around 13.4% of the GDP . In absolute terms, the AVM per capita (indicator 9.2.1) recorded continuous progress since the early 2000s, interrupted in 2013 and recor-ding a value in 2018 (179 USD) below the va - lues observed in the period 2012-2013 (181-188 USD). Other regions in sub-Saharan Africa are growing faster and in order to be competitive in the African Continental Free Trade Area ( AfCF TA) context, Angola will have to renew its efforts to keep pace among its future competitors through in - dustrial diversification/strategy.

At the sectoral level, the structure of the industrial fabric became dominated by food industries, namely i) the slaughtering of animals and the preparation and preser - vation of meat, fish, fruit and vegetables; ii) the manufacture of animal and vegeta - ble oils and fats; iii) the production of dairy products; and iv) the milling of cereals and the manufacture of starches, starches and their products. The gross value added (GVA) of these activities grew steadily, ma - king food products the predominant indus - trial production activity, with about 45% of industrial production in 2017, as confirmed by industrial production data, collected from about 600 companies and processed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MINDCOM). The remaining industrial ac - tivities as a whole never reached a third of industrial GVA in the period 2002-2017. In this group, the most important activity was the production of non-metallic pro - ducts whose production reached about 9% of industrial GVA 79. The fragmented Angolan industrial fabric is demonstrated by the number of compa - nies registered in Angola - 130,858 in 2018 - of which 4.7% (about 8,740), declared that their main activity was in the Manu - facturing Industries 80. Another reason for this fragmentation is the number of staff in service, finding that almost two-thirds of the companies in activity have between one and nine workers; 437 have between 10 and 19 workers; and only 632 have more than 20 workers in service. As for size, more than 90% of the companies in the 68 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTsector are micro and small (1,805 and 810, respectively), with 219 medium-sized and 39 large companies in operation. The government's recent efforts to impro - ve SMEs access to credit seem to bear the first fruits: the share of microenterprises with access to loans has increased from 0% in 2019 to 4.35% in 2020. Historically, manufacturing has a high po - tential for increasing formal employment. The most recent disaggregated data on manufacturing employment 81 shows that this stands at only 1.5 percent (indicator 9.3.1), far below other Sub-Saharan African countries. Therefore, it is not surprising to observe the increase in unemployment ra - tes from 32.7% at the beginning of the year to 34% in the third quarter of 2020, driven by youth unemployment (56.4%), and pus - hing the informal sector to almost 80% of total employment, with most women em - ployed in this sector (89.5%) 82. Excessive dependence on a subsector of the economy that is usually not gender inclusive (oil extraction) also leads Angola to present very low female participation rates in industry at the global level, below 1.2% since 2010, relegating most female employment to agriculture and services, sectors that are usually less productive. In this context, Angola has high inequa - lity indices in global terms - starting with the Gini index which in 2018 stood at 51.3 - with Angola in the same year having one of the highest gender inequality indices in the world, 0.578 (higher than Afghanis - tan, 0.575 and the average for sub-Saha - ran Africa, 0.572). This is reflected in an 81 MAPTSS, Administrative data 2015-2016. 82 IN E (2020) Employment Survey, IV quarter 2020. 83 World Bank and UNDP (2020) Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Angola: brief analysis .

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Productive Capa - bilities Index (PCI) summarizes the driving elements behind this performance: Angola ranked 177th out of 193 countries. In 2018, the country's overall CPI was 22.16, well be - low the average for other developing coun - tries (DPOs) (32.45) and slightly below the average for the group of least advanced countries (24.04). The low CPI for Angola means that the country's socioeconomic performance remains slow and vulnerable to negative external shocks, such as CO - VID-19. When compared to LDCs and LDCs, Angola's CPI performance is weaker in all seven categories used, except for the na - tural capital component, which is relatively higher than the LDC average, thanks to its dominant extractive sectors. In fact, An - gola's performance in structural change, Information and Communication Techno - logy (ICT), institutions, and the private sec - tor is the weakest when compared to other developing countries, and signals not only the high concentration of exports, but also an alarming gap between the country's Gross National Income (GNI) per capita on the one hand and key economic and social indicators on the other. COVID-19 is expec - ted to further weaken the country's low level of productive capacity, exacerbating its socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Access to digital technology remains qui - te limited, with less than 50% of Angolans 69PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S having access to the Internet84, although only 4% can afford more than 1GB of ac - cess per month85.

In 2008, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) conduc - ted a review of Angola's Science, Techno - logy and Innovation Policy (STIP). UNCTAD provided a set of recommendations on how the country should use Science, Te - chnology and Innovation (STI) for econo - mic growth in key sectors such as mining, agriculture, manufacturing and ICTs. As a result, the country has taken steps to try to improve its STI system. Key issues and recommendations, among others, from this review include: >Ed ucational reforms, including the role of higher education and STI-re - lated industries; >Un iversity activities aimed at solving social problems such as waste ma - nagement, recycling, etc.;70 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT >Promoting innovation and entrepre - n eurship in the educational system; >Cr eation of a support fund to finance STI actions; >Fos tering and creating synergies be - tween industry, universities, and re - search and development centers; >Pr omote the development of science parks and business incubators; cen - ters of excellence and national, re - gional and subregional research and development networks; >Pr omotion of incentives to scientific and technological production; and >St rengthening the ministries in char - ge of ICTs, Science and Technology, Health and Industry and other go - vernment departments, including in - ter-ministerial committees. In terms of industry development, innova - tion and infrastructure, it remains a cha - llenge for Angola to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the non-oil sector. Net FDI inflows to Angola have remained nega - tive over the past three years, mainly due to disinvestments in the oil sector - due to large repatriations of revenues by foreign headquarters companies and declines in oil production, which have affected new investments. In the first quarter of 2020, FDI inflows into the non-oil sector fell to USD 36.5 million compared to USD 160.5 million in the previous quarter. Angola faces great challenges in the tran - sition from an oil-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, so invest - ment in human capital and infrastructure capable of generating knowledge for so - ciety, which promote the emergence of technology-based companies, will be one of the ways to leverage the national eco - nomy. However, what can be observed is that innovation is very incipient, but the strategic use of intellectual property can underpin the objectives of the NDP . Howe - ver, so far, Angola has not made signifi - cant efforts to meaningfully integrate IP into addressing broader policy issues and development objectives. Although Angola has a revised Science, Technology and In - novation Policy (STIP), very little has been done to materialize these recommenda - tions, which is reflected in the incipient innovation and consequently the very low number of nationwide technological crea - tions (inventions), as can be seen in the statistics above. At a general level, one of the major cha - llenges for SDG 9 is necessarily to improve the institutional capacity to produce and make available data for the evaluation and monitoring of SDG 9-related targets on a regular basis. In the non-oil sectors , agro-industries sti - ll dominate production and few exports. However, the metals and chemicals indus - tries seem to offer an important opportu - nity in the near future. Angola has growth potential through investment in i) Educa - tion, Science and Technology; ii) Techno - logy Transfer; iii) Industrial Production, Competitiveness, Employment, Sustaina - bility; iv) Building resilient infrastructure to support development. The establishment of industrial nuclei , besides inducing a desirable industrial de - centralization and allowing the orderly im - plantation of a growing number of indus - tries, may constitute an important means for the development of certain regions, even if remote, by stimulating production, rationalizing the use and transformation of regional resources, and promoting a resettlement of the labor force. The go -71PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S vernment's effort to create an economy with industry and innovation as its basis is visible. Angola will have to renew its efforts to keep pace with future competitors throu - gh diversification and an industrial stra - tegy. Reversing trends in manufacturing and putting Angola on the right path to diversification will require, among others, building the necessary productive capa - cities, a process in which Angola lags be - hind other graduating countries and most LDCs. Angola will also have to develop actions aimed at building resilient infrastructure , promoting inclusive and sustainable in - dustrialization and fostering innovation. The realization of SDG 9 necessarily invol -ves investment in education, science and technology; investment in industrial pro - duction, employment, sustainability; and the construction of resilient infrastructure to support development. Overall, it is expected that Angola will continue to implement PRODESI and increase the viability of projects to in - crease the rate of bank financing. On the other hand, it should seek to find finan - cing and partnerships and coordination mechanisms to implement the industrial development plan. In the field of relevant information, it should be able to more efficiently collect updated data from the bodies responsible for its production and systematically update the indicators with more recent data.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development declaration recognizes that reducing inequalities at various levels is the basis of sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sus - tainable Development declaration states that sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth is essential for prospe - rity. This will only be possible if wealth is shared and income inequality is tackled 87. There are growing inequalities within and between countries in terms of income, opportunity, and gender, among others 88. For example, income inequality, based on the income share of the richest 10%, has increased since the 1980s in most re - gions 89. SDG 10 aims to reduce inequality within and among countries. 87 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, paragraph 27. 88 U nited Nations (2020) The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 . 89 UNDP (2019) Human Development Report 2019 and Alvaredo, F ., L.

Wa shington: World Bank. 93 Th e quintiles represent five groups that each in turn represent 20% of the population.3.10.1. Context of Angola The first target of SDG 10, target 1.1, aims to achieve progressively and sustaina - bly, the growth of the income of the 40% of the poorest population at a rate hi-gher than the national average. In Ango - la, about one in five people live with less than 50% of the median income 90(indica - tor 10.2.1). Inequalities in human development are an obstacle to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and there are different forms of inequalities beyond income and consumption. The Human Development Report (HDR) 2019 shows that inequali - ties in human development have taken new forms in the 21st century, including an increase in inequalities in terms of capabilities 91. In this sense, reducing in - equalities involves empowering and pro - moting the social, economic and political inclusion of all, regardless of age, gen - der, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, re - ligion, economic or other status (target 1.2) 92. In addition, target 10.4 implies the commitment to adopt policies, especia - lly on taxation, wages and social protec - tion, and progressively achieve greater equality. In Angola, there are important regional and local asymmetries. A key indicator of inequality is the distribution of national in - come by quintile 93. In Angola, the poorest 73PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S quintile captures only 3.8% of the national income, while the richest quintile captures 55.6% of this income. That is, the average income of a person in the richest quintile is 15 times higher than the average income of a person in the poorest 94 quintile. Gi - ven this difference between the first and fifth quintile, inequality in Angola is high, reaching 0.51 in urban areas, as measured 94 I NE (2019) Final Report of the Survey on Expenditure and Revenue .

There is more inequali - ty in urban areas (0.48) than in rural areas (0.44) 95. The World Bank estimates that in 2018 the richest 10% of Angola captured 39.6% of national income, while the poorest 10% captured only 1.3% of national income 96 (Figure 7). Figure 8 D istribution of national revenue in Angola by decile (% of national revenue captured by each group) 39,6% 1,3% POOREST 10% RICHEST 10% Source: World Bank, World Economic Indicators , 2018. Between 2000 and 2019, Angola's Human Development Index ( HDI ) value increased from 0.400 to 0.581, with a progressive improvement in average life expectan - cy indicators. However, when the value is weighted according to inequality - In - equality Adjusted Human Development Index (IDHD) - the HDI falls to 0.397, a loss of 31.7% due to the unequal distribution of the values of the different dimensions of the HDI 97. As economic and social in - equalities are in turn reflected even more strongly in imbalances at the glo - bal level, it is important to consider other measures of inequality. A key indicator is the HDI Adjusted for Pressures on the 74 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTPlanet (HDI), which adjusts the standard HDI to the level of carbon dioxide emis - sions and the material footprint of each country, in both cases per capita. Ango - la's HDI in 2019 has a value of 0.570 com - pared to an HDI value of 0.581 98. 98 Ditto.3.10.2.

Angola's Migration Po - licy was approved by Presidential Decree 318/18. Cross-sectoral teams of key migra - tion stakeholders, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MIREX), the private sector, and civil society bodies, are responsible for its dissemination and mainstreaming in their respective areas of work. Angola's Migration Policy focuses on the manage - ment of migration flows, the study of mi - gration trends, the integration of migrants and the reintegration of nationals, as well as the collection, analysis and publica - tion of migration data. It also aims at the analysis of the effects of climate change on migration policies, the promotion of tourism as a key factor for development, and the engagement and contribution of the diaspora to Angola's development. The policy also covers the return of qualified citizens and the prevention of transnatio - nal crime. It should be noted that in 2020, 46,312 citizens were in the country under international protection, of which 30,139 were asylum seekers and 16,173 had refu - gee status. To realize SDG 10, it is also necessary to implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries , in particular for Least Develo - ped Countries (LDCs), in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements 75PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S (target 10.a). Angola is included in the LDC category and has access to the corres - ponding international support measures. Regarding the targets set for LDCs, it is important to note that Angola's graduation has been extended to 2024. In this regard, the country will soon draft a Smooth Tran - sition Strategy that will determine the gui - delines to enable Angola to transition pea - cefully from the LDC category through po - licies and programs to strengthen human assets and reduce economic vulnerability. Finally, SDG 10 also includes a specific tar - get (10.b) regarding incentives for official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment to states where the need is greatest, in particular LDCs. Official Development As - sistance (ODA) flows received by Angola have been relatively limited, about USD 50.52 million in 2019 99. The analysis of the indicators showed in - equalities in income and human develo - pment, which require the redoubling of efforts to promote the achievement of SDG 10. These efforts include tax policies 99 OECD data .favorable to the most vulnerable groups, active labor market policies to strengthen professional skills and employment oppor - tunities, the promotion of gender equality, the reduction of regional asymmetries, the strengthening of governance and dialo - gue with the United Nations, development partners, civil society, and the private sector. It should be noted that inequalities are both cause and effect of environmental challenges. Unequal access to natural re - sources (e.g. access to land) and inequi-table distribution of their benefits can fuel social and economic conflict and li - mit economic development. Women, men, youth and children suffer differently from the impacts of climate change and envi - ronmental degradation. In this context, scientific knowledge, ecosystem manage - ment, conservation and restoration play a key role in reducing risks. In this sense, it will be necessary to redouble efforts for the inclusive and equitable participation of people in the formulation and implementa - tion of sustainable development policies. 76 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT3.11. SDG 11 SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES SDG 11 aims to achieve that cities and hu - man settlements are inclusive, safe, resi - lient and sustainable. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop - ment recognizes that sustainable housing and urbanization contribute very directly to sustainable development and are fun - damental to quality of life. SDG 11 aims to make cities and communities sustainable. Target 11.1 aims to ensure access for all to safe, adequate and affordable housing; to basic services; and to improve conditions in slums/museums, by 2030. 3.11.1. Context of Angola According to the definitive results of the General Census of Population and Housing of Angola (2014 Census), of a population of 25.7 million people, 63% lived in urban areas, with a strong concentration of po - pulation in the province of Luanda (27%), followed by the provinces of Hu\u00edla (10%), 100 CAHF - Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa (2019) Housing and Finance in Africa Yearbook . 10 1 Di tto. 102 AU/UNECA/AfDB and UNDP (2018) Africa Sustainable Development Report: towards a transformed and re silient UNECA.Benguela (9%) and projections, in 2030 Luanda will have 11,332,670 inhabitants, that is, it will be a megacity. In addition, Angola will have 11 cities with between one and five million people and six cities with between 500,000 and one million inhabitants. In 2010, 65% 100 of the population in Angola lived in musseques (slums). In 2018, the - re was a reduction in this percentage to 47%101, reflecting the government's efforts to implement housing projects aimed at both the construction of new housing and the urban upgrading of peripheral neigh - borhoods. This downward trend of popu - lation in the musseques is a pattern that is also registered in the African continent - in the period from 2010 to 2014 there was a reduction of 3.6% - although in absolute terms the number of people had an increa - se of 14.8 million, reaching the sum of 212 million people 102. At the time of the 2014 Census, 75.4% of the Angolan population lived in their own homes, and only 19.2% in rented houses. According to the results of the IDREA 2018-2019, in the housing occupation re - gime, self-built housing stood out, with 62.4%, with 84.1% in rural areas and 47.8% in urban centers, which demonstrates the ability of low-income families to build their own housing. However, this type of cons - truction increases the already existing di - sorder in large urban centers, exerts pres - sure on services and infrastructure, and contributes to a poorer quality of life. The high growth rate of urban areas, the result of natural population growth and rural exo -77PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S dus, occurs unplanned and unregulated. Self-built housing in informal areas, with no habitable conditions, is sometimes the only option for accommodation for many households, and some of them opt for ren - ting, where subletting and overcrowding practices prevail, leaving the tenants at the mercy of the owners' free will. Urbanization can be a vehicle for the crea - tion of wealth , for the generation of em - ployment, and drive human progress, as long as the positive externalities that the high concentration of people in the same place produces are taken advantage of, as indicated in target 11.a. To this end, it is im - portant to develop infrastructure and ser - vices capable of enabling access to the ci - ties (through improved means of transpor - tation - target 11.2) and the generation of employment, to meet the growing needs, especially of youth. Regarding the state housing projects, a set of legislation was created, among which the joint Executive Decree 363/20 and 364/20, which defines the houses prices and the value of the rents. Throu - gh this decree, it was established that the average value of the monthly instalment of the resolvable rent in the housing projects is AOA 12,000, positioned below the maxi - mum effort of 40% of the lowest category of salaries (second class cleaning assis - tant), which is AOA 33,598.36 (Presidential Decree 14/19). Angola is vulnerable to climate change : floods, droughts, soil erosion, marked temperature variability in some parts of the country, as well as the increase in the average sea level are pointed out as the main effects of climate change that also 103 M INAMB (2018) National Strategy for Climate Change . Luanda: Ministry of Environment. affect the cities. One of the threats and expected impact of climate change in urban centers are floods, which in seve - ral Angolan cities are responsible for the destruction of residential dwellings and commercial buildings and the interruption of transport routes. Cities are also espe - cially vulnerable to temperature rise, with the urban heat island effect, in which road geometry, building height, vegetation, and proximity to water play a large role. The in - crease in the average sea level is a threat to cities located on the coast, an area whe - re 10% of the Angolan population lives. Ac - cording to ENAC, it is estimated that 37% of households are located in areas with en - vironmental diseases such as malaria and cholera 103. The cities are areas with intense economic activity and that can be run more efficient - ly as long as they implement concrete ac - tions to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change, such as encouraging the principle of energy efficiency in buildings, investing in green areas, in the construction of bicy - cle paths; prioritizing public transport over private transport, implementing protec - tion systems for coastal areas; investing in the adaptation of urban infrastructure, in early warning systems for floods and storms, among others. The creation of institutional capacity for climate change management, as well as the elaboration of climate change action plans for cities, with the participation of community repre - sentatives, guarantee sustainability in ad - dressing this issue. Finally, it is important to emphasize the democratic potential created in urban en - vironments (Goal 11.3). Both the elabora - tion and the implementation of policies, 78 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTplans and initiatives in the most diverse aspects mentioned above, when carried out in a participatory manner, taking into consideration both local needs and po - tentials, have greater chances of success and appropriation by the citizens. Such processes are particularly relevant consi - dering the administrative decentralization phase currently underway in the country.3.11.2. Plans, Actions and Perspectives The Government of Angola through the NDP 2018-2022 implements different pro - grams to promote the sustainability of ci - ties, highlighting the following: Government Policies Leader Impact on SDG 11 indicators11.1.1 11.2.111.3.111.3.211.4.111.5.111.5.211.6.111.6.211.7.111.7.211.A.111.B.111.B.2National Housing Policy MINOPOT National Urbanism and Housing ProgramMINOPOT The National Housing Policy , whose ela - boration began in 2018 with the realization of a diagnosis in 2019 (Profile of the Hou - sing Sector), is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and Spatial Plan - ning (MINOPOT), as well as the coastal pro - tection and river regularization works. The policy is being developed under the United Nations Development Account (UNDA) pro - ject, with the support of UN-Habitat and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). It aims to strengthen the capacities of national and local gover - nments in formulating and implementing diagnosis-based and participatory hou - sing policies and strategies to support the implementation of SDG 11. The project has an inter-regional dimension covering selected countries including Angola, Bul - garia, Malaysia and Paraguay. It aims to stimulate technical cooperation and the exchange of experiences of innovative housing solutions. The Policy will be assisted by an Informal Settlements Improvement Strategy , with a focus on guidelines for intervention in the musseques . This initiative takes place in the context of the European Union-fun - ded Informal Settlements Improvement Program (ISPP), which is based on highly collaborative project design and imple - mentation practices at the national, local, and community levels. For the implementation of the policy and strategies, the MINOPOT articulates with other ministerial departments and with the State's Local Administration. In the urban environment, the Ministry of Transporta - tion (MINTRANS) and its subordinate enti - ties share responsibility for the Transport, Logistics and Distribution Policy, while the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Environ - ment (MCTA) is the entity responsible for conducting the national Environmental Policy. The MAT, for its part, has a key role in conducting the Territorial Development Policy. Housing policies in Angola aim to guaran - tee the basic rights of citizens to live with dignity, giving priority to those in vulnera -79PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S ble conditions, as is the case of citizens living in environmental risk areas, disor - derly and without basic sanitation, which aggravate or put at risk their mental and physical health. The right to housing has been recognized as a human right since 1948 through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For this reason, the Natio - nal Housing Policy was launched in Angola in 2009, which led to the delivery of 43,861 houses between 2015 and 2021, thus pro - viding citizens with decent housing and significantly reducing the existing housing deficit. In Angola, achieving SDG 11 is therefore a major challenge since the country faces a high housing demand due to demogra - phic dynamics, degradation of part of the housing stock, insufficient supply, and pri - ce, both for purchase and for rental. The biggest challenge has to do with reducing the existing housing deficit in the country, due mainly to the population growth rate that stands at 3.5% since 2014, according to data from INE, but also to the growth of inadequate and precarious housing cons - tructions, which have increased signifi - cantly, and which is not accompanied by investments in infrastructure. The demand for decent housing for the middle- and low-income population is very high and, consequently, the realiza - tion of article 85 of the Constitution and the achievement of SDG 11 - and namely target 11.1 which aims at access for all to safe, adequate and affordable housing and basic services, and to improve conditions in slums - presupposes the construction of social housing on a large scale, both for sale and for rent. This challenge repre - sents an opportunity for Angola to boost its economy, since the construction and financing of social housing stimulates the productivity of the various sectors that participate in the value chain of housing construction and respective infrastructu - re, making a significant contribution to the GDP . Due to financial difficulties, the sta - Ministry of Economy and Planning of Angola80 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTte aims to leverage the real estate sector through public-private partnerships, see - king new investors to continue investment in the construction of new housing develo - pments through new financing. In addition, significant institutional chan - ges are underway in the country, including a decentralization of public activities and the holding of municipal elections. Thus, the moment could not be more propitious for a reflection on the direction of housing policy in the country in its various spheres. Taking advantage of the ongoing revision of the Basic Law of the Legal Regime of Land, the improvement of the conditions of access to land and the support to citi - zens in the acquisition of land constitute an opportunity to leverage the sector of directed and assisted self-construction. Considering the relative youth of the land planning and housing sector in terms of basic sanitation (namely Wastewater Treatment Plants), electricity and water supply, the State has been making a major investment in urban infrastructure . There is currently a legal framework to guide and attract investment in the housing sector, and based on this, the state has sought to leverage investments in infrastructure, but one of the biggest obstacles has been revenue collection. While the government of Angola has made a considerable effort to expand and im - prove the country's housing stock, a large portion of Angolans continue to lack ac - cess to decent housing. The implemen - tation of the traditional model of housing provision and access in the country, na - mely through the National Urbanism and Housing Program (PNUH), has proven to be 104 UN-Habitat (2016) New Urban Agenda . limited in the current environment of redu - ced economic growth. The functionality of Angola's cities and the connections between them must be planned to support specific economic de - velopment objectives. Connecting urba - nism and access to housing to economic development through policies and strate - gies and investments is a priority for the sustainability of cities and allows for the development of dynamic, sustainable and inclusive urban economies, based on en - dogenous potential, competitive advanta - ges, cultural heritage and local resources, as well as through the efficient use of re - sources and resilient infrastructure, crea - ting a favorable environment for entrepre - neurship and innovation 104. Since the beginning of the millennium, the Angolan government has been investing in the urban construction of Centralities/Ur - banizations , and there has been a strong investment in this type of housing that aims to serve the most disadvantaged people through fully or partially subsidized social housing. Since the beginning of the oil price crash in 2014, however, the continuation of these projects has been slower compared to the 2009-2018 period. Although the need for urban expansions is still considered va - lid at the country level, it is important that the paradigm regarding them be rethought, considering diversified approaches to im - plementation, ensuring connections to the existing urban fabric and suitability to the demand of different groups. Still, there is a need for greater investment in the improve - ment of existing settlements. Of the country's persisting urban develo - pment challenges, the difficulty of access 81PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S to housing finance for Angolans in general stands out. Although the housing sector is capital intensive, there is no mortgage market in Angola, and in the case of hou - sing microfinance, there are few expe - riences, led mainly by non-governmental actors. The absence of a mortgage market constitutes a real bottleneck for the deve - lopment of the housing sector. Large-scale production could help ad - dress housing needs. This will require the creation of favorable conditions for the participation of the private sector and housing cooperatives, with access to land and financing for construction and pur - chase. The strategy for Angola's approach to Goal 11 and the goals of Agenda 2063 involves the definition of the goals to be achieved by the stakeholders involved, as well as the creation of conditions for the involvement of the most diverse actors, such as the private sector, housing coo - peratives and families, in the construction of housing for purchase, rental and direc - ted self-construction. In order to improve this process, a model for citizen and civil society participation should be created, as many housing units continue to be partially subsidized by the state. In relation to this subsidy, it is also necessary to improve the model for collecting contributions from beneficiaries in order to guarantee project sustainability. The New Urban Agenda , in this context, constitutes a fundamental guide for the promotion of sustainable cities and com - munities in Angola. Its dissemination among institutions directly linked to the achievement of the SDGs, including local government bodies, is a priority for Angola in the short and medium-term.82 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT3.12. SDG 12 RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION SDG 12 aims to ensure sustainable con - sumption and production patterns. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustai - nable Development recognizes that impro - ving the conditions and forms of produc - tion and consumption leads to more sus - tainable development. Sustainable con - sumption and production aims to \"do more and better with less\" by promoting resour - ce and energy efficiency, avoiding resour - ce waste and waste generation. This re - quires socio-economic transformation and new ways of thinking about products and services, innovating in terms of solu - tions with lower environmental impact and higher social and economic value. 3.12.1. Context of Angola The recent model of development and li - festyle in Angola, especially in urban areas, 105 Paula, R., Chaves, D. and Almeida, V.

Rome: FAO. 107 Ditto.presents challenges due to the existence of production and consumption patterns that do not follow standards of environmental sustainability. The intense urbanization, high population growth and increasing con - sumption of industrialized products causes an increase in the production of urban and industrial waste (hazardous and non-ha - zardous waste). In Angola, about 4 kg of waste is produced daily per person and in Luanda the annual production is 1.3 million tons, with an expected increase of 146% by 2025, according to the National Waste Agency. The lack of waste management and the inadequate disposal of waste in valley bottoms, street margins or watercourses, generates contamination of water bodies and food products, silting and flooding, pro - liferation of disease-transmitting animals, visual and air pollution 105, with implications for the health, welfare and quality of life of people, especially in urban areas. Another problem related to production and consumption is food waste , which in the sub-Saharan African region is about 37% (or 120-170 kg / year per capita) 106. Food los - ses and food waste occur along the entire agricultural value chain and at all stages of production until it reaches consumers (10% at harvest, 50% in handling and transport, 30% in central supply chains, and 10% in su - permarkets and consumers' homes) 107. Production and consumption are major dri - vers of the economy and, when done with a focus on socio-environmental responsibili-ty, have a major contribution to sustainable development. Considering the economic si - tuation of the majority of the Angolan popu -83PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S lation, there are some parameters and pa - tterns of sustainable consumption that are beyond what is desirable. The losses in the production, storage and handling of food in the world amount to more than 520 million tons, equivalent to almost 8% of the food produced; in the African case they amount to almost 12%, but there are possibilities of obtaining economic gains from the re - cycling of waste materials and organic and inorganic products. In Angola, there are incipient waste recy - cling services that take advantage of di - fferent types of waste materials (plastic, paper, aluminum, etc.). On a certain scale, there is also recycling of cooking vegetable oil, which is used to make soap 108. However, the recycling business in Angola has been gaining more and more space, especially in Luanda. Between 2002 and 2021, the go - vernment registered 102 companies for the collection, treatment and sale of recycled 108 National Recycling Agency, administrative data 2021. 10 9 Ditto. material (94 operate in the non-oil sector, 21 in the oil sector, four in the mining sec - tor and 16 in the hospital sector), and 63 companies treat, valorize and sell recycled material 109. Currently, not enough selective waste receptacles are available, and the - re are generally no ecopoints or waste co - llection and sorting sites. Public operators usually collect mixed waste that is landfi - lled, which means a loss of potential econo - mic resources. Some of these companies have developed ways to make economic use of garbage resources and contribute to the reduction of waste on the streets. 3.12.2.

The National Waste Agency (ANR) esta - blished under Presidential Decree 181/14 is a body supervised by the MCTA, in charge of executing the national waste management policy based on the hie - rarchy of applicable management prin - ciples, the prevention of waste produc - tion, reuse, recycling, recovery and dis - posal, through environmental protection criteria, thus ensuring at the national level the policy on waste management in the scope of standardization, regulation and supervision. The Strategic Plan on Urban Waste Ma - nagement (PESGRU), approved by Pre - sidential Decree 196/12 focuses on the implementation of seven axes thought with a focus on waste valorization (re - pair and reuse of goods instead of their rejection), an environmental governan - ce policy aimed at the circular economy. The National Environmental Quality Program , approved by Presidential De - cree 138/20, aims to improve the quality of life of Angolans in urban, peri-urban 85PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S and rural areas, focusing on ensuring the quality of air, water and soil, through concrete actions and the stimulation and articulation of various government plans and programs in the short, medium and long-term. In the scope of the 2018-2022 NDP , Axis 2 - Sustainable, Diversified and Inclusive Economic Development, is the one that contemplates the Environmental Sus - tainability Policy XII. The materialization of the five proposed solution axes of the Long-Term Strategy 2025 , in which pro - posals on waste are included, reinforces the ongoing work around the promotion of waste recovery and, as such, of the circular economy: i) Good environmental governance; ii) Prevention and control of pollution; iii) Circular economy as a ma - nagement model for waste; iv) Protection and conservation of biodiversity; and v) Adaptation and resilience to natural ris - ks. The implementation was designed to be integrated with the key issues of the sector, which are climate change (with a focus on decarbonization of economies), waste (with a focus on waste recovery) and the circular economy. At the level of specific projects that contribute to this SDG, the GEF-funded projects related to Chemicals and Waste (National Action Plan on Mercury in the Artisanal and Artisanal Gold Mining Sec - tor in Angola) and Persistent Organic Po - llutants (POPs) stand out. Under the lat - ter, capacity building activities to facili - tate early action in the implementation of the Stockholm Convention on POPs in Angola stand out.

ANR has identified since 2019 a portfolio of projects that are appl - ying for funding through UNEP Special Funds and has signed, since 2020, four memorandums of understanding with relevant institutions, such as the UNDP Acceleration Laboratory - Implementa - tion of the Recycle with Communities Program -; with the Institute of Tech - nology and Science (ISPTEC) - Training, consulting, scientific research focused on the impacts of waste and waste re - covery technologies -; with the National Scout Council - Strengthening of awa - reness and sensitization campaigns at the national level -; with the National Institute of Employment and Professio - nal Training (INEFOP) - Social integra - tion of waste pickers. Thanks to these initiatives, the implementation of se - lective waste disposal has been stren - gthened, through the installation of 19 ecopoints (five in Kilamba, three in In - gombota, two in Cassenda, one in Sam - ba, one in Zango 8,000, three in Zango I, one in Zango 4, three in the Zango Mar - ket); and the first steps have already been taken to install ecopoints in all in - formal markets. 102 companies collec - ting, processing and selling recycled material have also been registered. In addition, 2,001 environmental permits were issued, 25 environmental impact assessment processes were apprai - sed; 22 environmental licenses were issued and a public consultation was carried out for a structuring project in the oil and gas domain. Eight monitors were also performed in areas with a hi - gher probability of contamination from hydrocarbon derivatives and 72 physi - cal-chemical analyses were carried out by the Environmental Analysis and Po - llution Center (CAPA- Cabinda). One of the main concerns centers on the lack of scientific studies and difficulties in recording environmental indicators , par -ticularly with regard to climate change or waste. Another problem is the absence of 87PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S reliable information about the state of en - vironmental systems in the country110. Regarding waste (liquid and solid), Angola lacks management systems for sewage and industrial water, solid waste (hazar - dous and non-hazardous). A survey highli - ghted that in Angola there are 12 million plastic bags distributed daily in supermar - kets that end up on land and in the sea, polluting ecosystems. Activities such as construction focused on the production of buildings and infrastructure are respon - sible for up to 23% of air pollution, 50% of climate change, 40% of drinking water po - llution and 50% of landfill waste and much of the world's noise pollution. Angola is working on a workable financial model for waste management . One of the solutions identified globally is to move away from a linear economy and invest in circu - lar economy to minimize waste during the production chain and capture for a longer period of time the value of materials and resources and energy used, thus avoiding damage to the environment, supporting welfare and at the same time economic de - velopment. A major challenge in Angola is to comply with the regulations instituted to ensure an adequate response to waste management in the country (Presidential Decrees 24/15, 190/12 and 265/18). The non-compliance with the cited legisla - tion leads to different negative situations, such as the lack of waste management plans (and as such, waste is disposed of inappropriately) and the cross-border smu - ggling of waste. Another of the problems identified in solid waste management in Angola is the deficient collection of was - 110 Lucas, M. (2019) Environmental Sustainability Indicator System at the Municipal Level in Angola . U niversity of Aveiro. te due to lack of means (as pointed out by the administrations); the scarcity of contai - ners for dumping; little or even no environ - mental education and sensitization of the communities; little incentive for selective collection and no disposal points; the lack of collaboration of the population in the dis - posal of waste in the proper places. In order to reach the goals and indicators established for waste management, regu - lar training and the reinforcement of qua - lified human resources are therefore es - sential, without neglecting improvements in working conditions and remuneration, as well as the institutionalization of ANR's own headquarters and the approval of a set of legal decrees, among them those related to revenue collection sources. ANR will set in motion an inspection process of the licensed operators within the waste sector with the purpose of checking their technical capacity (equipment and other means) and identifying measures to redu - ce the inadequate and criminal disposal of hazardous waste. Associated with this, it is also necessary to promote quality civic and scientific environmental education. To promote a more sustainable and res - ponsible production and consumption of food products, Angola also needs to start a food re-education campaign to remove from the basic food basket foods and pro - ducts that are not produced in the country and that need to be imported (such as, for example, wheat to make bread and certain fruits) and to promote the consumption and production of locally sourced food products, stimulating fair prices, proper handling and the necessary quality. The same situation can be applied to the na -88 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTtional housing construction sector, cha - racterized by the excessive use and con - sumption of electricity, resulting from the architectural distortion of buildings and the use of materials and designs that are inadequate or adjusted to the climatic rea - lities of the country. Sustainable produc - tion and consumption therefore require an integrated approach and cooperation between the different agents involved in the distribution chain, from the producer to the final consumer. Good environmental governance and the promotion of the circular economy as a ma - nagement model for waste advocate impro - vements in the green job market, reduction of marine pollution, improved sanitation, with positive repercussions for the impro - vement of domestic and international tou - rism. Coordination and consultation at the 111 Government of Angola (2021) Angola Industrial Development Plan 2025 . L uanda: Ministry of Industry and Commerce.institutional level is thus essential. MINDCOM will strengthen collaboration and exchanges with the ministries and institutions respon - sible for the sectors that supply basic raw materials to industry (MINAGRIP and MIREM - PET), as well as those that oversee sectors that may be relevant customers for priority industrial products (namely MINIPOT, MINEA, MINTRANS, MINAGRIP , MIREMPET, Homeland Veterans (MINDENVP), MININT, Ministry of Telecommunications, Information Techno - logy and Media (MINTTICS), Ministry of Edu - cation (MED) or MAPTSS), seeking to collect information on current and foreseeable de - mand for these raw materials and products on the domestic market and to collaborate in studies aimed at developing and densifying the respective value chains 111, activities that will help to have more data on consumption and production.89PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.13. SDG 13 CLIMATE ACTION SDG 13 aims to take urgent action to com - bat climate change and its effects. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sus - tainable Development recognizes in a very concrete way action on climate and clima - te change as a key factor for sustainable development. Global warming and clima - te change have impacts on all human and natural systems, influence crop and lives - tock production, the availability of water resources, the emergence of diseases and pests that affect food production and con - sequently compromise food security and people's health. The impacts of climate change on resources and livelihoods can also generate social discontent, conflict and forced migration, increase poverty and decrease quality of life. 3.13.1.

Angola has a climate vulnerability and rea - diness index of 37.4, thus being the 50th most vulnerable country to climate chan - ge and the ninth least prepared to act and combat its effects and consequences out of a total of 181 countries analyzed in 2018 113. The droughts of 2012-2015 and 2019-2021 have affected millions of Angolans, espe - cially those living in the southern regions of the country. On the other hand, torren - tial rains and floods have been the catas - trophic events that have caused the most victims and material damage, especially in urban areas and in infrastructure, namely social infrastructure. The main impacts of climate change on the Angolan economy are related to the effects created by extreme climatic phe - nomena (drought, floods, storms), followed by coastal erosion and calamities. With the risks associated with climate variability, ri - sing temperatures, heavy rainfall (or lack of rainfall) and rising sea levels, there are losses in various productive areas (agri-culture, livestock, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture) and a greater occurrence of pests and diseases. The estimated direct economic losses due to floods in Angola are approximately USD 94 million per year, which represented in 2017 approximately 90 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT0.06% of the total economic value of the assets considered and 0.8% of GDP114. The 2020-2021 drought , the worst in forty years in the southwest of the country, has brought severe consequences for crops, with losses of up to 40% of crops, and also for livestock survival by causing food shor - tages 115. There are also negative effects on the urban and housing sector, transporta - tion and critical infrastructure, especially in the coastal areas. All these factors have a negative impact on GDP , local econo - mies and the country's potential for eco - nomic diversification. An improvement of the country's current and future climate information and impacts is therefore ne - cessary to be able to identify the risks and vulnerability factors, to establish adapta - tion and mitigation measures in the short, medium and long-term 116. The phenomenon of global warming and climate change is a global environmental problem, with different consequences at local level in all countries, including Ango - la. It is caused fundamentally by human activities that emit GHGs into the atmos - phere, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. The latest FAO forest study 117 carried out in 235 countries, in - dicates that Angola is the fourth country with the highest annual net forest loss (difference between forest created and destroyed) in the last decade (2010-2020), losing 555,000 hectares on average every year. Results from Angola's Second Na - tional Communication (2021) on Greeen - house Gas (GHG) emissions, report that the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land 114 CIMA and UNISDR (2018) Disaster Risk Profile of Angola .

Use (AFOLU) sector accounted for 70% of emissions at the national level, fo - llowed by the energy sector, with 18% of emissions. In general, the country is not a major con - tributor to global warming, like the more industrialized and advanced countries, but it is already directly feeling the negative effects of climate change and deforesta - tion. Natural ecosystems play an impor - tant role in regulating the climate, absor - bing about half of the carbon emissions from human activities, and are essential for adapting to climate change and allevia - ting its effects. Ministry of Economy and Planning of Angola91PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.13.2.

It also has oversight of the Cen - ter for Tropical Ecology and Climate Chan - ge (CETAC), created in 2012, and responsi - bility for coordinating the implementation of climate action projects with the other ministries (MINAGRIP , MINEA, MINOPOT). The climate program has three objecti - ves: Objective 1 - promote the adoption of a low-carbon economic growth model; Objective 2 - adapt the national territory to the effects of climate change, through the integration of the adaptation compo -nent in existing or new policies, programs and activities; Objective 3 - strengthen the fight against drought and desertifica - tion and the gradual introduction of citrus orchards and fruit planting by families as reforestation alternatives and preventive action for sustainability. The government's main strategies to com - bat climate change are set out in the Na - tional Strategy for Climate Change (ENAC 2020-2035) and the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 2020-2030), both under review in 2020. The national institutional framework for Disaster Risk Management (DRM) in Ango -92 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTla was developed by the 2003 Framework Law for Civil Protection, through the crea - tion of the National Commission for Civil Protection (CNPC) and the Civil Protection and Fire Service (SPCB). The CNPC, which is under the Ministry of Interior (MININT) is the commission in charge of coordinating and promoting disaster preparedness, response and recovery activities and risk management throughout the country. The Provincial Civil Protection Commissions (CPPC) are the provincial structures esta - blished by the CNPC, chaired by the nors or Vice-Governors. CNPC and CPPC are cross-sectoral commissions involving representatives of all ministries and insti - tutes, as well as relevant services. At the project level, Angola has for seve - ral years been developing projects such as the Promotion of Sustainable Charcoal in Angola through a Value Chain Approach (MCTA/UNDP , GEF-5); the Response to Ur - gent Coastal Adaptation Needs and Capa - city Gaps in Angola Project (MCTA/UNEP/UNDP , GEF-5) the Promoting Climate Re - silient Development and Enhanced Adap - tive Capacity to withstand Disaster Risks in the Cuvelai River Basin in Angola (MCTA/UNDP , GEF-5); the project Integrating Climate Resilience into Agricultural and Agro-pastoral Production Systems throu - gh Soil Fertility Management in Producti - ve and Vulnerable Areas Using the Farmer Field School Approach (MCTA/FAO,GEF-5) the Integrating Climate Change into Envi - ronment and Sustainable Land Manage - ment Practices project (ICE-SLM, AfDB); the Building Resilience as Climate Change Adaptation in Drought-Affected Communi - ties in Southwest Africa project (AF-OSS); the Strengthening NDA and Supporting Country Programming for Angola project (AfDB); the FRESAN project (European Union - EU); and the Promoting Access to Sustainable Energy for Rural Communities in Southwest Angola project (approved project concept). These projects total an estimated GEF funding of USD 33.6 million and co-financing of more than USD 129 million. In recent years, five policy and strategy documents have been prepared, some al - ready approved, such as the Disaster Re - covery and Drought Framework (QRD/S 2018-2022), others under review and pen - ding formal approval, such as the National Climate Change Strategy (ENAC 2020-3035) and Nationally Determined Contribu - tions (NDC 2020-2030). In 2020, the Paris Agreement and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol were ratified, impor - tant international legal instruments that underpin climate action on a global and also national scale. In the area of climate action and disaster risk reduction (DRR), the following actions are underway: (i) ela - boration of guidelines for the processes of vulnerability assessment to the effects of climate change; (ii) approval of the re - newable energy promotion project for the southwest of the country; (iii) the elabora - tion of the project on increasing the clima - te resilience of the populations surroun - ding the Iona and Luengue-Luiana national parks; (iv) elaboration of an Environmental Education strategy; (v) establishment of early warning systems for floods in Cune - ne and Benguela; and (vi) development of DRR management strategies at the provin - cial, municipal and local levels. Through the GEF Coal Project , an Impro - ved Stove for Angola (IKO) was designed, with emission and particulate reduction results of up to 90%. Through the Cuve - lai Project, more than 87 government te -93PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S chnicians from across the country were trained in meteorology and hydrology; 12 automatic weather stations were insta - lled; 12 remote and isolated communities were put in communication with the Cune - ne SPCBs via two-way radio; 11 resilience centers were established in the most vul - nerable villages of the Cuvelai; a radio pro - gram started broadcasting in two national languages in Cunene; and relevant studies of climate change impacts were done for the coastline. Through another GEF pro - ject, climate resilience was integrated into agricultural and agro-pastoral production systems through soil fertility management in key production areas, involving commu - nities. Resource mobilization actions were also undertaken to obtain funding from the Global Environment Fund (GEF-6 and 7), the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the Green 118 C IMA and UNISDR (2018) Disaster Risk Profile of Angola . Savona, Italy: CIMA.Climate Fund (GCF). Throughout 2020 and until the first quarter of 2021, 22,934 ci - tizens were made aware of the effects of climate change, corresponding to a de - gree of execution of 11.47% (annual target 10,000 citizens), involving the preparation of awareness raising material on adapta - tion to the effects of climate change. In 2019 the National Commission for Civil Protection conducted a study to deter - mine the disaster risk profile 118, an im - portant tool for flood and drought risk management in Angola, demonstrating its commitment to fulfilling the priority of the Sendai Framework which is to know disaster risks in all its dimensions, namely hazards, exposure, vulnerabilities and ca - pacities to cope with them. Collaboration has also been established with the Ministry Ministry of Economy and Planning of Angola94 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTof Education for the production of a disas - ter risk manual. Specific national needs related to climate change mitigation and adaptation include increasing skilled human resources for the development and implementation of mi - tigation and adaptation actions; building capacity (national, provincial, municipal and at the commune level) for the develo - pment of low carbon technologies; expan - ding knowledge and access to financing mechanisms by public and private enti - ties; better knowledge of new and more efficient technologies among different sectors and public and private entities; creating a robust system for collecting, measuring, reporting and verifying natio - nal contribution data. It is also necessary to create an integrating mechanism and greater participation and interaction and collaboration of government institutions, academia and research centers, and the private sector. At the global integration level, Angola's transition from Least Developed Country to Medium Development Country implies greater international reporting obligations to the UNFCCC and less funding available in the future. However, the recent ratifica - tion of the Paris Agreement and the Doha Amendment by the Angolan government and the approval of ENAC and NDC in the near future, open new opportunities for funding, technical assistance, technology transfer and collaboration to advance the country's climate change program. There is also a need to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation measu - res in the plans, strategies and policies of different strategic development sec - tors at different scales (national, provin - cial and municipal) in order to formalize the national approach to climate change. The latest government restructuring in April 2020, with the merger of ministries, together with the reduction of the Gene - ral State Budget (GSB) and the economic crisis accentuated by COVID-19, have pro - ved to be major challenges for the effec - tive implementation of projects and pro - grams. The process of decentralization and government restructuring, as well as the diversification of the economy, offer opportunities to improve processes and put solutions in place to help overcome the challenges. The creation of a Multi - sectoral Commission for the Reform of the Education System by the government and the preparation of a National Strategy for Environmental Education (2020-2025) by the MCTA (in progress), offer new possibili - ties to improve and strengthen knowledge, sensitivity and awareness in subjects of themes related to environmental sustaina - bility, climate change and disaster risk re - duction. In the short term, NDC 2020-2030 and ENAC 2020-2035 are expected to be finalized and formally approved, which will enable cross-cutting integration of clima - te change policy in all strategic socio-eco - nomic development sectors. For its efficient implementation, it will be essential to establish and ensure integra - ted, inclusive, participatory, and clear go - vernance systems and mechanisms, such as coordination arrangements between di - fferent ministries and other stakeholders, between different levels of governments and administrations, and protocols for co - llecting and sharing information between institutions, as well as activities that favor the establishment of a monitoring system. The proportion of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures and the tran -95PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S sition from a linear to a circular economy can also help increase resilience to cli - mate change and reduce vulnerability by increasing technical, technological, and financial capacity for adaptation and mi - tigation. Considering Angola's high degree of deforestation and GHG emissions from Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sectors, there is a need to develop strategies for sustainable exploitation and forest conservation and replenishment, as well as to promote a more sustainable, cir - cular, and resilient agriculture. Adaptation processes based on natural ecosystems offer sustainable and low-cost possibili - ties for action. On a more technical level, there is a need to improve the quality of information at the national level and the technical and scientific capacities of institutions on di - saster risks and climate impacts in order to facilitate the preparation and execution of disaster risk management and climate change mitigation and adaptation strate - gies. Associated with this, there is also a need to improve information communica - tion, access to scientific and public infor - mation, as well as to promote large quality civic and scientific environmental educa - tion programs tailored to rural and urban areas, in order to succeed in the implemen - tation of the 2030 Agenda. Angola urgently needs to develop research that shows the impact of climate change on the producti - ve sectors over the next 100 years, so that entrepreneurs and consumers can prepa - re and adapt to the new scenarios. Also, in order to solve a large part of the negative impacts of climate change, a major socio-cultural transformation is necessary in order to ensure adaptation to the effects and their mitigation, contributing to the sustainable development of the country. To realize its climate action, Angola will need greater financial assistance for the development of new techniques of collec - tion, analysis, data cross-checking, moni - toring of the climate and its variations, and incentives for the more rational use of na - tural resources. It will also be necessary to develop an adequate public policy strategy for financing the sector, in the short, me - dium and long term, to ensure low-carbon development and strengthen resilience and adaptation to climate change and di - saster risk reduction.96 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT3.14. SDG 14 LIFE BELOW WATER SDG 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resour - ces for sustainable development. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustai - nable Development recognizes and highli - ghts the protection of life in water as a key area of sustainable development. 3.14.1. Context of Angola The Angolan coast concentrates 60% of the country's population and a large part of its infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, such as fishing, trade, transport networks, energy, and tourism potentials. The sea is one of the main sources of de - velopment and growth of the country's economy, but in relation to which there are divergent interests from various sectors, which can result in social discontent and conflicts. In coastal areas, artisanal fishing is impor - tant for the subsistence and employment of populations that have fishing as their basic source of food and well-being. The rise in the average sea level, the increase in the intensity of sea storms, and the as - sociated calamities due to the effects of climate change pose a serious threat to coastal communities, infrastructure, and socioeconomic activities in the marine and coastal territory. Angola has a coastline of 1,650 km in len - gth and a continental shelf of 51,000 km 2, with a width that varies between 10 and 100 km. The Angolan maritime coast has an enormous economic potential, being the source of 95% of the national foreign trade that passes through the sea, respon - sible for approximately 60% of the national Gross Domestic Product (40% of which from the oil industry), and supplier of inco - me from the fishing sector, salt production and sustainer of leisure and beach tou - rism. The Exclusive Economic Zone (ZEE) covers an area of 518,433 km 2, in which the state has sovereign rights for the purpo - ses of exploration, economic exploitation, conservation and management of the re - sources, both living and non-living, of the waters above the seabed and its subsoil. In this circumstance, the planning of mari - ne space, in a context of great diversity of divergent interests, is a strategic point for the sustainable development of the coun - try and for its regional integration. The so-called blue economy or economy of the sea is a concept that recognizes the importance of the sea, oceans, rivers and lakes in the economic growth of countries and recommends the use of their resour - ces in a sustainable and integrated man - ner. It is a new model that is not only limited to traditional maritime activities, but also encompasses activities that directly use the sea as an income factor. In Africa, the sectors and components of the Blue Eco - nomy today generate an average of USD 296 billion in income and 49 million jobs, and could reach USD 405 billion in income 97PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S and 57 million jobs by 2030, becoming a strategic sector for sustainable develop - ment. In Angola, it is possible to promote the blue economy as a strategic sector for sustainable development, but this requi - res major commitments and the introduc - tion of structural changes in the economy, based on the functioning of ecosystems. Angola's geographical location and the to - pography of its marine space, associated with the dynamics of the cold Benguela and warm currents coming from the equa - torial current, create favorable conditions for a very substantial marine and landsca - pe biodiversity. The entire coastal zone is characterized in general by a high bio - logical productivity. These two currents are separated by a thermal front, the Ben - guela Front, and their location impacts the migration pattern of living resources, especially species that move in the water columns. 119 INIPM/MINAGRIP (2021) Relat\u00f3rio ano 2021. Luanda: MINAGRIP.The rich hydrographic network of the Republic of Angola also provides coastal transition spaces (estuaries, mangroves, lagoons) rich in marine life, and high agri - cultural fertility. Recent assessments of the biological status of fishery resources indicate that the level of exploitation of species that are important for food secu - rity and exports are classified as overex - ploited (Cunene horse mackerel and some demersal fish species) or exploited at their biological limits (sardinellas and deep-wa - ter shrimp) 119. The main threats to the marine ecosys - tem and its biodiversity are related to in - formal settlements and urban and indus - trial pollution, the activities of the oil and gas sector, overfishing, and climate chan - ge. These threats also produce socio-eco - nomic impacts as they affect the environ - ment and its ecosystems, human health and safety, income generation, and social Photo by mrjn Photography on Unsplash98 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTvalues. In this century, plastic pollution is considered one of humanity's greatest challenges. Angola still has no legislation that prohibits and restricts the produc - tion and marketing of disposable plastics (bags, straws, cups, etc.), as do other Afri-can countries. 3.14.2.

Regarding the marine environ - ment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fi - sheries (MINAGRIP) is responsible for for - mulating and implementing the policy for fisheries and the sea, which is supervised by the National Institute of Fisheries and Marine Research (INIPM) that contributes in a decisive way to the sustainable ma - nagement of fisheries resources and con - servation of the aquatic ecosystem. The Institute for the Development of Arti - sanal Fisheries and Aquaculture and the National Inspection Service of Fisheries and Aquaculture have as their mission the assessment of fishery resources and environmental conditions in marine and continental waters based on scientific research. Other Ministries that have com - petence in the marine territory are the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Oil and Gas (MIREMPET), the Ministry of Public Works 99PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S and Spatial Planning (MINOPOT), the Minis - try of the Interior (MININT), the Ministry of National Defense and Homeland Veterans (MINDENVP) and the Ministry of Finance (MINFIN). The Republic of Angola participates in se - veral international conventions and legis - lative frameworks of relevance to the ma - rine territory, which still need to be stren - gthened at the national level. Besides the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD), the country is a party to the Abidjan Convention (for the protection and management of the West African coastline) and the Benguela Current Commission (BCC), which focuses on the promotion of a regional approach (Angola, Namibia and South Africa) for the conservation and sustainable exploi - tation of the Benguela Current Large Ma - rine Ecosystem. It also participates in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO), which has the mission to ensure the long-term conservation and sustai - nable use of all living marine resources in the South East Atlantic Ocean and to safeguard the environment and marine ecosystems. The Regional Commission for Fisheries in the Gulf of Guinea Region (COREP) aims to preserve and protect aquatic ecosystems, both in marine and inland waters, with the harmonization of policies and the legal fra - mework of member states. Angola is also a member of the Ministerial Conference on Fisheries Cooperation among the Afri - can States that share the Atlantic Ocean (COMHAFAT), which aims at the preserva - tion of fish resources and the sustaina - ble development of fishing activity in the region. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) which regulates the conservation and ma - nagement of a variety of Atlantic marine species, including tuna and tuna-like spe - cies (swordfish, marlin, and sharks). In conjunction with international instru - ments are Law 5/98, which defines the ba - sic concepts and principles for the protec - tion, preservation and conservation of the environment and the promotion of quality of life and the rational use of natural re - sources, as well as Law 6-A/04, (Law on Biological and Aquatic Resources, LRBA), which establishes the policies for the conservation and sustainable renewal of aquatic biological resources, in conjunc - tion with the provisions of the Benguela Current Convention and the National Bio - diversity Strategy and Action Plan. At the level of projects in this thematic area, we highlight the MARISMA Project on marine spatial planning and governance of the Benguela current, which includes An - gola, Namibia and South Africa; the Project of the activities planned for the creation of the marine conservation area in Angola (MCTA/UNDP , GEF-6); the Angola without Plastic Project; the TRIATLAS Project, funded by the European Union under the H2020 program and aimed at understan - ding the state of the marine ecosystem of the Southern and Tropical Atlantic and its future evolution for the sustainable mana - gement of human activities affecting the Atlantic Ocean; the Luanda Water Front Project - ecological assessment of Luan - da Bay, funded by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation and aimed at increasing knowledge about the ecologi - cal dynamics of Luanda Bay, environmen - tal and human health risks associated with the proliferation of harmful algae100 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTIn recent years, the Government of Ango - la, under the coordination of MINAGRIP , has been achieving significant progress in areas of interest for the sustainability of marine life. Within the scope of scien - tific research , in 2017 and 2019 the first samples were taken to determine eutro - phication indices along the coast of Ango - la. In the years 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020, occurrences of microalgae (Dinophyceae) blooms were recorded in Luanda Bay, as - sociated with water eutrophication pro - blems. On the same cruises, water sam - ples were also taken for the mapping of the main micro-plastic retention areas and more than 351 samples were also taken to determine ocean acidification. The sam - ples are being analyzed by the laborato - ries of the Norwegian Research Institute and INIPM. This information will provide indicators of marine carbonate system indices and ocean acidification parame - ters. As part of the National Commercial Fleet Sampling Program, micro-plastic fi - laments were identified in the stomachs of some commercially interesting species. Regarding marine spatial planning, at least seven Areas of Ecological or Biological Importance (AEBI) and one possible Ma - rine Conservation Area (MCA) were identi - fied. In this context, a national workshop was held in 2020, with the aim of validating the Marine Spatial Planning proposals and the report of the AEBIs. The AEBI report will be submitted to the Convention on Biodiversity (UNCBD) by the MCTA under a proposal from MINAGRIP . In order to guarantee the exploitation of fi - shing resources, a survey of the industrial and semi-industrial fishing fleet operating along the entire coast was carried out to better understand their operations, in or -der to adjust fishing capacity to the availa - bility of resources in the future, according to the FAO Code of Conduct for responsi - ble fishing. Under SDG 14, the balance between the economic potential of the sea, rivers and lakes and the exploitation of their resour - ces is the main objective to be achieved globally and specifically in Angola. The empowerment of women fish processors, for example, is one of the priorities of the strategy of the sub-sector of fishing and aquaculture, in that, on the one hand, it promotes the generation of income and, simultaneously, creates the conditions for the participation and management of the protection of marine life. One of the challenges in the country is the absence in the legal system of a policy for planning and managing the national mariti - me space, which makes it difficult to ensu - re the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of human activities at sea. There is also a high violation of laws and regulations rela - ted to activities that take place at sea. At the top of the list are illegal fishing, essen - tially by foreign vessels, followed by the destruction of submarine cables, fishing in prohibited areas, mainly near oil platforms, illegal immigration, which is also beginning to be felt by sea, and the transshipment of fuel and merchandise without authoriza - tion. Another constraint is the impacts of climate change , together with the pollu - tion of coastal waters, especially in bays and estuaries that concentrate high den - sities of population that generate a lot of household waste, creating an excess of organic matter and causing environmen - tal pollution through eutrophication and also by the disposal of plastic waste. The lack of sufficient funds to support scien -101PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S tific research is another major problem to make progress in the sustainable manage - ment of the maritime space. The preparation of the integrated policy for the sea, which is underway, will bring opportunities to improve coordination between institutions, prioritize activities, and better order the marine territory in or - der to support the sustainable, equitable, and efficient use of living and non-living resources. Artisanal fisheries and com - munity aquaculture are without a doubt a rapidly developing sub-sector, and the go - vernment's strategy is based on the pro - motion of small-scale aquaculture (at the communal level) as a source of family inco - me. In this context, a program was started, for example, to collect fish innards from all the beaches along the coast to produ - ce fish flour in an artisanal way, serving as an incentive to the development of this activity. The biological state of the main fishery re - sources demands that their exploitation be carried out in a preventive and sustai - nable manner, requiring the implemen - tation of management plans so that the abundance levels of the resources at risk are recovered. Additionally, the creation of marine protected areas is essential to conserve the marine heritage. The government, as a strategy, has already identified some areas along the coastline considered as potential reserves or pro - tection areas. Angola will also define an integrated strategy of the sea to avoid du - plication of efforts and conflicts of power and competencies between different ins - titutional instances, which aims to deter - mine guidelines regarding the sustainable and integrated management of human ac - tivities at sea, the preservation of habitats, the fragility of coastal ecosystems, ero - sion, and social and economic factors. The country will also continue with the compi - lation, analysis and evaluation of scientific data and the monitoring of indicators of marine ecosystem degradation factors. In general, there is a need for more re - search studies to be conducted to obtain more rigorous information to contribute to the adoption of future measures for the protection of maritime space and the im - plementation of monitoring programs for maritime areas. 102 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT3.15. SDG 15 LIFE ON LAND SDG 15 aims to protect, restore and pro - mote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage fo - rests, combat desertification, prevent and intervene in land degradation and halt the loss of biological diversity. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustai - nable Development recognizes that pro - tecting life on earth is a fundamental ele - ment of sustainable development. 3.15.1. Context of Angola The terrestrial ecosystems (forest, river and agricultural) of Angola provide food, income, employment and work directly to more than 90% of the population through agro-livestock activities, fishing and aqua - culture, hunting and forest exploitation. The country has 66.6 million hectares of fo - rests and 58 million hectares of arable land. However, with a population growth rate of 3.5% according to INE and an urbanization 120 UN-Habitat (2019) HABITAT-MINOTH Country Programme Document for the Sustainable Urban Development of A ngola .

Washington, DC: World Bank.rate of 4.5%120, the demographic transfor - mation of the country and associated hu - man activities significantly affect land use and land transformation, leading, among others, to human-animal conflicts, defo - restation and soil degradation, increased vulnerability to natural disasters, and the extinction of species and loss of biodi - versity. Although a comprehensive legal framework exists in the country, environ - mental education and awareness are still generally very fragile, and the resources allocated to environmental management and biodiversity conservation are still una - ble to meet the various needs to achieve adequate and sustainable use. Despite the pressures exerted on rural li- velihoods - gathering firewood, deforesta - tion for charcoal production, and extension of agricultural areas or hunting for family consumption - and extractive industries (diamonds, gold, and others), the coun - try has wildlife and floristic resources of high ecological and commercial interest. The sustainable management of renewa - ble natural resources found in terrestrial ecosystems such as forests has great po - tential to contribute to the diversification of the economy and can potentially lead to job creation and income generation at the national and local levels 121. The expected transition from an oil eco - nomy to a more diversified economy is marked by the launch of programs like PRODESI (Program of Support to Produc - tion, Export Diversification and Import Substitution) or PIAAF (Integrated Plan for Acceleration of Family Agriculture and Fi -103PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S shing). These programs, while represen - ting a necessity for the socio-economic development of the country, put even more pressure on the management of natural resources, fauna, flora and soils. However, the sustainable exploitation of forests and conservation areas is not yet developed, with many cases of uncontrolled, irrespon - sible, or illegal exploitation. The valuation of Angola's natural capital and the contri-bution of forests, conservation areas and wildlife protection to the national and local economy is also not well documented due to lack of data and information. Studies conducted by the World Bank indi - cate that the timber sector could reach an export value of USD 240 million by 2028 (up to 1.5% of the export balance) and further indicate that the nature-based tourism sub-sector is a cornerstone of tourism de - velopment in Angola, given the country's unique landscape, biodiversity and coastal zones and protected areas 122. The Republic of Angola has one of the ri - chest biodiversity on the African conti - nent. From the humid tropical forests of the southern province of Cabinda to the arid lands and deserts of the southern pro - vinces, Angola is composed of a mosaic of ecosystems - seven biomes, 15 eco-re - gions and 32 types of vegetation - namely, 5,000 species of plants (of which 1,260 are endemic) 123, 300 species of fauna and 940 recorded types of birds124. 122 Ditto. 123 Santos, M.

These areas protect emblematic species of the national flora and fauna such as Welwitschia mirabilis , the mountain ze - bra ( variani ), among others. However, terrestrial ecosys - tems face serious direct threats that inclu - de deforestation for subsistence shifting agriculture, uncontrolled logging for char - coal production and other purposes; poa - ching for commercial purposes; forest bur - ning for shifting agriculture, mining, and oil prospecting; and indirect threats , such as the lack of carrying out activities aimed at sustainable management of lands, forests, wetlands, and CA, as well as poverty affec - ting much of the rural population, unemplo - yment, and institutional weakness in imple - menting the specific legislation in place 125. Forests promote soil formation and pro - tection, protect freshwater resources, provide nutrient storage and recycling, help build resilience and combat climate change, pests and pests, and are also the livelihood of much of Angola's rural popu - lation. Angola is the fourth country in the world with the greatest net annual forest loss (difference between forest created and destroyed) in the last decade, losing 555.000 hectares on average every year 126.

Angola has established commitments to delimit 17% of its land surface as biodiver - sity conservation and protection area by 2025. Angola has also set a land-neutral degradation target to reduce steep land degradation to 50% from the 2015 baseli - ne 128. In 2018, actions to set national land neutral degradation (LDN) targets were 106 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTalso implemented. Other actions initia - ted in that year include the preparation of the Macro-Fauna inventory; the gran - ting of Conservation Area status to three new areas; the strengthening of the ma - nagement structures of National Parks; the restructuring of current Conservation Areas, analyzing their typology, conser - vation category, boundaries and mana - gement strategy; the updating of existing legislation on conservation areas and bio - diversity protection; the prevention and monitoring of wildfires; the process of fi - nancial autonomy of Conservation Areas based on ecotourism The country has made significant progress in terms of the legal framework for its te - rrestrial biodiversity with the finalization of 129Angola's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP , 2019-2020), the signing and ratification of the Ramsar Con - vention (on wetlands) in February 2021, and in terms of attracting financial resources to support the management of the strategy. The government has identified 11 wetlands of particular conservation interest (one be - ing already under protection within the Ca - meia national park). The process of identif - ying new environmental conservation areas (Serra do do M\u00f4co, Floresta da Cumbira, Lagoa do Carumbo, and the creation of the first marine conservation area), and upgrading existing ones is also underway. Since 2016, the effective imple - mentation of the Convention on Interna - tional Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) has begun, with several seizures of wildlife specimens obtained illegally for the purpose of being traded: elephants, pangolins, alligators, 129 MINAMB (2018) National Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity, NBSAP 2019-2025. Luanda: Ministry of En vironment.leopard, among the animals, and Cabinda wood among forest species. Some progress has been made in relation to sustainable forest management and the fight against land degradation and deser - tification. The charcoal value chains pro - ject funded by GEF is being implemented in small communities in Kwanza Sul (San - ga and Quibala), and in Huambo some sus - tainable forest management activities are being developed with the support of ADPP , COSPE and UJES, such as selective logging promotion of natural regeneration by sta - king, fostering the creation of forest nur - series and tree planting, use of improved charcoal kilns and more efficient charcoal cook stoves, participatory forest invento - ries and community enforcement to control burning, or environmental education in rural schools. FAO/MCTA/MINAGRIP are also im - plementing actions related to sustainable land and forest management to increase vegetation cover, through the integration of these issues in government plans and the elaboration of integrated and participatory land use plans, where sustainable land and forest management practices are well defi - ned and practical application is done throu - gh the field schools (ECAS), present in the country for more than 15 years. The merger, in April 2020, of the Minis - tries of Environment, Culture, and Tou - rism creates an opportunity for greater synergies for the development of an eco - nomic and cultural sector, ecotourism or nature-based tourism, that promotes the conservation of natural ecosystems while generating local employment and sustai - nable economic development, which con - tributes to the diversification of the Ango -107PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S lan economy. At the national level, the in - tegration of the Ramsar Convention opens the door to the creation of mechanisms to better protect wetlands , key ecosystems for both adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and the source of unique biodiversity, such as mangroves. On the other hand, the process of identifying new environmental conservation areas is un - derway - Serra do Lagoa do Carumbo, and the creation of the first marine con - servation area - and the requalification of existing ones, which may increase or redu - ce the proportion of these areas in relation to the national territory. The process of government decentralization and muni- cipalities, expected to be implemented in the next few years, offers an opportunity to strengthen institutional capacities for the protection and conservation of natu - ral spaces and biodiversity, whenever the mayors are able to take practical control of the areas under their jurisdiction. The re - form of the education sector and the pre -paration of the National Strategy for En - vironmental Education (2020-2025) offer opportunities to improve the knowledge and sensitivity of Angolan society regar - ding biodiversity conservation and sustai - nable management of natural resources. Despite the advances, there are still se - veral areas that need greater impetus. In Angola, it is necessary to invest in quality civic and scientific environmental edu - cation in order to ensure the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve the SDG targets on biodiversity conservation and sustainable and responsible manage - ment of natural resources. It is necessary to train local populations in rural schools in the correct use of the natural resour - ces at their disposal. Training in adapted technologies is of paramount importance, countering, for example, the current trend of promoting agriculture using high-cost, high-maintenance tractors right from the start. Photo by Eryxson Fonseca on Unsplash108 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTIt was also necessary to strengthen the studies and actions for the reduction of environmental degradation (deforestation and land degradation), in order to achieve the goals already defined. It would also be important to promote the participation of scientists and academia at a national le - vel, as well as civil society organizations to be part of working committees that are related to biodiversity and conservation areas. On the other hand, there is a need to create programs for greater direct and indirect involvement of the communities that depend directly on the ecological ser - vices in the conservation areas. Angola also needs a more efficient application of the already existing legal instruments and policies that guarantee the protection of biodiversity, as well as provide more effi - cient monitoring. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pan - demic and the risk of further zoonotic outbreaks, the international community has elevated biodiversity conservation to the same level of urgency as the respon - se to climate change. Thus, the increase in funds available for this purpose can be expected. Regarding neutral land degra - dation, for the next few years it is expec - ted to achieve in the country the goals of restoring 50% of ecosystems currently degraded by irregular land use practices; increasing the Soil Organic Carbon content to 30% in all land classes; a contribution to halving (0.4%) the current rate of defores - tation throughout the country; the stren - gthening of information and awareness about good practices in land use, including those related to sustainable agricultu - re-conservation for 80% of rural families; the increase in 30% of water availability in the needy areas of the transhumance triangle (Cunene, Hu\u00edla and Namibe); the reduction in 25% of livestock in areas of strong tradition of concentrated livestock production. With regard to conservation areas , the following actions are expected to be ca - rried out: (i) preparation of the Macro-Fau - na inventory; (ii) granting of Conservation Area status to three new areas; (vi) stren - gthening of the management structures of the National Parks; (iii) restructuring of the current Conservation Areas, analyzing their typology, conservation category, boundaries and management strategy; (iv) updating the existing legislation on con - servation areas and the protection of Bio - diversity; (v) prevention and monitoring of wildfires; (vi) the process of financial auto - nomy of the Conservation Areas based on Eco-tourism; (vii) the process of creating the first marine conservation area; (viii) strengthening the management structu - res of the National Parks. In terms of fo - rests , it is hoped to develop a strategic sustainable charcoal policy that will help promote sustainable forest management and attract more attention and investment to the sector. In a global way and in view of SDG 15, more coordination and integration would be desirable, through, for example, a joint program between MCTA and MINAGRIP of reforestation for forest recovery and pre - vention. Another initiative is to encourage citrus plantations that not only have nu - tritional importance but also protect ve - getation. In order to ensure ownership of the values of protecting terrestrial life, it is also desirable that sufficient and well-de - fined areas are allocated to local residents so that they are valued and managed by the population in a sustainable manner. 109PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.16. SDG 16 PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS SDG 16 aims to promote peaceful and in - clusive societies for sustainable deve - lopment, facilitate access to justice for all, and build at all levels effective and inclusive institutions that are accounta - ble. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that peace, justice and effective institu - tions are indispensable requirements for sustainable development. The Agenda recognizes the need to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable de - velopment, to provide access to justice for all and to build and consolidate effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. 3.16.1. Angola's Context Angola achieved effective peace in 2002, after decades of war - from 1961 to 1974 against the Portuguese colonial power and, after 1975, a destructive civil war. Currently, although there are some move - ments of political and social contestation, also due to the increase of the population's civic conscience, it has been 19 years of political stability, with no recourse to ar - med violence. The country is multi-ethnic and its reli - gious culture is largely shaped by Roman Catholicism as the predominant religion and by a variety of religious orientations and practices, which calls for the esta - blishment of institutions and provisions that integrate this diversity and promote its coexistence. In Angola, customary law is in use and remains influential in various communities, which calls for constant ar - ticulation between traditional and rule of law systems in various aspects of people's lives. Especially since the end of the civil war, Angola is investing in increasing partici-pation of the population and the various sectors in public policies. The government launched, in March 2021, the Participa - tory Budget, a mechanism that aims to allow citizens to become directly involved in the management of public finances at the local level through the Municipal Bu - dget. This is an important advance in the sense that it will allow citizens to freely de - fine their local priorities and projects and to participate in the definition of priorities of local governments or administrations. On the other hand, the National Assembly of Angola took the initiative to host, in Fe - bruary 2021, the Seminar on Gender Bud - get Analysis and Monitoring, which aimed to promote the continuous process of in - formation production, knowledge building and implementation of methodological practices for the promotion of gender equality, through governance and demo - cratic consolidation mechanisms, using Gender Budgeting as a vehicle. Regarding the institutions necessary for better justice, Angola has the Ombuds -110 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTman, whose statute (updated in 2020) is in accordance with the Paris Principles, with only the conclusion of the accreditation process still pending. Angola is also part of several international alliances of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs). Several other initiatives have been registered to promote better systems and institutions. In 2021, the Virtual Parlatory was crea - ted, a technological solution to mitigate communication barriers between priso - ners and their families, relatives, friends, magistrates and lawyers, contributing to the mitigation and prevention of COVID-19 contamination in prisons and to safeguard the promotion of the Human Rights of pri - soners in prison services. Both MININT and the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (MJDH) have not recorded any cases of murder, kidnapping, enforced disappea - rance, arbitrary detention or torture of journalists , media personnel, trade unio - nists and human rights defenders in re - cent years. According to MASFAMU and MININT, the situations related to violence and safety (and the feeling of safety) have been im - proving, with paternal running away, ex - ploitation of child labor, and neglect now being the main forms of violence against children 130. 65% of the country's popula - tion feels safe walking alone in the area where they live 131. The registered number of victims of human trafficking has been decreasing, according to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (MJDH). 2020 was the sixth consecutive year of ne - gative economic growth, largely due to the 130 MASFAMU (2020) Administrative data, 2020. 13 1 IN E (2020) Quick Information Sheet, Angola Employment Survey (II Quarter 2020).

In 2018-2019, one in two Angolans (47.6%) lived below the international pover - ty line of USD 1.90 per day. Furthermore, in 2015-2016 about 54% of the population li - ved in multidimensional poverty according to the Angola Multidimensional Poverty Index (IPM-A) 132. These crises pose cha - llenges to peace and stability, the consoli - dation of justice systems and institutions, particularly in the area of human rights. On the justice front, and in relation to An - gola's illicit financial outflows , these were as high as 3.9% of GDP (2013-2015 avera - ge), which is in the lower range of capital flight compared to African countries (whe - re the average is 10%). In US dollars, capi - tal outflow was USD 4.9 billion per year in that period. During the period from 1986 to 2015, the total capital flight was USD 63.7 billion 133. Illicit financial flows related to commodity trade reached USD 1.7 bi - llion in 2018, equivalent to 1.5% of GDP . It is concluded that illicit financial flows vary strongly over time and that due to trade re - gistration practices (e.g. oil transported by pipelines), it is extremely difficult to detect them from trade statistics. Angola has, however, invested heavily in fighting corruption and capital outflows from the country (and the recovery of funds abroad), strengthening national ins - titutions and international collaboration in this area. Birth registrations also marked a signifi - cant increase between 2015 and 2019, with 111PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S the percentage of children under the age of five whose births were registered with a civil authority 134 rising from 25% to 28.3%. In the field of peacekeeping, stability, and justice, Angola is committed to greater equality in the distribution of natural re - sources, while supporting environmental and climate justice initiatives. 134 INE (2019) Final Report of the Survey on Expenditure and Revenue .

During the last 10 years, Angola has promo - ted a process of reform of the justice sys - tem , with emphasis on the approval of the new Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in 2019 to replace the code of 1892. In 2017, Angola held its fourth electoral pro - cess and the new government has taken a 112 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTnew political course, with a renewed com - mitment to democracy, the rule of law, and human rights, and has adopted as its flags - hip policy the fight against corruption, state reform, political and administrative decentralization, economic diversification and expansion of the private sector, and closer cooperation between the govern - ment and civil society. For the fight against corruption , the laws on the repatriation of illicitly acquired as - sets - both pecuniary and immovable (Law 9/18 on voluntary repatriation and Law 15/18 on coercive repatriation) - followed by asset recovery actions leading to the ongoing criminal prosecutions, anti-co - rruption moral campaigns, as well as the development of strategic plans and ac - tions have been passed. Several entities are engaged in the country's anti-corrup - tion action. The Attorney General's Office (PGR), in conjunction with the Criminal In - vestigation Services (SIC), leads the crimi-nal component, focused mainly on asset recovery action through the National As - set Recovery Office (SENRA). The General Inspection of State Adminis - tration (IGAE) acts in the fiscal, audit and monitoring components with a strong preventive approach. The Financial Infor - mation Unit (UIF) of the National Bank of Angola (BNA) has been a reference for the various other institutions in tracking va - lues. The High Level Working Group, for - med by the President of the Republic in 2019 (Presidential Decree 176/19), led by the Minister of State and head of the Civil House, with co-leadership from the Mi - nistry of Justice and Human Rights, is the entity responsible for the overall anti-co - rruption strategy. The Group also involves the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Foreign Affairs and Finance, the President's Se - cretary for Diplomatic Affairs, the Presi - dent's Secretary for Judicial Affairs, IAGE and UIF . The Group has overall leadership on the anti-corruption strategy, including the implementation of the United Nations Ministry of Economy and Planning of Angola113PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the establishment of an independent an - ti-corruption body, and the development of a national anti-corruption risk preven - tion plan. There is a growing recognition of the role of civil society demonstrated for example by regular presidential press conferences with journalists from all political spec - trums; presidential forums with youth and NGO groups; the creation of the Social and Economic Council composed of 45 civil society members to advise the President on economic, social, and political mat - ters; presidential tributes to civil and po - litical activists once considered persona non-grata ; and the increasing openness of political space and press freedom. In the 2020 Mo-Ibrahim Index of good go - vernance, Angola ranked among the eight countries with the most improvements in governance in the 2010-2019 period, which has a strong correlation with the politi-cal commitments of the new government elected in 2017, with a new President of the Republic after 38 years. In 2019, Angola ratified the three major UN human rights treaties that were pending, becoming a signatory to eight of the nine major treaties, and also held its third Uni - versal Periodic Review in November of the same year. Likewise, it launched the Na - tional Human Rights Strategy 2019-2025 that elevates the issue of human rights to a national security matter. The 2020 Human Rights Watch Report concluded that in the past year Angola's political and civil rights environment had become less restrictive, that the courts appeared to operate wi - thout political interference, and that the country improved 25 places in the global rankings from 170th to 145th. In June 2020, the SOS Crian\u00e7a 15015 hot - line was activated in partnership with the National Children's Institute (INAC), as an accessible mechanism for reporting ca - ses of violence against children, also in response to recommendations related to 114 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTthe Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) addressed to the Government of Angola. There was an immediate accep - tance of this new hotline service. On the other hand, Standard Operational Child Protection Procedures were developed to highlight the roles and responsibilities of each of the sectors that intervene in the response to Child Protection. These were approved in the first half of 2020 by the Joint Executive Decree signed by five Ministries - Justice, Interior, Social Affairs, Health and Education. This is a milestone in the government's efforts and commitment to promote the provi - sion of child-friendly services and break the cycle of violence against children in the Angolan society. In the same vein, considering that 66% of the Angolan population is under 25 years old and 50% of the Angolan population has access to mobile phones, in Decem - ber 2020 the Ministry of Youth and Sports launched the SMS Jovem youth enga - gement platform. The platform offers a means for greater participation by young people and access to a forum where young people not only express their con - cerns, but also seek help and services, with the aim of improving access to qua - lity services. The platform plans to reach 30,000 users in 2021. The country has consistently ranked low on the Human Development Index , and while there has been progress in educa - tion, gross national income per capita, and average life expectancy, the country continues to be affected by inequality, underdevelopment in key sectors, and is - sues of transparency and accountability in the management of public goods. Angola's social indicators demonstrate significant development challenges. More recently, with the fall in oil prices, the country has experienced an economic recession, exa - cerbated by the pandemic of COVID-19, in a context where social protection is already significantly limited. Given the country's recent past, there is still limited capacity in terms of quantity and quality of human rights institutions and law enforcement services (the police, for example) to promote and protect hu - man rights. This is particularly relevant to the legal right to demonstrate (the 1991 law remains ambiguous), human rights advo - cacy and mediation mechanisms, use of force, detention, gender and sexual orien - tation rights, persons with disabilities, and accountability. Socio-economic rights remain a sour - ce of potential social instability, and have been behind many demonstrations over the past two years, most notably concerns about employment, housing, basic servi - ces, inequality, and the right to participate in local governance processes through the realization of local government. 115PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S 3.17. SDG 17 PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS SDG 16 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize internatio - nal partnership for sustainable develop - ment. The Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the importance of partnerships at various levels to achieve sustainable development. 3.17.1. Angola's Context Angola belongs to the group of countries that have inter-ministerial and sectoral de - velopment aid coordination processes in place to eliminate fragmented approaches and align donor approaches. The degree to which donors align new interventions with national priorities in Angola is high at 94%, mainly in relation to institutional or mi-nisterial plans, but also shows that some room for further alignment 135 remains. While Angola's national economy is expe - riencing restraint caused by the impacts of the global pandemic and related cons - traints, ODA received by the country has 135 UNCTAD (2019) The Least Developed Countries Report 2019: the present and future of external development fi nance - old dependence, new challenges. Geneva: UNCTAD. reduced significantly. Total ODA origina - ting from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries was 0.300% of the GDP of DAC countries in 2019 (0.310% in 2018). LDCs as a group received a total of USD 28,893,114 million (current prices) in 2019, up from USD 25,658,095 million received in 2015. However, for Angola, the evolution of ODA revenues has been nega - tive. In 2019, Angola collected USD 94,984 million (current prices), compared to the USD 318,677 million received in 2015. Funds directed to LDCs through South-South cooperation (ODA allocated by non-DAC countries) in 2019 totaled USD 3,383,623 million (current prices), with Angola recei - ving USD 0.733 million in the same year. Also Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) shows a negative trend, particularly in the oil sector, giving new impetus to the gover - nment's efforts to diversify the economy. According to the National Bank of Angola, the balance of foreign direct investment was negative, -4,098.5 M USD in 2019 and -1,866.5 in 2020. Nevertheless, the non-oil sector balance was positive, USD 640.9 M in 2019 and USD 113.4 M in 2020. In 2019, the net FDI inflow as a percentage of GDP was -4.615%, much lower than the 8.631% in 2015. Personal remittances play a limited role in Angola's revenues. In 2019, Angola recei - ved remittances corresponding to 0.004% of its GDP , following a similarly low trend for at least a decade, in which even the peak recorded in 2008 remained low, ac - counting for 0.093% of GDP . Angola's integration into the global eco - nomy remains limited, as is the case for LDCs in general. In 2019, Angola's share of global merchandise trade was 0.18%, whi - le the share of LDCs as a group represen - ted 1.01% and that of developing econo - mies (excluding LDCs) represented 44.16%. For 2020, the corresponding figures indi - cate 0.12% for Angola, 0.98% for LDCs and 44.86% for developing economies (exclu - ding LDCs). In 2019, the weighted average applied ta- riff for Angola was 6.52%. As Angola's mer - chandise exports continue to be heavily oil-based (93% in 2019), the product-based weighted average does not provide a com - plete picture of the overall applied tariffs. However, Angola continues to benefit from duty-free and quota-free treatment as an LDC, for example, when exporting to the European Union under the Everything but Arms agreement. The importance of strategic partnerships is also highlighted, namely through mul - tilateral environmental agreements and their implementation to address global environmental problems such as climate change, pollution of the seas, illegal tra - fficking of wildlife species, illegal defores - tation and illegal fishing, contamination by toxic and hazardous waste, among others. 3.17.2.

However, MIREX, MINCO, MINFIN and MEP play a particularly prominent role. In terms of the country's alignment to both globally relevant data collection and information modalities and specifically oriented towards monitoring the SDGs, Angola has in recent years developed a number of relevant legislation and provi - sions in the area of statistics . Presiden -tial Decree 27/17 approved the Organic Statute of the National Institute of Sta - tistics and Presidential Decree 28/17, the Regulation of Official Statistical Activity and Direct and Coercive Data Collection. In addition to significant work and pro - ductions over the years, INE Angola has a five-year cooperation project funded by the World Bank. Population census as well as civil regis - tries have also seen major improvements in recent years. Angola held the first po - pulation census since the country's in -117PROGRESS I N IMP LEMENTING T HE S DG S dependence in 2014 (General Census of Population and Housing, RGPH 2014. Cu - rrently, the process of massification of the Civil Registry and attribution of the Identi - ty Card is underway, with 2,179,313 regis - trations having already been made in the period from November 2019 to December 2020 136. Angola continues its efforts to stabilize its tax and tax collection systems. According to MINFIN, total government revenue as a proportion of GDP decreased slightly, from 21.5% (2019) to 20.8% (2020). The domestic budget financed by national taxes accoun - ted for 65% in 2017. In terms of net official development assistance , here too the country recor - ded a significant decrease between 2015 (USD 318.677 million) and 2019 (94.984 million, current prices) 137. Along with the aforementioned significant decline in foreign direct investment, Angola is currently in a position of fragility in rela - tion to external partnerships to support development. 136 MJDH, administrative data, 2020. 137 O ECD Creditor Reporting System Insertion in the global economy and com - petitiveness still lacks greater investment and support towards digitalization, Inter - net access, and the development, trans - fer, dissemination, and diffusion of envi - ronmentally safe technologies . At the regional level, the opportunities opened up by the realization of the AfCFTA can translate into gains for participation in the regional economy as well as in global exports. The coherence and efficiency of global development monitoring systems needs greater efforts to produce economic data (such as tools like the Macroeconomic Dashboard/Macroeconomic Dashboard), to improve mechanisms to verify policy coherence for sustainable development, to extend the use of results frameworks and planning tools developed by countries themselves in development cooperation, or to continue the substantial investments already made in statistical capacity for systematic and effective monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals. 119CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS In an economic context with many cha - llenges posed by the fall in the price of oil, the resource on which the country's economy is based, the dependence of a large part of the families on the infor - mal economy with the precariousness associated with this, the prevalence of poverty and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Angola is investing in rever - sing these negative aspects. At the so - cial level, the country has been inves - ting in sectors and policies that allow it to counter the trends of poverty and the negative indicators of human de - velopment, namely at the level of basic conditions of health, education, access to energy and water, and at the level of social and gender inequalities. In the en - vironment area, Angola's policies are ba - sed on the guidelines of the SDGs, aiming to address climate change and disaster risks in a sustainable way. The development of the VNR is an oppor - tunity to reflect on the best ways to im - prove statistical information and data on development and thus develop strong and efficient systems on an ongoing basis. As a result of the groups' research and analysis of the indicators, both the availa - bility and quality of data and the progress towards the SDGs in Angola are still, on the whole, far from what is desired for the country. The main success factors for the indica - tors, especially in the areas of Education, Health, Gender Equality, Social Protection, Justice and Human Rights, and Environ - ment are related to the investments made in these areas, not only through budget allocations but also through assertive pro - grams and policies. As for the factors of failure , we highlight the mentioned incomplete progress in the production, compilation and analysis of data specifically oriented to the SDGs. Regarding the Goals that need more at - tention, we highlight those related to the Economy and Employment, to the sustai - nability of Industry and Innovation, to ac - cess to clean and sustainable Energy and Water, to better Cities and Communities, and to the consolidation and expansion of Partnerships that sustain the successes already achieved.04 120Figure 9 C urrent status of indicators per SDG Total number of indicatorsIndicators for AngolaIn % SDG 1 13 12 92 SDG 2 14 9 64 SDG 3 28 22 79 SDG 4 12 11 92 SDG 5 14 9 64 SDG 6 11 9 82 SDG 7 6 6 100 SDG 8 16 16 100 SDG 9 12 10 83 SDG 10 14 8 57 SDG 11 14 8 57 SDG 12 13 9 6 9 SDG 13 8 7 89 SDG 14 10 10 100 SDG 15 14 13 93 SDG 16 24 16 67 SDG 17 25 15 60 Total 247138190 77 As for the public policy environment , the Angolan government, through its NDP 2018-2022 responded to the SDGs in an integrated way, identifying in its prioriti - zation areas the relationships with Agenda 2030 and Agenda 2063. Given the inter - connected and indivisible nature of the SDGs, these are evident in various and multiple areas of the NDP . The principle of \"leaving no one behind\" is also present to some extent in the NDP , particularly with regard to concerns about gender equality 138 Includes repeated. and the creation of better living conditions for Angolans. The main good practices and lessons learned refer to the development and im - plementation of comprehensive programs in the areas of economics ( PRODESI ), lo - cal development (PIIM) transfers ( Kwenda and Valor Crian\u00e7a ). Also the policy and institutions for gender equality have shown that the country is able to sustainably proceed in improving the basis for greater gender equality. The main emerging challenge is the im - pact that COVID-19 will undoubtedly bring to the national economy, especially with regard to the most vulnerable and de - pendent on the informal economy. On the other hand, the pandemic also has very significant impacts on health systems, in - frastructure, and conditions in the coun - try, requiring additional efforts to improve them. In the economic area, Angola faces major challenges in reducing dependence on oil, diversifying, and increasing emplo - yment, especially for youth and the popu - lation that depends on the informal eco - nomy. There is still a need to extend basic services , most notably access to health and quality education, water, energy and sanitation infrastructure, and the develo - pment of sustainable cities. Angola continues to face the challenge of combating multidimensional poverty and hunger and ensuring the protection of the most vulnerable. Economic and social in - equalities are in turn reflected even more strongly in environmental imbalances, with climate change likely to significantly 121weaken economic progress and exacerba - te inequalities. In the context of the environment, clima - te change , disaster risk reduction, envi - ronmental degradation and biodiversity, Angola is exposed to an increase in pro - ductive insecurity, especially for small rural producers, with consequences for increased food insecurity. Droughts and the effects of El Ni\u00f1o in the south of the country as well as environmental degrada - tion in the cities are trends to be taken into account that have a very direct influence on the country's sustainable development possibilities. In all the areas identified, the scarcity of data that allows a follow-up of the evolution as well as of the areas whe - re more investment is needed is one of the gaps that the country should be able to fill, preferably as soon as possible. This work is particularly important also for the pre - paration of the next VNR. With regard to the resources needed to implement the 2030 Agenda , the pre - paration of the future NDP 2023-2027 is an opportunity to align recovery plans with the 2018-2022 NDP programs and the SGB . It also allows for the identifica - tion of what funding is needed and what the contributions from the private sec - tor and international cooperation can be. The decentralization process is also an opportunity for collecting, analyzing and publishing SDG data at the provincial and municipal levels and for strengthening ca - pacities and processes for this purpose. The government restructuring process is also important for defining institutions responsible for monitoring indicators and compiling information, as well as for esta - blishing processes for publishing annual reports from the various ministries and/or departments. In terms of the Angolan statistical system , there remains a need to improve alignment with the 2030 Agen - da and to study how to harmonize the sys - tems for collecting, compiling and sharing data from the different sectors. Allied to this, the designation of entities and ser - vices responsible for the management of this information is an important step to eli - minate duplication of efforts. To this end, it will be necessary to improve data mana - gement capabilities as well as technologi - cal bases. Ongoing training and the deve - lopment of integrated systems shared by the sectors are fundamental foundations to be consolidated. 122ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS139 139 Original acronyms and abbreviations in Portuguese used.
