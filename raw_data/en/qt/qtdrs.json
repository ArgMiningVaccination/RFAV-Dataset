It's important to understand what cancer is, so you can better understand your options and make decisions about your treatment. Our body is made up of many cells. Healthy cells follow the \"rules\" when they divide and they know when to die. Cancer happens when cells start to grow out of control. When these cells grow and divide, they can form a lump called a tumour. Not all tumours are cancer. Some are non-cancerous (also called benign ). It might help to use the example of a garden: Cancer cellsGood cellsA Healthy Body Imagine your body as a garden. The soil is your immune system, the good plants are your good cells, and the weeds are the cancer cells. When you're healthy, the good plants grow and the soil helps keep the weeds away. When the odd weed starts to grow, the body is able to get rid of it by itself. Cancer cellsGood cells A Body with Cancer Cancer cells are like weeds in your garden. Sometimes the body cannot get rid of the weeds and needs help. There are many different types of cancer treatments including: systemic treatment, radiation treatment, surgery and stem cell transplant. There are different books for different treatments. A Healthy cells dividing: Find out about all types of cancer treatment in the Newly Diagnosed With Cancer BookManage Your Cancer Care 01 Newly Diagnosed with Cancer: Information and Resources to Help Patients and Families Be Active in their Cancer Care General Information Living Your Best Life With and Beyond CancerNormal CellsCancer Cells Image \u00a9 Alberta Health ServicesImage \u00a9 Alberta Health ServicesJust Diagnosed 2 Radiation Treatment General Information What is radiation treatment? It is a cancer treatment that: Uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours. Treats many types of cancer as well as some conditions that are non-cancerous. Can be used alone or combined with other treatments such as surgery, or chemotherapy. Cancer cellsGood cellsRadiation Treatment Radiation treatment is like increasing the power of the sun with a magnifying glass and aiming it at the weeds. The goal is to damage the weeds in order to get rid of them, or prevent them from growing or making new weeds. Sometimes other healthy plants nearby might get damaged as well. How is radiation treatment given? External Beam (most common): The radiation is produced by a machine and aimed at the tumour, so the radiation source comes from outside of the body. (page 5 )Internal Radiation : The radioactive source is placed inside the body, either inside the tumour, or close to it. This is called brachytherapy. (page 6 )B When radiation passes through our bodies to kill cancer cells, it also causes damage to nearby healthy cells. Healthy cells are usually able to repair the damage from the radiation. The damage done to the healthy cells is what causes side effects (see more on page 14). How is Radiation Treatment Given? www.cancercarealberta.ca > Patients and Families > In Treatment > Radiation Image \u00a9 Alberta Health Services3 Just Diagnosed What are the goals of radiation treatment? The goals of treatment are different for everyone, and can change over time. Possible goals of treatment are to: Become cancer-free \u2014 to get rid of the cancer from your body Control cancer growth \u2014 to stop the cancer from growing and spreading to other parts of your body Relieve or reduce symptoms that the cancer may cause such as pain, bleeding, or shortness of breath How does my healthcare team decide what treatment they should recommend for me? It depends on the type of cancer you have and where it is in your body. Research has shown us which treatments work best for which cancer. Other things we consider include: Your overall health If you've had radiation treatment before Your concerns and wishes How much radiation will I get and how many treatments? Your cancer doctor (Radiation Oncologist) will decide on a total dose (total amount) of radiation for you. Usually the total dose is divided so you only get a part of it each treatment (called fractions). The Oncologist will also decide over how many day(s) you will get this radiation treatment. The total dose and number of treatments depends on: Your type of cancer: Some cancers are more sensitive to radiation and need less radiation to kill the cancer cells, while other cancers might need more. The treatment goal: If the goal of treatment is to get rid of the cancer, the radiation amount will likely be greater than if the goal is to control the cancer, or to relieve symptoms. Where the cancer is in your body:The Radiation Oncologist will prescribe the total tumour dose based on a number of factors such as the type of cells in the treatment area (pathology), stage of the cancer and your physical health. Just Diagnosed 4 Where can I have my radiation treatment? This depends on where you live and the type of cancer you have. It is offered at the: Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton Central Alberta Cancer Centre in Red Deer Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary Jack Ady Cancer Centre in Lethbridge Grande Prairie Cancer Centre in Grande Prairie Some kinds of radiation treatment are only available in Edmonton or Calgary. Sometimes people who live out of town choose to have their radiation treatments in a city where they have friends or family to stay with. If you live out of town and do not have a place to stay, talk to your healthcare team to find out what your options are. Who is part of my healthcare team? Here are some of the people who play a role in your care: Clerk \u2014 will schedule your appointments Medical Physicist \u2014 checks your treatment plan Nurses \u2014 may teach you about cancer, tests, treatments and help you manage symptoms Radiation Oncologist (cancer doctor for radiation treatment) \u2014 prescribes your treatment and helps you manage your side effects Radiation Therapists \u2014 see you when you come for treatment, give you your CT Simulation, calculate and plan your treatment, deliver your radiation treatment, and help you manage side effects Supportive Care Specialists \u2014 such as dietitians and counsellors Radiation T reatment Cancer CentresAlberta Health Services Cancer Care Centres Edmonton - Cross Cancer Institute Red Deer - Central Alberta Cancer Centre Calgary - T om Baker Cancer Centre Lethbridge - Jack Ady Cancer Centre Grande Prairie - Grande Prairie Cancer CentreGrande Prairie Cancer Centre Coming Soon5 Just Diagnosed External Beam Radiation Treatment External beam is the most common type of radiation treatment, but there a few different types of machines. Linear Accelerator (or Linac) Most common type of treatment machine Rotates around you while you lie down in your treatment position Can treat any part of the body Used to treat cancer and non-cancerous conditions Radio-surgery Provides \"surgery\" to treat the brain using special radiation machines. Available in Edmonton at the University of Alberta Hospital using a Gamma Knife machine. Available in Calgary at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre using a specialized Linac machine.Orthovoltage Uses low energy radiation to treat skin cancer, cancer that has spread to the bones, and some non- cancerous conditions You may hear some different sounds from the Linac: An X-ray machine attached to the Linac moves in and out of position. Sheets of metal slide in and out and block some of the radiation to help protect some of your healthy tissues. A buzzing noise happens when the radiation is turned \" ON\". The Linac makes noises as it moves around you. Images \u00a9 Alberta College of Medical Diagnostic and Therapeutic TechnologistsJust Diagnosed 6 Internal Radiation Internal Radiation is also called Brachytherapy , which means \"short distance\" radiation treatment. This means the radiation source is close to, or inside your body. There are different types of brachytherapy: High Dose Rate (HDR) Low Dose Rate (LDR) Intracavitary (in a body cavity) Interstitial (in a body tissue) Permanent Seed Implant Superficial (on the surface of your skin)Brachytherapy treatments are not covered in this booklet. If you need brachytherapy, your healthcare team will give you more information about the treatment. 7 In Treatment In Treatment Preparing for Your Radiation Treatment There are many steps to help prepare you for radiation treatment. The next few pages talk about what you can expect. When you meet your Radiation Oncologist, you will talk about: Your cancer diagnosis and treatment goals How we can use radiation to treat your cancer What your basic treatment schedule will look like Consenting to treatment Your Radiation Oncologist may recommend radiation treatment as part of your cancer treatment, but you need to decide if you want to have radiation treatment. To help make your decision, you need to know the: Goals for treatment Risks and benefits to getting the treatment Other possible treatment options other than radiation Possible outcomes if you do not have treatment Pregnancy and Fertility If you think you are pregnant talk to your radiation oncologist before you start your treatments. Radiation treatment to a pregnant person can affect the unborn baby. Treatment to the pelvic area can affect your ability to have children later on \u2014 this applies to everyone. Talk to your doctor about fertility preservation options before you start treatment. Everyone should use some form of birth control before and during treatments. Ask your radiation oncologist when it would be safe to try to have a baby after treatment. C You can use the free AHS My Care Conversations app to prepare for your next appointment and to audio record conversations with your healthcare team. You can listen to your recordings at home and share with family or trusted friends. Download it from the App Store or Google Play. In Treatment 8 Your CT Simulation A CT (\"cat\" scan; computerized axial tomography scan) simulation is a planning session that happens before you get your first external beam treatment. It helps us see: where the tumour is in your body shape of the tumour size of the tumour What is a treatment position? It is the position you need to be in every time you get your treatment. The radiation therapist chooses your position based on the area being treated. Some positions include: Lying on your stomach Lying flat on your back Having your arms up above your head Wearing a mesh mask over your head, neck, or other body part Most patients will get permanent tattoos on the treatment area. Each tattoo is the size of a small freckle. Tattoos help us get you into the right position for every treatment.At your CT simulation, the radiation therapists will put you in your treatment position and take a 3D image of the area you need treated. The images are used to develop a treatment plan just for you. The CT simulation helps us be as accurate as possible. When you come in for treatment, we can aim the radiation at the same spot every time, which means that less of your healthy tissues and organs are affected. Images \u00a9 Alberta College of Medical Diagnostic and Therapeutic Technologists9 In Treatment Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the CT simulation? You might get special instructions to help you prepare. They may include: Breathing \u2014 how to practice holding your breath for your CT scan and treatments Bowels \u2014 having a bowel movement before your CT scan and each treatment Bladder \u2014 how much to drink to have a full bladder for your CT scan and treatments If you are getting treatment to the area of your head or neck, you will see the Hospital Dentist before your CT simulation. Will I need to wear a mask? Not everyone needs a mask for treatment, but if you do, we create the support especially for you. This ensures that it will fit the body shape it is meant to support such as your head, hips or foot. A mask is used to help your body stay in position, since it's very important for you to stay still during your treatment sessions, How can I Prepare for Radiation? www.ahs.ca/cancertreatment > Radiation Treatment There are many different kinds of masks, but most are made from a plastic material with holes in it. The steps to making a mask include: 1. The plastic mesh is placed in warm water until it becomes stretchy. 2. The stretchy plastic mesh is placed over your head and neck area (or other body part) and secured into position. The mesh is easy to breathe through. 3. The Radiation Therapists shape the plastic mesh to your body part. 4. It takes about 10 minutes for the mask to cool and harden into shape. The Radiation Therapist can offer you ideas for relaxing during the mask making. Ask them if you are nervous. Image \u00a9 Alberta College of Medical Diagnostic and Therapeutic TechnologistsIn Treatment 10 Planning your Treatment Who plans my treatment? Your Radiation Oncologist, a Radiation Therapist and a Medical Physicist will all be involved in planning the best way to treat your cancer. Treatment planning takes time. There are many things your healthcare team looks at when they make a treatment plan for you such as: The shape of your body Where the cancer is in your body Organs or tissues near the tumour so they can help protect them Quality Assurance and Safety We make sure you get the best possible quality of treatment. At many points during the treatment process, we double check our work and our processes. This includes: A careful review by the Medical Physicist of the treatment plan and machine settings. A discussion by the Radiation Oncologist, Radiation Therapists, and Medical Physicist about your treatment plan. A careful review before every treatment by the Radiation Therapists to prepare for your treatment.Image \u00a9 Alberta College of Medical Diagnostic and Therapeutic Technologists11 In Treatment Your Radiation Treatment Days Common Questions When you come for your first radiation treatment, you may be nervous and wonder what is going to happen during your treatment. It's important to know that: You cannot feel the radiation. Most treatment appointments take 10 to 15 minutes \u2014 most of this time is spent getting you into position. You need to stay still for your radiation treatment. You will not be radioactive after your treatment. Should I take my medications while I get radiation treatment? Take your regular medications as you normally would, unless you were told not to If it's needed for your treatment, take your anti- nausea, anti-anxiety, or pain medications as instructed What should I bring to my appointments? Photo ID, healthcare card and cancer care card Any questions you have written down to ask your healthcare team Can I still have my treatment if I am sick? It depends, but usually yes. If you are not feeling well, you may be able to see our nurses to find out what is going on. If you have cold, flu-like, or COVID symptoms, call before coming in. Why do I have to spell my last name and say my birth date before every treatment? Safety is our priority. Your name and birth date helps us confirm that you are the person who is supposed to have that radiation treatment. Will I have to change into a hospital gown or pants for my treatment? We may ask you to change into a hospital gown for your radiation treatment depending on what area of your body is being treated. This can make it easier for us to position your body and see the marks or tattoos on your skin. Tell your Radiation Therapist before every appointment if you are or might be pregnant.Your first treatment appointment is the longest. For most people, it will take about 30 minutes. D How can I Prepare for Radiation? www.ahs.ca/cancertreatment > Radiation Treatment Come to all your radiation treatments if you can. If you do miss a treatment, we will have to add another treatment day to your schedule.In Treatment 12 Who gives me my radiation treatment? Often people think it is the Radiation Oncologist who delivers the treatment but it is actually trained Radiation Therapists who do this. Radiation Therapists are trained in: CT Simulation \u2014 help to figure out the best treatment position for you Planning \u2014 use computers to plan your treatment (called dosimetry) Treatment \u2014 put your body in the right position, and operate the machines to deliver your radiation treatment(s) Patient Care \u2014 give you information about your treatment, possible side effects, and help you manage side effects during your treatment What is a \"Machine Maintenance Day?\" Our Linacs need routine maintenance every 6 weeks . During a maintenance day you may or may not have your radiation treatment. If you do have treatment, it may be on a different machine or very early in the morning before our specialists take the machine apart. When will I see my doctor or nurse? You may see your Radiation Oncologist or Nurse at a regular weekly visit, or it may be scheduled as needed. If you need help managing a side effect, or if you have a concern, you or your radiation therapist can ask to arrange an appointment. Remember to ask for prescription refills at this appointment if you need them. If you are getting treatment to the area of your head and neck, you may also see a dietitian at this visit.Protect yourself from falls at the cancer centre: Use a wheelchair if you need to \u2014 you may have a long walk to the treatment unit. Staff can use safety straps to help you stand up and move. The treatment bed is high above the floor during your treatment \u2014 wait for the therapist to tell you when it is safe to get off. Use the grab bars in the washrooms and change rooms to help you sit and stand up. Be extra careful on escalators, or use the elevator instead. 13 In Treatment What Will Happen at My Treatment Appointments? The radiation therapists will: bring you into the treatment room uncover the area of your body being treated so they can make sure any belts or metal objects are out of the way To help position you the radiation therapists will: Use the tattoos or marks from your CT simulation Move your body into the correct treatment position Use lasers (light beams) to help straighten and level your body The treatment bed can also help reposition you, so it may move. You will usually have an X-ray or a CT scan to confirm your body is in the right position. This is done using the treatment machine. When you are in position it will be time to start treatment: You will hear a beeping noise or chiming sound when the Radiation Therapists leave the treatment room You will be alone in the treatment room but the therapists have a camera and microphone so they can see and hear you and talk to you if needed The radiation treatment will begin and the radiation machine may rotate around you until it reaches a starting position You will not feel the radiation. When the radiation treatment is done : The radiation therapists will come back into the room and lower the bed Once the bed is lowered you will be able to stand up Possible Side Effects 14 Side Effects Possible Side Effects Are there side effects from radiation treatment? There are possible side effects. Your cancer care team will talk to you about them, but it does not mean you will have all or even any of them. Everyone is different. Your treatments are planned just for you, so we can try to limit your side effects as much as possible. Why do you get side effects from radiation treatment? The body is made up of billions of cells. Side effects happen when radiation treatment damages the healthy cells in our bodies . Over time, the healthy cells are able to fix themselves which is when the side effects go away. When will the side effects happen? Early side effects can start during your treatment, or shortly after. These side effects should go away and usually: Take 2 to 3 weeks (14 to 21 days) to develop before you notice anything Last 1 to 2 weeks (7 to 14 days) after treatment until they start to get better Late side effects may develop weeks, months, or years after treatment. These side effects are sometimes permanent. Talk to your Radiation Oncologist about late side effects that you could get.E 15 Possible Side Effects Types of Possible Side Effects Use this chart when talking to your radiation oncologist to identify the possible side effects you need to watch out for. If you are also getting systemic treatment - talk with your healthcare provider about how this may impact your possible side effects. General Side Effects may happen when you get radiation treatment to any part of your body and are common to all radiation treatments Fatigue (cancer-related) ( p. 17) Skin changes ( p. 19-20) Sleep pattern changes ( p. 18) Sexuality and intimacy changes ( p. 21) Specific Side Effects these side effects happen only in the area of the body being treated Area of TreatmentWhat to Watch For: Brain Go to the Emergency Room if you have: Seizures/blackouts Severe headaches Go to the page if you have: Hearing changes ( p. 27) Hair loss (p. 26) Nausea and vomiting ( p. 27)Talk to your healthcare team if you have: Vision changes Headaches Problems with balance or walking A change in sensation in your face, body, arms, or legs such as numbness, tingling, loss of feeling, or weakness Vomiting Sinuses and Mouth Go to the page if you have: Difficult Swallowing ( p. 25) Mouth Problems ( p. 26-27) Dry Mouth Mouth Sores Dental Hearing changes ( p. 27) Taste Changes ( p. 28) Talk to your healthcare team if you have: Difficulty Speaking Pain Arms and Legs Go to the page if you have: Skin Changes ( p. 19-20) Hair Loss (p. 26)A high fever is not caused by Radiation treatment but it should not be ignored.

Fatigue is best treated with regular exercise and good nutrition. Fatigue can make you feel like you: are worn out, tired or sleepy, or have no energy can't concentrate or think lack interest in doing anything with friends or family have no interest in sex or being intimate with your partner are depressed, disconnected or uninterested in anything What can cause fatigue? cancer treatment poor nutrition or not enough calorie and protein intake weight loss stress changes in your daily schedule or interrupted sleep schedule low red blood cell count - red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen in your body How can I manage my fatigue? Stay as active as possible before and during treatment. Physical activity may be a simple walk once or twice daily. Set a goal of 8 hours night time sleep. A good sleep is more likely when you go to bed at the same time every night and follow a routine. Pace yourself day by day. Prioritize and plan your activities according to how you feel that day. You may not be able to do everything on your list so decide what's most important for you and ask for help from others to complete the remaining tasks. Eat smaller, more frequent meals and snacks. Eat a balanced diet, with protein rich foods. Ask to speak to a registered dietitian to learn how nutrition can help manage fatigue.F Get more tips and check out the booklet \"How to Manage Cancer-Related Fatigue\" \u2014 available at your cancer centre. For more information on how to manage cancer-related fatigue, visit https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Alberta/Pages/cancer-fatigue.aspx Possible Side Effects 18 Sleep Pattern Changes Getting enough sleep helps with healing, digestion, emotional well-being, and cognitive functions like memory and problem solving. What is a sleep pattern change? Difficulty falling asleep Difficulty staying asleep Waking up earlier than you normally do Sleeping more than usual but not waking up feeling rested Why does this happen? There are many things that can cause changes to your sleep, such as: The cancer itself Pain Insomnia (where you can't seem to fall asleep) Fatigue Side effects from the cancer treatment, such as diarrhea, or nausea Emotional changes Stress What can I do to help improve my sleep pattern? If you nap during the day, try and nap between 1 and 3 pm and only for 30 minutes. Nap on the couch or in a recliner. Save the bed for sleeping at night. If you feel depressed - let your healthcare team know. Speaking with a social worker or psychologist can help you to talk about your concerns in a safe and caring environment. Take your medications as prescribed to help manage pain or your nausea and vomiting. Turn off all electronic devices 1 hour before you fall asleep \u2014 this includes televisions, cell phones, and laptops. Exercise - even if it is for a short walk (page 34 ). Create a calm, quiet environment to sleep in. 19 Possible Side Effects Changes to Your Skin and Tissue Tightening Radiation treatment can cause skin irritation during or after treatment. This depends on the: Dose of radiation given each day Area of the body being treated What are the signs and symptoms? Dry, itchy or cracked skin Redness, warmth, or swelling Tenderness More sensitive to sunlight, wind and cold How will I know if I have skin irritation? There are different levels of skin irritation and different signs and symptoms: Skin Changes MildMild Moderate Severe Signs and SymptomsSlightly pink colour Warm ItchyDarker pink colour Dry with flaking ItchyRed colour Blistering Weeping (fluid from the wound) How can I prevent or manage my skin irritation? Use unscented creams and mild soaps that are gentle on your skin. Apply cream after you dry off from a shower, while your skin is still slightly damp \u2014 it will help to keep your skin moist and soft. Avoid creams, soaps, and other hygiene products with alcohol, perfume, lanolin or AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acids). These can dry or irritate your skin. Ask your healthcare team what products they recommend. Wash the treated area daily Take short showers or baths in lukewarm, not hot, water. Pat your skin dry rather than rubbing it dry. Use a soft washcloth and towel. If your lips are in the treatment area and are dry, ask your doctor what to use to help keep them moist. Do not shave in the treatment area. Avoid waxing or hair removal creams in the treatment area \u2014 they can irritate your skin.The skin in some areas of the body is more likely to get irritated from the radiation treatment. This can happen because of the shape of our bodies, or from the skin rubbing together in areas such as: Under the breast fold Groin Behind your ears Neck Armpit Possible Side Effects 20 Changes to Your Skin and Tissue Tightening Radiation treatment can cause skin irritation during or after treatment.

This can happen because of the shape of our bodies, or from the skin rubbing together in areas such as: Under the breast fold Groin Behind your ears Neck Armpit Keep your nails clean, cut short, and avoid scratching. Keep your skin covered up. Wear a hat with a wide brim. Avoid sunscreen during radiation treatments in the area being treated. Protect your skin by not using heating pads, or ice packs in the treated area. Eat a healthy diet (p. 33). Check with your radiation oncologist to see if you can use deodorant (if your armpit is in the treatment area). Swimming in pools is fine as long as your skin changes are no more than mild (p. 19). Rinse well after and apply cream. Avoid using a hot tub or sauna during treatment. Avoid using tape or bandages in the area being treated. Wear loose fitting clothes so they do not rub the treated area. Use a mild detergent to wash clothes. Skin and Tissue Tightening (Fibrosis) in the Radiation Treatment Area Signs and symptoms of tissue tightening in the area treated can include: Pulling sensation of the skin Reduced stretch in the skin Reduced flexibility in your joints - such as in your hips after pelvic radiation Regular, gentle stretching can help. If you notice your range of motion is getting worse, tell your doctor. A physiotherapist can help you improve. 21 Possible Side Effects Sexuality and Intimacy Changes Sexual health affects people of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, cultures and beliefs.
