The recommendations now go to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the [CDC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cdc) , for her approval, after which they become the agency's official clinical advice to public health officials and health care providers nationwide. Among Americans initially immunized with the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, adults over 65, adults ages 50-65 with certain medical conditions and those who reside in long-term care settings should receive a single booster dose six months or longer after the second dose, the committee said. For adults ages 18-49 with certain medical conditions and adults whose jobs regularly expose them to the virus, committee members opted for softer language, saying they may choose to get a booster after considering their individual risks. The panel also endorsed the so-called mix-and-match strategy, under which people fully immunized with one company's vaccine could switch to a different one for their booster. Limited evidence strongly suggests that booster doses of one of the two mRNA vaccines \u2014 Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech \u2014 more effectively raise antibody levels than a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the committee noted. The experts emphasized that people who have received two mRNA vaccine doses or a single Johnson & Johnson vaccine should still consider themselves fully vaccinated. Federal health officials said they would continue to study whether those who have weak immune systems and have already received a third dose of a vaccine should go on to get a fourth dose. Some advisers were concerned that young, healthy Americans who don't need a booster might choose to get one anyway. \"Those that are not at high risk should really be thoughtful about getting that dose,\" said Dr. Helen Talbot, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. The final votes aligned with the Food and Drug Administration's authorizations on the vaccines but contrasted sharply with discussions earlier in the day. The panel heard that in adults under 65, even those with chronic conditions, the Moderna vaccine remained highly protective against severe illness and showed only a small decline in effectiveness over time, if any at all. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine showed less efficacy than the Moderna vaccine overall, but the data were too limited to determine whether there might be a decline over time. The purpose of the vaccines is to prevent illness severe enough to require medical attention and not to prevent infection, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician at the University of Maryland. \"It might be too much to ask for a vaccine, either a primary series or the booster, to prevent all forms of infections,\" he said. In the first major presentation in the meeting, representatives from Moderna presented evidence in support of a booster of 50 micrograms, half the dose given in the initial rounds. But the data were of \"very low certainty,\" said Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a CDC scientist. Moderna researchers also did not assess the clinical outcomes, she said. If cleared, the smaller dose may need to be delivered from the same vials now used for initial immunization. Some panelists noted that this may increase the risk of contamination and incorrect dosing, and complicate data gathering. (Moderna has been testing vials that deliver smaller volumes to alleviate this problem, according to a former government official.) The panel also heard data in support of a second Johnson & Johnson dose. Scientists from the company said they had estimated the rate of blood clots following vaccination \u2014 a particular concern in young women \u2014 at 15.1 cases per million following the first dose and 1.9 cases per million after the second. Data for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were of very low quality, Dooling also noted. CDC scientists said at the meeting that the vaccines are generally safe, with the exception of uncommon and mostly mild heart problems in young men. The risk of the condition \u2014 called myocarditis, an inflammation of the muscle \u2014 is highest after the second shot of an mRNA vaccine, and highest in men ages 18-24. In males under 20, the condition may affect more than 100 in every million vaccinated. Studies have shown that the risk of heart problems after a bout of COVID-19 is much higher. Some panelists said they worried about the risk of blood clots in young women who get a second dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and the risk of myocarditis in young men after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine. Perhaps young women should be directed to mRNA vaccines and young men to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, Talbot said. \"We're in a different place in the pandemic than we were earlier,\" she said. The opportunities to mix and match vaccines \"are priceless.\" On Wednesday, the FDA authorized boosters for millions of people who received the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, just as it did for recipients of Pfizer-BioNTech shots last month. The FDA also gave the go-ahead for people eligible for boosters to get an extra dose of a different brand from the one they first received. "}
