There are two main types of influenza that cause seasonal epidemics each year during the cold winter months: Type A and B. Influenza is transmitted by direct or indirect contact with vi rus-containing respiratory secretions. Symptoms of influenza typically include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, muscle pain and runny nose. Elderly people, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions are at higher risk of ser ious flu complications such as severe pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections. In Switzerland, influenza results every year in approximately 112,000 to 275,000 doctor's consultations, several thousand hospitalisations due to complications and several hundred deaths (https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/krankheiten- im-ueberblick/grippe.html). The influenza vaccine is the most effective way of preventing flu and its complications. The seasonal influenza vaccine composition for the Northern hemisphere is recommended by the WHO in the first quarter of every calendar year based on the circulating viruses . SwissPAR 6 / 9 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 4 Quality Aspects 4.1 Drug Substance The active substance consists of four different monovalent bulks of live attenuated influenza viruses (LAIV), with h aemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) viral gene segments, from each of the specific four influenza virus strains that are recommended f or the seasonal formulation every year by the WHO. The four strains used in the quadrivalent influenza vaccine consist of one i nfluenza A (H1N1) virus strain, one i nfluenza A (H3N2) virus strain, one influenza B (Yamagata lineage) virus strain and one infl uenza B (Victoria lineage) virus strain. The LAIV monovalent bulk drug substance is prepared by the inoculation and growth of the Master Virus Seed (MVS) in embryonated Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) eggs. The MVS used in production consists in 6:2 reassorta nts containing a specific combination of six viral gene segments from an attenuated Master Donor Virus (MDV) and the two gene segments encoding haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens contributed by a wild- type (wt) influenza virus. Virus parti cles from the pooled harvest fluid are clarified by filtration, and further concentrated and purified by tangential flow filtration and sucrose gradient flow ultracentrifugation. The concentrated virus particles are then diluted and sterile filtered before filling into bottles and storing at -60\u00b0C. The manufacturing process has been validated with full -scale drug substance batches. The characteri sation of the drug substance and its impurities was performed using state- of-the-art methods (e.g. SDS -PAGE, HA- content, total protein content, genomic consensus sequencing, as well as biological properties like attenuation, potency and immunogenicity). The specifications for the pooled harvest fluid include bioburden and absence of adventitious agents tests; and those for the monovalent bulk include identity, potency and attenuation tests, as well as sterility and endotoxin tests. Batch analysis data from commercial scale batches from the current manufacturing site were provided. Additional batch data from drug substance used in non- clinical studies and clinical trials were presented and their comparability was demonstrated. All the analytical methods are described and non- compendial methods have been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The drug substanc e is stored at -60\u00b0C. No significant changes are observed under the proposed storage conditions. A shelf life of 24 months has been accepted. 4.2 Drug Product The quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) finished drug product is a blend of four strains of monovalent bulk drug substance, stabili sed with concentrated gelatin -arginine -glutamate (cGAG) buffer and diluted to a final volume with sucrose phosphate (1X SP) buffer. One human dose consists of a 0.2 m L nasal sprayer capable of delivering 7.0 \u00b1 0.5 log10 FFU of each strain, and 0.1 mL is sprayed into each nostril. The Q/LAIV drug product is presented as a clear to yellow slight ly opalescent suspension that might contain little white particles , and it contains no preservatives. The finished product manufacturing process includes blending of monobulk lots of the four strains and dilution with buffer and polysorbate to produce the quadrivalent bulk vaccine, aseptic filtration and filling. Process validation studies were conducted at commercial scale using three consecutive validation batches. The specifications include appropriate tests for identity, potency on each individual strain, total potency, pH, endotoxin, ovalbumin, total protein, colour , opalescence and appearance, sterility and EDTA . All non -compendial methods are validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Batch analysis results for the process validation batches and the clinical lot used for the pivotal studies comply with the release specification. The container closure system i n contact with the finished product consist of a single -dose type I glass nasal sprayer closed with a butyl rubber plunger stopper. 3012 www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 The drug product is stored at 2- 8\u00b0C. No significant changes are observed under the proposed storage conditions. A shelf lif e of 18 weeks has been accepted. The product should not be frozen and should be kept in the outer box in order to protect it from light. 4.3 Quality Conclusions Satisfactory and consistent quality of the drug substance and drug product has been demonstrated. The manufacturing process of the drug substance and drug product incorporate adequate control measures to prevent contamination and maintain control with regard to viral and non- viral contaminants.

For prophylaxis of influenza caused by the two influenza A virus subtypes and the two influenza B virus subtypes contained in the vaccine. The use of Fluenz Tetra should be based on official vaccination recommendations. Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ Dosage/Administration Usual dosage 0.2 ml (administered as 0.1 ml per nostril). To ensure traceability of biotechnological medicinal products, it is recommended that the trade name and batch number should be documented for each administered dose. Children : For children 2- 8 years of age who have not previously been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks. Mode of administration Fluenz Tetra is intended for nasal administration only. Do not inject Fluenz Tetra parenterally. The dose of Fluenz Tetra is administered as a divided dose in both nostrils. After administering approximately half of the dose in one nostr il, administer the other half of the dose in the other nostril immediately or shortly thereafter. The patient can breathe normally while the vaccine is being administered - there is no need to actively inhale or sniff. For administration instructions, see section \"Other instructions\" . Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances, of the excipients (e.g., gelatine; see \"Composition\" ), or to gentamicin (a possible trace residual). Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to eggs or to egg proteins (e.g., ovalbumin). Children and adolescents with clinical immunodeficiency due to conditions or immunosuppressive therapy , such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; symptomatic HIV cellular immune deficiencies; and high- dose corticosteroids. Fluenz Tetra is not contraindicated for use in individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection, or in individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low -dose systemic corticosteroids , or in those receiving corticosteroi ds as replacement therapy, e.g. for adrenal insufficiency. Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy because of the association of Reye's syndrome with salicylates and wild- type influenza infection . Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ Warnings and pr ecautions Risk in children <24 months of age Do not administer Fluenz Tetra to children younger than 24 months. In a clinical study, an increase in hospitalizations was observed in children younger than 24 months after vaccination with the trivalent version of Fluenz , and an increased rate of wheezing was observed (see section \"Undesirable Effects\" ). These data with trivalent version relevant to Fluenz Tetra because Fluenz Tetra is identical to the trivalent version of Fluenz with the only difference being the addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain). Severe asthma or active wheezing Fluenz Tetra should not be administered to children and adolescents with severe asthma or active wheezing because these individuals have not been adequately studied in clinical studies. Management of acute allergic reactions As with all vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of Fluenz Tetra . Vaccine recipients should be informed that Fluenz Tetra is an attenuated live virus vaccine and has the potential for transmission to immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with severely immunocompromised individuals (e.g. bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for 1- 2 weeks following vaccination. Peak vaccine virus recovery concentrations occurred 2 -3 days post -vaccination in Fluenz clinical studies. In circ umstances where contact with severely immunocompromised individuals is unavoidable, the potential risk of transmission of the influenza vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and transmitting wild- type influenza virus. No data exist regarding the safety of intranasal administration of Fluenz Tetra in children with unrepaired craniofacial malformations. Interactions Children and adolescents under 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy should avoid vaccination with Fluenz Tetra (see \"Warnings and Precautions\"). Do not use salicylates in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age for 4 weeks after vaccination with Fluenz Tetra unless medically indicated. Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ The co -administration of varicella and orally -administered poliovirus has been studied. No clinically meaningful changes in immune responses to measles, mumps, varicella, orally -administered poliovirus or Fluenz have been observed. The i mmune response to rubella vaccine was significantly altered. However, this alteration might not be of clinical relevance with the two- dose immunisation schedule of the rubella vaccine. These studies with trivalent Fluenz are relevant to the use of Fluenz T etra because Fluenz Tetra (influenza vaccine, live attenuated, nasal) is identical to Fluenz, with the only difference being the addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain). The co -administration of Fluenz Tetra with inactivated vaccines has not been s tudied. The concurrent use of Fluenz Tetra with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A and/or B viruses has not been evaluated. However, based upon the potential for influenza antiviral agents to reduce the effectiveness of Fluenz Tetra, it i s recommended: not to administer Fluenz Tetra until 48 hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy. not to administer influenza antiviral agents until two weeks after administration of Fluenz Tetra unless medically indicated. If influenz a antiviral agents and Fluenz Tetra are administered concomitantly, revaccination should be considered when appropriate. Pregnancy, lactation Pregnancy There are to date only limited data from the use of Fluenz Tetra in pregnant women. There was no evidence of significant maternal adverse outcomes in 138 pregnant women who had a record of receiving trivalent version of Fluenz in a US based health insurance claims database. In more than 300 case reports in the AstraZeneca safety database and over 150 case reports from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of the trivalent and quadrivalent version of Fluenz administration to pregnant women, no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes were observed. While animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, and post -marketing data offer some reassurance in the event of inadvertent administration of the vaccine, Fluenz Tetra is not recommended during pregnancy. Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ Lactation It is not known whether Tetra is excreted in human milk. Therefore, Fluenz Tetra should not be used during breast -feeding. Effects on ability to drive and use machines The vaccine is not expected to have an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. Undesirable effects The safety experience with the trivalent version of Fluenz is relevant to the use of Fluenz Tetra because the trivalent version of Fluenz is identical to Fluenz Tetra with the only difference being the addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra. Safety data regarding use of Fluenz Tetra are based on data from Fluenz Tetra clinical studies in 2,231 children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, studies of the trivalent version of Fluenz in over 29,000 children and adolescents , and post-authorisation safety studies with the trivalent version of Fluenz in over 84,000 children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age. Additional experience is available with marketed use of the trivalent version of Fluenz. In clinical studi es, the safety profile of Fluenz Tetra was similar to the safety profile of the trivalent version of Fluenz. The most common adverse reaction observed in clinical studies was nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea. List of adverse reactions Frequency of occurrence o f undesirable effects are defined as: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (<1/10,000) disorders Uncommon: Hypersensitivity reactions (including facial oedema, urticaria and very rare anaphylactic reactions) Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common: Decreased appetite (18.3%) Nervous system disorders Common: Headache Information for healt hcare and connective tissue disorders Common: Myalgia General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Malaise (11.7%) Common: Pyrexia Description of specific adverse reactions and additional information In an active- controlled clinical study (MI -CP111), an increased rate of hospitalizations (for any cause) up to 180 days after final vaccination dose was observed in children 6- 11 months of age (6.1% trivalent version of Fluenz versus 2.6% injectable influenza vaccine) . Most hospitalisations were due to gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections and occurred more than 6 weeks post vaccination. The rate of hospitalizations was not increased in t rivalent version of Fluenz recipients 12 months and older. In the same study , an increased rate of wheezing through 42 days was observed in children 6- 23 months of age ( 5.9% trivalent version of Fluenz versus 3.8% injectable influenza vaccine) . The rate of wheezing was not increased in trivalent version of Fluenz recipients 24 months of age and older. Fluenz Tetra is not indicated for use in children younger than 24 months (see section \"warnings and precautions\" ). Very rare reports of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 symptoms (including anaphylactic reactions, facial oedema and urticaria), epistaxis and rash have also been observed in the post - marketing setting with the trivalent version of Fluenz. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to r eport any suspected adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.ch . Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ Overdose There have been occasional reports of administr ation of twice the recommended dose of Fluenz Tetra and the trivalent version of Fluenz in the post -marketing setting. The adverse reactions reported were similar to those seen with the use of the recommended single dose of Fluenz Tetra. Properties/Effects ATC code J07BB03 Mechanism of action Since 1985, two distinct lineages of influenza B viruses (Victoria and Yamagata) have circulated worldwide. Fluenz Tetra is a quadrivalent (also known as tetravalent) vaccine that contains antigens for four influenza virus strains, namely an A/(H1N1) strai n, an A/(H3N2) strain, and two B strains (one from each lineage). The influenza virus strains in Fluenz Tetra are (a) cold - adapted (ca), (b) temperature -sensitive (ts), and (c) attenuated (att). As a result , the vaccine viruses only replicate in the nasopharynx and induce protective immunity. No evidence of reversion has been observed in the recovered vaccine strains that have been tested (135 of a possible 250 recovered isolates). Immune mechanisms conferring protection against influenza following r eceipt of Fluenz Tetra vaccine are not yet fully understood. Likewise, naturally acquired immunity to wild- type influenza has not yet been completely elucidated. Serum antibodies, mucosal antibodies and influenza- specific T cells may play a role in prevent ion of infection and in recovery from infection. Pharmacodynamics The efficacy of Fluenz Tetra is based on data demonstrating laboratory -confirmed efficacy of the trivalent version of Fluenz in children and a comparison of post -vaccination geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies between individuals receiving the trivalent version of Fluenz and Fluenz Tetra. Clinical experience with the trivalent version of Fluenz is relevant to Fluenz Tetra because the trivalent version of Fluenz is identical to Fluenz Tetra with the only difference being the addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra. T he trivalent version of Fluenz has been administered to over 30,000 individuals in Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ controlled clinical studies over multiple years, in various regions and using different vaccine strains. Clinical efficacy Paediatric studies Efficacy data in the pa ediatric population for the trivalent version of Fluenz originates from 9 controlled studies comprising over 20,000 children, conducted during 7 influenza seasons. Four placebo- controlled studies included second season revaccination. T he trivalent version of Fluenz has demonstrated superiority in 3 active- controlled studies w ith injectable influenza vaccine. See Table 1 and Table 2 for a summary of efficacy results for the trivalent version of Fluenz in children.

Study D153- P501: P aediatric A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial (D153- P501) was performed in Asia for two consecutive seasons (2000- 2001 and 2001- 2002) to evaluate the efficacy of the trivalent version of Fluenz against culture -confirmed influenza illness in children 12- 35 months of age without high- risk medical conditions. The primary endpoint of the trial was the prevention of culture- confirmed influenza illness due to antigenically matched wild- type influenza. A total of 3,174 children were randomized 3:2 (vaccine: placebo) to receive 2 doses of study vaccine or placebo at least 28 days apart in Year 1. See Table 3 for a description of the results. During the second year of Study D153- P501, for children who received two doses in Year 1 and one dose in Year 2, the trivalent version of Fluenz demonstrated 84.3% (95% CI: 70.1, 92. 4) efficacy against culture- confirmed influenza illness due to antigenically matched wild- type influenza. Information for healt hcare professionals ____________________________________________________________________________ Study AV006: P multi -centr e, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial performed in U.S. children without high -risk medical conditions to evaluate the efficacy of the trivalent version of Fluenz against culture -confirmed influenza over two successive seasons (1996- 1997 and 1997- 1998) . The primary endpoint of the trial was the prevention of culture -confirmed influenza illness due to antigenically matched wild- type influenza in children who received two doses of vaccine in the first year and a single revaccination dose in the second year. During the first year of the study, 1,602 children 15- 71 months of age were random ized 2:1 (vaccine: placebo). In Year 2, children remained in the same treatment group as in year one and received a single dose of the trivalent version of Fluenz or placebo. See Table 3 for a description of the results.

During the 2004- 2005 influenza season, a total number of 3,916 children <5 years of age and without severe asthma, without use of bronchodilator or steroids and without wheezing within the prior 6 weeks were randomized to the trivalent version of Fluenz , and 3,936 were randomized to active control. Participants were then followed through the influenza season to identify illness caused by influenza virus. As the primary endpoint, culture -confirmed modified CDC- ILI (CDC- defined influenza- like illness ) was defined as a positi ve culture for a wild- type influenza virus associated within \u00b1 7 days of modified CDC -ILI. Modified CDC -ILI was defined as fever (temperature 100\u00b0F (corresponding to approx. 37.8\u00b0C) oral or equivalent) plus cough, sore throat or runny nose/nasal congestion on the same or consecutive days. In the primary efficacy analysis, the trivalent version of Fluenz demonstrated a 44.5% (95% CI: 22.4, 60.6) reduction in influenza rate compared to active control , as measured by culture- confirmed modified CDC -ILI caused by wild -type strains antigenically similar to those contained in the vaccine. See Table 4 for a description of the results by strain and antigenic similarity.

Immun ogenicity of Fluenz Tetra in Children and Adolescents e, randomized, double- blind, active- controlled, non -inferiority study (MI -CP208) was performed to assess the immunogenicity of Fluenz Tetra compared to Fluenz (active control) in children and adolescents 2 through 17 years of age. A total of 2, 312 children and adolescents were randomized at a 3:1:1 ratio to receive either Fluenz Tetra or one of two Fluenz comparator vaccines of the trivalent version of Fluenz , each containing a B strain that corresponded to one of the two B strains in Fluenz Tetra . Product information for human medicinal products Immunogenicity was evaluated by comparing the 4 strain- specific serum hemagglutination inhibition trivalent formulations of Fluenz , as the upper bound for each of the four 95% CIs for the post dose strain specific GMT HAI antibody ratios was less than the pre -specified non-inferiority criterion of 1.5. These data provide evidence that the addition of the second B strain did not result in immune interference to other strains included in the vaccine. Studies in Immunocompromised Individuals Safety and shedding of vaccine virus following administration of the trivalent version of Fluenz were evaluated in children in a randomized (1:1), cross -over, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial in 24 HIV-infected children [median CD4 cell count of 1 ,013 cells/mm3] and 25 HIV -negative children 1- 7 years of age, and in a randomized (1:1), open- label, inactivated influenza vaccine- controlled trial in 243 HIV -infected children and adolescents 5 -17 years of age receiving stable anti -retroviral therapy. Frequency and duration of vaccine virus shedding in HIV -infected individuals were comparable to that seen in healthy individuals. No adverse effects on HIV viral load or CD4 counts were identified following administration of the trivalent version of Fluenz . In the 5 -17 year -old age group, one inactivated influenza vaccine recipient and one trivalent version of Fluenz recipient experienced pneumonia within 28 days of vaccination (days 17 and 13, respectively). The effectiveness of the trivalent version of Fluenz in preventing influenza illness in HIV -infected individuals has not been evaluated. Twenty mild to moderately immunocompromised children and adolescents 5- 17 years of age (receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who had received chemotherapy in the 12 weeks prior to study enrolment ) were randomized 1:1 to receive the trivalent version of Fluenz or plac ebo. Frequency and duration of vaccine virus shedding in these immunocompromised children and adolescents were comparable to that seen in healthy children and adolescents. The effectiveness of the trivalent version of Fluenz in preventing influenza illness in immunocompromised individuals has not been evaluated. Study with Concomitant Live Vaccines In Study AV018, concomitant administration of the trivalent version of Fluenz and live vaccines against MMR (manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc) and varicella virus (manufactured by Merck & Co.) was studied in 1, 245 subjects 12 -15 months of age. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to MMR, varicella vaccine and placebo (group 1); MMR, v aricella and trivalent version 2); or trivalent ver sion of Fluenz alone (group 3). Immune responses to MMR and v aricella vaccines were evaluated 6 weeks post -vaccination, while the immune responses to trivalent version of Fluenz were evaluated 4 weeks after the second dose. Adverse reactions were similar t o those seen in other clinical trials with the trivalent version of Fluenz (see section \"Undesirable Effects\" ). No Product information for human medicinal products evidence of interference with immune response to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and the trivalent version of Fluenz vaccines was observed. Study D153- P522 investigated the concomitant use of the trivalent version of Fluenz and live vaccines against MMR (manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) in 1,233 subjects aged 11- 24 months. The participants were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive LAIV+M MR or placebo+MMR. Seroresponse to measles and mumps was comparable in both groups. Compared with placebo, response rates to rubella in LAIV+MMR recipients were statistically lower (83.9% versus 78.0%) at a threshold value of 15 IU/mL, and the pre -defined criteria for non- inferiority were not fulfilled. In a post -hoc analysis using an alternative, generally -accepted threshold value of 10 IU/mL, the criteria for non- inferiority were met (93.4% versus 89.8%).
