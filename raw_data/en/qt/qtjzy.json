Before your dog's STELFONTA\u00ae treatment, it's important to understand how the process works and what to expect. The spot where your dog's tumor is will likely look worse before it can get better. This is normal; and it's part of the tumor removal and healing process. While uncommon, the wound may be extensive, requiring additional treatment and prolonged recovery times. Most mast cell tumors treated with STELFONTA are fully healed within 4-6 weeks of the initial injection. The healing process may take longer in some dogs.1,2 Before your dog's STELFONTA treatment, your veterinarian will prescribe essential oral medications to reduce the risk of [mast cell degranulation](https://stelfonta.com/faq#degranulation). Any manipulation of a mast cell tumor can cause degranulation, releasing large amounts of chemicals and compounds like histamine that can pose a serious, potentially even fatal, risk to your dog's health. Reduce the risk of degranulation: commence medications 2 days before the STELFONTA injection and continue for 7 days after treatment. This is not the time to stop early - or skip doses. It is critical for your dog's wellbeing to give these medications as prescribed. Your veterinarian may also prescribe pain medication to keep your dog comfortable in the first few days after their STELFONTA injection. Your veterinarian will prescribe a corticosteroid, an H1 receptor blocking agent and an H2 receptor blocking agent when treating with STELFONTA to decrease the potential for severe systemic adverse reactions, including death, from mast cell degranulation Before treatment, be sure to discuss with your veterinarian: Checklist for treatment day: Your veterinarian will inject STELFONTA directly into the mast cell tumor. Most dogs do not need to be sedated or put under anesthesia for this procedure. Your veterinarian may recommend sedation if your dog is anxious or aggressive or if the tumor is located on a sensitive part of your dog's body. Within 4 hours of a STELFONTA treatment, the cells inside the tumor begin to break down. At this point, you may notice the tumor area starting to change color or swell.
