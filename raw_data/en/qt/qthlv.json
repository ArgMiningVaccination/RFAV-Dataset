Key stages in life deserve to be honored. Soulfully-designed weddings Want to create that magic moment that you will both remember? There is an art to it. Essentially, beautiful ceremonies of all types take in consideration that we are all part of the natural world. Ceremonies should be grounded, relaxed and full of love. Surrounding yourself with elements of nature really help with that. The wording for your event should come from the heart and draw every person that listens to it inward. I can assist with crafting a beautiful flow. I am an ordained minister as well as a shamanic practitioner and it brings me great joy to officiate weddings. I do add a special touch by incorporating therapeutic sound before and during the ceremony. I help you both ground and center before the event with personalized mini sound sessions to balance you energetically. When you walk down the isle you both will be doing so whole and balanced...that makes an amazing union. During the ceremony if you wish I will play a selection of beautiful alchemy crystal bowls to fill the whole room with elevated vibration and love. The bowls can even be used to call in loving ancestors to be with you in spirit on this threshold day. Ceremonies imbedded with nature, healing sound, and clear intent are life shaping. "}
