Most children qualify for one of the State of Wyoming's discounted immunization programs (see criteria below). Patients will be subject to a vaccine administration fee in accordnace with State of Wyoming immunization program guidelines. The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program is a federally-funded program that provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. VPC-eligible children are those who are age 18 and under and are eligible for Medicaid, uninsured, American Indian/Alaskan Native, or underinsured (where required vaccines are not covered by the individual's health insurance plan). The WyVIP program was created after the enactment of the Childhood Immunization Act (2006) to provide appropriation for vaccines for children who are not VFC-eligile. Children who are Wyoming residents, 18 years and under, and do not qualify for VFC vaccine are eligible for WyVIP vaccine. The follow vaccines are NOT available trhough the WyVIP program: influenza vaccine, Hepatitia A vaccine, meningicoccal vaccine, and HPV vaccine. For those vaccines not covered by WyVIP, patients will be charged based on the clinic's current fee schedule. Adults who do not have access to health insurance coverage can receive discounted vaccines through the AHP. The AHP program provides Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccines to adults who are 19 years and older who are uninsured or whose insurance plan does not cover recommended adult Hepatitis vaccines. Patients are charged an administration fee and the vaccine itself is free. "}
