We passionately believe there is much to learn from the medical wisdom of traditional healing systems, coupled with an expert understanding of scientific research. One of the ways we deliver our mission is through the herbal creations we make. We source and use only the best quality, practitioner-grade, organic ingredients and our herbal experts draw on insights from the latest herbal research and education to make our blends. We keep innovating and bringing out new creations that suit different tastes, preferences and lifestyles but always with an eye on what really impacts upon human health. Why do we need a herbal revolution? We want to spark a herbal health and wellbeing revolution, to help our society appreciate the benefits of herbs to human health. Human healthcare worldwide is at a pivotal point - and there are significant challenges ahead. Around the world, we are living longer but less healthily. Diseases linked to both over and under-nutrition are highly prevalent, while antimicrobial resistance is an imminent global threat, making the need to find alternatives to antibiotics ever more urgent. We need to create a sustainable healthcare system that supports and optimises human health whilst nurturing the diversity and future of our planet. By providing education opportunities and promoting better health choices, Pukka is advocating for a herbal revolution of preventative and alternative healthcare, where herbs are at the forefront of wellness. Influencing healthcare Members of our herbal team regularly deliver talks to inspire on the power of plants. Through our partnership with the [College of Medicine](https://collegeofmedicine.org.uk/) we're working on a radical programme to change conversations about health, bringing together leading figures in medicine, holistic health and research to build a truly integrated health platform. One such example is support for the new concept of 'social prescription', now supported across the NHS. We also co-hosted the [conference](https://vimeo.com/365007425/b08ab6fa6a) 'Before we really need anti-biotics.... What healthy alternatives can we recommend?' to discuss how to tackle the rise of antimicrobial resistance which is a major global public health threat. Reducing the over-prescription of antibiotics is vital as well as identifying new herbal treatments, such as andrographis. Inspiring and educating the next generation There are so many benefits to being in nature, putting your hands in the soil and getting to know plants better. And it's great fun too. We partnered with the Soil Association's Food For Life Programme to teach children in schools and nurseries how to grow organically whilst learning about the wide-ranging benefits of herbs. \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\" Nelson Mandela Pukka Life Academy In 2019, we launched a brand new CPD accredited education platform - curated by our herbal experts - called Pukka Life Academy, aimed at employees, trade partners and practitioners. Comprised of 14 interactive modules, Pukka Life Academy explores the concept of health and wellbeing from traditional, Ayurvedic and bio-medical perspectives. We match this digital resource with face-to-face sessions to support and encourage deeper learning within Pukka and our international community. To get signed up to the Pukka Life Academy please email: education@pukkaherbs.com Due to legal restrictions, this course is unfortunately not available to members of the public.
