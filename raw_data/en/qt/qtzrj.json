Regular massage in upward circular motions will ensure healthy and glowing skin in the long run. The following are some glowing skin tips that will help you maintain healthy skin. Tips To Get Glowing Skin 1. Drink Plenty Of Water It is very important that you drink 10-12 glasses of water daily as it helps to flush the toxins out of your system. The skin needs to receive enough water to be hydrated, soft, and supple. Without enough water, it becomes dull, dry, and might even start to tear ( [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/)). 2. Moisturize Your Skin Regularly The skin on your face, ears, and neck are very sensitive to UV rays and other environmental hazards. These areas shed cells more often and rapidly than other parts of the body. Therefore, it needs more moisture to repair and rejuvenate itself. This allows the new skin cells to rise to the surface. 3. Wear Sunscreen Daily Always use a good sunscreen with SPF (sun protection factor) whenever you step outdoors. Use sunscreen not only in summer but also in winter. A good sunscreen protects your skin from the harmful UVA and UVB rays. 4. Avoid Smoking If glowing skin is what you desire, keep your addictions away. Smoking tobacco, drugs, and drinking alcohol can lead to serious health as well as skin problems. They contribute to premature aging, fine lines, and wrinkles ( [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/)), ( [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1292432)). 5. Exfoliate This should happen right after the cleansing step. Use a mild scrubbing product for your face, depending on your skin type. Use a mild exfoliant if you have pimple-prone skin as scrubbing on a rash or a sensitive area can cause more breakouts. Exfoliate at least twice a week. Do not forget to follow it up with toning and moisturizing. Skin that is not exfoliated gathers up to 10 times more weight with clogged pores and dead skin cells. A good scrub will remove the top layer of dead skin cells, encouraging the production of new, healthy cells. It also improves blood circulation and lightens the skin, making it soft, smooth, and youthful. 6. Cleanse Regularly A proper cleansing routine helps to get rid of the dirt that gets settled on your skin during the day. Always use a cleanser/face wash suitable for your skin type instead of soap. The soap contains harsh chemicals like sodium carbonate, which makes your skin dry by stripping off the moisture. 7. Ban The Chemicals Be a little skin conscious. Don't get lured by the fancy advertisements you see. The next time you [purchase a sunscreen](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-sunscreen/) or lotion, or any other skincare product, try reading the list of active ingredients. Select the ones containing natural oils like olive oils, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, etc. Stay away from the ones that contain chemicals like sulfates, parabens, etc. 8. Makeup Removal Do not forget to remove any traces of makeup from your face before going to bed. Sleeping with makeup on will clog your pores and often dry out the skin, leading to pimples and breakouts. It will also make your skin look dull and lifeless. You should use an alcohol-free cleanser for makeup removal. Rosewater can also be used as it is a natural toner. 9. Pay Attention To Certain Special Areas After the age of 30, it is necessary that you pay attention to certain special areas like the neck, eyes, and hands, which show early signs of aging. The skin around the neck and hands becomes loose gradually, and we can observe [dark circles](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/simple-ways-to-remove-dark-circles-completely/) due to loss of facial fat and volume and puffiness under the eyes. These are the initial signs of skin aging. 10. Throw Away Expired Skin Products Do not use cosmetics products, creams, tools, etc. that are very old. Always check the expiry date before buying and using the product. Try not to share your personal cosmetics with others as it contaminates it and makes it unsafe for personal use. 11. Get Enough Sleep While we sleep, our body repairs the damaged cells and replenishes the old ones. Hence, our body requires at least eight hours of sleep daily. This will give healthy and glowing skin and refresh your mind as well. 12. Switch With Seasons It is a good idea to modify your skincare routines with the change in season, namely, during summer or spring. Switch to oil control face packs and washes and light toners during summers. For monsoons, opt for antibacterial and deep cleansing face washes. During winters, switch to hydrating foot care lotions and moisturizing skin care products. Use deep nourishing toners and lip balms to help keep your skin nourished and smooth. Depending on your skin type, the type of products used during any time of year can vary. A [healthy diet](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/why-is-healthy-food-important/) is very important for your body and skin. Fresh fruits and vegetables are storehouses of vitamins and minerals that are important for our body ( [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/)).
