The proposals would also allow Australia to export generic versions of patented drugs to developing countries to tackle outbreaks of diseases such as malaria, HIV and TB. The bill looks set to become law after a cross-party parliamentary committee this week recommended it be passed. The pharmaceutical industry has also given its backing to the changes, with Medicines Australia chief executive Brendan Shaw saying the bill struck the right balance between helping people in poor countries and safeguarding intellectual property to ensure new medicines and vaccines continue to be developed. The bill clarifies the ''Crown use'' provisions of patent law, the circumstances in which federal, state or territory governments can use patented inventions without the permission of the patent owner. Matthew Rimmer, an associate professor at the Australian National University College of Law, said the changes would make it easier for governments to safeguard the health of their people by ensuring patented medicines, vaccines and tests were available. ''It recognises that patent law is intended to serve public purposes,'' Dr Rimmer said. ''If companies try to block access to inventions or charge extremely high prices, the government can intervene and ensure that there is equitable access to patent inventions,'' he said. "}
