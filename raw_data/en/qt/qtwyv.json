Raspberries also contain tannins that reduce cell damage, promote cell repair, and stimulate the processing of fats and sugars. Turmeric root: Turmeric is a liver health powerhouse.

Saponins, another class of naturally occurring compounds, are proven anti-inflammatory and immunity-boosting agents. Yarrow: Yarrow has powerful anti-inflammatory and liver-protective properties. It also facilitates the secretion of bile, which helps break down gallstones and hard-to-digest fat. L-cysteine: N-acetyl-or NAC amino acid increases blood flow to your liver, protects it against damage by toxins, and can improve liver function in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Dandelion root: Dandelion root reduces stress on the liver and promotes healthy bile flow.

Research shows that regular zinc supplementation can help maintain optimal liver health. Choline: Choline is essential for the human body. By transporting fat from the liver to other body parts, choline keeps your liver free from harmful accumulation of fat and toxins. Your liver produces some choline, but most of it must come from your diet. Milk thistle: Milk thistle is one of the most-studied and best liver supplements. The plant's seeds contain a flavonoid called silymarin, a potent antioxidant that protects your liver by boosting liver function and detoxification. Milk thistle extract also repairs damaged liver cells and can aid in treating liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and viral hepatitis. Chicory root: Chicory extract has a high concentration of naturally occurring antioxidants that are very effective at filtering harmful free radicals.

Organifi Liver Reset Organifi is a household name in the dietary supplements industry, and the company's liver supplements are among the best on the market. Organifi Liver Reset keeps it simple: The unique liver health formula has just four ingredients. However, these potent adaptogens, superfoods, and herbal extracts are highly effective at promoting liver detoxification, boosting healthy bile flow, and optimizing your body's energy production. Like most of the best liver health supplements, this blend features artichoke leaf extract, organic dandelion root extract, and organic milk thistle extract. Organifi's original twist comes with the addition of Triphala, also organic, to the mix. Triphala is a traditional herbal remedy from Ayurveda, India's millennia-old medical system. It's not one plant but a finely balanced blend of three types of fruit that support healthy digestion and proper liver function. More specifically, Triphala contains: Organic amla fruit extract: Amla (Emblica officinalis), also known as Indian gooseberry, is naturally high in vitamin C, essential minerals, amino acids, and potent antioxidants, such as phenols, tannins, and curcuminoids. Antioxidants prevent cell damage, and some test-tube studies show that amla extract may even have anti-cancer properties. Organic bibhitaki fruit extract: Bibhitaki (Terminalia lignans, flavones, and ellagic acid. In addition to promoting liver health, these compounds may help regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and provide anti-inflammatory effects. Organic haritaki fruit extract: Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) contains essential vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, iron, copper, magnesium, and potassium, as well as powerful antioxidants, such as terpenes, polyphenols, and anthocyanins. According to Organifi, Liver Reset is particularly effective at relieving symptoms associated with liver disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, Organifi Liver Reset is one of the best liver health and liver detoxification products currently on the market. There are no reports of serious side effects or unwanted reactions while taking the supplement, and the company uses non-GMO and certified organic ingredients. The pricing starts at $27.95 per bottle for a one-off purchase, or you can get 10% off plus free shipping if you buy a monthly subscription. Consistency is key for liver supplements to work, so if Organifi Liver Reset agrees with your body, you may want to consider the recurring subscription. Organifi also offers a risk-free, 60-day money-back guarantee, so you can try the supplement at no cost to you. 4. 1MD Nutrition\u00ae LiverMD\u00ae LiverMD\u00ae by 1MD Nutrition\u00ae was the 2020 NEXTY Award for Best Condition-Specific Supplement, and with good reason. This liver supplement is specially formulated to boost liver function, stave off liver disease, detoxify your liver, and improve your overall liver health. The patented formula contains popular and well-researched vitamins, minerals, and amino acids like vitamin E, which has potent antioxidant properties, zinc, selenium, and L-cysteine HCL. But the true added value of LiverMD\u00ae lies in the ingredients you don't normally see in many liver supplements, several of which are patented and clinically proven to promote liver health, such as: Alpha lipoic acid (ALA): Alpha lipoic acid delivers powerful antioxidant effects and helps liver enzymes turn the food you eat into energy. Siliphos\u00ae bioavailable Silybin\u00ae: This enhanced form of milk thistle extract is easier for your body to absorb compared to conventional extracts and has been shown to promote liver function and gallbladder health. TocoGaia: TocoGaia is a patented, plant-based, full-spectrum vitamin E extract that packs in all eight forms of the vitamin to maximize its bioavailability and its many benefits for your liver and overall health. In addition to boosting liver health, LiverMD\u00ae promotes a healthy heart function, helps maintain normal energy and metabolism, and can help with weight management, making it one of the best liver detox supplements on the market. 1MD Nutrition\u00ae takes its formulas very seriously. The company has a scientific advisory board comprised of physicians, nutritionists, and other medical experts that help develop its products, including its liver supplements. All products are GMO free, made in the U.S., and GMP certified. LiverMD\u00ae costs $49.99 per bottle for a one-time purchase, but you can get it for as low as $29.99 if you buy a six-month supply with a subscription. The company offers free shipping on all U.S. orders and a 90-day money-back guarantee. 5. Glutathione Scientists and medical professionals jokingly refer to glutathione as the \"mother of all antioxidants.\" The antioxidant activity of this compound is around ten times more potent than vitamin E. All cells in your body need glutathione to function properly and fight oxidative stress, but the highest concentration of glutathione is in the liver. Unchecked, chronic oxidative stress can lead to conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and heart disease. Glutathione also supports your immune system and helps your body produce white blood cells and prevent or fight off disease. Research shows a correlation between low glutathione levels and chronic diseases like gout, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. Of course, correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, but the results are statistically significant. Glutathione also plays a major role in liver detoxification, helping rid your body of harmful toxins and other byproducts. It takes the toxins you ingest through food or the environment out of circulation and prepares them for disposal, either through stool or urine. Aging, stress, poor diet, and various health conditions can cause your body's natural glutathione levels to dwindle. Taking liver health supplements \u2014 and specifically milk thistle \u2014 helps to prevent the depletion of glutathione. 6. Turmeric India's Ayurvedic physicians have known antioxidant, and anticancer benefits of turmeric root for millennia. Western science has now finally caught up. One study in human adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease found that taking as little as 500 mg of curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, for eight weeks greatly reduced liver fat content and the levels of AST and ALT liver enzymes. Another study found that curcumin effectively lowers cholesterol and inflammatory markers in the liver and that the liver functions much better with turmeric than without. Animal research has also shown the polyphenols in turmeric help reduce the risk of stress-induced fatty liver disease. In one study, the researchers fed a group of cows a blend of turmeric and green tea. Over time, the cows showed a significant reduction in irritation markers for fatty liver. With this in mind, consider incorporating a turmeric liver supplement into your daily routine, whether on its own or in combination with other ingredients that promote optimal liver health. Alternatively, you could use fresh or dried turmeric root to spice up your home-cooked dishes. Remember, even the best liver supplements can't replace a well-balanced diet. 7. Beetroot Beetroot is one of those vegetables you either love or hate with a passion. If you're not a fan, consider giving it a second chance. Not only are beets an excellent source of fiber, but they also boast exceptional nutritional content, including high levels of folic acid, manganese, and potassium. Fiber plays a critical role in your body's detoxification process \u2014 and, by extension, aids liver detox \u2014 as it helps move stool through the digestive tract. One of the most bioactive fibers in beetroot is pectin, which stimulates the cleansing of the liver and assists in toxin disposal. Betalain pigments, a class of antioxidants, are another important component of beetroots. Research has shown that they scavenge free radicals and significantly reduce inflammation throughout your body, making beetroot juice a preferred treatment for chronic illnesses associated with inflammation and oxidative stress \u2014 including chronic liver disease. If you find it hard to incorporate beetroot into your diet, there are various beetroot-based liver supplements on the market that provide the liver health benefits of the plant minus the earthy aftertaste (and the staining). 8. Ginger Root Ginger is perhaps best known for its immunity-boosting properties, but it's also essential to liver health. Some of ginger's active ingredients, such as gingerol and shogaol, are very effective at keeping prostaglandins, cytokines, and other inflammation-inducing chemicals in the body in check. Inflammation is a major contributor to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several studies on patients with this condition have shown that cytokine TNF-a plays an important role in both liver fibrosis and insulin resistance. TNF-a also increases the oxidation of fatty acids. However, after the patients took a ginger liver supplement, their levels of TNF-a dropped significantly. Other clinical trials have suggested that ginger liver detox supplements can boost the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions like exercise and a healthy diet in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. So, whether you take ginger with your tea or in the form of a liver supplement, it can be a fantastic aid in helping you maintain liver health. 9. Milk Thistle Native to the Mediterranean, milk thistle extract may be the most potent out of all liver health supplements. This prickly, purple-flowered weed contains a wealth of naturally occurring compounds that can relieve the symptoms of various liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, alcoholic and viral hepatitis, and fatty liver disease. Numerous studies have documented milk thistle's beneficial impact on liver function. The star ingredient in milk thistle is a flavonoid called silymarin. Extracted from the seeds of milk thistle seeds, silymarin is a potent antioxidant that protects the liver by promoting liver detox and optimal liver function. Silymarin acts like a gatekeeper, binding to the outside of liver cells and staving off toxins and free radicals by blocking their entry into the cells. But that's not all: Silymarin also scavenges toxins that have already entered the cells and repairs liver cells damaged by disease, alcohol, drugs, and lifestyle factors. Another important function of milk thistle is its ability to boost your body's natural production of the powerful antioxidant and liver-health-promoting compound glutathione. Unsurprisingly, milk thistle has become one of the most popular liver support supplements for treating and repairing the liver globally. 10. Choline Choline is a macronutrient and a structural component of fat. Your body requires choline to carry out many vital processes. As we mentioned earlier, choline is particularly important for healthy liver function. It ensures the proper transportation of healthy fats, including cholesterol and triglycerides, from your liver to other body parts where they can support crucial physiological functions. Another of choline's major health benefits is its role in keeping your liver free from the accumulation of fat and harmful toxic buildup. Too much fat in your liver can lead to serious conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Studies suggest that choline may also boost your overall energy levels and improve your mood, sleep, and recovery after physical exercise. Choline is also fundamental to healthy muscle nerve functioning, so it may help prevent fatigue and muscle aches post-exercise. Your liver produces some amount of choline, but you need to obtain most of your daily requirements through your diet. Foods such as meats, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, and vegetables all contain choline, but how much you can absorb will depend on your age, digestive system, and overall health. A choline-based liver supplement can help ensure that you meet your body's daily choline needs. Why Are Liver Supplements Important? Despite its major role in our overall health, we tend to overlook the well-being of the liver. This vital organ works day and night tirelessly to purify our bodies, rid us of harmful toxins, and ensure the proper breakdown and metabolism of all essential nutrients: fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Sadly, chronic stress, busy lifestyles, and unhealthy habits like eating processed foods, alcohol consumption, and substance misuse take a toll on liver health over time. Many people today have liver-related diseases, sometimes without even knowing it, as is often the case with the early stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. While maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and practicing self-care are the best ways to maximize liver health, these aren't always sustainable. Sometimes life just gets in the way. This is where liver health supplements come in. Incorporating them into your daily routine is a clinically proven and hassle-free solution to prevent liver damage, encourage liver detox, and keep your liver healthy for as long as possible. How To Choose a Good Liver Support Supplement How can you tell which are the best liver supplements for you? The first and most important step is to consider your current liver health status and consult with a medical professional. Beyond that, you should know what green and red flags to watch out for in a quality liver health supplement. Here are some of them: Ingredients Always go for liver health supplements with clinically proven and science-backed ingredients, whether natural or pharmacological. The best formulas are non-GMO, third-party tested for purity and potency, and free from unnecessary additives, preservatives, and other nasties. Ingredients that are proven to positively affect liver function include: - Milk thistle - Turmeric - Ginger - Artichoke extract - Dandelion root - Alpha lipoic acid - Beetroot - L-cysteine - Choline - Vitamin E - Zinc - Selenium Of course, no liver supplement will contain all of these compounds, and a longer ingredients list doesn't necessarily mean that a product is better than a competitor with a carefully selected and finely balanced blend of three or four ingredients. Label Transparency The quality of the labeling is a good indicator of the quality of a liver supplement. Look for clear, easy-to-read labels with full ingredient lists and clear dosage indications. Some not-so-reputable liver supplement companies like to hide behind \"proprietary formulas\" that don't tell you much \u2014 or anything \u2014 about what actually is going in your body. Honest Advertisement Reputable and trustworthy companies are honest about what their liver health supplements can and cannot do and stay away from exaggerated claims. If the health benefits advertised on the label or the company website sound too good to be true, they probably are. Company Reputation Always opt for well-established brands with a proven track record of formulating safe and effective liver detox products and other supplements. Too many weeks-old companies with questionable expertise try to capitalize on the latest health and wellness fads, one of which happens to be liver support supplements. Country of Manufacture The United States, Canada, the UK, and the European Union have the highest standards for health and wellness products globally, including liver detox supplements. Always check where the product was made. If it was produced in the U.S., check that it was in an FDA-registered and GMP-certified facility. Price and Value Most liver health supplements aren't cheap. Good brands start at around $20-$30 per bottle, and the premium ones can go much higher. While there is some correlation between the price and the quality of a liver supplement, expensive doesn't always mean better. Do your research and consult with your physician before buying \u2014 you can almost always find a decent balance between quality and cost, especially if you make use of the many discount and subscription offers out there. Also, remember that even the best liver detox supplement isn't worth your money if you aren't going to take it consistently. Money-Back Guarantee Reputable companies will offer a money-back guarantee if you find that their liver detox supplement doesn't work for you. Look for products with a 30-day money-back guarantee at a minimum. Customer Reviews Customer reviews are a great way to gauge the efficacy of a liver support supplement, but take the reviews brands post on their own websites and social media with a grain of salt. Instead, look to neutral sources such as public forums or medical journals. Bioavailability Bioavailability is a measure of how much of a nutrient your body is able to absorb. Some nutrients, as well as some forms of the same nutrient, are easier to absorb than others. For instance, magnesium is available as magnesium: - Bisglycinate - Chloride - Citrate - Sulphate - Taurate Some of these are more bioavailable and can have different health benefits. If you are unsure of the bioavailability of a certain liver health supplement, ask your doctor for advice. Natural Ways To Detox Your Liver Taking liver health supplements isn't the only way to keep your liver healthy. Here are some natural ways to detox your liver and improve liver function: Eat a Healthy Diet Maintaining a nutritious and well-balanced diet is probably the best way to support your liver health. Avoid sugar, simple carbs, processed foods, and fast food as much as possible. Instead, focus on eating fruits, vegetables, nuts, eggs, fish, fermented foods like yogurt, and lean meats. Foods that specifically promote liver health include those that contain glutathione's building blocks, such as garlic, onion, watermelon, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and brussels sprouts. You also want to limit the intake of bad fats and increase the consumption of good fats. Fatty acids play a vital role in maintaining your liver cells healthy, and unsaturated fats \u2014 like the ones found in avocados and olives \u2014 may help lower \"bad\" cholesterol levels, increase \"good HDL\" cholesterol, and prevent your arteries from clogging. On the flip side, consuming too much saturated fat can block your arteries and harm liver health. Drink More Water Hydration is vital to your overall health and maintaining a healthy liver. Make it a habit to drink water or unsweetened caffeine-free tea throughout the day to keep your body properly hydrated and prevent toxin buildups in your liver and digestive system. Get Enough Sleep Sleep deprivation is a common cause of poor liver health. Research shows that people who sleep less than six hours a night are at a much higher risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and other conditions like depression, anxiety, obesity, and heart disease. For optimal liver function and overall health, ensure you are getting seven to eight hours of sleep a day. Exercise Regularly Keeping active is essential to staying optimally healthy and can even improve your overall health and relieve the symptoms of many conditions. Exercise also reduces stress, improves your mood, boosts energy levels, and helps you maintain a healthy weight. An ample body of research shows that regular exercise can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and more. Crucially for your liver, exercising increases blood flow to your internal organs, which increases the amount of available nutrients and helps flush out toxins. Quit Smoking If you're a smoker, the best investment you can make in your health is quitting smoking or, at the very least, drastically reducing how much you smoke. Smoking doesn't just affect your lungs - it harms your whole body. Nicotine in your bloodstream makes it harder for your liver to flush out toxins. Over time, this causes your liver to become inefficient and sluggish. But nicotine isn't the only culprit. Cigarettes also contain other toxic chemicals that can cause liver damage over time, such as tar, ammonia, acetone, benzene, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide. Limit Alcohol Consumption Excess alcohol consumption is a surefire way to damage your liver. If you drink too much for too long, you can develop chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and more. For optimal liver health, limit your alcohol intake as much as possible. If you already suffer from a liver condition, discuss with your doctor how you can stop drinking altogether. Don't Abuse Medications or Drugs Even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen can have serious side effects, including possible liver damage, if you use them too much or too often. Some medications can cause allergies, cause liver inflammation, or interact with other drugs or nutrients, causing them to become toxic. Avoid Sugar Research shows that sugar plays an unfortunate role in virtually every type of liver disease. Excessive sugar consumption can result in weight gain and insulin resistance, both of which contribute to poor liver health. With this in mind, avoid sugar as much as you can. If you crave something sweet, substitute processed sugary foods with fresh or dried fruit in moderate amounts. Practice Intermittent Fasting Intermittent fasting is the practice of abstaining from all food and calorie intake for a specific window of time each day \u2014 usually, between 16 to 20 hours. A number of recent studies suggest that longer periods of fasting cause liver cells to make more of a certain protein associated with lower levels of liver fat and improved sugar metabolism. Periods without eating also allow your body and liver to repair damaged tissue, flush out toxins, and destroy compromised cells instead of focusing on digesting food. While more research may be needed, these findings seem promising. However, always talk to your doctor before trying intermittent fasting if you have a medical condition, and start easy. The 16-hour fast is a good introduction to intermittent fasting for beginners. Give it a try for a couple of weeks, and see how you feel. When your body is ready, you can gradually increase the fasting window to 18 or 20 hours. Just make sure you are consuming enough calories and nutrients for the whole day during your eating period. Frequently Asked Questions About Liver Health Supplements Here are the answers to commonly asked questions about liver detox supplements: Is Taking Liver Supplements Safe? Taking liver supplements can be safe under medical supervision and when taking supplements from reputable companies. Always consult with your physician or another medical professional before taking liver supplements, even if they are natural, and follow medical guidelines. Certain dietary supplements can cause liver damage, on their own or through interactions with other drugs or nutrients, and should be used with caution. Does Apple Cider Vinegar Flush Out Your Liver? While your body can normally detoxify itself and doesn't need much extra help if you are in good health, consuming apple cider vinegar in moderation may have some health benefits and support liver health. There is a growing body of research on apple cider vinegar's impact on type 2 diabetes. In one small study, apple cider vinegar lowered blood glucose and insulin levels and increased the feeling of fullness after eating bread in 12 participants with diabetes. Are Liver Cleanse Supplements FDA Approved? Liver support supplements don't require FDA approval and aren't regulated by the FDA. The FDA does not have authorization to approve the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements. Businesses can market many supplements without even notifying the FDA. Always talk to your doctor before taking liver support or any other type of supplements and wellness products. What Are the Signs That I Need a Liver Cleanse? Some signs you may need liver detox include: - Fatigue - Headaches - Frequent sugar cravings - Blood sugar issues - Irregular bowel movements - Allergies or sensitivities to food or chemicals - Intolerance to strong smells such as perfumes - Weakened immune response - Skin irritations or other issues like breakouts, acne, or rashes - Unpleasant body odor or bad breath - White or yellow-coated tongue - High levels of stress or anxiety - Stubborn weight gain, especially around the abdomen - Mood swings - Abdominal gas and bloating - Poor digestion - Nausea after fatty meals Should Alcoholics Take a Liver Supplement? People who abuse alcohol tend not to consume or absorb the essential nutrients their bodies require for optimal health. As a result, people suffering from alcoholism often experience malnutrition and nutrient deficiency, both of which are leading causes of liver inflammation and damage. Liver support supplements like milk thistle can provide struggling livers with some protection against alcohol-related damage and liver disease. At the same time, many liver supplements contain essential nutrients that not only improve liver function but also support other vital physiological functions and promote overall health. What Is Chronic Liver Disease? Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a gradual deterioration of liver function and destruction of liver tissue lasting more than six months. Liver conditions in this category include cirrhosis and fibrosis of the liver. Final Thoughts on Liver Supplements Liver support supplements can help you maintain a healthy liver and improve your overall health. However, not just any liver supplement will do. Before buying any liver health product, be sure to do thorough research, consult with a medical professional, and always consider your current health status. Keep in mind, too, that there are many natural ways to keep your liver and body healthy and thriving and that even the best liver supplements can't make up for a poor diet, insufficient sleep, and a lack of regular exercise.
