[Hand sanitizers consumers should not use](#products) in Brief](/news-events/press-announcements/fda-brief-fda-withdrawing-temporary-guidances-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizers) [10/28/2021] FDA is alerting health care professionals and consumers of artnaturals voluntary [recall](/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/artnaturalsr-issues-voluntary-recall-limited-batches-8oz-bottles-scent-free-hand-sanitizer-due) of limited batches of 8 oz bottles of Scent Free Hand Sanitizer. [10/4/2021] FDA has tested certain artnaturals scent free hand sanitizer labeled with \"DIST. by artnaturals Gardena, CA 90248\" and found unacceptable levels of benzene, acetaldehyde, and acetal contaminants. The agency urges consumers not to use this contaminated product and has added artnaturals hand sanitizer products to the [list](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use#products) of hand sanitizers consumers should not use. To date, artnaturals has not responded to multiple FDA attempts to discuss the contaminated hand sanitizers, including identification of the manufacturer, possible recalls, and the scope of the contamination. Therefore, as of October 4, FDA is urging consumers not to use any artnaturals hand sanitizers. Benzene may cause certain types of cancer in humans. Animal studies show acetaldehyde may cause cancer in humans and may cause serious illness or death. Acetal can irritate the upper respiratory tract, eyes, and skin. While the exact risk from using hand sanitizer containing benzene, acetaldehyde, or acetal is unknown, FDA recommends consumers do not use products contaminated with unacceptable levels of benzene, acetaldehyde, or acetal. Consumers who have products on this [list of hand sanitizers](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-methanol#products) should immediately stop using the product and dispose of it, ideally in a [hazardous waste container](https://www.epa.gov/hw/household-hazardous-waste-hhw). Do not pour these products down the drain or flush them. Contact your [local waste management and recycling center](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/links-hazardous-waste-programs-and-us-state-environmental-agencies) for more information on hazardous waste disposal. FDA reminds [consumers](/consumers/consumer-updates/safely-using-hand-sanitizer) to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. If soap and water are not readily available, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) (CDC) recommend consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol (also referred to as ethyl alcohol). FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA's [MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting](/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) program (please provide the agency with as much information as possible to identify the product): [3/25/2021: UPDATE - FDA warns consumers not to use Durisan Antimicrobial Solutions recalled Hand Sanitizer Alcohol-Free due to microbial contamination](#64fb1485890c9) [3/25/2021] FDA is warning consumers and health care professionals not to use Durisan Antimicrobial Solutions Hand Sanitizer manufactured by Sanit Technologies LLC doing business as Durisan in Sarasota, Florida, due to microbial contamination.

Individuals with compromised immune systems are at increased risk. Infection can occur with use of the contaminated hand sanitizer by consumers or by health care professionals who may also transmit the contaminating bacteria to patients. Use of this contaminated hand sanitizer by health care professionals who tend to an at-risk patient, such as one with cystic fibrosis, could lead to adverse events ranging from a localized infection to lung or bloodstream infections, which could require patient hospitalization or extend an existing hospitalization. The agency has updated its [do-not-use list of hand sanitizers](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use#products) to include Durisan's contaminated hand sanitizers. Durisan's hand sanitizer, which contains benzalkonium chloride as an active ingredient, is available online and in retail stores. Consumers who have products on the [list of hand sanitizers](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-methanol#products) with potential contamination should immediately stop using the product and dispose of it, ideally in a [hazardous waste container](https://www.epa.gov/hw/household-hazardous-waste-hhw).

FDA is not aware of any adverse events related to Durisan's hand sanitizer products. FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA's [MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) program (please provide the agency with as much information as possible to identify the product): [1/26/2021: PRESS RELEASE - Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Takes Action to Place All Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers from Mexico on Import Alert to Help Prevent Entry of Violative and Potentially Dangerous Products into U.S., Protect U.S. Consumers](#64fb148589169) [1/19/2021: UPDATE - FDA Provides Policy for Testing of Alcohol (Ethanol) and Isopropyl Alcohol for Methanol, Including During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency ](#64fb14858925c) [1/19/2021] Today, FDA issued a [guidance](/media/145262/download?attachment) outlining the agency's policy for drug manufacturers and compounders to test alcohol or isopropyl alcohol for methanol contamination prior to using the alcohol to produce drugs, including hand sanitizer products. Methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for any drug and should not be used due to its toxic effects. The policy outlined in this guidance applies to all pharmaceutical alcohol used as an active or inactive ingredient in a drug, including hand sanitizer under the FDA's temporary policies for preparing alcohol-based hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, consistent with FDA's temporary policies for hand sanitizer prepared during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA does not intend to take action against firms preparing hand sanitizer under the temporary policies that have not tested each lot of pharmaceutical alcohol for methanol, if the firms use alcohol they have produced themselves (e.g. distilleries that manufacture their own hand sanitizer from alcohol they produce) and do not procure it from an outside source. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) revised the Alcohol (ethyl alcohol) monograph on September 1, 2020, and established a limit for methanol in alcohol of 200 parts per million (ppm). Generally, all manufacturers and compounders that produce drugs containing ethanol must conduct the limit test for methanol, using the test method that appears in the USP Alcohol monograph. Ethanol used to manufacturer hand sanitizer products under FDA's temporary policies should contain no more than the interim methanol impurity level of 630 ppm to be consistent with those policies. The test method for methanol described in the USP [Alcohol](https://www.uspnf.com/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/revisions/alcohol-rb-notice-20200817.pdf) Monograph can also be used to test for methanol contamination in isopropyl alcohol. While USP has not yet updated the Isopropyl Alcohol Monograph to include a specific methanol limit, FDA may consider the 200 ppm methanol limit for ethanol to also be suitable for isopropyl alcohol. The agency also reminds manufacturers of their ongoing obligation, in accordance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to take all appropriate actions to prevent unsafe levels of methanol in drugs, including, but not limited to, purchasing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol from a reliable supplier, completing proper testing of alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and reviewing finished product test methods to verify the testing distinguishes between the active ingredient and methanol. Additionally, any repackers who distribute hand sanitizers and other ethanol or isopropyl alcohol-based drugs, should know who they are purchasing from and conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure the drugs they sell are safe for consumers. [8/27/2020 PRESS RELEASE - COVID-19 Update: FDA Warns Consumers About Hand Sanitizer Packaged in Food and Drink Containers](#64fb148589310) [8/24/2020: UPDATE - FDA provides testing method to assess the quality of hand sanitizer products for impurities](#64fb1485893c7) [8/24/2020] FDA is providing a [laboratory testing method](/media/141501/download?attachment) to assess the quality of finished hand sanitizer products. This testing method can be used to help assure hand sanitizers contain the correct ingredients and do not contain harmful levels of impurities. The testing method (with appropriate validation) can be used for hand sanitizers labeled with either alcohol (ethanol) or isopropyl alcohol (also called isopropanol or 2-propanol) as the active ingredient and can screen for potentially harmful impurities, as listed in FDA's temporary guidances. Testing ethanol for methanol contamination is a quality standard set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) for alcohol used in pharmaceuticals (including hand sanitizers) and enforced by FDA pursuant to section 501(b) of the FD&C Act. USP's revision bulletin for [alcohol](https://www.uspnf.com/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/revisions/alcohol-rb-notice-20200817.pdf) and [dehydrated alcohol](https://www.uspnf.com/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/revisions/dehydrated-alcohol-rb-notice-20200817.pdf) monographs outlines this testing requirement, official as of September 1, 2020, which FDA [requested](https://www.uspnf.com/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/usp-nf-notices/fda-letter-alcohols-nitr-att.pdf) to protect health care providers and consumers from using dangerous hand sanitizer products. The agency's investigation of contaminated hand sanitizers is ongoing. [8/12/2020] FDA is warning consumers and health care professionals about certain hand sanitizer products, including those manufactured by Harmonic Nature S de RL de MI in Mexico, that are labeled to contain ethanol or isopropyl alcohol but have tested positive for 1-propanol contamination. 1-propanol, not to be confused with 2-propanol/isopropanol/isopropyl alcohol, is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizer products marketed in the United States and can be toxic and life-threatening when ingested. The agency urges consumers not to use these 1-propanol-contaminated products and has expanded its do-not-use list of hand sanitizers at [www.fda.gov/unsafehandsanitizers](/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use) to include hand sanitizers that are or may be contaminated with 1-propanol, in addition to other hand sanitizers the agency is urging consumers not to use. Young children who accidentally ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk. Ingesting 1-propanol can cause central nervous system (CNS) depression, which can result in death. Symptoms of 1-propanol exposure can include confusion, decreased consciousness, and slowed pulse and breathing. Animal studies indicate that the central nervous system depressant effects of 1-propanol are 2 to 4 times as potent as alcohol (ethanol). Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing 1-propanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate care for treatment of toxic effects of 1-propanol poisoning. Skin or eye exposure to 1-propanol can result in irritation, and rare cases of allergic skin reactions have been reported. Consumers who have products on the [list of hand sanitizers](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-methanol#products) with potential methanol or 1-propanol contamination should immediately stop using the product and dispose of it, ideally in a [hazardous waste container](https://www.epa.gov/hw/household-hazardous-waste-hhw). Do not pour these products down the drain or flush them. Contact your [local waste management and recycling center](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/links-hazardous-waste-programs-and-us-state-environmental-agencies) for more information on hazardous waste disposal. The agency continues to add certain hand sanitizers to the [import alert](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1166.html) to stop these products from legally entering the U.S. market and has issued warning letters to companies that violate federal law. FDA reminds [consumers](/consumers/consumer-updates/safely-using-hand-sanitizer) to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. If soap and water are not readily available, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) (CDC) recommend consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol (also referred to as ethyl alcohol). FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA's [MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting](/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) program (please provide the agency with as much information as possible to identify the product): [8/7/2020: UPDATE - FDA Includes Methanol Testing in Temporary Policies for Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers](#64fb148589519) [8/7/2020] Today, FDA issued updated guidances to provide additional clarification on testing of alcohol used in hand sanitizers manufactured under FDA's temporary policies to help ensure that harmful levels of methanol are not present in these products. This will help ensure widespread access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers that are free of contamination. FDA has updated our guidances to provide clarification that companies test each lot of the active ingredient (ethanol or isopropyl alcohol (IPA)) for methanol if the ethanol or IPA is obtained from another source. FDA recommends using the test methods described in the USP monograph for alcohol (ethanol) and conducting the testing in a laboratory that has been previously inspected by FDA and is compliant with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). Additionally, any alcohol (ethanol) or IPA found to contain more than 630 ppm methanol does not fall within the policies described in the temporary guidances and may be considered evidence of substitution and/or contamination. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers that are contaminated with methanol are subject to adulteration charges under the FD&C Act. The alcohol (ethanol) or IPA should be destroyed following guidelines for hazardous waste and the manufacturer or compounder should contact FDA regarding the test results and the alcohol's source. The temporary guidances have also been updated to provide adverse event reporting guidelines for state-licensed pharmacies and outsourcing facilities. The agency also included an additional denaturant formula in the temporary guidances. Denaturing alcohol in hand sanitizers is critical to deter children from unintentional ingestion. Consumer and health care professional safety is a top priority for FDA, and an important part of FDA's mission is to protect the public from harm, especially as we seek to help increase hand sanitizer supply. For questions, contact FDA: [COVID-19-Hand-Sanitizers@fda.hhs.gov](mailto:COVID-19-Hand-Sanitizers@fda.hhs.gov). [7/31/2020] FDA continues to find issues with certain hand sanitizer products. FDA test results show certain hand sanitizers have concerningly low levels of ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, which are active ingredients in hand sanitizer products. The agency urges consumers not to use these subpotent products and has expanded its [list](#products) to include subpotent hand sanitizers, in addition to hand sanitizers that are or may be contaminated with [methanol](#products) The agency continues to add certain hand sanitizers to [import alert](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1166.html) to stop these products from legally entering the U.S. market. FDA reminds [consumers](/consumers/consumer-updates/safely-using-hand-sanitizer) to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. If soap and water are not readily available, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) (CDC) recommend consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol (also referred to as ethyl alcohol). Additionally, FDA reminds consumers that no drugs, including hand sanitizers, are approved to prevent the spread of COVID-19. FDA encourages health ce professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA's [MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting](/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) program (please provide the agency with as much information as possible to identify the product): [7/27/2020 PRESS RELEASE - Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Reiterates Warning About Dangerous Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers Containing Methanol, Takes Additional Action to Address Concerning Products](#64fb148589672) [7-2-2020] FDA is warning consumers and health care providers that the agency has seen a sharp increase in [hand sanitizer products](#products) that are labeled to contain ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) but that have tested positive for methanol contamination. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin or ingested and can be life-threatening when ingested. The agency is aware of adults and children ingesting hand sanitizer products contaminated with methanol that has led to recent adverse events including blindness, hospitalizations and death. Methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizers and must not be used due to its toxic effects. FDA's investigation of methanol in certain hand sanitizers is ongoing. The agency will provide additional information as it becomes available. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate treatment for potential reversal of toxic effects of methanol poisoning. Substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although all persons using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who accidently ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute, are most at risk. FDA reminds [consumers](/consumers/consumer-updates/safely-using-hand-sanitizer) to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. If soap and water are not readily available, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) (CDC) recommend consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol (also referred to as ethyl alcohol). FDA remains vigilant and will continue to take action when quality issues arise with hand sanitizers. The agency is especially concerned with: - The dangers of drinking any hand sanitizer under any conditions. While hand sanitizers with possible methanol contamination are more life-threatening than those that are not contaminated, FDA urges consumers not to drink any of these products. - Certain hand sanitizers that may not contain a sufficient amount of ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. - Hand sanitizers that are sold or offered for sale with false and misleading, unproven claims that they can prevent the spread of viruses such as COVID-19, including claims that they can provide prolonged protection (e.g., for up to 24-hours). - Products that are fraudulently marketed as \"FDA-approved\" since there are no hand sanitizers approved by FDA. - Products packaged to appear as drinks, candy or liquor bottles, as well as products marketed as drinks or cocktails because their appearance could result in accidental ingestion or encourage ingestion. Children are particularly at risk with these products since ingesting only a small amount of hand sanitizer may be lethal in a young child. - Products labeled with harmful or poisonous ingredients, such as methanol. FDA is aware of reports of adverse events associated with hand sanitizer products. FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA's [MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) program (please provide the agency with as much information as possible to identify the product): [7/2/2020 PRESS RELEASE - FDA Takes Action to Warn, Protect Consumers from Dangerous Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers Containing Methanol](#64fb1485897c8) FDA urges consumers not use certain hand sanitizer products The following chart outlines the information on hand sanitizer labels for consumers to use to identify a product that: - Has been tested by FDA and found to contain methanol, 1-propanol, benzene, acetaldehyde, or acetal. - Is labeled to contain methanol. - Has been tested and is found to have microbial contamination. - Is being recalled by the manufacturer or distributor. - Is subpotent, meaning it has less than the required amount of ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or benzalkonium chloride. - Is purportedly made at the same facility as products that have been tested by FDA and found to contain methanol, 1-propanol, benzene, acetaldehyde, or acetal. - Is packaged in a container that resembles a food/beverage container that presents increased risk of accidental ingestion. - Is made at a facility that did not respond to multiple FDA requests for information about the quality of their products and manufacturing process. FDA advises consumers not to use hand sanitizers produced by the manufacturers identified in the table below. Consumers can easily identify which hand sanitizer products to avoid by using the following information: - The names of the specific manufacturers. - NDC number, which may also be located on the product label. - The name of the distributors that sell, or sold, or had planned to sell specific hand sanitizers products produced by these manufacturers. Distributors may use more than one manufacturer to produce their hand sanitizer products, which are then marketed under the exact same brand or product name. Distributors often do not identify the manufacturer on the product label and are not required to do so under federal law. Consumers should be aware that FDA's recommendation against using a distributor's specific hand sanitizer product(s) manufactured by a particular manufacturer, as listed below, does not extend to: - A distributor's products bearing the same brand name as listed below, but made by a different manufacturer - Other products distributed by the same distributor If a product on the list below does not identify the manufacturer on the label, consumers can contact the distributor whose name appears on the label to find out who manufactured the product. If the distributor refuses to clarify this information when contacted by a consumer, FDA advises consumers not to use that product.
