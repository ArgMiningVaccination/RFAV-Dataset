Huber, Ph.D. President THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THE COLLEGE| 7 LEGACY Nano Nagle founded the Presentation Sisters in Ireland in 1775. She began her ministry by teaching children, which was against the law at that time. Her belief in the power and importance of education has spanned the centuries and continues to shape the ministry of the Presentation Sisters around the world. Education is the underlying fabric that weaves itself into all of the Presentation ministries. Mother John Hughes, Mother Agnes Hughes and Sister Teresa Chal loner, Presentation Sisters from Ireland, arrived in Dakota Territory on March 19, 1880. They came at the request of Bishop Martin Marty, to teach children of the Lakota Sioux and of the European settlers. During the next two years, their journey in pursuit of this missionary call to teach took them Wheeler, Deadwood and Yankton. Their next stop was in Fargo, where they remained for four years. In 1886, Fr. Robert Haire invited the Presentation Sisters to open the first school in Aberdeen. An education ministry that has spanned more than 125 years began when Mother John Hughes, Mother Aloysius Chriswell and Sister Joseph Butler responded to this invitation. Presentation Academy opened on Octobe r 15, 1888. The Academy offered education for children in kindergarten through grade eight, fine arts including music, piano, organ, needlework, as well as typing, shorthand and bookkeeping. In a foreshadowing of Presentation College, the academy also offered teacher training. Two hundred and thirty-two Presentation Sister teachers have touched the lives of over 300,000 students over the years. Today, the Presentation Sisters can be found ministering to the n eeds of those in all walks of life, yet they remain grounded i n their first ministry: education. The Presentation Sisters of Aber deen are the only Presentation Sisters to sponsor a college. Msgr. John Brady established Notre Dame Junior College in 1922, in Mitchell, South Dakota. Presentation Sisters staffed the Junior College as well as Notre Dame Academy, which educated students in grades 1-12. The Presentation Sisters relied on the Junior College to provide an education for their young members. Due to financial difficulties and concerns about accreditation, the ownership of the College was given to the Sisters in August 1951, and the College moved to Aberdeen. The name was changed to Presentation Junior College. In 1965, the College was officially incorporated as Presentation College, an entity separate from the Presentation Sisters, although the Sisters continu ed their sponsorship. The mission of the Sisters is to go where there is the greatest need. In the early 1900's, the Aberdeen area experienced diphth eria and typhoid epidemics. The Sisters began providing health care for those afflicted. In 1901, the Sisters opened St. Luke's Hospital in Aberdeen. This health care ministry continued to grow. St. Luke's School of Nursing was soon established. Sisters Mary Margaret Grainer, Peter Buckley and Vincent Hennessy were members of the first graduating class in 1904. In 1942, the four Presentation Schools of Nursing combined to form one Central School of Nurs ing at St. Luke's Hospital in Aberdeen. In 1962, the School of Nursing affiliated with Presen tation Junior College. This affiliation led to the eventual designation of Presentation College as a specialty Health Science Baccalaureate Institution. Offering degrees primarily in health related fields, Presentation College thus represents the convergence of the two ministries , which have been the focus of the Presentation Sisters since the early years of their ministry in South Dakota - education and health care. In 1988, the Presentation Sisters adopted a new mission statement, which was faithful to the Gospel values of their Foundress, Nano Nagle, and of their authentic spiritual and service tradition. This mission is to do works of justice, alleviating oppress ion and promoting human dignity, especially among the poor; and to o ffer Good News proclaimed in a spirit of love, zeal and joy. The Sisters specifically noted that this mission was to be applied to each of their ministries. Soon after this mission statement was adopted, the Leadership of the Presentation Sisters affirmed that the mission was present in the mission and philosophy of Presentation College. As sponsors, the Sisters promote their mission and values within the College. Many sisters are active as members of the Board o f Trustees as well as in supporting campus activities and providing educational support services such as tutoring and prayer ministries. THE COLLEGE THE COLLEGE| 8 HISTORY Presentation College has been continuously accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (previously known as the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools) since 1971. Presentation College conferred a diploma on its graduates until 1966 when the College began to confer associate degrees in Arts and in Science. In 1990, the College was accredited to also offer four-year professional baccalaureate programs. In 1980, the Cheyenne River Lakota Nursing School at Eagl e Butte, South Dakota, a satellite of the nursing program of Presentation College, enrolled the first class of Native Americ an students. In 1991, the name of the school was changed to Presentation College-Lakota Campus. The athletics program began in 1995 and continues to grow and ex pand. The 1,200-seat Strode Activity Center was dedicated in 1998 as the home of Saints Athletics. The College participated in athletics at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NC AA) Division III level until April 2013 when it became an approved member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Presentation College offers male and female students th e opportunity to participate in a number of sports including basketball, soccer, softball, baseball, volleyball, and football. A new student housing complex opened in 1999, featuring suites that are on a space-available basis, with private bedrooms, semi-private bathrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and Internet access. Distance learning programs at the College were added in 2000 under the umbrella known as PC Virtual. PC Virtual currently includes distance-based programs in a variety of areas. The clas sroom work for these programs is offered completely online to students who reside in states where Presentation College has received state approval to operate. In 2003, Presentation College-Fairmont Campus was opened in the community of Fairmont, Minnesota. In 2006, Presentation College offered programs within the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, area on the campus of Kilian College. The College moved its Sioux Falls offerings to an independent location in Sioux Falls in May 2013. In the 2011-2012 academic year, the College completed a renova tion of its chemistry, biology, anatomy and physiology and athletic training lab facilities. During that time period, th e College also invested in infrastructure and programming by constructing a practice football field with artificial turf and by expanding the Strode athletic facility to accommodate the addition of football as a conference sport. In November 2012, Presentation College began construction on a multi-million dollar student su ites housing facility and an athletic training and wellness center. In addition to the new suites and wellness center, construction includes a campus beautification project to move all roads and parking to the perimeter of the campus and create a central campus green. The College, in 1998, received the ABBY Award for Community Involvement; in 2002, the Outstanding Rural Health Program Award from the National Rural Health Association recognizing SEED (Skills Enhancement & Education Through Distance Learning); and in 2008, the Corporation for National and Community Service named Presentation College to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. MISSION Welcoming people of all faiths, Presentation College challenges learners toward academic excellence and, in the Catholic tradition, the development of the whole person. CORE VALUES Catholic Tradition Drawing upon a 2,000-year-old Catholic tradition, Presentation College has a rigorous commitment to the pursuit of truth in harmony with a deep appreciation for the spiritual life. The most basic tenet of the Catholic intellectual tradition, as it rel ates to higher education, is the manner in which faith, knowledge and reason complement each other. Presentation College offers an education of continuing scholarship, seeking the truth. That tradition permeates the curriculum, student life and core values o f the College. Inherent in both the tradition of the Church and in the mission of the Presentation Sisters is a sincere commitment to social justice, which includes respect for the dignity of the individual. This commitment is expressed in service and is a special hallmark of a Presentation College education. THE COLLEGE| 9 At Presentation College, we express the Catholic intellectual trad ition through the integration of faith and reason, in the lif e-giving presence of Presentation people worldwide, in a particular knowledge of and respect for social justice principles, and in the milieu cha racterized by the search for meaning and for God. We are proud of our Catholic symbols of spirituality an d joyfully invite all to share in our liturgical life. We aspire to social justice principles and to practicing so cial justice in our dealings with each other and society. We are committed to service to each other and to the broader community. We provide opportunities for spiritual development and for service. Learning Community The charism of the Presentation Sisters of the Blessed Virgin Mary extends itself thro ugh Presentation College. Inspired by the love and zeal of Nano Nagle, the College welcomes all people in the spirit of hospitality to include warmth, acceptance and gratitude. Presentation College is committed to intentionally serving and learning with all who seek relationship within the context of th e College.

We value our diversity as well as shared events and rituals that symbolize our common purpose and unity. Whole Person Education Presentation College believes that an effective, comprehensive education will encompass the spiritual, intellectual, socio- cultural, emotional, environmental, physical and career dimensions of the whole person. At Presentation College, we recognize that students are whole persons.

In our commitment to whole person education, we call forth from our community an intrin sic reverence for life and a passionate love of learning. Our students are well prepared, upon graduation, to enter their chosen professions, fully utilize their talents and assume roles as servant leaders. Education of Distinction Presentation College is the only college, worldwide, which is sp onsored by a congregation of Presentation Sisters of the Blesse d Virgin Mary. A vital aspect of the legacy of the Presentation Sisters is excell ence in teaching and in healing. Honoring that legacy, as wel l as the sponsorship of the Presentation Sisters, is the basis for an education of distinction at Presentation College. Presentation Sisters value hospitality and practice social justic e and those values are a distinctive part of the Presentation College learning community. As Presentation people, we joyfully teach, learn and serve. At Presentation College, we believe that our learning community mu st be permeated by our mission and values, and enriched by th e legacy of the Presentation Sisters in order to offer an Education of Distinction. At Presentation College, we believe that each academic divisi on and program must identify its own path to distinction. Inherent in that path is an education that is academic ally challenging to each student. At Presentation College, we believe that the process of sel f-reflection and of continuous improvement is essential. The significant accreditations held by Presentation College pr ovide external validation of our excellence. Resourcefulness Presentation College has been a leader in health care education, in establishing outreach campuses, in utilizing technology and in offering on-line education. Based on that history of innovati on and of responding to needs, Presentation College continues t o embrace creativity, originality, imagination and vision to promote resourcefulness. At Presentation College, we believe in persistence in the face of obstacles, rewarding fresh thinking, taking risks, providing time for quiet reflection, finding patterns in our information, sh ared communication, and inquisitive problem solving. The constant need to garner rare resources and the distance between campuses drive us to nurture ou r creativity and foster the conditions that promote creative action.

Students are responsible for their own actions and are expected to maintain the highest standards of conduct at all times and in all places affiliated with the College. Each student must, of course, respect the rights and privileges of all other students as well as College administrators, faculty and staff. The College reserves the right to dismiss from a course or from the College, or restrict from any other Co llege activity or facility, any student whose behavior is detrimental to the College or its students. For a full explanation of the College's Code of Conduct, read the Student Handbook. (Academic policies and procedures shall govern dismissal or suspension for academic reasons.) 15. In order to preserve the privacy, confidentiality, and comfort of other visitors and staff, cell phone use in the financialaid waiting areas and offices is prohibited except when necessar y to conduct business related to the student's visit. Students and other visitors are expected to complete their cell phone conversations, text messaging, and other use prior to entering the FAO and waiting area. 16. While the FAO staff is available to assist applicants throug h the application process, it is the applicant's responsibility to see to the correctness and completeness of his or her applications. If the applicant receives notification that his or her FAFSA or loan application is incomplete, he/she must determin e what is necessary to complete his or her application(s), and promptly submit the required information. 17. An application for financial aid will have no effect on the decision concerning admission. The admission decision is made without access or reference to financial aid data. 18. Students are required to provide their social security nu mbers on the FAFSA. Provision of the student ID or social security number (as specified on the individual document) is required on all supporting documents used to apply for financial aid. Students' social security numbers will be used for the College's system of student records, to process the FAFSA, to award financial aid, for compliance with federal and state reporting requirements, as well as for debt collection. The College will not disclose students' social security number s to anyone outside the institution, except as required or allowed by law, and will make every effort to protect students' privacy. 19. Policy on Non-Discrimination in Educational Programs. The College complies with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Older Americans Act of 1975, and South Dakota's laws against discrimination. These laws (and others) prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, affectional or sexual orientation, sex, famili al status, domestic partnership status, disability and handicap. Decisions on admission, financial aid programs, access to course offerings, or other aspects of the College's educational pr ograms or activities are not made on the basis of any of the aforementioned factors, except when lawf ul to do so. Inquiries regarding these laws may be submitted to the College's Director of Human Resources or to the U. S. Department of Education, Washington, DC 20201. 20. Additional Information: The administration and receipt of financial aid is a complex area governed by federal, state,and institutional regulations. Students who receive federal, stat e and/or institutional financial aid are subject to all of the governing regulations whether or not they are aware of thes e rules. For additional information about financial aid at Presentation College please visit the College's website at www.presentation.edu. The following U.S. Department of Education and other websites may also be of interest to financial aid applicants and recipients: www.fafsa.ed.gov www.irs.gov www .sss.gov www.studentloans.gov www.fastweb.com in th e Students' Rights and Responsib ilities are included in the financ ial aid glossary at the end of the financial aid section of the catalog. Attendance The College awards financial aid to students with the expectation that they will attend their classes for the entire semester. Full eligibility for financial aid cannot be confirmed until students have attended their classes beyond the midpoint of the semeste r. That is, students incrementally earn their financial aid during the early weeks of the semester and do not become fully eligibl e for their aid until the latter weeks of the semester. Students wh o withdraw from the College or otherwise stop attending their FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 22 classes may be required to immediately repay a portion of their fi nancial aid even if they have already paid for books or recei ved a refund and spent the money. When students fail to attend their classes they could leave the College owing money because their charges for tuition, fees, th e suites, and meal plan are higher than the amount of financial aid that they have earned. For information about the calculation (R2T4*) that the College is required to use to determine how much of the student's financial aid must be returned to the federa l government see the R2T4 section and the glossary at the end of this section. Students are advised to meet with a member of the Business Office or FAO to discuss the financial consequences of dropping out or withdrawing from the College before doing so. Fraud Falsification of documents and any other in formation that is used to determine elig ibility for financial aid is an extremely se rious criminal offense. Students who gain access to and are disbursed Title IV* financial aid based upon fraudulent information are subject to immediate repayment of those funds. Examples of fraud include, but are not limited to: 1. deliberately and willfully providing information that is inaccurate or materially incomplete 2. applying for Title IV* financial aid using someone else's identity 3. submitting FWS timecards that reflect time that the student did not work4. using Title IV* funds for non-educationally related expenses 5. making purchases in the bookstore for other students using Title IV* funds Students who falsify documents used to obtain financial aid are subject to disciplinary action which may include expulsion from the College. The College may refer any instance of suspected fraud to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of the Inspecto r General as well as to local law enforcement agencies. Title IV* regulations provide for the imposition of fines and impr isonment for those who are convicted of fraud. By signing the FAFSA* parents and students are acknowledging that \"if you purposely give false or misleading information, you may be fined up to $20,000, sent to prison, or both.\" Application Procedures To apply for financial aid, students must complete the Free App lication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)* for each year of their enrollment. Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.gov The FAFSA should be submitted as soon as possible after October 1 to secure the most favorable funding package. Presentation College's priority deadline date for submitting the FAFSA is March 1. The FAFSA is used to determine eligibility for federal, state, and institutional aid. In order to be considered for federal aid and most other forms of assistance the student must: 1. be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen; and2. have and provide a valid Social Security Number; and3. if a male between the ages of 18 and 26 register (or if older have registered) with Selective Service; and 4. have a high school diploma, its equivalent, or a General Education Development (GED); and 5. be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student; and6. be enrolled in an eligible certificate or degree program; and7. be enrolled in courses that are applicable to the eligible certificate or degree; and8. be enrolled for the required number of credits; and 9. not have a drug conviction for an offense that occurred while receiving Title IV* financial aid; and 10. not owe a refund on a federal grant; and11. not be in default on a federal student or parent loan; and12. demonstrate financial need* as applicable; and13. maintain satisfactory academic standing in accordance with federal and College policies; and 14. meet all other the eligibility requirements. Financial aid eligibility for courses that are applicable to the program When eligibility for financial aid is calculated, only those credits that are applicable to the student's degree program (and a ppear on the checklist) are counted. As an example, if a student is enrolled in six credits and three of those credits do not count t oward the student's program he is not eligible to receive a Direct loan, which requires a minimum enrollment in six program-eligible credits. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 23 Financial aid eligibility and completion of the baccalaureate degree or its equivalent Once students have completed the requirements for the baccalaurea te degree (or its equivalent), they are ineligible for Pell an d FSEOG grants, as well as PC athletic and merit scholarships. Students who have earned a baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from an institution outside the United States are also subject to this regulation. Students cannot prolong their eligibility by delaying receipt of their diplomas nor can they receive these grants and scholarships during their enrollment after having earned a baccalaureate degree. Deadlines The College uses deadlines for a number of reasons. Deadlines are primarily used to assist students in maximizing their funding by helping them to meet eligibility guidel ines for state, federal and other external financial aid programs. Deadlines are also used to allow the College sufficient time to process students' financial aid applications to allow them to plan for their enrollment. In addition, the College must adhere to deadlines that are imposed upon it by the state, federal, and other agencie s that provide funding to students. Financial aid applicants are subject to several types of deadlines and should understand the consequences of failure to submit information in a timely manner. In general, students who miss financial aid deadlines may be ineligible for funds that they would have otherwise received. The primary financial aid deadlines are listed below: 1. March 1 - Priority processing deadline. Students should submit their FAFSAs by March 1 (preceding the award year) in order to maximize their eligibility for funds from all fina ncial aid programs. Students who submit their FAFSAs after March 1 will be awarded financial aid on a funds-available basis. 2. March 31 - Scholarship deadline. Each year the College offers a number of donor scholarships. Application information and procedures are posted on the College's website. Most scholarships require that the student submit an essay along with an application for consideration. 3. First day of the fall, spring and summer semesters. In order to begin attending classes, students should have completed their FAFSAs and submitted all required documents. Students who do not complete their financial aid files by the first day of the semester are required to pay their account balances from their own resources. 4. Last day of enrollment. Students who fail to complete their financial aid files by submitting all required documents and information by their last day of enrollment during the academic year are ineligible for unprocessed financial aid. Students who delay the submission of financial aid information and documents until the final days of the semester may be ineligible because there is insufficient time to process their files. Students who wish to be considered for assistance from the Co llege's financial aid programs are encouraged to apply early and to submit all requested information and documents promptly. Census Date The amounts and types of students' financial aid awards are set on the College's census date each semester. The census date is generally the last day of the add/drop period. The student's enro llment as of the census date determines eligibility for the financial aid which has been awarded as of that date. For example, if a student begins the semester with twelve credits and the n after adding and dropping classes during the first two weeks of the semester is enrolled for nine credits on the census date, h is financial aid will be adjusted based upon nine credits. Awarding After the FAO reviews the student's financial aid file it may make an offer of one or more types of financial assistance in accordance with the student's eligibility. This offer of aid is called an award letter* and is made available electronically in the student's portal. Students may view and decline any aid that they do not wish to receive by selecting the My Financial Aid link available on the Student Portal at http://www.presentation.edu/students/ Students who wish to borrow less than the loan amount offered should send an em ail to financialaid@presentation.edu from their PC email account The FAO makes award offers to incoming students once they have been accepted to the College and have completed the financial aid process (which may include verification). The FAO also makes award offers to provisionally accepted students; however, funds can only be disbursed after all required documentation is received and they have been fully admitted. Returning students will receive an award offer once their registration for the upcoming semester has been confirmed, they have completed the financial aid process and their grades have been reviewed. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 24 Award Adjustments The College may make adjustments to students' financial aid awards at any time and without prior notification due to such factors as new or conflicting information in the student's file, decreases or increases in funding levels, modifications in pro gram eligibility rules and changes in the student's ability to qualify for financial assistance. The College may also adjust award amounts based upon the student's enrollment status at any time during the semester. Students should visit the FAO prior to adding or dropping courses to discuss the changes that will be made to the award offer. For most families the information provided on the FAFSA is a good indication of the financial resources that will be available during the year the student is enrolled in college. Sometimes th ere are changes in the student's household that are not reflect ed on the FAFSA and that decrease the resources that are available to pay for college. The most common changes are related to separation or divorce, major illness or injury, job loss, and death. The FAO may be able to assist when the student or family h as experienced these types of changes. Contact the FAO to confid entially discuss your circumstances and a staff member will determine if you meet the requirements to appeal for a review of the student's financial aid award. Financial Aid Disbursement The annual amount of financial aid (scholarships, grants and loans) is divided so that half of the award is disbursed for the f all semester and the remaining half is disbursed for the spring seme ster. Financial aid for students who enroll only for the spring and summer semesters and have eligibility is disbursed so that the students receive half for the spring and half for the summer . The College is required to review each st udent's enrollment and other eligibility criteria on the day that aid is disbursed to determine if the student is still eligible to receive the assistance. For example, a student who was awarded a loan based upon her credits at census date will not be eligible for the funds if sh e has dropped below six eligible credits on or before the date t he loan is disbursed. Students who are considering dropping or withdrawing from a class or classes should meet with a financial aid counselor before doing so. Summer Financial Aid Eligibility All of the sessions during the summer (from May to August) ar e combined to comprise the su mmer semester. Thus, a student who enrolls for three credits in the first six-week session and for an additional three credits in the second six-week session is considered to be enrolled in six credits for the summer seme ster. The summer is the third se mester of the academic year following the fall and spring semesters. Typically, students who enroll full-time (twelve credits or more) during each of the fall and spring semesters will consume all of their financial aid eligibility and will have no remaining funds for their summer enrollment. Students who enroll part-time (le ss than twelve credits) during one or both of the fall or spring semesters may have financial aid funds remaining for the summer semester, particularly if they are Pell Grant recipients. Students who want to be evaluated for summer financial aid eligibility should submit the College's summer financial aid application which is usually available in Ma rch and can be obtained on the web site. Social Security Use Policy The purpose of this policy is to define and describe the FAO's collection, retention, use, and disclosure of students' Social Security numbers. The policy is also intended to provide students with information that the FAO collects and uses Social Security numbers if specifically required by law to do so or if necessary for the performance of the College's duties and responsibilities. The U.S. Department of Education (the federal agency that provides and governs the Free Application for Federal Student Aid - FAFSA) requires applicants and students to provide their correc t Social Security number on the FAFSA. Students who fail or refuse to provide their correct Social Security number on the FAFSA are thereby ineligible for Title IV (federal) financial aid and may also be ineligible for other types of aid from the College as well as state agencies and other agencies. Provision of the student's Presentation Coll ege student ID number or Social Security number (as specified on the individual document) is also required on all supporting documents used to apply for financial aid. The student's Social Security number will be used for the College's system of student records, to process the FAFSA, to award financial aid, for compliance with federal and state reporting requirements, as well as for debt collection. The College will not disclose the student's Social Se curity number to anyone outside the institution, except as required by law, and will make every effort to protect the student's privac y. Students who fail or refuse to provide their Social Security nu mber or student ID number when requested will delay or prevent the processing of their financial aid. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 25 The U.S. Department of Education requires students to subm it their Social Security number when completing federal applications for student aid. The student's Social Security number is then used by the College to match applicants' records, verify eligibility, and to coordinate benefits with other programs. The FAO uses Social Security numbers to verify eligibility and disbursement requirements for federal, state, and institutional aid programs. As required by law, the College reports Social Security numbers for students receiving benefits from aid programs to various state and federal agencies. Agencies include but are not limited to Nebraska Student Loan Program, Inc., d/b/a Inceptia, the National Student Clearinghouse, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and the State of South Dakota. As required by law, and in performing the duties required to administer the financial aid programs, Presentation College releases students' Social Security numbers to vendors contracted by the College and external agencies to assist with compliance with federal and state requirements. The vendors and other agencies are authorized to use Social Security numbers to complete the tasks contractually required and are not authorized to use Social Security numbers for any other purpose. Currently, vendor s include (but are not limited to) the National Student Clearinghouse, Federal Family Educational Loan providers, guarantors and servicers of federal loans. The following statement may appear on and is applicable to all of the College's financial aid forms: *Social Security Number Policy: Federal regulations require that you provide your Social Security number (SSN) on the FAFSA. Provision of your Presentation Co llege student ID number or SSN (as specif ied on the individual document) is also required on all supporting documents used to apply for financial ai d. Your SSN will be used for the College's system of student records, to process your FAFSA, to award your financial aid, for compliance with federal and state reporting requirements, as well as for debt collection. The College will not disclose your SSN to anyone outside the institution, except as required or allowed by law, and will make every effort to protect your privac y. Failure to provide your SSN or student ID number on this form will delay or prevent the processing of your (insert name of form here). Verification Presentation College has established the following FAO policy and procedure to define and administer verification and correction of data that applicants submit on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and other documents used to apply for Title IV (or federal) funding, as well as several othe r types of financial assistance administered by the College. Al l recipients of Title IV funding (and other sources of funding as determined by the College) are governed by this policy as specified below. The verification policy is in accordance with and references the language from regulations, CFR 34, Section 668.51-61, promulgated under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended. The College adheres to federal policy, as set forth in HEA in the administration of verification for Title IV recipients, in all respects. The verification policy applies to the following types of Title IV aid administered by the College: Federal Pell Grant Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Work Study (FWS) Federal Direct Loan (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The verification policy may also be applied to other types of financial aid that are administered by the College that are need- based. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) sets forth both the framing regulations as well as significant detail governing the proce ss of verification. ED requires that institutions document certain verification guidelines over which they have discretion. Those policies are described below: \u0087 selection for institutional verification, \u0087 the deadlines by which students must submit verification documentation, \u0087 the consequences for failing to submit veri fication documents by applicable deadlines, \u0087 the method the FAO will use to notify students if their EFC and/or Title IV aid amount changes, \u0087 the procedures the FAO or students will follow to correct FAFSA data, \u0087 the procedure the FAO will follow to refer a student to the Office of Inspector General. Other policies and procedures are copied from and closely base d upon the federal Application and Verification Guide (AVG) from the Federal Student Aid Handbook, Chapter 4. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 26 Verification, Updates and Corrections Because students sometimes make errors on their application, there is a process for verifying applications and making corrections. The Central Processing System (CPS) selects which applications are to be verified, but the FAO has the authority t o verify additional students. The FAO must verify applications selected by the CPS of stud ents who will receive (or have received) subsidized student financial assistance. Verification is not required if the studen t will only receive unsubsidized student financial assistance ( see verification exclusions later in this policy), though a student cannot avoid verification by accepting only unsubsidized aid. I f the student tries to do this, the FAO must continue with verification. Institutional Notification Policies ED selects, on a random basis and through edits at the Central Processing System (CPS), certain financial aid applicants nationwide for review in a process called verification. When an applicant has been selected for verification the FAO is require d to review the student's FAFSA for accuracy and completeness. Typi cally, students and their families are required at minimum to submit a verification worksheet (available from the College) and an IRS tax transcript (available from the IRS and required if the Data Retrieval Tool was not used). Depending upon the sources of income reported on the FAFSA, the student (and parent or spouse, as applicable) may be required to submit additional documents. All students who have been selected for verification must submit all required documentation and any other requested information prior to being issued an award offer. Students and parents are reminded that by signing the FAFSA they have agreed that \"If you are the parent or the student, by signing this applicat ion you certify that all of the information you provided is true and complete to the best of your knowledge and you agree, if asked, to provide information that will verify the accuracy of your co mpleted form. This information may include U.S. or state income tax forms that you filed or are required to file. Also, you certify that you understand that the Secretary of Education has the authority to verify informatio n reported on this application with the Internal Revenue Servi ce and other federal agencies.\" Typical Documentation When a student is selected for verification, the following documentation, at minimum, is required: 1. Verification Worksheet (Dependent or Independent). Available from the college.2. Transcript of Tax Return \u0087 student's tax transcript (must be obtained from the IRS, not a photocopy of the tax return) \u0087 parent's (for dependent students) or spouse's (for married independent students) tax transcript (must be obtained from the IRS, not a photocopy of the tax return) \u0087 if the student (and parent or spouse) used the IRS Data Retrieval when submitting the FAFSA, a tax return transcript is not required unless changes are subsequently made Additional documentation may be required to substantiate data on the FAFSA or to resolve conflicting information, as follows: \u0087 child support received \u0087 child support paid \u0087 payments to tax-deferred pensions \u0087 value of real estate investment properties \u0087 wages earned \u0087 current valuation of assets When students are selected for verification, an email is generate d or a postcard is mailed informing them as to the process and the documentation required to review their file and applicable deadlines. Students who fail to respond to requests for documentation are repeatedly contacted on an established schedule with information about the importance of complying and the consequences of failure to do so. Title IV regulations require that institutions have written policies supporting their administration of several aspects of verification. An overview of each required element is presented below. Title IV regulations require that the institution have t he following written policies: Selection for Institutional Verification The FAO may at its discretion select students for verification wh o were not selected by the Central Processing System (CPS). Th e FAO may also select students for verification of data elements in addition to those required in the student's verification grou p. For example, the FAO will select students whose files contain conflicting information either within the award year or between FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 27 award years. The FAO will also select known members of the sa me household when one member is selected by CPS. The FAO will not select students for verification based upon any discriminatory or unlawful reason. The FAO may require those students it selects to verify any FAFSA information and to provide any reasonable documentation in accordance with consistently applied FAO policies. In either situation the FAO may, but is not required to, include any of the 2017-2018 CPS verification items not already included. Students wh o have been institutionally identified are considered to be selected for verification and, as with CPS-selected applications, all other verification requirements, such as notifications, deadlines, allowable tolerances, and interim disbursement rules, apply. The deadlines by which students must submit verification documentation Selected applicants are notified upon receipt of the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) to submit required documents, which are listed in the notification email. On a w eekly basis, the financial aid counselors review the document tracking report which lists those students who still have incomplete files due to missing documents. The FAO requests that applicants submit their documents within ten days of the date of the notification email or their last day of enrollment, whiche ver occurs first. Enrolled students continue to be notified throughout the semester to complete their files. Since the College does not issue financial aid awards until after the verification process has been successfully completed, students must submit all of their verification documents so that they are received in the FAO during regular business hours by the last day of the semester or th e student's last day of attendance, whichever comes first; however, students who delay and do not submit their financial aid forms until the final days of their enrollment may render themse lves ineligible for grants and loans by doing so because there may be insufficient processing time. For example, if a student wo uld have been eligible for a Direct loan and the loan was not originated prior to the student's last day of enrollmen t the student is ineligible to receive those funds. The consequences for failing to submit verifi cation documents by applicable deadlines In the initial notification email and in all subsequent communica tions, the FAO notifies students that failure to submit all required documents will result in ineligibilit y for all forms of Title IV financial aid as well as some types of institutional aid. If the student has already received a disbursement(s) of Title IV aid for which he has become ineligible the notification from the FAO contains the information that he will also forfeit those funds. The method the FAO will use to notify students if their EFC and/or Title IV aid amount changes The FAO initially prepares awards only for those students who ha ve completed the verification process. If a student is selected after having been packaged and prior to all disbursements, the FA O provides notification as above. If the student's EFC and/or Title IV aid amount changes, the FAO notifies the student via em ail. The notification email contains information to enable the student to access the revised award letter. The procedures the FAO will fo llow to correct FAFSA data When any dollar or non-dollar item changes as a result of the verification process, the information is updated by correcting th e student's FAFSA via the web. The ISIR is the report that is produced after the student files a FAFSA. The ISIR contains all of the student's answers to the questions on the FAFSA. The FAO us ually downloads ISIRs daily: Monday - Thursday. When the corrected ISIR, reflecting the updates, is downloaded into the College's student information system, the FAO confirms that the data is accurate. The FAO packages (or repackages, as necessary) applicants and students whose ISIRs are accurate and their files are otherwise complete. The FAO then notifies affected appl icants and students via email as to their updated EFC and/or award. The procedure the FAO will follow to refer a student or others to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) If any college employee (or other individual) develops a credible suspicion that a student, pare nt, employee, or other individu al has misrepresented information or altered documentation to fraudulently obtain federal funds, he or she is to report the observation to the Director of Financial Aid (DFA), Vice Pres ident for Student Affairs or the Director of Human Resources (DHR). Unless the report is that the DFA's conduct has caused the suspicion, the DFA is to be immediately advised of the evidence. If the DFA is suspected of fraudulent activity the report is to be made to the DHR. Otherwise, the DFA is responsible for assembling any available evidence and providing it along with a statement (usually in writing) of the suspect activity to t he OIG. The DFA will also refer the student for institutional disciplinary action. The DFA may also be required to report the suspected fraudulent activity to state agencies (and other en tities) from which the student received financial aid funds. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 28 Return of Title IV (R2T4) Presentation College has established policies and procedures to define and administer the Return of Title IV (R2T4) funds requirements as promulgated in the Higher Education Act (HEA), Section 668.16. The R2T4 policy includes information that reflects institutional procedures as well as text that is copied from the Federal Student Aid (FSA) Handbook, Volume 5 Chapter 1. The R2T4 policy governs the determination of students' eligibility to receive funding from the following federal programs offered at Presentation College (PC) when they cease attend ance in all Title IV eligible classes during a semester: Federal Pell Grant Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The U.S. Department of Education (ED) offers Title IV programs in addition to those listed above. Presentation College only participates in the programs listed. The College adheres to federal policy, as set forth in the FSA Handbook and the Higher Education Act (HEA), Section 668.16, in the administration of R2T4 policies and procedures in all respects. Title IV funds are provided to students with the expectation that they will attend their classes for the entire period for whic h the assistance has been awarded. When students stop attending thei r classes, for any reason including medical withdrawals or even circumstances that are beyond their control, they may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that they wer e originally awarded and may have already received. When students stop attending all of their Title IV eligible cl asses and are no longer participating in any academically-related activities (last date of engagement), the College is required to determine if the student is eligible to retain or to receive a ny Title IV financial aid. Federal regulations require the College to use a calculation called Return to Title IV (R2T4) to determine th e percentage of financial aid funds the student has earned as well as the amount that is unearned. The R2T4 calculation is based upon the concept that students earn their financial aid in proportion to the number of days they are enrolled in and attending their classes. The calculation is based upon the number of days that the student attended as a percentage of the days in the semester. Under this reasoning, a student who withdraws in the second week of classes has earned less of his financial aid than a student who withdraws in the seventh week. Once students have begun to attend approved classes, they begin to incrementally earn their Title IV financial aid (if they have completed their files and are otherwise el igible). Prior to the 60% point of the semester students earn a percentage of aid that increases with each day of attendance. Once aid recipients have attended their classes for 60% of the semester, they are considered to have earned 100% of their financial aid (as long as they are otherwise eligible) for that term and will not be required to return any funds. If students withdraw from all of their Title IV eligible courses prior to completing at least 60% of a semester, typically they would have earned only a portion of the federal financial aid that they received, or are scheduled to receive, for that term. I f a student remains enrolled in only those courses that are not Title IV eligible, an R2T4 calculation is likewise required. A pror ated schedule is used to determine the amount and type of federal student aid funds they have and have not earned at the time of the withdrawal or cessation of attendance in all Title IV eligible classes. Of note, students may have earned a percentage of their Title IV financial aid when they begin and then cease attendance during the two-week add/drop period at the beginning of the seme ster. Thus, students may be eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV aid when they cease attendance prior to the census date, regardless of whether the College has disbursed aid or assessed any institutional charges. When students fail to attend their classes they could leave the College owing money because their charges for tuition, fees, housing and meal plan exceed the amount of financial aid that they have earned. For these reasons, students are strongly advised to meet with a member of the business office or FAO to discuss the financial consequences of dropping out of or withdrawing from the College before doing so. Determination for students who earn all \"F\" and other zero quality point grades When students receive all \"F\" and other zero quality point grades , the College is required to determine if they earned the grad es or ceased to attend at some point in the semester. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 29 When final grades for the semester have been posted, the FAO reviews the records of those students who received any combination of \"F\", \"I\", \"U\", \"W\", and \"WF\" grades to identify the last date of attendance as submitted by the students' instructors. Order of return of Title IV funds to the federal programs As dictated by federal regulation, the FAO returns Title IV funds that the student has not earned to the applicable program in the following order: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized loan2. Federal Direct Subsidized loan 3. Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) 4. Federal Pell Grant5. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)6. Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant The student's grace period for loan repayment of unsubsidized an d subsidized Direct Loans will commence as of the date of the withdrawal from the College. The student's grace period is also triggered when he is no longer attending at least six credits. Students should contact the FAO if they have questions regarding their grace period or repayment status. Post-withdrawal disbursements If a student receives less federal student aid than the amount earned, the College must offer a disbursement of the earned aid that was not received. This is called a post-withdrawal disbursement. A post-withdrawal disbursement to the student for earned Title IV funds in excess of outstanding current (educationally related ) charges must be made as soon as possible, but no later than, 45 days for grants, and as soon as possible, but no later than, 18 0 days for loans. The College's policy is to make post-withdrawa l disbursements for grants within two weeks whenever it is possible to do so. Whenever possible, post-withdrawal disbursements for loans are made within two weeks of the deadline established for the student to accept or decline the loan portion of a post-withdrawal disbursement. Institutional and student responsibilities under the R2T4 policy The institution's responsibilities under the R2T4 policy include: 1. provide students with the information about the R2T4 policy;2. identify students affected by this policy and complete the R2T4 calculation; 3. inform the student of the result of the R2T4 calculation an d any balance owed to the College from the required return of unearned funds; 4. return any unearned funds to the applicable Title IV program(s);5. notify the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) of the student's withdrawal date; 6. notify the student (or parent, as applicable) of eligibility for a post-withdrawal disbursement, if any. The student's responsibilities under the R2T4 policy include: 1. review the R2T4 policy and understand how withdrawing from courses affects eligibility for Title IV aid; 2. adhere to the College's withdrawal policy and promptly notify the institution of intention to separate;3. promptly pay any outstanding balance owed to Presentation College resulting from the required return of unearned Title IV aid; 4. pay all collections costs and attorney's fees that may be required to satisfy any balance that the student fails topromptly pay. Sample R2T4 calculation To review an example of how the R2T4 calculation affects a stud ent who ceases attendance before the 60% point of the semester visit the financial aid pages on the College's website. Return to Title IV Questions The procedures and policies listed above ar e subject to change without advance notice as may be required by federal and institutional regulations. When the College makes updates, the new policy will be published as soon as is reasonably possible. Students are held to the most current published policy. The above policies and procedures are intended to provide an overview of a complicated and complex area of the Title IV regulations. Students, parents, and others who have questions regarding the R2T4 calculation or general inquiries about the Title IV federal student aid programs should connect with any of the following resources for information: FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 30 PC's Financial Aid Office www.presentation.edu financialaid@presentation.edu 1.605.229.8429 Federal Student Aid Information Center 1.800.4.FEDAID (1.800.433.3243) TTY users may call 1.800.730.8913 Student Aid on the Web https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/ Minnesota Higher Education Services Office Refund Policy If a student is receiving a Minnesota State Grant, Minnesota Child Care Grant, or Supplemental Education Loan Funds (SELF) the calculations are processed under the Minnesota Higher Educat ion Services Office refund policy.

Application and additional information may be found at http://www.sdbor.edu/dakotacorps/welcome.htm ***For a comprehensive listing of scholarships, visit http://www.presentation.edu/tuition-aid/scholarships/ FEDERAL AND STATE GRANT PROGRAMS Federal Pell Grant The purpose of the Pell Grant is to provide eligible students with a base of gift aid to help defray the costs of post-secondar y education. The Pell Grant is an entitl ement program administered by the federa l government and the College's FAO. The amount students receive is based on the number of eligible cred it hours in which they are enrolled, the student's expected fami ly contribution (EFC)*, and the institution's cost of attendance (COA)*. Students may receive the Pell Grant until they earn their first baccalaureate degree (or the equivalent) or they have received the equivalent of twelve semesters of full-time eligibilit y, whichever occurs first. In very limited circumstances students who have earned a baccalaureate degree who are enrolled in certain teacher certification programs may be eligible for Pell Grant. Students are not required to repay the Pell Grant unless they failed to meet attendance and other eligibility criteria or made errors on the FAFSA that when corrected make them ineligible for this type of funding Pell Grant eligibility for enrollm ent in the nursing programs Students who enter the College's nursing program after previous enrollment at another institution should carefully monitor the aggregate amount that they have received from the Federal Pell Grant program. Nursing students should also carefully project the amount they have in remaining funding to determine if they have sufficient remaining Pell Grant to complete their program. Nursing students can monitor the annual and aggregate amounts that they have received from the Pell Grant program through the National Student Loan Data System at www.nslds.ed.gov If you are a nursing student who received Pell Grant at one or more institutions prior to your enrollment at Presentation Colle ge, please visit the FAO for assistance in understanding your remaining eligibility.

The FWS program is available to undergraduate students who show a demonstrated need* documented through analysis of the information on their FAFSAs*. Students who wish to participate in the FWS program should review the list of available job opportunities on the College's website. The student should then contact the applicable supervisor for an interview. If the student is selected for employment and was not awarded FWS, the supervisor is required to contact the FAO to confirm whether or not the student is eligible for FWS. If the student is eligible for FWS, that form of assistance will be added to the student's financial aid award. Employed students are paid once per month through the Business Office based upon hours worked.

LOAN PROGRAMS Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan Program The purpose of the Federal Direct Loan Program is to make low-interest, long-term loans to students to assist them in meeting their educational expenses. First-time Federal Direct Loan borrowers are required to comp lete the Master Promissory Note (MPN)* and entrance loan counseling prior to disbursement of funds. Once a student has completed the MPN, the Note is valid for ten years so long as it is used within the first year after it is signed. Students must be enrolled at least half-time (six credit hours) in an eligible p rogram to receive the funds from the Direct Loan Program. Students who are enrolled but are in less than six eligible credits at the t ime of disbursement are not eligible to receive Direct Loan funds. Repayment generally begins six months after students graduate or FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 34 drop below half-time (six credits) enrollment in an eligible prog ram. Generally, borrowers may take up to 10 years (or more) to repay their federal student loans. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan The Federal Direct Subsidized Loan is available to students wh o qualify based on their financial need*. Students who qualify fo r subsidized loan funds are not required to make interest paymen ts during in-school, deferment and grace periods. Students who qualify for unsubsidized loan funds are required to make interest payments during in-school, deferment and grace periods. Students who qualify for unsubsidized loan funds may elect to capitalize their interest during in-school, deferment and grace periods. Otherwise, the same application processes, terms and conditions apply to both the subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs. After graduation or cessation of half-time enrollment students are required to make payments on both the principle borrowed and interest as it accrues on their subsidized (and unsubsidized) loans. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan is available to students who do not qualify for the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan based on their financial need*. The same application processes, terms and conditions apply to bo th the subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs, except that unsubsidized loans require payment of interest during in-schoo l and grace periods. Borrowers are required to begin making interest payments on unsubsidized loans while they are still enrolled. Students may elect to capitalize the interest on their unsubsidized loans; however, this adds to the cost of borrowing. If they can afford to do so, students should make interest payments on their unsubsidized loans to keep the principle amount borrowed as low as possible. After graduation or cessation of half-time enrollment students are required to make payments on both the principle borrowed and interest as it accrues (as well as any accumulated capitalized inte rest) on their unsubsidized loans. Dependent students whose parents are not approved for a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit history, may be able to receive additional unsubsidized direct loan funds. The following chart from https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized shows the annual and aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The student loans website is an excellent source of information about the federal loan programs. Year Dependent Students (except students whose parents are unable to obtain PLUS Loans) Independent Students (and dependent undergraduate students whose parents are unable to obtain PLUS Loans) First-Year Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $5,500\u2014No more than $3,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $9,500\u2014No more than $3,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Second-Year Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $6,500\u2014No more than $4,500 of this amount ma y be in subsidized loans. $10,500\u2014No more than $4,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Third-Year and Beyond Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $7,500\u2014No more than $5,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $12,500\u2014No more than $5,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Loan Limit $31,000\u2014No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $57,500 for undergraduates\u2014No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. \u0087 The aggregate loan limits include any subsidized Federal loans and unsubsidized Federal loans from both the Federal Family Education Loan and Direct Loan programs. \u0087 If a student's grade level changes during the academic year and this results in additional direct loan eligibility, the student must submit a written request to the FAO for the additional funds. Direct Loan eligibility during enrollment in a certificate program The College's certificate programs are designed to be completed in one year. Students who are enrolled in a certificate program are eligible to receive as a maximum the loan amount for freshmen . Students are not eligible to exceed the annual freshman loan level during any academic year even when they enroll for more than one year to complete any certificate program. Direct Loan eligibility during enrollm ent in an associate degree program FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 35 Most of the College's associate degree programs are designed to be completed in two years. Students who are enrolled in an associate degree program are eligible to receive as a maximum the loan amount for sophomores. Students are not eligible to exceed the annual sophomore loan level duri ng any academic year even when they enroll for more than two years to complete any associate degree program. Simultaneous enrollment Students who are simultaneously enrolled in any combination of a certificate, associate and/or baccalaureate degree program are typically eligible to receive Direct Loan funds at the grade level for which they qualify in the program that has the longe st length. For example, a student who is simultaneously enrolled in certificate and baccalaureate degree programs and has reached the sophomore grade level in the baccalaureate program is likely eligible for a sophomore level loan, even though the certifica te is a one year program. Changes in type of program Students who are enrolled in an associate or baccalaureate degr ee program and change to a certificate or associate program may decrease the amount of their eligibility for Direct Loan funds. For example, if a student is enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program in the fall semester and has earned sufficient credits to place him at the junior grade level and changes to a certific ate program in the spring, his loan eligibility will decrease to the freshman level. In this scenario a portion of the student's lo an for the spring semester must be cancelled and cannot be disbursed. Direct Loan eligibility for enrollment in the nursing programs Students who enter the College's nursing programs after previous enrollment at another institution should carefully monitor the aggregate amount that they have borrowed. Nursing students should also carefully project the amount that they anticipate they will borrow to complete their program to determine if they have sufficient remaining eligibility in Direct Loan funding. Nursin g students can monitor their annual and aggregate amounts borrowed from the federal student loan programs through the National Student Loan Data System at www.nslds.ed.gov If you are a nursing student who borrowed at one or more institutio ns prior to your enrollment at Presentation College, please visit the FAO for assistance in understanding your remaining loan eligibility. Loan Proration for graduating students The FAO is required to prorate loan eligibility for those students who will graduate, or complete, their programs after one semester of enrollment during th e academic year. For example, if a student will graduate at the end of the fall semester, the F AO is required to prorate her loan eligibility. The maximum that a student who enrolls for twelve credits is eligible to borrow is generally one-half of the annual amount for which she is otherwise eligible. Students who enroll for six or more but less than twelve credits are eligible for less than half of the annual maximum amount of loan funds. If you will graduate after attending only one semester in an academic year, please visit the FAO for assistance in understandin g your remaining loan eligibility. Monitoring annual and aggregate amounts borrowed Students who have borrowed from any of the federal student loan programs can monitor their annual disbursements and aggregate amounts by logging into the National Student Loan Data System at www.nslds.ed.gov Changes in your program, number of credits, and your prior borrowing history can significantly alter your eligibility for funding from the Direct Loan program. If you have questio ns about the aggregate or annual amounts that you have borrowed or are considering changes in your enrollment or program please visit the FAO for assistance in understanding your status. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The Direct PLUS program is available to credit-worthy pa rents of undergraduate dependent students. The parents of independent students are not eligible to borrow from the PLUS program for the student. The amount of loan eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance (COA)* minus the financial aid (including student loans) already awarded. The students must be enrolled at least half-time (six credit hours) for the parent to be eligible for the PLUS program. A parent must comple te the Direct PLUS Loan Application and Master Promissory Note (MPN)* and submit authorization for a credit check. Dependent students whose parents are not approved for a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit history may be able to receive additional unsubsidized Direct loan funds. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 36 Nursing Education Assistance Loan Program The 1998 South Dakota Legislature authorized this loan progra m to provide financial assistance to qualified South Dakota residents who are admitted to a nursing program. The number and amount of each loan will be determined annually by the South Dakota Board of Nursing but may not exceed $1,000 per fu ll academic year. Student borrowers may elect to repay the loan either by employment in nursing in South Dakota at a conversion rate of $1 per hour or monetary payments within the required time period of five years. Applications are available at doh.sd.gov/boards/nursing/loan.aspx Alternative Loans Information on alternative loans is available on the Presen tation College website at www.presentation.edu/tuition-aid Alternative loans may be an option for qualifying students (and parents) who are in need of additional resources to cover education-related expenses. Typically alternative loans require that the borrower have a good credit history and may have minimum income levels as well as a maximum debt-to-income ra tio. Students and/or parents may borrow up to the remaining cost of attendance * for the student's education. Students have the right to select a lender of their choice. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SATISFACTO RY ACADEMIC PROGRESS POLICY Presentation College (PC) has established the following policy and procedure to define and administer Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for those students who are recipients of Title IV* (or federal) funding, as well as several other types of finan cial assistance administered by the College. All recipients of Titl e IV* funding are governed by this policy as specified below. The SAP policy is in accordance with and references the language from regulations, CFR 34, Section 668.16, promulgated under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended. The College adheres to federal policy, as set forth in HEA in the administration of SAP for Title IV* recipients, in all respects. The College has also established academic standards apart from the SAP policy that govern all students including those who are not Title IV* recipients. HEA requires that, to demonstrate administrative capability, an institution must have a SAP policy th at is equivalent to or stricter for Title IV* recipients than the standards for students enrolled in the same educational program who are not receiving federal aid. Students who are Title IV* aid reci pients are also subject to all of the College's academic poli cies and must meet those standards in addition to the minimum federal policies detailed below. In those instances when the College's academic policies are stricter than the minimum SAP standard, students are subject to the College's academic policy for receipt, continuation or reinstatement of their Title IV* financial aid. Thus, PC's SAP policy is stricter for Title IV* re cipients than it is for those students who are not receiving federal aid. For additional information about the College's academic progre ss policies that govern all students please read that section of the catalog. The SAP policy applies to the following types of Title IV* aid: \u0087 Federal Pell Grant \u0087 Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant \u0087 Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) \u0087 Federal Work Study (FWS) \u0087 Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) \u0087 Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The SAP policy also applies to several other types of financial ai d that are administered by the College which may include, but not be limited to, institutional aid, Minnesota state grants and work study, and scholarships (which may require a higher grade point average than the minimum in the SAP policy). Academic progress (and other) requirements for non-Title IV* aid are described in the eligibility criteria for those forms of assistance. Components of Presentation College's SAP Policy The quantitative and qualitative standards listed below are used to evaluate the cumulative results of all periods of students' enrollment, including those semesters or payment periods during which they did not receive Title IV* funds or other types of financial assistance. Thus, a student who has not previously rece ived Title IV* aid may be ineligible to do so at initial application. The numbers that result from the qualitat ive and quantitative calculations for SAP are not rounded. Thus, the student's GPA and rate of completion must be equal to or above the minimums cited below without rounding. 1. Frequency of evaluation: HEA requires that an institution evaluate SAP at least annually for programs that are longer than one year and every payment period for programs of one year or less. PC evaluates all components of SAP at the end of each academic year which corresponds to the end of the spring semester. Students who fail to meet the College's academic FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 37 progress policy are reviewed at any time during the academic ye ar for financial aid eligibility if they appeal their academic suspension and are permitted to return to the College. All students who submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA*), as well as those who receive any type of Title IV* financial assistance, are evaluated for SAP annually. Transfer students and those who are returning to the College after a hiatus are evaluated upon entry (or reentry), whether or not that point in time is at the end of the academic year. Financial aid recipients and applicants (upon submission of the FAFSA) who are found not to be in satisfactory academic standing will be notified. Students can also check their eligibility status by logging into the student portal. When a change of grade is submitted subsequent to the SA P evaluation, PC will recalculate the student's SAP status using that new information. 2. Qualitative component: PC uses the student's grade point average (GPA) to measure qualitative progress. To meet this standard, Title IV* recipients are required to achieve and maintain a minimum cumulative 2.00 GPA, which is consistent with PC's graduation requirements for most programs. If the Title IV* recipient is enrolled in a program that requires a higher GPA (usually 2.5) the student must meet the program GPA in orde r to maintain eligibility for financial aid. When the GPA required by the program is higher than the SAP GPA, students will be considered to have met the SAP qualitative standard so long as they are eligible to continue in the program and their cumulative GPA is 2.00 or higher. The cumulative GPA that PC uses to evaluate the student's SAP st atus is calculated based upon all courses that have been attempted, excluding those that are developmental, audited, or have no quality points associated with the course. Courses that have been repeated will have the highest grade earned calculated into the SAP GPA. The SAP GPA also includes grades for courses that have been forgiven under the College' s academic forgiveness policy. Thus, the GPA used to evaluate SAP may be different from the studen t's GPA on the academic transcript. 3. Quantitative component (maximum timeframe and pace of completion): HEA requires a quantitative component that evaluates the maximum timeframe in which students must comp lete their educational program and a pace of completion that ensures they will complete the program within the timeframe. PC requires that all financial aid recipients successfully complete a cumulative minimum of 67% of the credits that they attempt. Successful completion for this standard is defined as earning a grade of A, B, C, D, P or S (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade). Financial aid recipients must also complete their program within 150% of the published length required for their program of study. The SAP quantitative calculation is based upon all courses that the students have attempted, including those that are developmental; the calculation also includes grades for courses that have been repeated or forgiven under the College's academic forgiveness policy. 4. ESL and developmental courses: Students may attempt a maximum of 30 credits of ESL and/or developmental coursework, during which time they may or may not be Title IV* recipients, prior to becoming ineligible for such funds during future attempts. Developmental and ESL courses are included in the quantitative assessments of SAP. 5. Changes of program: Students are permitted to make changes to their program in accordance with their academic goals. So long as students are meeting all other SAP standard s, changes of program alone will not disqualify them for Title IV* eligibility. After a change of program, the student's ne xt scheduled SAP evaluation will include all previously attempted courses. The student's cumulative credits for this standard are the total of all courses attempted at PC combined with all transfer credits. Students who reach (or will reach) 150% of the length of their programs (below) and who are otherwise in satisfactory standing, may request a recalculation of their maximum timeframe based upon only those credits that are applicable to their certificate or degree. 6. Additional certificates or degrees: Students who seek additional certificates or degrees are treated in the same way as those who change their programs (as above). After the completion of the first certificate or degree (at PC or elsewhere), the next scheduled SAP evaluation will include all previously a ttempted courses. The student's cumulative credits for this standard are the total of all courses attempted at PC combined with all transfer credits. Students become ineligible for Title IV* aid when it becomes mathematically impossible to complete the program within 150% of the published length required for their pr ogram of study, even when the student has not yet reached 150%. \u0087 Students who are enrolled to complete an eligible certific ate are eligible, but not guaranteed, to receive Title IV* for up to 150% of the published length required to complete the certificate. \u0087 Students who are enrolled to complete an eligible associate degree are eligible, but not guaranteed, to receive Title IV* for up to 150% of the published length required to complete the associate degree. \u0087 Students who are enrolled to complete an eligible baccalaureate degree are eligible, but not guaranteed, to receive Title IV* for up to 150% of the published length required to complete the baccalaureate degree.FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 38 Thus, the Title IV* recipient is subject to the limitation of 150% of the published length required by the certificate or degree being sought. 7. Course incompletes, withdrawals and WF grades: Successful completion of coursework is defined as earning a grade of A, B, C, D, P or S (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade) at PC. All other grades including I (Incomplete), F, U, WF and W (Withdrawn) are defined as unsuccessful completion. Accordingly, all courses having grades of I, F, U, WF and W count as the applicable credits attempte d and count as zero credits earned in the SAP calculation. The grades of F, I and WF additionally count as zero quality points when the qualitative SAP standard is assessed. Grades of P, S, U and W are not counted when the qualitative SAP standard is assessed. Grades of P, S, U and W do not carry any quality points. Students who have grades of Incomplete (I) and who are, as a result, in unsatisfactory standing, will have their SAP status recalculated when those grades are later reported as an A, B, C, D, P or S (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade). Students who receive other grade changes will also have their SAP status recalculated. Students who achieve satisfactory standing as the result of a grade recalcul ation will be evaluated for reinstatement of financial aid so long as the end of the same academic year has not occurred and all other eligibility criteria are met. 8. Course repetitions: Under HEA regulations, Title IV* recipients are permitted to repeat a course in which they previously earned only failing grades (F, U, WF and W) without a limit, except as imposed by the SAP and College academic standards. Once a student has earned a grade of A, B, C, D, S or P (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade) one repeat of the course is permitted to be counted toward calculating Title IV* aid eligibility for any payment period or semester. All subsequent attempts of that course, ev en those required by the College, are ineligible for Title IV* funding. Course repetitions are counted in the evaluation of the qu alitative standard by using the highest grade earned. All course repetitions are counted in the quantitative SAP standard. 9. Transfer Credits: HEA regulations require that, at a minimum, transfer credits that are applicable toward the student's current program must count as both attempted and completed hours. PC counts all transfer credits as both attempted and completed hours when evaluating pace of completion. Only those courses applicable to the program of study are included in the maximum timeframe calculation upon a student's initial entrance to the College. 10. Financial aid warning semester: Students must meet all of the SAP standards to be considered in satisfactory academic standing. The College does not is sue a formal warning semester. Students are advised that if they are found to not be in satisfactory academic standing at the end of the academ ic year they are immediately ineligible for Title IV* financial aid for the subsequent semester. Students who fail to reach all of the SAP standards and are therefore not in satisfactory academic standing are ineligible to receive further Title IV* funding, unless they have submitted an appeal (as below) which is approved. Students who submit an appeal, which is approved, will be placed on probation and required to follow an academic improvement (AIP) plan. 11. Financial aid probation: Students who fail to reach all of the SAP standards and are therefore not in satisfactory academic standing are only eligible to receive further Title IV* funding if they submit an appeal (as below) which is approved. Students who fail to reach all of the SAP standards after the probationary semester are also not in satisfactory academic standing and are ineligible to receive further Title IV* funding, unless they have submitted an appeal (as below) which is approved. Students who submit an appeal that is approved will be placed on probation and must continue to follow their academic plan. During any probationary semester , the student must meet the SAP standards based upon their term GPA and term rate of credit accumulation. Students are al so required to meet the Colleg e's academic standards during any probationary semester. 12. SAP appeals: HEA regulations allow but do not require an institution to permit students who are not in satisfactory academic standing to appeal their status in order to receive Title IV* funds. PC permits such appeals. Title IV* applicants and recipients, who are not in satisfactory academic standing, may appeal their status by accessing the College's SAP appeal process as described on the website. All students, except those who are eligible to request a recalculation of their SAP status , who submit an appeal must also include a completed academic plan. In order to develop the academic plan, the student must meet with an advisor and adhere to all associated requ irements. If the appeal has been approved, the student must adhere to the associated academic plan. The financial aid appeal committee has final approval on the terms of the academic plan and may add terms and conditions to the plan. The FAO will review the student's progress at the end of the probationary semester to determine if the terms of the academic improvement plan (AIP) have been met. Students who wish to change their academic plan must appeal to do so. Students who wish to appeal to change their academic plan should submit a letter to the FAO. In the appeal, the student must explain what has happened to make FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 39 the change necessary and how academic progress can be achieved. The appeal letter should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. Students who wish to appeal must submit the SAP appeal form along with appropriate documentation to the FAO for evaluation. Students are responsible for developing and composing their own SAP appeals. SAP appeals that were completed by anyone other than the student are not acceptable and will be rejected. The FAO will respond to the appeal in writing by Presentation College email, and US Post al mail to the billing address, usually within two weeks of receiving the complete appeal. Students may contact the FAO to request the SAP appeal form and instructions. As required, PC reviews progress at the end of the semester for those students on probation, to determine if the student is meeting the requirements of the academ ic plan. If the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan, the student is eligible to receive Title IV* aid so long as th e student continues to meet those requirements. Students who experience extenuating circumstances, that were reasonably unforeseeable at the beginning of the semester and that are beyond the student's control, may appeal. The circumstances that are cited in the appeal must be timely to the semester of enrollment during which the acad emic difficulty occurred. These extenu ating circumstances must have been sufficiently disruptive that the student was prevented from continued enrollment and/or successful completion of the semester and meeting of the SAP standards. Students who are otherwise in good academic standing but who have exceeded 150% of the published length required for their certificate or degree and who have changed their program of study no more than four times may appeal based solely upon their change of program without presenting extenuating circumstances. Such students may request that their SAP status is recalculated based only on those credits which are applicable to their current program of study. Students who have failed one or more of the SAP standards and have changed their program more than four times are required to present and document extenuating circumstances with their appeal. Circumstances such as difficulty adjusting to college, time management issues, failure to balance social life against academic workload requirements, prioritization of other activities above coursework and inability to afford enrollment expenses in the absence of financial aid are no t alone sufficient to qualify as extenuating. Documented extenuating circumstances might include, but are not limited to: \u0087 student's major illness or injury \u0087 major illness or injury in the student's immediate family \u0087 student's spouse's major illness student's student's parent's student's student's \u0087 student's parent's separation or death family \u0087 student's deployment to active duty \u0087 student's parent's deployment to active duty \u0087 natural disaster affecting the student \u0087 natural disaster affecting the student's parent(s) \u0087 natural disaster affecting the student's spouse All SAP appeals will be evaluated by the SAP appeals committee or its designee. As noted in the instructions that accompany the SAP appeal process, the student must docume nt all extenuating circumstances, explain changes that will allow for academic success during future enrollment, and must submit an adviso r-approved academic plan. Documentation typically consists of provider confirmation of injury or illness, an employer's separation letter, police incident or accident report, attorney's letter, divorce decree, deployment orders, obituary or death certificate as applicable; however, the SAP appeals committee or its design ee solely determines the suff iciency of documentation in accordance with the circumstance(s) presented. If a SAP appeal is approved for a student who does not enro ll for the next scheduled seme ster, the approval is subject to submission to the SAP appeals committee for reevaluation. If the SAP appeals committee confirms that the approval is still valid the student is eligible to receive financial aid so long as all other eligibility criteria are met. If the SAP FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 40 appeals committee determines that the approval is not valid the student is ineligible for any financial aid that is governed by the SAP policy. 13. Reestablishing eligibility for Title IV* aid: Students who choose not to appeal, or whose appeals are not approved, may be able to reestablish eligibility for Title IV* aid. Such st udents may (if they are otherwise eligible) continue to enroll for courses at the College at their own expense until they have met all of the SAP standards that are applicable for Title IV* aid receipt. Neither paying for one's classes nor sitting out for a te rm affects a student's academic progress standing, so neither (alone or together) is sufficient to reestablish aid eligibility if the student has not met all SAP standards. 14. Satisfactory Academic Progress definitions: Appeal: The process by which a student who is not meetin g SAP standards petitions PC based upon extenuating circumstances for reconsideration of eligibility for financial aid funds. Financial aid probation semester: The status PC assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successfully appeals. Eligibility for aid is reinstated for one payment period or semester. During any probationary semester the student must meet the SAP standards based upon their term GPA and term rate of creditaccumulation. Maximum timeframe: For an undergraduate program measured in credit hours, the maximum timeframe is a period no longer than 150% of the published length of the program. Students become ineligible for Title IV* aid when it becomes mathematically impossible to complete the program within 150% of the length of the program, even when the student has not reached 150%. Payment Period: The definition of a payment period applies to all FSA programs except FWS. The common definition is integral to requirements for the administration of FSA funds in that FSA program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, and a student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) evaluation is required to correspond with the end of a payment period. At Presentation College a payment period is equivalent to a semester. Minnesota State Programs Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Students who receive Minnesota State Grant, Minnesota Postsecondary Child Care Grant, Minnesota Indian Scholarship, and Minnesota Work-study are subject to the Federal Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) requirements as outlined in the College Catalog in order to maintain eligibility to receive these funds. Students who fails to meet the SAP standards will be disqualified from further Minnesota State financial aid funding. Glossary of terms used in the financial aid section Award Letter The College updates information in the students' portal as the method of notifying financial aid applicants of the financial ai d assistance offered. These updates are considered an electron ic award letter. The paper or electronic award letter provides information on the types and amounts of fina ncial aid offered, as well as specific pr ogram information, student responsibilitie s, and the conditions which govern the award. Students are considered to have accepted all aid amounts that they do not decline. Students should decline those forms of aid that they do not wish to receive. Cost of Attendance (COA) The COA (or student's budget) is the total estimated amount it will cost the student to attend Presentation College for one academic year consisting of the fall and spring semesters. Th e COA for those students who enroll for three semesters (fall, spr ing and summer) during the academic year is increased so that it also includes the estimated costs for the summer term. The COA includes tuition and fees; room and board (or a housing and food allowance); and allowances for books, supplies, transportation , loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses; may include an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. Contac t the FAO at PC if you have any unusual educationally-related expenses that might affect your COA. The College's COAs for full-time and half-time students are deta iled on the website in the financial aid pages. Full-time is defined as enrollment for twelve or more credits per semester. Ha lf-time is defined as enrollment for six to eight credits per semester. The College also calculates a prorated COA for students who enroll three-quarter-time (nine to eleven credits) and less-than half-time (five credits or less) per semester. For studen ts attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition a nd fees, an allowance for books, supplies and transportation; room and board expenses are not included. Students who enroll on a FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 41 less-than half-time basis are not eligible for federal Direct loan s, thus loan fees are not included in the COA for this enroll ment status. If a less-than-half-time student applies for and is eligible to receive an alternative loan the COA can be adjusted. Expected Family Contribution (EFC) This is the number that is used to determine the student's eligibility for federal student financial aid. This number results f rom the analysis of the financial information the student provides on the FAFSA*. The EFC is reported to the student on the Student Aid Report (SAR). Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) The application that is used to apply for federal student aid, such as federal grants, loans, and work-study. The FAFSA must be filed for each year of enrollment. The College's FAFSA priority deadline is March 1. Master Promissory Note (MPN) The MPN is a binding legal document that the student (or parent) borrower must sign in order to apply for a federal student (or parent) loan. The MPN can be used to make one or more loans for one or more academic years (usually up to 10 years). It lists the terms and conditions under which the student (or parent) agrees to repay the loan and explains the rights and responsibilities of the borrower. It is important to read and save the MPN to refer to it later when loan repayment begins or a t other times to access information about provisions of the loan, such as deferments or forbearances. Need Financial need is the number that results when the student's EFC is subtracted from the COA. In the following example the student's estimated cost for tuition, fees, books, housing, meals and personal expenses totals $30,000 for one academic year. $30,000 COA - $ 5, 820 EFC = $24,180 Need In this example the student is eligible for a maximum of $24,180 in financial aid that is based upon need. Return to Title IV (R2T4) When students stop attending all of their classes and are no lo nger participating in any academically-related activities the College is required to determine if the student is eligible to retain or to receive any Title IV* financial aid. Federal regula tions require the College to use a calculation called R2T4 to determine the percentage of financial aid the student has earned as wel l as the amount that is unearned. The calculation is based upon the nu mber of days that the student attended as a percentage of the days in the term. Once students have begun to attend approved classes they begin to incrementally earn their Title IV* financial aid (if they are otherwise eligible). Prior to the 60% point of the semester students earn a percentage of aid that increases with each day of attendance. After the 60% point of the semester students are considered to have earned 100% of their Title IV* financial aid. When students fail to attend their classes they could leave the College owing money because their charges for tuition, fees, th e suites, and meal plan are higher than the amount of financial ai d that they have earned. Students are advised to meet with a st aff member in the business or FAO to discuss the financial conseque nces of dropping out or withdrawing from the College before doing so. Title IV Title IV* financial aid is also called federal financial aid. The Title IV* programs were created with the passage of the Highe r Education Act in 1965. All Presentation College campuses part icipate in these Title IV* programs: Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) programs; Direct Loans (for students and parents); and Federal Work-Study (FWS). The College also offers state and institutional scholarships and grants. To apply for Title IV* aid, students must file the FAFSA for each year of college. Presentation College reserves the right to update and change these and all other financial aid policies as may be required by federal, state and institutional regulations at any time and without prior notice. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 42 TUITION AND FEES Tuition and fees for the academic year may be found at http://www.presentation.edu/tuition-aid/ Student Billing Statement, Balance Due and Refund of Credit Balance Once a student has registered at Presentation College, the st udent's billing information can be viewed online through the Student Portal. The billing statement on the Student Portal will detail what costs will be incurred for that semester, along wi th any payments made and pending financial aid that will be applied to the balance. Any changes to students' schedules may generate a change in billing and financial aid. It is the students' responsibility to check their ledger periodically throughou t the semester. All students are required to sign a Payment Agreement and Initial Disclosure form each year. The form is available online at www.presentation.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees/ and must be submitte d once per year. Failure to complete this form will result in a HOLD being place on your student account and will prevent future registration or release of transcripts. The Payment Agreement and Initial disclosure document contains the official explanation of the College's payment policies. Students are expected to pay any balance due to the College prio r to the first day of each term . The balance due is calculated based on the term charges less payments made to date and less the pending financial aid shown on the statement. Financial aid will be posted to students' accounts within three (3) days of receipt of the funds from the U.S. Department of Education. If a student's payments, including financial aid, exc eed the charges shown on the statement, the student will have a credit balance and will be issued a refund within 14 days of the date financial aid funds are received by the College. Refer to the website for the dates refund checks will be processed each seme ster. Students are encouraged to complete a form for automatic deposit of their refund checks in order to receive the refund as quickly as possible. Refunds not made by automatic deposit wil l be mailed to the student's billing address of record. Payment Plans Presentation College offers the benefit of a monthly payment pl an. Four monthly payments may be made each semester under this plan. Payment amounts will vary based on the student's balance due. Students interested in using a payment plan should contact the Business Office for additional information or refer to the websi te. Late Fees A late payment fee of $50 per month may be assessed on unpaid accounts, including accounts not settled by the first day of clas s, unpaid accounts as of the first of each month, and delinquent payments on monthly payment plans. Unpaid Accounts and Business Holds Students with unpaid balances who have not made payment arrangements with the College will have a HOLD placed on their account. A HOLD means the College will not issue degrees, transc ripts, employment placement credentials, financial aid, final grade reports, or statements of honorable dismissal. Students are also not permitted to register for subsequent terms once a HOLD has been placed on an account. If students fail to pay any balance due at the specified time , they may be administratively withdrawn from the College. Delinquent accounts may be transferred to a collection agency and fees for this service will be added to students' accounts. Institutional Refund Policy - Withdrawal Withdrawing from a course (within the publicized add/drop refund period) Students who wish to withdraw from a registered course and receive a tuition/fees adjustment must initiate the necessary process with their academic advisor. In some cases, financial ai d that has been awarded or disbursed to the student may require adjustment. Withdrawing from a course (after the publicized deadline for a refund) Students who wish to withdraw from a scheduled course after the publicized add/drop period must complete the necessary process with their academic advisor. In some cases, financial aid that has been awarded or disbursed to the student may require adjustment. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 43 Withdrawal from College Students who wish to withdraw from the College must contact their academic advisor or the Registrar's Office. When students officially withdraw from the College or stop atte nding all of their classes during the early weeks of the semeste r, they may be eligible to be assessed only a percentage of costs assessed for the semester; they may also be eligible to retain a percentage of their federal, state and institutional financial aid to assist them with the payment of their costs due to the Co llege. Students should officially withdraw by using the appropriate forms and completing the withdrawal process. When students complete the official withdrawal process their last day of engagement (LDE) is deemed to be the date that they initiated the withdrawal process. The LDE is used to determine the percentage of tuition and other account charges the College will assess as well as the amount of financial aid the student is eligible to retain. Students who wish to withdraw from the College should contact their advisor or the Registrar's Office and complete the official withdrawal process. When it is not possible for students to complete the official withdrawal process or they stop attending their classes without providing notice, the College will determine their LDE once the College becomes aware that a student is no longer attending classes. For students withdrawing during summer 2017 sessions, the fall 2017 semester and spring 2018 semester, the College performs a prorated calculation of tuition and some fees. Book expenses ma y or may not be pro-rated, depending on the source of funds used to purchase the books. The following account charges are eligible for proration for summer 2017, fall 2017 and spring 2018 (\"COSTS ELIGIBLE FOR PRORATION\"): Tuition IT Fee Pro gram Fees Online per hour Fee Housing Charge (Cost per Day Calculation) Meal Plan (Actual Meals Used) The following account charges are not eligible for proration and are assessed at 100%: Course Fees Disciplinar y Fines New-Student Fee Housing Fines Books purchased in the online Bookstore Librar y Fines Supplies purchased in the Saints Stop Clinical makeup Fees Laptop if purchased from the Colle ge Challen ge exam Fees Parkin g Fines Transcript Fees *All institutional aid will be awarde d according to the Cost Eligible For Proration dates listed below.

Please consult the website for exact dates and amounts. Students who had added non-mandatory meal plan dollars to their account will receive a refund of the balance on their account. This applies only to non-mandatory meal plan dollars. For students who fail to complete the official withdrawal process, Presentation College will determine the date of withdrawal once the College becomes aware that a student is no longer attendin g classes. If an amount owed is generated as a result of the calculation, the payment must be received or repayment arrangements must be made within 30 days of notification of the withdrawal date or the student's account will be considered delinquent. The financial aid office performs a calculation of return of Title IV funds that is separate from the College refund calculatio n. That policy is in the financial aid office section of the college catalogue. Deposits The College will retain any deposits that have been paid to the student's account to satisfy the amount due. Deposits are only refunded if the student's account reflects a credit balance.

ACADEMIC YEAR The academic year is divided into two semesters and a summer term with more than one session. DEGREES, CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AND MINORS (AVAILABILITY MAY VARY BY CAMPUS): Bachelor of Science: American Studies Athletic Training Biology Business Business-Sports Administration Communication Criminal Justice Exercise Science Health Science Interdisciplinary Studies Management Nursing Psychology Radiologic Technology Secondary Education Biology Business History Language Arts (English) Psychology Social Work Associate of Science: Biology Business Chemistry Communication Exercise Science Medical Assisting Medical Office Administration (online only) Radiologic Technology Surgical Technology (completion degree for graduates of Presentation College's Surgical Technology certificate program) Associate of Arts: English General Studies Religious Studies Minors: Agricultural Business Management Biology Minors (cont.): Business Essentials Coaching Communication Corporate Recreation/Fitness Criminal Justice Exercise Science Finance Health Services Administration Management Medical Coding Nutrition Psychology Religious Studies Social Work Sports Administration Sports Psychology Women and Children's Global Issues Certificate: Medical Coding (online only) Surgical Technology ACADEMIC POLICIES ACADEMIC POLICIES| 51 OFFICIAL CHANGE IN REGISTRATION \u0087 Add/drop requests begin with students' advisors and are processed by advisors \u0087 Students may add courses within the publicized add period \u0087 Students may drop courses during the publicized drop period, regardless of the course start date. The institutional refund policy for dropped classes is described in the Tuition an d Fees section. Classes held in an accelerated format can be added or dropped according to the above policy regardless of start date; however, financial aid adjustments will not be made. NOTE: *Summer session add/drop requirements may vary and are posted on the summer schedule STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Students are considered full-time when enrolled in 12 or more credit hours per semester during the academic year. Students enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours are classifi ed as part-time. Summer session classifications vary. The number of semester credits completed towards grad uation classifies students in the following levels: Freshman = 0-29 semester credits Junior = 60-89 semester credits Sophomore = 30-59 semester credits Senior = at least 90 semester credits CREDIT HOUR EXPLANATION In an effort to ensure conformity with commonly accepted practi ces in higher education, Presentation College utilizes the U.S. Department of Education's definition of a credit hour. A credit ho ur is an amount of work that reasonably approximates (1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimu m of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or at least the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practicu ms, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. CLASS LOAD The recommended academic load is 12-15 credit hours during a regular semester. To exceed 18 credit hours requires the recommendation of the faculty advisor, written approval of the Vice President for Academics, and a 3.00 (B) cumulative grade point average. STUDENT ACADEMIC LOAD EXPECTATION The average student workload for one credit hour would be one cl ock hour of direct teacher interaction plus two clock hours of outside work related to the course. At Presentation College , a 15 credit semester schedule would require an average commitment of 45 hours per week for 15 weeks. This definition is consistent with the U.S. Department of Education's expectation. Laboratory courses, clinicals, practicums and internships vary in expectations and are outlined in the course syllabus. ATTENDANCE Students are expected to attend every class session and be on time. Online students report their attendance by participating in their online course(s) as designated by the instructor. If for any reason students must be absent from class, the responsibilit y of making up work rests entirely upon the students. Each faculty member has the responsibility to develop his/her own policy on class attendance. The instructor's attendance policy must be included in the syllabus. This should include statements regarding make-up work and the relationship of attendance to grading. The added costs of supervision for missed classes/clinicals may accrue to the students. Faculty and administration will honor officially approved absences where individuals or groups are absent as part of a College- sponsored activity or in the interest of the College. The director of the activity and the students will be responsible for not ifying the appropriate faculty and staff prior to the absence. Officially approved absences may include tours, athletic competitions, field trips, and professional conferences. ACADEMIC POLICIES| 52 Faculty are required to track and report student attendance on a weekly basis. In addition, faculty are to report a last date of attendance for students who have not met any of the activities included in the definition of academic attendance found in 34 CFR 668.22(l)(7)(i) within fourteen days of last attendance, or less if specified in the course syllabus. Please see the Last Date of Attendance section for more information. LAST DATE OF ATTENDANCE In determining a last date of attendance for students, Presentation College utilizes the definition of academic attendance foun d in 34 CFR 668.22(l)(7)(i) \"Academic attendance\" and \"attendance at an academically-related activity\"\u2014 1. Include, but are not limited to\u2014 a. Physically attending a class where there is an opport unity for direct interaction between the instructor and students; b.

GRADING POLICIES Grading System Student achievement is determined by evalua tive procedures according to objectives set by instructors. This achievement is reported by instructors and assigned grade points per credit hour according to the following: A = 4.0 grade points - outstanding achievement A- = 3.7 grade points B+ = 3.3 grade points B = 3.0 grade points - more than satisfactor y performance B- = 2.7 grade points C+ = 2.3 grade points C = 2.0 grade points - satisfactor y performance C- = 1.7 grade points D+ = 1.3 grade points D = 1.0 grade points - passin g but less than satisfactor y D- = 0.7 grade points F = 0.0 grade points - unsatisfactor y performance ACADEMIC POLICIES| 55 AU Audit. Not computed into GPA. I Incomplete. Given when some portion of the work is lacking for a satisfactory reason. Students who receive an \"I\" (Incomplete) in a course must complete the course by the last date to add a course in the next semester (spring/fall) or as designated on the Incomplete Contract. If the coursework is not completed by that date, students will receive an \"F\". Students with an \"I\" on their record cannot be considered for the President's List or Dean's List in that semester until the Incomplete is graded. Not computed into GPA. P Pass. Not computed into GPA. S Satisfactor y performance. Not computed into GPA. U Unsatisfactor y performance. Not computed into GPA. W Student- or College-initiated withdrawal through 60% of semester (publicized withdrawal date). Does not affect the GPA, but is considered as credit hours attempted for financial aid purposes. Not computed into GPA. WF Student- or College-initiated withdrawal after 60% of semester (publicized withdrawal date). WF is computed in the GPA at 0.00 grade points per credit hour. WU Student- or college-initiated withdrawal after 60% of semester (published withdrawal date) from a course graded S/U. WU is not computed in the GPA. To calculate GPA, multiply the grade points by the number of course credits. Divide the total grade points by the total number of course credits. Example: Course Grade Grade Points Graded Credits Total Points EN113 A 4.0 x 3 = 12.0 SW324 B+ 3.3 x 4 = 13.2 There are a total of 7 credits with a total of 25.2 grade points. 25.2 points divided by 7 credits = 3.60 GPA. Students who complete undergraduate certificate program(s) an d/or earn undergraduate degree(s) from Presentation College and subsequently pursue a graduate degree, will have separate cumulative GPAs on their academic record. Undergraduate degree(s) include certificate, associate, and baccalaureate. Transc ripts will illustrate the complete academic record and note the separation of the undergraduate and graduate GPAs. Course Repeat Policy If a student repeats a course, the record of all attempts will be retained on the student's transcript. Cumulative totals will be adjusted in the term in which the highest grade is achieved, and the cumulative GPA will thereaft er be computed using only the highest grade1. The cumulative GPA will remain unchanged up to the term in which the highest grade is achieved. Students are allowed to enroll in a course three times. This repeat po licy will affect courses repeated from Fall 2014 forward. 1 See the Federal Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy section for more information. Grade Reports Grades are submitted at the end of each semester and are accessed through the student portal. Students may not receive transcripts until outstanding financial accounts have been paid. Access to final grades may be withheld from students with outstanding financial accounts. ACADEMIC STANDING Academic Forgiveness Policy The Academic Forgiveness option is available to degree-seeking students re-entering Presentation College. This policy offers currently enrolled students a one-time, one-year window of opportunity to petition for Academic Forgiveness, allowing students who earlier had experienced academic difficulty to im prove their academic standing and GPA. To be eligible for Academic Forgiveness students must: ACADEMIC POLICIES| 56 1. Have been absent from Presentation College for a minimum of three years; and 2.

The granting of Academic Forgiveness does not supersede institutional financial aid policies governing Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students should be aware that this policy might not be honored at other institutions of higher learning. Review of Academic Standing Presentation College monitors all students' academic progress after fall and spring terms to determine academic standing. Students who are placed on an Academic Improvement Plan may also have their academic standings reviewed after completion of summer terms. 1. Good Academic Standing A student is in good academic standing if the cumulative GPA is 2.00 or above; select majors may require higher standards. 2. Academic Warning When a student's semester GPA falls below 2.00 but cumu lative GPA remains above 2.00, the student is placed on academic warning. Advisors and students create strategies to remedy the situation. Academic warning will be noted on the transcript. 3. Academic Probation The purpose of academic probation is to warn students of th eir scholastic standing. Notification of probationary status will be made in writing to students from the Registrar's Office and a copy of the notice will be sent to the appropriate Dean and advisor.

Academic suspension will be noted on the transcript. If a student chooses to seek readmission to Presentation College after one se mester of suspension, the student is required to undergo review by the Admissions Appeal Co mmittee, on which the Vice President for Academics (or designee) participates. The Committee will review the stat us of the prospective probationary student, requiring a written appeal which will include two letters of recommendat ion and completion of a short questionnaire. Conditions for readmission will include entrance on probationary status, along with the required participation in an academic improvement plan that may include additional meth ods of remediation, mandatory counseling, mandatory appointments with the academic advisor, and/or specific cl ass or clinical attendance requirements, and enrollment in ACADEMIC POLICIES| 57 the one-credit Success Academy Lab (GE011) course. Violat ions of the academic improvement plan may result in dismissal from Presentation College. 5. Other Grounds for Academic Suspension/Probation a. Students may also be given an official warning and su bsequent probation or suspension for continued absences from class, continued failure in assignments over a period of time, or an attitude depicting a lack of motivation and interest as documented by faculty over a period of time. Continuation of the condition after a semester of probation will be considered grounds for suspension. b. The physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing of st udents is an essential component of educational development. Therefore, a student may be requested by th e College to submit evidence of health as determined by a physician or other qualified professional any time du ring the course of the student's education. If a student is believed to be an immediate threat to the safety of himself/herself or others, the College reserves the right to request the student to obtain immediate professional assistance, to withdraw, or to take a leave of absence for aspecific period of time. The College reserves the right to request that a physician or other qualified professionalbe given authorization by a student to provide written documentation to Presentation College stating thathe/she is in good physical, mental, and emotional health. 6. Administrative Withdrawal The College reserves the right to administratively withdraw a student from a class or all classes if, in the judgment of the appropriate College officials, such withdrawal is in the best interests of the student and the College. A \"WF\" grade is given to a student with a College-initiated withdrawal after the last date to withdraw in each semester. A \"W\" may be given prior to the last date to withdraw. A \"WF\" is computed into the grade point average as 0.00 grade points per credit hour. ACTIVE DUTY A student who is a member, or the spouse of a member if the me mber has a dependent child, of the national guard or reserve forces of the United States and who is ordered to state military service or federal service of duty has the following options: 1. Withdraw from the student's entire registration and receive a full refund of tuition and mandatory fees.2. Make arrangements with the student's instructors for course grades, or for incompletes that shall be completed by thestudent at a later date. If such arrangements are made, the student's registration shall remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees shall be assessed for the courses in full. 3. Make arrangements with only some of the student's instructors for grades, or for incompletes that shall be completed by the student at a later date. If such arrangements are made, the registration for those courses shall remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees shall be assessed for those courses. Any course for which arrangements cannot be made for grades or incompletes shall be considered dropped and the tuition and mandatory fees for the course refunded. If Title IV eligible students withdraw due to being called to active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States or have be en otherwise impacted by military mobilization, the College performs the Return of Title IV Funds calculations that are required b y Federal statute and regulations (34 CFR 668.22).

Students on an approved leave of absence who return within the timeframe indicated on the leave of absence form do not need to seek formal readmission. Application for a leave of absence must be made an d approved no later than the end of the semester preceding the leave. Students granted such a leave should consult with the Registrar and Financial Aid offices regarding how a leave of absence may affect their enrollment status and financial aid. Students may request a leave of absence one time. Exceptions for leaves of absence due to emergency medical or military conditions will be made upon submission of supporting documentation. The Request for Leave of Absence form may be found on the Re gistrar's web page or by contacting the Registrar's Office.

To be eligible for honors, Bachelor degree students must have 33 earned hours from Presentation College with the following cumulative GPA: 3.90 to 4.00 Summa Cum Laude 3.70 to 3.89 Ma gna Cum Laude 3.50 to 3.69 Cum Laude To be eligible for honors, Associate degree and Certificate studen ts must have 18 earned hours from Presentation College with the following cumulative GPA: 3.90 to 4.00 with Hi ghest Honor 3.70 to 3.89 with Hi gh Honor 3.50 to 3.69 with Honor STUDENT APPEAL/GRIEVANCE PROCESS Purpose The appeal/grievance process is designed to afford all st udents a means to redress any form of unjust, oppressive, discriminatory, or fundamentally unfair practice affecting student academic performance or progress. Such identified practice may be either academic or non-academic in nature. Academic/Non-Academic Appeal/Grievance Defined For the purpose of the policy and procedures that follow, ac ademic/non-academic appeals/grievances refer to a substantial complaint of a serious nature. It is a student's claim of injury or wrong resulting from a decision, practice, or act by a memb er or members of faculty, administration, or staff, which is arbitrary and capricious, unjust, oppressive, discriminatory, fundamenta lly unfair, or exceeds the limits of academic freedom. For any matte r to give rise to such an appeal/grievance subject to these procedures there must be clear an d convincing evidence, which demonstrates either arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the individual faculty, administration, or staff member or acti on which is oppressive, discriminatory, fundamentally unfair, or which exceeds the limits of academic freedom. The evidence must also establish that such action was injuriou s. In all such appeals or grievances, the burden of proof and persuasion is upon the student. Academic/Non-Academic Appeal/Grievance Process Students who wish to appeal or grieve academic or non-acad emic actions/decisions are to fo llow appropriate channels of communication in seeking resolution of differences. Note: ordinarily a final grade may not be appealed. In order for a student to pursue an appeal of a final grade, the student must have specif ic concrete evidence that the grade was either erroneously or unfairly awarded. A challenge to a grade received in a course , comprehensive examination, or other graduation requirement will be considered only when the student alleges that the grade received reflects other than a ppropriate academic criteria, tha t is, achievement and proficiency in th e subject matter as stated in the course syllabus. When a student appeals a final grade, the student will provide the faculty member with a copy of all petitions. Informal Phase: When a student believes that he/she has a grievance or complaint related to his/her enrollment and successful progress at the College, within 10 business days of the action for which the grievance is being filed, the student must approach the instructor/staff/administrator directly and attempt to reach an understanding at that level. In those rare instances where a student believes that a direct approach might prejudice his/her standing, the student may bring the problem directly to the ACADEMIC POLICIES| 59 attention of the instructor/staff person's supervisor or Dean. The Informal Phase shall last no longer than two weeks from the date the grievance was initiated. Formal Phase: Level 1. In those instances in which a satisfactory resolution is not secured in the Informal Phase, and in those instances where the grievance involved more than a single event/course or College employee: 1. The student should provide written notification of the complaint to the appropriate Dean and/or area supervisor within two weeks after the completion of the Informal Phase. 2. The Dean/Supervisor may discuss the matter with the student and any involved faculty/staff separately or together. a. If the situation warrants, the Dean/Supervisor may solicit the views and opinions of other faculty members, staff, and/or students on the matter at issue and may use any division appeal or grievance mechanism that has been established. b. A written decision must be given to all parties involved within 10 business days from the date Level I was initiated. Level 2. In those cases where a satisfactory resolution has not been secured at Level 1: 1. The student may, in writing, request a conference with the appropriate College administrator (Vice President for Academics, Vice President for Finance, Vice President for Student Affairs, or Executive Director for Mission). 2. In attempting to reach a clarification and resolution of the grievance, the administrator should meet with the concerned parties within five business days after the written decision has been rendered in Level 1. a.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Academic Integrity - Policies and Procedures Inherent in the mission of Presentation College is the strong belief in the principle of academic integrity. Students' actions reflect their moral character and, by extension, the College's reputation . Therefore, all students are expected to recognize and abide by the following: It is a major responsibility of students and faculty to promote academic integrity. The College will not tolerate violations by cheating, plagiarism, fabr ication and other academic misconduct. The principles of academic integrity require that a student: x properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others. x properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work. x make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of impermissible materials or impermissible collaboration. x obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her interpretation or conclusions. x treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct theiracademic progress. x uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for which he or she is preparing. Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to ensure that: x everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments. x all student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others. x the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered. x the reputation of the College for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced. . The faculty shares the responsibility for educating students abou t the importance and principles of academic integrity. Faculty members are expected to inform students of the particular re quirements regarding academic in tegrity within their specific courses, to make reasonable efforts to minimize academic dishonesty, and to respond appropriately to violations of academic integrity. Faculty members are strongly encouraged to provide a statement concerning academic integrity and a link to the Academic Integrity Policy on their course syllabi. Students are responsible for understanding the principles of academic integrity and abiding by them in all aspects of their work at Pr esentation College. An online tutorial on academic integrity is required in some courses at Presentation College. Once students pass the online examination they will receive a score in Moodle indicating they have been educated on the academic integrity policy at Presentation College. Students not in a course that ACADEMIC POLICIES| 61 requires this can ask to take it to assess their knowledge. St udents are also encouraged to help educate fellow students about academic integrity and to bring all alleged violations of academic integrity they encounter to the attention of the appropriate authorities. Types of Violations of Academic Integrity 1. Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person's work as your own without appropriate acknowledgement of his or her work. You commit plagiarism if you: 1. Quote or paraphrase from another paper without crediting the original author. 2. Fail to cite information or ideas from another source. 3. Propose another author's idea as if it were your own. 4. Submit a paper to be graded or reviewed that you have not written on your own. 5. Copy answers or text from another classmate and submit it as your own.6. Cite data without crediting the original source. 7. Fabricate references or using incorrect references. 8. Submit someone else's presentation, program, assignment, spreadsheet, or other file with only minor alterations. This is not a definitive list - any action, which misleadingly implies someone else's work is your own, can constitute plagiari sm. Levels of Plagiarism Various levels of plagiarism are recognized from intentional to unintentional plagiarism; however, all are unacceptable in submitted assignments. Level 1 plagiarism is plagiarism that is perceived to be due to a student's inexperience with academic writing or presentation of academic work, or a la ck of knowledge of the conventions used for paraphrasing, referencing, or acknowledging sources, rather than an intention to deceive. Level 1 plagiarism is not considered an academic integrity violation, but is reported for tracking purposes. Level 1 plagiarism is defined as doing any of the following without attribution for a minimal portion of the assignment: x Inserting verbatim phrases of 2-3 distinctive words. x Submitting synonyms into the original sentence rather than rewriting the complete sentence. x Reordering the clauses of a sentence x Imitating the sentence, paragraph, or organizational structure, or writing style of a source using a source's line of logic, thesis or ideas. Faculty should use instances of Level 1 plagiarism as teaching opportunities and adjudicate it themselves as deemed appropriate. Instances of Level 1 plagiarism should be reported to the academic integrity committee for tracking purposes. Level 2 plagiarism describes incidents where student conduct is cons idered dishonest and unfair in connection with their academic work. Level 2 plagiarism is considered a mi nimal academic integrity violation, and is subject to the sanctions for minimal violations described in the Levels of Violations and Sanctions section. Level 2 plagiarism is defined as doing any of the following: x Any of the Level 1 items without attribution to the extent that it comprises a significant portion of the assignment. x Multiple occurrences of Level 1 plagiarism. x Inserting verbatim sentences or longer passages from a source. x Combining paraphrasing with verbatim sentences to create a paragraph of more text. x Reusing or modifying a previously submitted assignment for a present assignment without obtaining prior approval from the instructors involved.ACADEMIC POLICIES| 62 Level 3 plagiarism describes serious incidents where student conduct is considered dishonest and unfair in connection with their academic work. Level 3 plagiarism is considered a substantial academic integrit y violation and is subject to the sanctions for substantial violations described in the Levels of Violations and Sanctions section. Level 3 plagiarism is defined as doing any of the following: x Multiple occurrences of Level 2 plagiarism. x Submitting or presenting someone's complete published or unpublished work (paper, article, or chapter). x Submitting another student's work for an assignment, with or without that person's knowledge or consent. x Using information from a campus file of old assignments. x Downloading a paper from a web site. x Buying a paper from a mail order company, web site, or another student. 2. Cheating Cheating is the use of inappropriate or prohibited materials, in formation, sources, or aids in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes Level 3 plagiarism such as submitting papers, rese arch results and reports, analyses, etc. as one's own work when they were, in fact, prepared by others. Some common examples are: x Receiving research, programming, data collection, or analytic al assistance from others or working with another student on an assignment where such help is not permitted. x Copying another student's work or answers on a quiz or examination. x Using or possessing books, notes, calculators, cell phones, or other prohibited devices or materials during a quiz or examination. x Preprogramming a calculator or other electronic device to contain answers, formulas, or other unauthorized information for use during a quiz or examination. x Acquiring a copy of an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination, including the use of websites to find answers to textbook's test bank. x Having a substitute take an examination in one's place. x Submitting as one's own work a term paper or other assignment prepared by someone else. 3. Fabrication Fabrication is the invention or falsification of sources, citations, data, or results, and recording or reporting them in any academic exercise. Some examples are: x Citing a source that does not exist. x Making up or falsifying evidence, data, or other source materials. x Falsifying research papers or reports by selectively omitting or altering data that do not support one's conclusions or claimed experimental precision. 4. Facilitation of Dishonesty Facilitation of dishonesty is knowingly or negligently allowing one's work to be used by other students without prior approval of the instructor or otherwise aiding others in committing vi olations of academic integrity. A student who intentionally facilitates a violation of academic integrity can be considered as culpable as the student who receives the impermissible assistance, even if the facilitator does not benefit personally from the violation. Some examples are: x Collaborating before a quiz or examination to develop methods of exchanging information. x Knowingly allowing others to copy answers to work on a quiz or examination or assisting others to do so. x Distributing an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination. x Distributing or selling a term paper to other students. x Taking an examination for another student.ACADEMIC POLICIES| 63 5. Violations Involving Po tentially Criminal Activity Violations in this category include theft, fraud, forgery, or distribution of ill-gotten materials committed as part of an act of academic dishonesty. Some examples are: x Stealing an examination from a faculty member's or College office or from electronic files. x Selling or distributing a stolen examination. x Forging of any College document x Falsifying a College transcript. Levels of Violations and Sanctions Any violation of academic integrity is a serious offense and is therefore subject to an appropriate sanction or penalty. Academ ic integrity violations at Presentation College are classified into two levels called minimal and substantial. Minimal violations are less severe violations for which the possible sanctions do not include suspension or expulsion from the College; substantial violations are more severe violations for which the possible sanctions include suspension or expulsion. Whether a given violation is classified as minimal or substantial depends on a number of factors including: the nature and importance of the academic exercise; the degree of premeditation or planning; the ex tent of dishonest or malicious intent; the academic experienc e of the student; and whether the violation is a first-time or repeat offense. 1. Minimal Violations Minimal violations are less serious viol ations of academic integrity. These vi olations are generally quite limited in extent or represent a small percentage of the total course work. Below are a few examples of violations that are most often considered minimal, at least when committed as a first-time offense. This list is not exhaustive and classification of a given violation as substantial or minimal is always heavily dependent on the facts and circumstances of the violation. x Any instances of Level 2 plagiarism. x Unpremeditated cheating on a quiz or minor examination. x Unauthorized collaboration with another student on a homework assignment. x Citing a source that does not exist or that one has not read on minor assignments. x Fabricating a small number of data points on a laboratory exercise. x Signing in for another student via attendance sheet or clicker in a course in which attendance counts toward the grade. An alleged second minimal violation is trea ted as an alleged substantial violation Sanctions for minimal violations include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following, and do not include suspension or expulsion: x Required participation in a noncredit workshop or seminar on ethics or academic integrity. x An assigned paper or research project related to ethics or academic integrity. x A make-up assignment that may be more difficult than the original assignment. x No credit for the original assignment. x A failing grade on the assignment. x A failing grade for the course. x Disciplinary warning or probation. Faculty should report all minimal violations for tracking purposes; however, they may adjudicate the violation themselves as deemed appropriate or may request the academic integrity committee to adjudicate. 2. Substantial Violations Substantial violations are very serious violations of academ ic integrity that affect a more significant portion of the course work compared to minimal violations. Below are some examples of violations that are most often considered substantial. Again, the list is certainly not exhaustive and clas sification of a given violation as minimal or substantial is always heavily dependent on the exact facts and circumstances of the violation. x A second minimal violation. x Any instances of Level 3 plagiarism.ACADEMIC POLICIES| 64 x Cheating, as described above. x Fabrication, as described above x Facilitation of dishonesty, as described above. x Knowingly violating research or professional ethics. x Any violation involving potentially criminal activity. Sanctions for substantial violations include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following and may, but need not, involve suspension or expulsion: x A grade of F for the course. x Dismissal from a departmental or school honors program. x Denial of access to internships, externships, or research opportunities. x Loss of appointment to academically based positions. x Loss of departmental/graduate program endorsements for internal and external fellowship support and employment opportunities. x Removal of teaching assistantship, scholarships, or work-study support. x Suspension for one or more semesters. x Permanent expulsion from the College with a permanent notation of disciplinary expulsion on the student's transcript. Faculty should report all substantial violations to the committee for adjudication. The recommendations for sanctions at each level are not binding, but are intended as guidelines for the College community. For both minimal and substantial violations, the severity of the sanction impo sed should be proportional to the severity of the violation committed. Administration of the Academic Integrity Policy Role of Faculty and Administration Faculty and Staff at Presentation College are required to report instances of student academic misconduct. Minimal violations can be adjudicated by the faculty member, but an incidence report must still be filed. 1. Faculty/Academic Staff Faculty and Academic Staff are expected to promote academic integrity and educate students about the importance and principles of academic integrity. Faculty members are expe cted to inform students of the particular requirements regarding academic integrity within their specific courses, to make reasonable efforts to minimize academic dishonesty, and to respond appropriately to violations of academic integrity. 2. Academic Integrity Committee Academic Integrity Committee is a standing Faculty Assemb ly Committee. Membership of the committee includes a representative from each academic department and a repr esentative from Student Government Association. Each faculty member is elected for a 2-year term. The Academic Integrity Committee w ill help educate faculty and students concerning academic integrity, advise faculty members concerning academic integrity policies and procedures, and adjudicate allegations of academic integrity. a. The Academic Integrity Committee will meet regula rly to review cases of alleged student academic misconduct. If needed, the Committee will conduct an investigation of the complaint, including but not limited to interviewing the person bringing the complaint forward and the student accused. The Committee will determine whether adequate evidence is availabl e to warrant student sanctions and determine the level of sanction deemed appropriate for the level of student academic misconduct. i. For minimal offenses, the Academic Integrity Commi ttee, at the request of the faculty member, can provide a written statement to the student explaining the offense and the sanctions assigned. 1. For a first-time offense, the individual facu lty member can adjudicate the student violation themselves, but a report must be submitte d to the Academic Integrity Committee. The reporting process provides evidence if multiple infractions occur and allows review of disciplinary action taken. ii. For substantial violations, the Academic Integr ity Committee must hold a Disciplinary Conference with the student accused, explaining the offense and the sanctions assigned. ACADEMIC POLICIES| 65 1. For substantial violations, the Academic Integrity Committee can levy a sanction as severe as course failure without involving the Vice President of Academics. 2. For substantial violations, that the Academic Integrity Committee believes warrants expulsion from an Academic Program, the Committee will recommend such sanctions to the Dean of the appropriate Department. 3. For substantial violations, that the Academic Integrity Committee believes warrants expulsion from Presentation College, the Committee will recommend such sanctions to the Vice President of Academics. 3. The Vice President of Academics a. The Vice President of Academics will receive recomme ndations from the Academic Integrity committee if the Committee believes the offence warrants expulsion from Presentation College. b. The Vice President of Academics will be provided with the evidence from the Academic Integrity Committee and conduct his/her own investigation before adjudicating the final sanction. Procedures for Adjudicating Allegations of Academic Violation Initial Reporting of an Alleged Violation A Faculty or staff member who observes or is apprised of a po ssible academic integrity violation by a student or group of students must report the incident on the Academic Integrity link. Minimal Violations a. If a Faculty or staff member wishes to adjudicate the matter, he or she will complete the academic integrity reporting form, indicating what he or she believes the alleged violation to be, along with evidence or a narrative supporting the claim and how the allegation was resolved. i. The Faculty member must also notify the accused student in writing or by electronic communication that he or she is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, that the matter has been referred to the Academic Integrity Committee, and that the student should expect to be contacted shortly by the Committee if follow up is required or if this incident advances the student to a substantial violation due to mult iple violations. Following the re ferral the Academic Integrity Committee assumes responsibility for any additional follow up. 1. The Academic Integrity Committee will run a report to ensure this is the first violation by the student. If this is not the first violation and the alleged act moves the student to Substantial Violation, the Academic Integrity Committee will open an investigation and notify the student. b. If a Faculty or staff member does not wish to adjudicate the matter, he or she will complete academic integrity form, indicating what he or she believes the alleged violation to be and the evidence or narrative supporting the claim, and requesting the Committee adjudicate the incident with the student. i. The Faculty member must also notify the accused student in writing or by electronic communication that he or she is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, that the matter has been referred to the Academic Integrity Committee, and that the student should expect to be contacted shortly by the Committee. Following the referral the Academic Integrity Committee assumes responsibility for any additional follow up. 1. The Academic Integrity Committee will run a report to ensure this is the first violation by the student. If this is not the first violation and the alleged act moves the student to Substantial Violation, the Academic Integrity Committee will open an investigation and notify the student. Substantial Violations a. If a Faculty or staff member believes a student has committed an alleged substantial violation of academic integrity, he or she is required to complete an academic integrity form, indicating what he or she believes the alleged violation to be and the evidence supporting the claim. b. The Faculty member must also notify the accused student in writing or by electronic communication that he or she is alleged to have committed a violation of academic inte grity, that the matter has been referred to the Academic GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS| 66 Integrity Committee, and that the student should expect to be contacted shortly by the Committee. Following the referral the Academic Integrity Committee assume s responsibility for any additional follow up. Investigation of Alleged Academic Integrity A Faculty member or Academic Integrity Committee adjudicating an allegation of a first time minimal violation of academic integrity must meet with the student unless the student elects not to meet with the Faculty member of the Committee. At the meeting, the Faculty or Committee members will specify the alleged violation, discuss the typical range of sanctions for such violation and ask the student to respond to the allegation. In addition to meeting with the accused student and carefully considering his or her response to the allegation, the Faculty member or Committee members will investigate the matter and reac h a decision by considering all available physical evidence and interviewing available witnesses. If the student does not re spond within the prescribed time limit or chooses not to meet with the Faculty member or the Committee, the Faculty memb er or Academic Integrity Committee will reach a decision regarding responsibility and sanction, based on the available evid ence, including any written response from the student. At the end of this process, the Faculty member or Academic In tegrity Committee will take one of the following actions: a. If it is found that the student has not violated the Academic Integrity Policy, the faculty member or the committee will notify the student in writing or by electronic communication within 10 working days after meeting the student. The matter will be considered closed. b. If it is found that the student has violated the Academic Integrity Policy, the committee will communicate the proposed sanctions in writing or by electronic communication within 10 working days after meeting with student. The notification will also inform the student of the opportunity to appeal the sanction following the College Grievance Process. The form will be uploaded to the student file in File Director. c. If the sanction recommended for the violation is suspensi on from the student's academic program, the committee will forward the recommendation and evidence on to the approp riate Dean. Following the referral from the Academic Integrity Committee the Dean will assume final responsibili ty in regards to a student's removal from an Academic Program. d. If the sanction recommended for the violation is suspension from Presentation College, the Committee will forward that recommendation and evidence on to the Vice Presiden t of Academics. Following th e referral from the Academic Integrity Committee, the Vice Presid ent of Academics will assume responsibility for final sanctions. Because of the critical nature of the education and licensure es tablished by the State and/or accrediting agencies, many of the programs at Presentation College require more hours to meet graduation requirements than are typical of some College programs. Each academic major may vary. See individual major requirements for details on credits and grade point average. Presentation College requires that 30 of the last 60 credits earned for a bachelor's degree that the institution awards, and 15 of the final 30 credits for an associate's degree it awards, be credits earned at the institution. A candidate for a degree or certificate for graduation is expect ed to be present for commencement ceremonies. A candidate for a degree or certificate must file an application on the website at the time designated in the academic calendar, usually at the t ime of registration for the final semester. Students who lack the re quired credits for a certificate or degree may apply to the Vic e President for Academics to participate in th e May commencement ceremony of that year if they are within 11 credits of degree completion. The diploma will be awarded after students complete all requirements. Students who fail to complete all remaining requirements by the end of the next regula r academic semester after they commenced wi ll be required to re-apply for graduation and pay the applicable graduation fee. Students follow the requirements of the catalog in place at the time of enrollment into the major. If College or major requirements are changed, students may opt for the new requ irements. Students who withdraw or are dismissed from the College or a major must follow the requirements of the catalog in place at the time of readmission into the College or major. T he College reserves the right to change requirements. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS| 67 Students who have completed the requirements for graduation but who have outstanding financial obligations to the College will receive the certificate/diploma and a release of transcript upon clearing their financial obligation with the Business Office.

Participation credits, whether taken at Presentation College or through transfer work, will count as institutional credit without limit. NOTE: institutional credits count toward full-time status and total credits completed for purposes of financial aid, but do not necessarily apply to graduation. Participation credits will be categorized as either athletics or arts credits. Up to eight participation credits may be applied toward graduation as elective credit, with no more than five of the eight credits from a single category of athletics or arts. SERVICE-LEARNING PROGRAM Service-learning is an important component of Presentation Co llege's extended mission statement. All candidates for the associate and baccalaureate degrees at Presentation College must satisfactorily complete the required and approved service- learning projects. \u0087 Associate degree students are required to complete one service-learning project* \u0087 Baccalaureate degree students are required to complete two service-learning projects** \u0087 Students who transfer in 60 or more credits are requ ired to complete at least 1 service-learning project *RS293 Christian Ethics curriculum requires a service-learning project; therefore, successful completion of RS293 satisfies an associate degree seeking student's service-learning requirement. **Baccalaureate degree seeking students who successfully complete RS293 Christian Ethics will satisfy one of the service- learning requirements. Students who entered Presentation College prior to Fall 2014 may use the service-learning hours toward the volunteer service hours requ irement needed for graduation. This requirement is intended to provide students with an oppo rtunity to serve their community, apply knowledge gained in the classroom and become informed, active, responsible, and ethical ci tizens. Service-learning is different from volunteerism. It i s anticipated that through these projects and reflection students will enrich their understanding of the gifts and opportunities they have been given in life and that all persons have an obligation to give back to their communities. Students are placing their g ifts and talents at the service of others with no expectation of monetary reward. These interactions add to the richness of the student-learning experience and provide occasions for reflection on life and its meaning. It is our belief that in serving othe rs, we serve God. Service-learning objectives: \u0087 Connect meaningful service, relevant academic work, and critical reflection \u0087 Apply knowledge and skills to specific service projects \u0087 Grow and develop academically, spiritually, and civically Students who are granted transfer credit for RS293 Christian Ethics will be granted credit for one service-learning project. Students who transfer an ethics course without a service-learning component will be granted credit for RS293 Christian Ethics and must register for and successfully complete SLC000 Service-Le arning to meet one of the requ ired service-learning projects required for graduation. Any student enrolled in a course that integrates a service-lear ning project must successfully complete both the academic course and the service-learning project to pass the co urse and fulfill a service-learning project. Students can fulfill a service-learning project in three ways: 1. Successful completion of RS293 Christian Ethics 2. Successful completion of an academic course with an integrated service-learning project. Some academic majors require specific coursework, internships, or other activities that may fulfill a service-learning project. Students must pass both the GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS| 73 academic course requirements and the servic e-learning project to fulfill a service-learning project. Current approved courses are: GE411 Professional Development NB445 Community Health Nursing NU455-IN Community Health Nursing SW422 Social Work Project Students may be concurrently enrolled in two of the above courses to fulfill the graduation requirement if permitted by requirements set for indi vidual academic majors.

ATHLETIC TRAINING PROGRAM Athletic trainers (ATs) are health care professionals who collab orate with physicians. The services provided by ATs comprise prevention, emergency care, clinical diagnosis, therapeutic inte rvention, and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions . Athletic trainers utilize their knowledge and skills in a variety of settings. The athletic trainer plays a vital role in the prevention, recognition/management, treatment, and rehabilitation of injuries that occur during physical activity. Athletic Trainers may work in professional, college/university, and seco ndary school military; the performing arts; and in physician offices. Many athletic trainers work outside of athletic settings; they provide physical medicine and rehabilitation, as well as other services to people of all ages. Athletic training is practiced by athletic trainers (AT), health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients across age and care continuums. Athletic training encompasses the preventio n, diagnosis, and intervention of emergency, acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations, and disabilities. ATs work under the direction of physicians, as prescribed by state licensure statutes. Their patients and c lients include everyone from professional athletes to industrial worker s. Recognized by the American Medical Association as allied health professionals, athletic trainers specialize in the prevention, diagnosis, assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of m uscle and bone injuries and illnesses. Program Certification Students must graduate and complete a Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) accredited athletic training education program before they are eligible to sit for the Board of Certificat ion, Inc. (BOC) certification ex am. Once the student successfully passes this examination, he or she earns the \"Certified Athletic Trainer (ATC)\" credential from t he BOC. The ATP at Presentation College is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). For more information regarding the accreditation standards of athletic training programs, please visit www.caate.net. The Athletic Training Program Students in the Athletic Training Program (ATP) must demonstrate: 1. Physical ability to perform assessments and handle equipment; 2. Ability to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and colleagues; DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE| 76 3. Capacity to maintain composure during periods of high stress; 4. Perseverance, diligence and commitment to complete the program; 5. Flexibility and ability to adjust to changing situations in clinical situations; 6. Ability to relate professionally to others. Technical Standards for Admission and Retention The ATP at Presentation College is a rigorous and intense pr ogram that places specific requirements and demands on the students enrolled in the program. An objective of this progra m is to prepare graduates to enter a variety of employment settin gs and to render care to a wide spectrum of individuals engaged in physical activity. The technical standards set forth by the AT P establish the essential qualities considered necessary for students admitted to the clinical phase of the program to achieve th e knowledge, skills, and competencies of an entry-level athletic tr ainer. The following abilities and expectations must be met b y all students admitted to the clinical phase of the Athletic Training Program. In the event students are unable to fulfill thes e technical standards, with or without reasonable accommodation, students will not be permitted to progress to the clinical phase . Compliance with the program's technical standards does not guar antee progression in the ATP at Presentation College and/or eligibility for the Board of Certification, Inc., and certification exam. Candidates for selection to the Presentation College ATP must demonstrate: 1. The mental capacity to assimilate, analyze, synthesize, integrate concepts, and problem solve to formulate assessment and therapeutic judgments and to be able to distinguish deviations from the norm. 2. Sufficient postural and neuromuscular control, sensory function, and coordination to perform appropriate physical examinations using accepted techniques; and accurately, safe ly and efficiently use equipment and materials during the assessment and treatment of patients. 3. The ability to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and colleagues, including individuals from different cultural and social backgrounds. This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to establish rapport with patient s and communicate judgments and treatment information effectively. Students must be able to understand and speak the English language at a level consistent with competent professional practice. 4. The ability to record the physical examination results and a treatment plan clearly and accurately. 5. The capacity to maintain composure and continue to function well during periods of high stress. 6. The perseverance, diligence, and commitment to complete the athletic training program as outlined and sequenced. 7. Flexibility and the ability to adjust to changing situations and uncertainty in clinical situations. 8. Affective skills and appropriate demeanor and rapport that relate to professional education and quality patient care. Candidates for progression into the clinical phase of the athletic training program will be required to verify they understand and meet these technical standards or that they believe that, with certain accommodations, they can meet the standards. Presentation College disability services, in conjunction with the athletic training program director, will evaluate a student w ho states he/she could meet the program's technical standards with accommodation and confirm that the stated condition qualifies as a disability under applicable laws. If a student states that he/she can meet the technical standa rds with reasonable accommodation, the College will determine whether it agrees that the student can meet the technical standa rds with reasonable accommodation. This includes a review as to whether the accommodations requested are reasonable, taking into account whether accommodation would jeopardize clinician/patient safety, or the educational process of the st udent or the institution, including all coursework, clinical experiences and internships deemed essential to graduation. Admission to Athletic Training Program Students who are enrolled in the Athletic Training Program (ATP ) are subject to two different minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) standards. Students who are enrolled in courses that are prerequisites for the clinical phase of the ATP or general education courses required for the degree must earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. Students are, however, advised that maintaining a minimum GPA of 2.00 is not sufficient to meet the standard for enrollment into the clinical phase of the ATP. Students applying to the clinical phase of the ATP are required to have a 2.50 cumulative grade point average or higher at the end of the semester they are applying. Students apply for the clinical phase of the ATP after completing the foundational core during their non-clinical phase. Durin g this time, students are required to take the following athletic training courses (may be taken concurrently during application semester): \u0087 AT111 Introduction to Athletic Training DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE| 77 \u0087 BI162 Medical Terminology \u0087 BI213 Human Anatomy and Physiology I \u0087 BL211 Human Anatomy and Physiology I Lab \u0087 BI293 Human Anatomy and Physiology II \u0087 BL291 Human Anatomy and Physiology II Lab \u0087 EXSC112 First Aid and Emergency Cardiac Care \u0087 EXSC333 Care and Prevention of Injuries and Illnesses These courses require a grade of a \"C-\" or higher in order to apply to the clinical phase of the athletic training major. Competitive Admissions Application and Selection Process In addition to the above academic requirements, acceptance into the clinical phase of the ATP will be determined by evaluation of the student's formal application to the ATP. The following application materials are due to the ATP Program Director in April of the spring semester: 1. Two letters of recommendation (one from faculty - non-ATC (Certified Athletic Trainer); one from supervisor) 2. Completion of 10 observation hours and worksheet packet (given in AT111) 3. Completed application form 4. Typed 500-word topical essay 5. Formal interview with ATP selection committee Selection of the student for the clinical phase of the ATP is based on a scored rubric. Each application item (overall GPA, GP A for pre-application courses, evaluation of observation student, observation worksheet, two letters of recommendation, application essay, and interview) is scored, weighed to a maximu m of 100 total points, and then multiplied by a predetermined percentage. The top point-earning students from each cohort will be selected based on the number of available openings for the ATP. For example, if 10 seats are open for a given cohort, the top 10 point-earners will be selected. During non-competitive application years (more ATP cohort seats open than applications), the interview component may be omitted. Official acceptance into the Athletic Training Program will occur after final grades for the spring semester are posted. Stude nts offered a position in the Athletic Training Program will have one week to confirm their appointment. Provisional Progression In situations where cohorts do not fill all the available clinical phase openings for the ATP, students who do not meet applica tion minimum requirements may progress provisionally to the clinical phase in the ATP. In such cases, a formal letter of provisiona l acceptance stating the terms of admission to the clinical phase of the program will be sent to the student and placed in his/he r official academic file. The terms will include: \u0087 which requirement was not met \u0087 the process the student will ta ke to meet the requirement \u0087 the length of time the student has to meet the minimum requirement If the student does not meet the minimum requirement in the time allotted in the written contract, the student will be not be allowed to progress in the clinical phase of the program. During the provisional time of acceptance, students may be subject t o certain clinical and/or academic requirements or limitations. Any student accepted into the clinical phase of the ATP under provisional status must meet minimum program acceptance standards within one academic year (two semesters). Program Academic Retention Requirements Once accepted into the clinical phase of the Athletic Training Program, the student must continue to meet the academic and clinical requirements of the program. Stud ents who fail to meet the academic retention standards will be placed on probation. Athletic training students' compliance with the academic retent ion requirements will be measured at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Listed below are the academic re tention requirements for each level in the program. Clinical Level I: \u0087 minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA; \u0087 minimum 2.75 GPA in athletic training major courses; \u0087 grade of \"C-\" or higher in all \"AT\" prefix courses Clinical Level II: \u0087 minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA; \u0087 minimum 2.75 GPA in athletic training major courses; \u0087 grade of \"C-\" or higher in all \"AT\" prefix courses DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE| 78 Clinical Level III: \u0087 minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA; \u0087 minimum 3.00 GPA in athletic training major courses; \u0087 grade of \"C-\" or higher in all \"AT\" prefix courses Clinical Education Students formally accepted into the clinical phase of the ATP will complete a minimum of 140 hours of clinical education at various sites per semester.

Due to the rigors of athletic training study and the comprehensiveness of the BOC\u00ae certification exam, athletic training students must ma intain an above average academic level. Academic probation serves as a warning of the student's athletic training program and overall academic status. Students must be aware that a second semester of academic probation will delay the student's gr aduation at least 1 year. The athletic training student will meet with the program director to develop a written contract to address the unmet requirements. The contract will address (but not limited to): \u0087 Academic plan of action to address requirements not met \u0087 Required study hours with ATP faculty Academic Disciplinary Actions 1.

DIVISION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE & HUMANITIES| 147 SOCIAL WORK The Division of Social Science & Humanities offers a Bachel or of Science degree in Social Work (BSW) as professional preparation for entry level positions in social welfare and human service delivery systems, or entry into graduate school. The degree program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) an d prepares students at the Aberdeen campus for the Generalist practice. Generalist practitioners work wi th individual, families, groups, organizations and communities. A general practitioner enables people to enhance their own proble m-solving and coping abilities, advocates for human operation of societal systems, and links people with resources. Theref ore, the generalist perspective requires that students learn competencies in a wide array of areas rather than specialization. Graduates will be prepared to intervene in a purposeful manner, utilizing knowledge of people and environment as well as the ethics of the profession to guide their behaviors. Upon graduation students will have achieved the ten Core Social Work Competencies as identified by the Council on Social Work Educ ation-Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards. Students with a BSW degree have a wide range of career possibilities. As noted by the National Association of Social Workers Guide for Schools and Programs of Social Work, social workers are employed in: \"schools, hospitals, mental health facilities, senior cent er, private practices, prisons, the military, corporations, go vernment, private and public agencies\" (NASW 2008, p. 3). A variety of minors are available to students majoring in so cial work, including: criminal justice, psychology, corporate recreation/fitness, religious studies and health services administration. The BSW program is offered at the Aberdeen campus of Presentation College. Courses are offered in a variety of form ats, including traditional classroom settings, online and video- conferencing. The Social Work Student Handbook is updated each year and is available on-line. It is the students' responsibil ity to review the handbook and be accountable for the information and policies. Admission Students are first admitted to Presentation College and then may be admitted to the Social Work program. Students may declare their interest in social work as a major at any time after admission to the College. Students may apply for formal admission to the Social Work major in the spring of their sophomore year. The Social Work program admissions committee will evaluate students based on the program's admission criteria. The Social Work program admission process is designed to accomplish two goals. First, it is intended to admit to the program those students who may reasonably be expected to complete the progra m academically, to be accepted by agencies for field placement and to perform competently as professionals upon graduation. Second, it is based on the need to maintain a program of excellence in the classroom and assure availability of quality fi eld placements. The administrators for the Social Work progra m reserve the right to refuse admission to any student who does not meet the established criteria for program admission.
