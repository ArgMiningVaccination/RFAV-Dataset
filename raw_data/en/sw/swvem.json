After all, what does \"free-range,\" \"natural,\" \"organic,\" \"grass-fed\" and \"fair-trade,\" really mean? Paying careful attention to the food you purchase and consume not only helps to reduce your carbon footprint, but it also has a positive impact on your health and overall wellbeing! Below, find our top tips for a clean, green diet: 1) Eat local: There are countless reasons to eat local. To name a couple: you'll reduce carbon emissions caused by the shipping and transportation methods of traditional grocery stores (which can contribute to global warming), and you'll simultaneously support your local economy. 2) Pay close attention to labels: Did you know that \"natural\" is completely different from \"organic?\" Organic products come from farms that don't use pesticides, antibiotics or growth hormones. These farms also provide animals with access to the outdoors and a 100% organic diet. For the record, \"natural\" is an ambiguous term used by many brands as a marketing ploy. There are very few government regulations concerning the \"natural\" label, so watch out! Look for the Canadian and USDA label of \"organic\" or \"100% organic.\" 3) Read the nutritional information: Check out [these helpful tips](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/nutrition-labels-how-to-read_n_1889011.html) on the best way to read a nutritional label and what to avoid. 4) Utilize re-usable shopping bags: Skip the pack of gum or candy bar and instead pick up a few of those re-usable shopping bags that cover the \"impulse buy\" checkout lane. 5) Try out your green thumb: Growing your own produce, vegetables, or herbs can help the environment by offsetting carbon emissions caused by purchasing such products in stores. Who knows...gardening may become your next beloved hobby! Opt for sustainable seafood: It's no secret that our planet's oceans - and their inhabitants - [are in trouble](http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/7-major-threats-to-our-planets-oceans/world-oceans-day). Be sure that the seafood you're consuming comes from [sustainable](http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/take-action/sustainable-seafood/) sources. Eat green: Literally. Adding more fruits and veggies to your diet and eliminating several servings of dairy and meat every week can work wonders for both your health and the environment.
