The developmental approach to moraleducation attempts to%voidthearbitrarynormso!societyandthe naturalisticfallacyby coordinating philosophicalprinciples ofhuman actions and values the stagesof natural growth and moral development.Arguably themostcomprehensive theoryof moral development useful classroom strategies isthe workofLawrence Kohlberg.Kohlberghasexpandedthecognitive-developmental work of Piaget to build a stage theory ofhow childrendevelop the capacity for moral reasoning.It ispedagogically important for science teachers to haye anappreciation of the characteristics of thesestages of moral reasoning to ensure that their teachingstrategies (when discussing moral andethics-related science topics) are consistent with themoral growth stagesoftheirstudents,justasknowledgeof cognitivedevelopmentpermitsustoorganizeand present oursciencelessonsinsuchawayasto facilitate the intellectual growth ofourstudents.

Proconventional levelAt this level, the child is responsive to cultural rules and labels.cg good and bad, right orwrong, but interprets these labels either in terms of the physical or the hedonistic consequences of action (punishment, reward, exchange of favors) or in terms of the physical power of those who enun- ciate the rules and labels. The level is divided into the followingtwo stages: Stage 1: The punislinient-and-obedience orientation. The phydatconsequences of action determine its goodness or badness,regardless a the human meaning or value of these conse-sLewe.Avoidance of punishmentenclunquIsdoning deferenceto power are valued in msvnright, not in terms ofrespect for an underlying moral order supported by punishment and authority (the latter being Stage 4). !tap 2: The instrumentakelatitibt orkntation. Right action consists of that which instrumentally satisfies one's own needs and occasionally the needs of others. Human relations are viewed in terms like those of the mark.'ere. Elements of fairness, of redprocity, and of equal sharing aie present, but they ars ,gh-gms interpreted in a physical, pragmatic Way. Reciprocity is a matter of \"you scratch my back andscratch yours,\" not of loyalty, gratitude. or justice.U. Conventional levelAt this level, maintaining theexpectations of the individual's family, poop. or nation is perceived as valuable in its own right, regardless of immediate :end obviousconsequences. The attitude is not only one of conformity to personal expectations and social order, but of loyalty to it, of actively maintaining, supporting, and justifying the order, and of identifyingwith the persons orgroup iritivad in it. At this level, there are the following two stages: Stap 3: T* interpersonal concordance or \"good boynke gvr orientation. Good behavior is that which pleases or helps othersand is approved by them. There is much conformity to stereotypical images of what is majority or \"natural\" behavior. Behavior is frequently judged by intention\"hemeans well\" becomes impatant fog the first time. One earns approval by being \"nice.\"Stage t rio \"late and order\"orientation. There is orientation toward authority, fbced rules, and the maintenance of the social order. Right behavior consists of doing one's duty, showing respect for authority, and maintaining the given social order forits own sake.l'ostconventional, autonomous, or prindpled level At this level, there isa clear effort to define moral values and principles that have validity and application apart from tne authority of the groups orpeesons holding these principles and apart from the individual'sown identification with thesegroups. Thls les* also has two stages: Step 5: The social.contract,legalistic orientation, generallywith utilitarian overtones.Right action tends to be defined in terms of general individual rights andstandards which have been critically examined and agreed upon by the whole society. There is a dear awareness of the relativism olpersonal valuesand opinions anda corresponding emphasisupon pro- cedural rules reachingconsensus. Aside from what is constitutionally and demo- cratically agreed upon, the right is a matter of personal\"values\" and \"opinion.\" The result is an emphasisnpon the \"legal point of view, gut with an emphasisupon the possibility of changing law in terms of rational considerations of soda' utiiity (miler than freezing it in terms of Stage4 'law and order). Outsidethe legsl realm, freeagreement and contract is the bindingelement of obligation. This isthe \"official\" morality of the American government andConstitution. Stage & The animist ethical-priociple orientation. Right is defined by the decision of conscience in accord with self-chosen Aka' principles appealing to logicalcomprehensiveness, univer- sality, and consistency. Those prindples are abstract andethical (the Golden Rule, the categorical imperative); theyare not concrete moral rules like the Ten Commandments. At heart, these are universalprinciples of justice, of thereciprocity and equality of human rights, and of respect for thedignity of human beingsas individual persons.

The wording ofthe ideasis addressedto teachers and isintended to suggest a way in which they can present the ideas orallyor inprint.Thequestions,factual background, and reading references may be useful too, but amajor goalhas beento keepthemallbrief. It's thebrief presentation of an idea by the teacherthat is central to each \"item\" in the collection.Thisverybrevityhelpstoresoivethe objection that theteacherisnottrainedinthe subject matter of the item, for unlike the long modules presentlyinprintwhichrequirecarefulte:,.cher preparation and study, ourshort itemsrequirenone whatever.Theteacher ert. Teachersand studentsare wrong answers, andeven thechoice ofthe least unpleasant resolution often requires moreknowledge than a busy teacher or student can ever hope to master. This, we suggest, isas it.should be, for it is precisely suchopen-ended \"no right answer\" questions which constantly confrontusasadults,taxpayers,voters,and consumers; it is for that adult world full of ambiguitythat we hereby prepare our students. The following material consists of a number of short\"iteie.whIchrsquire, then,little orno class time or teacher preparation. In preparing them we have been guided by several considerations.For anitem to be useful it must be relevanttoa specifictonicinaconventionalfirst-yearchemistrY,physics, While thisexcludes ouritems is to enhsnce the teaching ofour present conventional course topics, not to distractfrom them.As an ideal, one can imagine at least one item for every single topic.For anitem to be useful it should relate .togi Youngster'simmediate world or to an issue which canOstia appealto We avoid issueswhich, however important, elude immediate recognition,and weseek items which will provoke thought and stick 'I in themind.Theycanbeamusing,puzzlLng,startling, or paradoxical as well as serious.For anitem tobe usefulit should requirethought leading to a choice or a decision.

They report that 6 to 16 minutes, perhaps once a week, is effective in reinforcing the effectof the quick references andingivingadditionalmotivationtoanewtopic. Typically, they report thatthey haveto resistthe classdesiretodevoteexcessivetimetosuch discussions. Not surprisingly, they also noticed a pronounced increase in thesophistication of response of students in the upper grade levels and an increasing inclination to react tothe material even when stated in its briefest form.Teachers also report that as successfulalternatives to class discussion they have:-offered students extra credit for an essay or brief report on a topic-predicted an extra-credit question on the next quiz-formed small groups to role-play opposing viewson a question.Inadditiontothesemoretime-consuming proceduresweofferinthelatterpartofthis collection avariety of student activities that derivedirectly fromsomeoftheprecedingitemsinthe collection.

Th strands of mitochondrial DNA can be broken into fragments by various-enzymes. The fragments from a particular ethnic group nf people are all the same, but fragments from diffrnt ethnic groups (e.g.Papago Indians, Westrn Europeans, Eskimos, African Bushmen) are demonstrably different as a result of mutations incurred by their many ancestors over long periods of time iA the past. Th.4 longer the tine elapsed, the more the DNA kragments of any two groups arefound to differ from each other. .Vorking backwards, it appears that ill the ethnic groups studied so far have common ancestors who lived in Asia between 60,000 and 100,000 years ago.From the study of fossilsthat period of time has been determined to be the timeduringwhichmodnrnmen,Bonosapienssapiens, originated-- a time before diverse ethnic groups existed.

Dollar value ofa human lifeIn dollars,how much money is yourlife worth?Or your neighbor's? IL your answer determined by a human being's responsibilities? By their contributiontotheeconomy ortosociety?By sentiment?This is not just a theoretical question.In the process of transforming coal into coke foe use in making iron and steel a mass of coal is heated to over 2000 degrees F for up to 16 hours. The coal gives off hydrocarbon gases known to cause lung cancer.Theremedyisclearandeffective-- engineering improvements and changes in work practices that steel industry experts say ould cost about $200million every year. As nearll, as can be estimcted,the changes would save 109 lives a year plus untoldhuman suffering.At one of the hearings of the OczapationalHealthandSafetyAdministration consideringsuchremedies it was argued that the remedies would costbetwan $1 million and $9 miAlion per worker saved.Since each worker was destined to earn only $200,000 to$500,000inhiscareerthecostofthecontrolsoutweighed the benefits, and therefore, it was argued,nothing should be done.For another example, if it would cost automanufacturers $90 million to install improved bumperswhich will save 100 lives per year, is it worth doing?If each life is valued at $1 million, that is a savingof $10 million, so on a strict cost-accounting basis itj. worth it.In theory such an approach helps industries,governmentagencies,andthecourtsdecideissuesaffecting loss of human life.For example,theEnvironmental Protection Agency puts the oflife $8.3 million. The FederalAviation gency assumes $1 million, while the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission puts it at S2 million.If you are horrified by this, then how sig youdecide how much a human life is worth when health andsafety legislatL.n is being written or legal damagesbeing determined? As a regulator or a judge you mustdecide eiten_if your dec4sian is to do nothing. Asexamples of cases requiring decisions, consider whetherit would be cost effective:-to maintain crash fire trucks at small airports.-to prolong the expensive safety testing of a newdrug.-to pay for the regular inspection of the nation's565,000 hi( my bridges, half of which (according tothe Rational Highway Traffic Safety Administration) arepotentially unsafe.-to close a copper smelting factory (in Tacoma,Washington in 1983) with the certain loss of 800 jobsor to accept the uncertain but demonstrated risk oflung ccncer from arsenic in the air resulting in aboutone death per year.-for'an airline to lower the age of retirement ofthe aging airliners in its fleet when one w-ash occurs. -6-Debating dissection Should a biology student bereguirssito take part in animal dissections?In a recent case in New Jersey a 17-year-old high school student refused to dissect a cat in biology class./n defence of his stand he said, \"/ think dissection just reinforces the idea that animal life is cheap.I feel it's an inherently objectionable thing to do.\"Buta past president of the New Jersey Science Teachers Association held an opposite view.

Recently DNA research has led to an ability to identify which children will be stricken and face a lingering early death and which children will not-- usually between the ages of 35 and 50.If your parent had Huntington's, would you take the test? (Two thirds of a sample of 36 such people said they would).If you find you have inherited the defective gene, should you have children?If you already have children, should you tell them?+ Should aseverely retarded child with an incurable disease be treated when treatment will merely serve to prolong a painful life for a few months?How about 20 years? t. live?Aging processGiven free choirs, how long would you like to Rendarchnowinprogress may reveal whypeople age.If the aging process can be significantlyslowed to allow people to live two or three centuries,would you want to live that long?

As a result there now exists:-Jwheat with the soybean's ability to fixatmospheric nitrogen and convert it to fertilizer, thanks to newly engineered bacteria in its roots.-bacteria that digest oil from spills.-bacteria that create petroleum and alcohol.-bacteria that raise the freezing point of water so that ski slope operators can make snow at warmer temperatures, and vegetables (e.g. tomatoes) gain frost resistance.-micro-organisms whose metabolism creates interferon (an anti-.cancer agent) and insulin (for treatment of diabetes), and vaccines against malaria and rabies.Is it safe to release gene-altered micro- organisms- outdoors where they can spread freely? And how can yoa make sure?(See item: Patenting Plants aad Animals, p. 15. Why shouldn't people who carry antibodies to the AIDS viru3 but have not yet developed the disease be isolated or fired from their jobs? -15-Patenting plants and animals It is possible now to invent and to patentnew plants and animals-- if you can afford it.In April 1988, eight years after the U.S.Supreme Court legalized the patenting of geneticallyaltered micro-organisms the U.S. Patent Office ruledthat genetic engineers may now patent ligt-r lifeforms-- evan mammals. One immediate result lay bethat with patents at stake and many millions of , )11arsinvested in competitive research and development, thescientistsdevelopingneworganismsforsaleareunlikely to share information freely with colleagues, asubversion of one of the important characteristics ofgood science.Another bad reicult, critics charge, is thatcompetitive pressures to win profitable patents mayencourage cruel animal experiments and may also wipeout smallfarmers who may not be able to affordgenetically improved livestock. (See first followingexample).They worry, too, that escaped or mutantorganisms might unleash a biological catastrophe ofsome sort on an unprepared worldOn the other hand,supportersofgeneticengineering insist that genetic manipulation may hastena cure for AIDS and other diseases, may help to reducechemical pollution of the environment, may produce newnon-polluting substances that may replace fossil fuelsaa a source of energy and industrial raw materials, andmayproduce new agricultural food plants.Support or disapproval of these conflictingpositions must take account of unresolved ethical andsafety questions. For example:- Is it safe to release new gene-altered plants oranimals into the environment?- Is it ethical to alter the genetic structure ofanimals?Don't they have rights?- By what rules or standards does our society decidewhether a new technology should be pursued?As Dorothy Nelkin, a professor in CornellUniversity's Program on Science, Technology and Society - 1 6- pointsout,\"Theissuesrangefromethics within universitiestotheenvironment,toeugenics,to definitionsof nature, to religious thought, to what it is to be human. The stake is tens of billions of dollarse hundreds of thousands of jobs, and America's ability to compete in the world's agricultural and pharmaceutical marketplace. Only the ability to obtain a patent just.!.fies the immensel expense of the necessary research\".As an example of what can happen, consider 8GH, a synthetic protein identical to a hormone that is producednaturallyinacow'spituitarygland. Through genetic engineering, researchers have developed a bacterium that can produce the BiGHproteinin commercial quantities. Caws that were given the protein in daily injection: increased their milk yields by 10 to 20 percent. The Untted States is already producing more milk than it knows what to do with. With no markt.t for more milk,an increase in milk productivity will require a decrease in the number of cowsinproduction--whichwillresultina corresponding decrease in the number of dairy Elms. If the federal Food and Drug Administration approves the use of BCHmany small farLA will be driven out of business.Thisisonly one example of how genetic engineering might well speed the elimination of small farmers and increase the size and industrialization of farms all over tb.- world. Already the number of farms in the U.S. has been dropping from 4.8 million (in 1954) to 2.3 million (in 1985), and ...Ae average size of the survivors has more than doubled from 242 acres to about 445 acres. If this decline continues what effect will it have on mar community? On local and state taxes and on food prices? On the social diversity of urban and rural society as ever more farmers go out of businesoe Should failing farmers receivefinancialassistance') Doestherecent widespread failure of savings and loan banks in Texas bear on these questions? Should the use of BGH be made illegal?As a second example, fisheries biologists at Auburn University (Alabama) are isolating the gene in catfish which produces growth hormone, and their work shows promise of reducing the time needed for catfish to grow big enough to eat, thus improving the vitality of the South's $300 million aquaculture industry. A plausible next step is to genetically alter fish to survive in polluted lakes and rivers. -17- Yet another example is a genetically alteredstrain of rice with greater drought tolerance which nasrecently been created for use in arid countries.Since 1986 researchers have altered 32 otherspecies of plants including corn, cotton, and soybeans, and the number of field experiments has been doublingeach year (1990). Among the goals is the desire to eliminate the need for pesticides to kill various worm parasites.The engineered genes become a permanentpart of each plant cell, making every bite a lethal nne for'voracious worms.It might be worth making a class collection of newexamples of genetic engineering_ and posting them as they are noted from time to time in newspapers and magazines.Who benefits from the development? Who, if anyone, is hurt? How are are society or people's lives altered?

The question:Was Henry VII7 malnourished? provides an example.\"His appetite for food and for women is legendary, but despite his royal girth, Henry VIII may have died from malnutrition. According to historian Susan Kybett,it was not syphilis, as once commonly believed, but a chronic lack of vitamin C that killed the king in 1547 at age 55\".\"Henry'sfrequentcolds,constipation, bloated body,collapsed nose, bad breath,ulcerated legs and wild mood swings are all symptoms of scurvy. The affliction was commonin Tudor England, where fruits and vegetables were not only scarce but also shunnedbytheupperclassesasunfittoeat. Itybett... contends that the deficiency also affected Henry's personality. If so, it could conceivably have affected his decision to marry six times-- having two of his wives beheaded-- and break with Rome to found the Church of England. Which raises the question, Might a few bottles of vitamin C on the king's table have changed the course of history?\" (Time, Sept. 11, 1989)Might diet be having any effect on events or on calture in parts of America? How do you know your diet is adequate? -25-Energy to produce food A loaf of bread requires far more energy toproduce than you gain by eating it. The energy outputof a slice of white bread is about 75 Calories, butover750Calorieswentintoitscreationandtransportation to you.Thus, energy input ia 10 times as great asenergy output. The energy inputs include:- solar energy falling on wheat fields- gasoline for tractor for cultivation- manufacture of all tools (e.g.,tractor) used inpreparation-work expended personally by farmers, bakers,tranaportation workers and you while shoppingfor it-heafor the baker's ovenBy contrast, consider a primitive farmer inNew Guinea.Each Calorie of human energy he investsin raising sweet potatoes, taro, and cassava returns 16Calories of food energy at harvest time. For him,input is only 1/16 as great as output. Thus, in atleast a limited sense, Ids primitive agriculture is 160times as efficient as American mechanized agriculture!(Current Energy and Ecology Mag., Doc. 1981, p. 15).A second example: From May through Octobermost of the lettuce eaten in New York (1983) is shipped3000 miles by truck from California. The energyrevired for the trip costs 15 cents per head and addsup to six million gallons of diesel fuel per year justto =AM= the lettuce!Are these sensible uses of energy?

As ily one example, the genes from Turkish barley that gave it resistance to yellow dwarf disease is worth $150 million annually to U.S. farmers.Xn contrast, the genetically perfected plantvarieties bred by the commercial seed companies have been considered to be private property and therefore an article of commerce for which payitent must be made-- even by Third World countries who are impoverished and You may disapprove of South Africa's abuse of human rights,but it isthe source of 81% of the world's supply of manganese, which is necessary for the hardening of steel.

If we plant enough of them they will ease the presentthreat ofglobal warming caused by the buildup ofcarbon dioxide in the air.Here is something you can do to help in apractical way.Trees, crops, grass, and other green plantsabsorb carbon dioxide from the air and convert it toplant material (cellulose, starch, sugars, et al.) andoxygen bya processcalled photosynthesis. Thereaction is energized by sunlight bygreen chlorophyll.6CO2 + 61120 = C6111206 + 602Carbon dioxide is the gas chiefly responsiblefor the greenhouse effect. (See item: Absorption ofRadiation: Greenhouse Effect, p. 154 ).Its removal from the atmosphere by the photosynthesis of greenplants is being retarded by the massive destruction offorests and the desertification of agricultural landworldwlde,andinsteaditsconcentration in theatmosphere is being steadily increased by the burningof fossil fuels like coal, oil land gasoline. (Seeitems: Destruction of Tropical Forests, p. 46,andSoil Erosion, p. 32 ).To reduce the greenhouse effect we clearlymust reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in theair, which requires, in turn that we cut back on fossilfuel consumption and increase the effectiveness ofphotosynthesis.Thesefundamentalfactsofnaturehave convinced a number of expertsthatthe widespreadplanting of trees and conservation of existing forestsis one of the surest, ersiest, and least expensive waysto slow or even to reverse the buildup of carbondioxide in the air.In one of the first large-scale actions inthis direction the American Forestry Association (1516P Street N.W., WashingtonD.C.20005),a citizens'conservation organization, has under=aken a nationalcampaign aimed at planting 100 million new trees in A -28-American cities and towns by 1992. The E.P.A.ispresently considering the feasibility of planting 400 million trees, which could reforest 20 percent of the U.S.highwaycorridorsand,plantedstrategically around buildings, would not only soak up carbon dioxide but would also provide shade to help reduce peoples' energy use in hot weather. The E.P.A. estimates that the total mass of American forests could be increased by 60 percent in this way.Although it makes sense to develop large-scale tree planting programs on degraded land in the tropics,someofitdenudedandabandonedafter traditionalslash-and-burn, itisalso true that a reforested acre here in your home town in the U.S. is just as effective as a reforested acre in Brazil or Indonesiainhelpingtopromotephotosynthesis worlewideandcounteractingthegreenhouseeffect. Thus, by planting trees, even in your own backyard, you cangenuinelyaddressaworld-classenvironmental problem without having to travel overseas.Over 100,000 children and adults in 42 states have planted and cultivated many thousands of trees for feuit or shade all ovev the U.S. through the agency Trees for Life, 1103 Jefferson, Wichita, Kansas 67203. Each tree. removes an average of 13 pounds of carbon dioxide every year, converting it to oxygen, as shown in the above equation.Here are a few more things you can do to fight global warming:-Recycle newspapers. An entire printing of the Sunday New York Times consumes an average of 75,000trees; preserving them by recycling could remove nearly one million pounds of carbon dioxidl: annually.-Switch to natural gas.Burning coal and oil forenergy are far greater culprits in global warming thannatural gas.-Insulate your space.Each year as much energy leaks'through Americrm windows as flows through the Alaskan oil pipeline.-Ridethebusorsubwaywheneverpossible. Roughly one third of the global warming caused by the U.S. stems from transportation.-Get better gas mileage. The average car driven in the U.S. emito nearly 60 tons of carbon dioxide during its lifetime Fuel-efficient cars available today emit less than half that amount. -29- -Put the heat on politicians. There are scoresof actions our elected leadersshould take at thenational, state, and local levels to alleviate globalwarming.Does it follow that 1,ecause you are so smalland the problem is so big that your effort will beworthless?(See item: Trees vs. Desert, p. 33 and thebooklet \"Slowing Global Warming: A Worldwide Strategy\",C.Flavin.WorldwatchPaperSeriesnotedinBibliography.) Unpredictable costs of environmental protection 18 environmental cleanup worth undertakirgwhen you don't know how much it will cost?In many cases itisextremely difficult--probably impossible-- to predict the dollar costs ofenvironmental protection even though supposedly precisescientific and engineering facts are available.For example in 1965 the New York State votersapproveda billion-dollar bond issuefor,inthegovernor's words, \"the elimination of water pollutionin New York's lakes, streams, and rivers\" within sixyears.Seven years later another 1.15 billion-dollarbond issue was approved for the same general purpose.After another three years had passed, it was estimatedby a state spokesman that to meet federal EPA standardsby 1983 would require an additional expenditure \"on theorder of18billiondollarsTM.

The fires also destroy bushes and woodlands, thus increasing the grasslandarea.As a consequence the population of grass-eatingwild animals in the adjG.Ining Serengeti National Parkhas expanded enormously. The100,000 wildebeeststhere in 1960 have become two million in 1980, and thepopulation of gazelles and zebras has also exploded sothat in a drought overpopule.tion will result in massstarvation.One solution is to harvest a fraction ofthe population for their meat and hides and for export.This means the regular systematic slaughter of animalsinoneofAfrica'smostbeautifulandanspoilednational parks.Should this be done?If oil were to be found beneath one of ournational parks should it be drilled for?

But 50,000 to 70,000 acres of America's land is being built over every week for highways, new housing, factories, etc.(1986).That's about 350 acres every hour. About one third of this is agricultural land.Moreover, the topsoil on the remaining land, . which averaged three feet thick two hundred years ago is blowing and washing away at the rate of five to seven billion toes a year so that today our fertile topsoil averages only about six inches deep. It's been calculated that in Iowa alone the soil being lost to erosion would fill a five ton truck every second of every day.But soil erosion can be controlled. It's been done in China for 2000 years. In the U.S., however, except in such high yield areas as the corn and wheat belts, effective conservation can add $250 to $300 an acre to the cost of farming. For a farmer to stay in business he must exploit his soil; he cannot afford to build it. He is, in effect, borrowing from his children-- and f1.2m you.Not incidentally, American homeowners spend $12 billiona year to maintain lawns wtose product--grass clippings-- they count as a nuisance.

If asthma proves to be agenetic disease, should that be curedgenetically?What about baldness?-If it should ever become possible to do so, do youPillow alteration in any healthy individual's germcells to \"improve\" his/her children by making themtaller, stronger, or smarter?-What if people want to use the technology to improvegenes that are not defective but me-aly mediocre?Could genetic engineeriny become the cosmeticsurgery of tne next century? In June 1983 a group of about 40 religiousleaders issued a statement calling for a complete banon human genetic engineering, or genetransplants, F.; -52-arguingthat\"humansshouldnotassumethe prerogatives of the Creator\", and that \"no individual, group, or institution can legitimately claim the rightor authority to make such decisions on behalf of the rest of the species.\"On the other haad, many people contend that the chance to reduce suffering or enhance human well- being far outweighs the risks of genetic tampering. Who do you think is right?Just before and during World War II, using political action and physical force the Nazis tried to promote what they considered to be \"pure Aryan\" German citizens and set about destroying all the Jews they could (about 6,000,000).

Yet among adults 15 percent of all married couples in this country are unable to haveany children, according to an American MedicalAssociationestimate. Thecausesmay originate in either the male or the female partner. In females one of the most commcn causes is blockage of the fallopian tubes or oviducts, but it is now possible to circumvent such a blockage by fertilizing the ovum outside the body using a technique known as in vitro fertilization (IVF). The fertilized ovum is then reimplanted in the uterus, where development of the embryo takes place normally.The fertilizedovum can be implanted in the same female whose ovum was fertilized, or 4,tcan be implanted in the uterus of a second woman who agrees to carry the baby to term. The baby may then, by prior agreemetit, belong to either the genetic mother or to the surrogate mother who gave it birth. -53-The first such \"test tube baby\" was born toits genetic mother in England in 1978. Since thenmore than 5000 such births have been reported here inthe U.S.(1989) and about 15,000 worldwide. Untilthere is a statistically significant number of in vitropeople living out their lives the procedure must stillbe considered as being experimental and the peoplethemselves as guinea p.4.4s, for there are risks in anyprocedure which, like the thalidomide disaster, may notbecomc apparent until later. On the oth r hand, fortheinfel'tileparentsdesiringapregnancytheprocedure is certainly desirable.So far, no U.S. state has passed any lawgoverning surrogate motherhood or rvF, but thetechnology of rvF raises serious ethical questions.For example:-Does the government have a responsibility toprevent people trom taking risks that are stillundefined or to regtlate who who may become IVFparents?-Do rvF parents have a right to subject thedevelopinghuman embro to the risks of theprocedure?-In the case of a surrogate mother, who should beentered in the official records as the child'slegal mother-- the genetic mother or thesurrogate mother?-What are the legal rights of the embryo?-The IVF procedure costs upward of $3000 perattempt, and often several attempts are necessaryfor success.

WOWED rigidly? -59- AIDS and society's responsibilityBoth for doctors and for society AIDS raisesproblems unlike those of any other disease.For society the problems turn on the fact thatmost AIDS patients cannot afford their long-drawn-out (sixmonths to two years) terminal care. Hence insurancecompanies try to screen out applicants for insurance and todeny policies to applicants who may be carrying the disease.To the degree that they are unsuccessful, the company'sfunds for terminal care are being consumed at the expense ofother policy holders, whose premiums must therefore beincreased.Hospital budgets are likewise being strainedand broken to the detriment of patients whose illnesses arefundamentally more manageable.Some day (if not now) you will probably be anapplicantfor medicalinsurance. Howcaninsurancecompanies and hospitals be fair to you and at the same timedo justice to the needs of AIDS sufferers?For doctors one of the problems posed by AIDS wasexpressed by Dr. C. Everett Roc:41 when he was the U.S.SurgeonGeneral speaking to the President's AIDS Cmadssion (N.Y.Times, Sept. 13, 1987):\"Health care in this country has always been predicatedon the assumption that somehow everyone will be caredfor and that no one will be turned away... that carewill not be abandoned for the sick and the disabled,whoever they are. Hence, the reports of a fewphysicians and others witholding care from persons withAIDS are extremely serious, in my opinion. Suchconduct threatens the v.try fabric of health care inthis country..\"Remembering that however unlikely it may be for aphysician oradentisttoacquire AIDSin treatingapatient,and remembering that the disease isinvariably fatal, what are the responsibilities of a doctor who may have a family of his own to consider as well as an AIDS patient?(For questions and student thinking activities toprovoke discussion and analysis of the public fear of AIDSsee\"DifficultDecisions:AIDS\".I.L.Slesnick,TheScience Teacher, Jan. 1988, pp. 34-5.) -60- AIDS vaccine There is great doubt that a vaccine fcr AIDS will ever be practical. Nonetheless,the need is so groat that a ma or worldwide effort is under way. If a promising vacc_ .e is found its creation will raise difficult questions. For example:When,inthe course of research, doesit become morally acceptable to conduct experiments on live subjects? Chimpanzees, the animals clinically nearest to humane do not seem to get AIDS from the wild strain of the disease, so they would not be appropriate test subjects. Sooner or later any promising vaccine will have to be tried on human beings. Like who?The research scientists themselves? Drug addicts?Prison inmate volunteers? People already infected?Since human experimental subjects must be protectedagainst exposing thewselves to infection from the AIDS virus (which is always fatal), how can such a human egperiment be designed to prove that a vaccine works?Ii will take years for the necessary large- scale testing to ensure the efficacy of a new vaccine. For example,serious side effects that occur rarely from measles, swine flu, and other vaccines did not show up untilyears after they had been marketed andinjected into people.And if such a vaccine is finally developed for marketing,tjw can it t distributed equitably worldwide, given timt the demand will be urgent and enormouso much of it from third-world countries that won't be able to afford it?(See item: Av)S and BociaZy'sResponsibility,P. 59). -61- Organ transplants Many parts of your body can be replaced byartificial parts (prostheses). Plastic hips, heariagaids,pacemakersforyourheart,wigs,uentalstructures, and artificial arms and legs are only a fewof the more familiar ones.Many more parts of your body can be replacedby transplanting living healthy organs from someoneelse.Eye(cornea)and kidney transplants, skingrafts, and of course blood transfusions are common,and entire hearts are now being transplanted fromanimals and from healthy accident victims into peoplewith terminal heart disorders, but the need fortransplant organs now far exceeds t4e number of donorsbecoming available. This raisss tough questions.As a first example, given two desperatelyneedy patients, both about to die, how do you decidewhich one is to be saved by the one available heartfrom an accident victim? Would you be willing todonate one of your two kidneys to save the life of astranger?Of a family member?Second, fresh transplant organs are typicallyaognized from the body of someone who has just died orbeen killed LI an accident. Speed is important inperforming the transplant, but how do you know thedonor is truly dead? Brain waves? Heart beat?Breathing?And who has the right to grant the use ofa donor's organs? Relativew(often unavailable)?The surgeon (a heavy responsibility for one person whoisastranger)?A committee(hardtoassemblequickly)?Although delay can cost the life of therecipient, haste can cost the life and rights of tlyzdonor.Third, in France a law was passed recentlythat decrees that at death all the organs and tissuesof a person's.body may be used for transplant purposesunlessthey objectin writing before their death.This measure makes avaLlable a copious supply of organsfortransplantpurposes--hearts,lungs,livers,kidneys,eyes-- and will undoubtedly save numerouslives.Do you think a government has the right todecidetheuseofyourbodyatdeath,evenforhumanitarian purposes? On the other nand, isn't it -62-selfish, if not almost criminal, to refuse the use of your dead body for humanitarian purposes?Fourth, It is becoming practical to implant anentireartificialheartintoanailinghuman, (Barney Clark, 1983; William Schroeder, 1984) 50,000 people a year stand to gain added years of life from the operation which costs $100,000 (1988). But that same total investment of $5 billion would save many more than 50,000 lives if it were invested in measures to prevent heart disease in the first place. (See item: Tobacco,p. 9)In 1983172 transplants of natural hearts were actually performed in the U.S.; as many as 5000 people could have benefited from the operation.

Her teen-age parentshad no job, nc money, no child-care training.Pregnant teen agers often have defective orprematurebabies--babiesthatcanbesavedbytechnology but only at a staggering expense. Who paysfor them now? Who should pay? Should access tounlimited medical technologyregardlessofcost beconsidered as a right of all American citizens?Healthinsurancealonecannotsolvetheproblem,for37millionAmericanshavenohealthinsurance whatever.The National Research ( ncil reports that in1987 about a million U.S. teen agers became pregnant,resultingin470,000 births, 400,000 abortions and130,000 miscarriages. That's about 1300 live babiesof teen-age parents per day. Since teen-age parentshave severely limited career prospects they are likelyto become dependent on public assistance. and the costto society is high. $17 billion in federal assistance(lid to Families with Dependeat Children, Medicaid, andfood stam?s) went in 1985 to families begun by birthsto teen-age mothers. As a semi.: example, should Congress fund thedesign of an artificial heart? If fully perfected, asit probably would be, it might benefit 17,000 to 35,000beart disease patients whose lives would otherwise befJut short.(1985 report by the N.I.H.

Of coursethe patient's quality of life presents problems too-- aprediction of 2.3 hospitalizations, a drug maintenance -64- regimen,and need forconstant medical supervision which has to be paid for somehow, with an expected life extension of only 54 months. Couldn't that money bemore effectively spent on prevention of heart diseasein the first place?Situationslikethesearemakingit impossible to argue that we must save all life at any cost.We simply can't afford to do so. If we were to try, then the federal government should pay not only for these thousands of heart transplants annually but the $300,000 bill for a single liver transplant or the- care of a 60-year-old alcoholic as well as for the care of a defective new-born child. for Jane?Where do you draw the line?

That, in turn,may make &A otherwise .healthy person uninsurable.Insurancecompaniesinsomestatesare demanding proof that an &pplicant is not at risk for AIDS, and since the number of people at risk for A/DS is rising .toepiuemic proportions so also is the number of people whoare unable to obtain health or life insurance andare therefore destineu to become wards of the state whenthey become ill. If blood tests are legally prohibited as a condition for obtaining health insurance theninsurance companies will be unable to screen out people who are at particularly high risk, with the result that the increasing -rmber of AIDS victims willraise the price of policies for sal insured individuals. In effect, theenormous costs of the AIDS epidemic will be increasingly borne by the uninfected public.Should bloodtests be made mandatory for insurance applicants? If you say \"No\", then who should pay thecosts of hospitalizing people who later came down with AIDS?If you say 'Yes\", you should recognize thata tiny minority of people who do not have HIV in their blood nonetheless test positive for it.To exclude them from insuranceor jobs clearly would worka great injustice to these very fwd.

CHEMISTRY BeginningOn of Censervation of Matter Where is all the trash and waste material forwhich you were personally responsible during the pastmonth?The Law of Conservation of Matter is one ofthe cornerstones of chemistry. Just about all of theatoms of which you are made have been around since theformation of the earth-- and earlier--and used over andover again by living organisms down through history.And they will persist into the indefinite future.The atoms of wastes (if they are not radio-active)are also indestructable. While some waste compoundsdecomposeintosimplercompounds(e.g.,sewage and kitchen garbage) other compounds often donot.Wheneveritrainsourlakes,rivers,andshorelines are dosed with oil, lead, and bacteria fromcity streets,sediments and pesticides from erodingfarm lands,soil from construction sites, and acids from mines.An example of the latter is the \"acid mi-drainage\"associatedwithcoaldeposits.contaminates streams in coal mining areas with sulfuric acid.A reaction is4FeS +902 + 4H20 = 4H2SO4The FeS is deposits, and the02 is from the air.Another example: \"Rubber dust is an awful mess im cities, towns, or near freeways.

Yeats, \"The Second Coming\")Work must be done (energy expended) to createorder out of disorder. Left to themselves, orderly arrangements of matter tend to become disorderly orrandom.Disorder(measured byscientistsbyaquantity called entropy) tends to increase. Thus:-a pack of cards arranged in order becomes disorderedwhen it is shuffled. It is extremely unlikelythat shuffling would arrange the cards innumerical order again. An effort (work) would berequired to arrange them in order.-a box of sugar cubes or an egg are orderlystructures.Dropped on the floor they becomedisordered.Humpty Dumpty.-a plant or animal body is highly ordered when it isalive.Metabolic work during life maintains theorder.At death randomness ensues.-environmental pollutants of all kinds (chemicals,heat, solid waste) may be tightly confined invarious containers (ordered), but if not cared forthe containers fail, and disorder follows. workis then required to restore order, which isusually expensive, sometimes impractical.-it is very expensive to extract fresh water from theocean.For further examples consider what happens tothe orderliness of:a) soda pop and beer bottles, once in factorycontainers, ending up alongside highways.b) the energy of a lump of coal being dissipated inthe atmosphere.c) your disorderly bedroom unless you perform work topick it up.d) a discarded automobile rusting in the.town dump. -74- e) an abandoned building.f) PCB's and other industrial wastes disposed of in the river, in waste land above the water table, or as flue gases up the smokestack.g) radioactive waste from the spent fuel rods of nuclear power plants.h) information transmitted by word of mouthCan you name some other examples?Collect and post appropriate news clippings that illustrate the increase or decrease of entropy in the environment.

But using methane gas to heat a mixture of slaked lime aad aodium carbonate in water you get NAOH in quantity.Na2CO3+ Ca(\"H)2=CaCO3+ 2NaOHThe raw materials are often cheaply available, and cast-off oil drums can be used for the reAction and for filtering off the NaOH solution from the solid calcium carbonate.Reactions like these asing simple equipment and local raw materials wore abandoned long ago in technically advanced countries like the U.S. because they req-4red too much labor and cannot be operated continuously.

Any significant destruction of theozone layer will therefore result in an increase in cancer-causing and plant-killing ultraviolet radiation at groundlevel.Ozone (03) is highly reactive and iE destroyed bythe (N20) and carbon (CC2) or CPC's for short). In sunlight thefreon breaks down to release chlorine which catalyzes thereaction 203 = 302. Since each chlorine atom acts as acatalyst and is therefore not used up it can go on wreakinghavoc in the ozone layer for as long as 70 to 100 years.Continuing destruction of ozone will result in an increaseinseriousskincancersand birthdefects,willkillplankton in the oceans, reduce the yield of many crops, andmay even destroy forests and alter climate. The effects will probably take years, perhaps decades, to be fullyapparent, and by then the damage will be irreversible.Nuclear exp\".1sions high in the atmosphere (no%banned by international treaty) can deplete the ozone ldyerin additional ways, and the widespread use of nitrogenfertilizers may also be having the same effect.There is no agreement even among experts on howmuch destruction of ozone results in how much increase inground-level ultraviolet light nor how destructive any givenincrease in ultraviolet light would be, so extensive studyof the problem is urgently in order.

Biodegradable and photodegradable plastic is made by ins,,,rting carbon monoxide molecules as weak links in the polymer chain, which is then easily broken by ultraviolet light or bacterial action.Most of the plastic trash now accumulatingworldwide is not degradable in this way; neither sun nor bacteria will get rid of it-- only time.

TO reduce this damage good running shoes depend on a good deal of physics.The foam midsole acts as a shock absorber, an action that depends on the work, Fd, which the foam padding must do to reduce to zero the kinetic inergy of your foot and body hitting the ground, mv4/2.

The principle of moments measures the effect of this.The sock liner absorbs sweat, reducing the blister-causing force of friction inside the shoes, cle,ted soles increase the friction with the track.The upper should be made of a fabric that allows the shoe to \"breathe\" (lehk air) to keep your foot cool by evaporation (loss of latent heat) and still repel water. No material available can do both these well at the same time.And the shoe must have the smallest possible mass, m, in order to keep F small (in F = ma), or you will wear yourself out merely accelerating a massive shoe back and forth.Allofthesefeaturescanstillstand improvement,given time,research,andimagination.

For example, a jet engine close up, rock concerts, and some stereo headsets at 135 decibels do it instantly. A big motorcycle with no muffler or an average chainsaw at 110 decibels takes 10 or 15 minuts. A jackhammer or a big power mower at 100 decibels will do it in one to two hours.At 90 decibels a convertible ride alonga busy freeway takes four hours-- and a screaming child takes eight.Alarm clocks and vacuum cleaners down around 75 decibels have no limit.Not surprisingly, by the age'of 40 most Americans have lost some hearing in the top two octaves of their hearing range.The Rocky Mountain News reported on Jan. 18, 1988 that when the Denver Broncos played Cleveland in the play- off game in Denver a sound level meter read a peak of112 decibels when the Broncos recovered a Cleveland fumble. For a news note on a $27,000 \"boomcar\" system that topped 150 decibels see Time Magazine, March 6, 1989, p. 52.Even when it isnot deafening, prolonged noiseexposurecausesstressandislinkedto headaches,ulcers,and high blood pressure.

Effective centralgovernment under such a condition would have be-n verydifficult if not impossible. The telegraph, activatedby storage batteries, may well have saved the nation!Certainly the fact that it took a sailingship six to eight weeks to carry messages across theAtlantic eastbound (and longer westbound) contributedto England's difficulty in ruling the American coloniesat the time of the Revolution.What d) you suppose were some of the effectsof the installation of the first transatlantic cable in1866?During the War of 1812 the Battle of NewOrleans was fought on January 8, 1815 Atalr the peacetreaty had been signed in Europe between the U.S. andGreat Britain (Dec. 24, 1814).

(see map)Canada has plans to build a dam across the basin insuch a way that water trapped at high tide must flowout through power-generating turbines to escape as thetide falls.It would be a rare example of pollution-free energy from a renewable fuel source-- the tides.But there's a catch! The North Atlantic Ocean tidehas a period of about 12 hours, 25 minutes. Thenatural period of water in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf ofMaine, if it were free to wash back and forth betweenMinas Basin and Cape Cod, is about 13 hours.

What do you and thepublic authorities do if there is a 90 percent chanceof the earthquake occurring sometime during the nextmonth?If you evacuate the town and nothing happensto it, what consequences do you anticipate? But ifyou fail to evacuate, and the earthquake occurs, is the \"break even\" point?In 1980,when Mt.St.Helens was becomihgactive the immediate area was evacuated, but normalsawmillandlumberingactivitiesinvolvingapproximately10,000peoplecontinuedatwhatwasconsidered to be a safe distance from the volcano. OnSunday, May 18 at 8:32 A.M. an explosive eruption blewoffthreecubic miles ofearth and created a 5.1earthquake on the Richter scale, ob1iterating a largefraction of the area of lumbering and sawmills. Manyof the work force would have been killed-- except thatit was a Sunday so they were not at work. A judgmentcall tnat \"lucked in\"1San Francisco has been built on top of anearthquake fault along which two underlying plates inthe earth's crust meet. As the plates move, the forcebetween them builds up, and an earthquake becomes moreand more likely-- and more severe when itfinallycomes.It has been suggested that if a small nticlearezplosion could be detonated deep within the earth theforce between the plates could be relieved, thus savingthecityanditspeoplefromafuturegreatcatascrophe.Would you aavocate doing this?

Payne in \"Does the Earth Rotate?\"(The PhysicsTeacher,Feb.1987,p.86). Rstation is responsible for the Coriolis force thatdeflects moving weather patterns and ocean currents into curved paths. Thus, \"were it not for the fact that the warm Gulf Stream northbound along our EastCoast unexpectedly veers off to the right and ends up bathing the British Isles with its heat those islanders would probably have been kept too busy staying warm to worry about exploring the world. England is at thesame latitude as 1,:-.brador and without the warmth of theGulf Stream would have been nearly uninhabitable in early times!\"\"One can show that the water on the right side ofthe Gulf Stream is about one meter higher than the water on the left side-- dramatic evidence for theCoriolis forceTM.Do you agree with M.M. Payne's argument? Can you cite another example or two of large climatic andcultural consequences of the action of the Coriolis force? 1Li -153- Weather forecasters incourt Are weather forecasters responsibleforafaulty forecast when death or injury result?When a defective wind-sensing anemometer onan ocean buoy off the coast of New England failed toprovide accurate data, and the National Weather Servicefailed to predict a sudden severe storm four Gloucesterlobstermen were swamped and drowned on Nov. 22, 1980.Relativesofthe dead fishermen sued the NationalWeather Service for negligence in having failed torepair the buoy for two and a half months after thebuoy had been hit by a ship.

Thusblockedfromradiatingits accumulating warmth into space,the earth's surface heats up.As a result of this \"greenhouse effect\" thesurface averages a comfortable 59\u00b0F.

If there is an abundance ofrabbits the foxes get lots to eate and they multiply.But with more hungry foxes out hunting, the rabbitsupply becomes depleted.

Thegovernment' backed him, believing the idea was not onlyconsistent with Marxist ideology but could be used tcincrease crop yields. The first result was the arrest andimprisonmentofmostof'thenation'stopgeneticists, followed by the complete destruction ofwhat we regard as serious work in genetics, and a blowto agricultural production from which the nation hasnot-yet fully recovered. Soviet genetics still lagswell behind the West, not only in agricultural geneticsbutinthemorerecentdevelopmentsingenetic engineoring.More recently in the Soviet Union, until therecent\"openness\"policyintroducedbyGorbachov,computer education and the use of computers has beenseverely limited or non-existent. Oneimportantreason has been fear of the public gaining access toinformation of all sorts. Even copying machines wereunder lock and key; the production of video recorderswas halted, and direct telephoning abroad came to anend soon after the 1980 Moscow Olympics. For yearsMoscow was forbidden to have telephone directories onthe grcund that it would provide too much informationfor those who shouldn't have it.

There are enormous numbers of workers in the autoinaustry itself.2. Numerous industries serve as suppliers to the autoindustry such as steel manufacturers , makersoftires, plastics, electronics, and, of course, the oil industry.3. In addition to supplying the industry there are manybusinesses and industries that depend on theautomobile such as garages, service stations,parking lots, car washes, auto races, toll boothoperators, meter maids, highway construction andmaintenance firms, roadside stands, motels, junkyards, driving schools, drive-in movies, truckingand farming.4. Taxes on autos and gasoline are important sources ofrevenue for local, state, and federal governments.5. Auto loans are important in the tanking business.6. Automobile advertising is important in theadvertising business.7. It is estimated that as much as 25% of t:le lifetimeearnings of a worker and his family go to the costandupkeep of his automobiles.8. The huge industrial capacity of its automobilemanufacturing plants served the U.S. in good steadin World War II. Automobiles, jeeps, tanks,trucks, etc. are essential to the modern army.XAMirallaftUta1 _ILLIgt11. A great deal of land has been paved over for parkinglots, garages, etc., and an area exceeding thatof Conn., Del., Mass., N.H., Rhode Island,and Vermont has now been paved over for motortraffic.It is estimated that 213 of the LosAngeles downtown area is given over to theautomobile.2 -169-2. Ugly billboar& and road signs constitute visualpollution of the highways.3. Tankers which carry oil are a threat to the ocean'secosystem.4. Junking of cars wastes valuable resources, yet theentire industry is predicated on planneiobsolescence.5.

Mho automobile is the most important source of airpollution in many areas of the country.7. Automobiles are an important source of noisepollution.=gists on health1. Automobiles are a major cause of death and injury.Deaths total about 45,000 a year and seriousinjuries about four million.2. Lack of exercise and overuse of the automobile tendto keep many Americans in poor physical condition.3. A health plus for the automobile is the manyemergency vehicles that save lives-- ambulances,fire trucks, police cars.political effects1.

The mobility given by the automobile has influencedleisure-t;7:a patterns of Americans. The autoalso makes possible short vacations such asweekends, ski trips, etc. as well as extendedtravel.2. The automobile allows people to live and work in widely separated places. Thus the auto is animportant cause of the rise of the suburbs and, atthe same time, a cause of the decline of the innercity.3. The autozobile has greatly affected the sexual mores of American society.4. The automobile has enormous importance as a statussymbol and a source of prestige in the community.5. The emphasis on the car as a source of prestigeleads many peo.71e to get into debt beyond theirmeans.6. The automobile makes possible attendance at cultural andsports events, museums, libraries, etc.7. The private auto has strangled publictransportation. Railroads used to provide cheap and efficient pasaenger service; now many statnshave no passenger trains at all.8. School and family join in making it easy for teenagers todrive.Three out of every fourAmericans of age are licensed drivers.9.

Hence it'simportant that our industries use it in manufacturingfor export and competition in the world marketplace.General Motors is almost entirely metric.Disadvantages:The public resists strongly, and some peoplehave even organized to fight what they seeasatroublesome, even impractical, move. For example,deeds, plats, and blueprints on record for hundreds ofyears back are all in inches and feet. Consumeradvocates warn that a changeover to metric packaging inthe marketplace will provide a smokescreen to hidesteep price increases.In September 1982, after six years of effc,the federal government gave up exhorting the couatyand abolished the U.S. Metric Board.
