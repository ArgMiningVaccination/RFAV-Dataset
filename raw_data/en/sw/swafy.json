CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety and teaching people healthy coping skills for managing negative emotions.2 Antidepressants are the most common medications used to treat anxiety. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be prescribed. Benzodiazepines are also sometimes prescribed for acute anxiety on a short-term basis, however, Hims does not prescribe these types of medications. Additionally, alternative approaches like hypnosis, biofeedback, acupuncture, and homeopathy may also be recommended, but research is less clear on the effectiveness of these approaches.3 Depression Depression is a mood disorder that involves sadness, or apathy, that persists for several weeks.

For example, some therapists may assign homework or other activities to supplement your therapy. When you view your therapist's profile, you can get an idea of how they work and their treatment approach. Unfortunately, therapist profiles on Hims do not provide a significant amount of information about the therapist, especially when compared to other mental health platforms or online directories. Hims Mental Health also offers a progress tracker and online videos on topics like \"relief from depression\" and \"ease for anxiety.\" Accessing some of these features can be tricky though since some are only available on the app. I found myself having to go between the website and app to use different features, which could be inconvenient at times.

Hims Mental Health vs Competitors There are many online mental health treatment platforms available in addition to Hims Mental Health, including Brightside Health and Talkspace. Compared to competitors, Hims is unique in offering medication management without an appointment. It is also more affordable than many other platforms. However, some competitors are able to serve a larger pool of customers and accept health insurance. The platform that is best for you will depend on factors like your age, mental health condition(s), finances, and personal preferences. Hims Mental Health vs Brightside Brightside Health is an online mental health treatment platform that offers therapy and medication to people experiencing depression. Both platforms serve adults across the United States, are similar in cost, and match you with a provider. Medication with Brightside Health is $95 a month plus an additional $15 to have your medication delivered to you. Therapy costs $299 monthly and includes four online video sessions, but you can purchase additional therapy sessions for $59 each. You can also select a combination plan for $349 a month which includes the benefits of both the medication and therapy plans. Unlike Hims, Brightside Health is in-network with some health insurance companies, including Aetna and Cigna, and can provide a superbill for out-of-network reimbursement. One difference between the two platforms is the length of therapy sessions. With Brightside Health, your first therapy session is 45 minutes long and subsequent sessions are 30 minutes long. Therapy sessions with Hims are 50 minutes long. People seeking longer therapy may therefore prefer Hims over Brightside Health. Another difference between Brightside Health and Hims is that Brightside Health offers traditional psychiatry appointments. When you sign up for their monthly medication plan, you will meet with your provider over live video for your initial evaluation and subsequent appointments. Hims, on the other hand, does not require any appointments to get prescribed medication. To learn more about subscription options with their platform, you can read our detailed review of [Brightside Health](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/brightside-health-review/). Hims Mental Health vs Talkspace Talkspace also offers online mental health care, including medication and therapy. However, Talkspace differs from Hims in several ways. First, Talkspace serves Canada as well as the United States and treats a larger range of mental health conditions. Like Brightside Health, Talkspace has you attend an initial evaluation to get prescribed medication and follow-up appointments for refills. These appointments are held over live video. The cost of psychiatry with Talkspace is more than Hims and is billed per appointment, rather than as a monthly charge. An initial psychiatric evaluation with Talkspace costs $249 and follow-up appointments are $125. Some insurance plans are accepted. There are also notable differences between Hims and Talkspace's therapy plans. With Talkspace, teens ages 13 and older can participate in therapy with a parent or guardian's consent. Talkspace also offers three monthly subscription plans for therapy. The messaging plan costs $69 per week and allows you to communicate with your therapist through text, video, or audio messages in a secure chatroom. The live therapy plan costs $99 per week and gives you four 45-minute therapy sessions each month. The messaging and live therapy plan costs $129 per week and combines the features of both plans together. The cost of Talkspace's subscription plans may vary depending on location and therapist availability and are charged monthly. Hims, on the other hand, only provides therapy to adults and does not offer any messaging plans. You can message your therapist if you have a scheduling question, but you cannot use messaging as a form of therapy. To learn all about their subscriptions, you can read our comprehensive [review of Talkspace](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/talkspace-review/). How Hims Mental Health Has Evolved [Hims](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/recommends/hims-reviews/) is a part of Hims & Hers Inc., which was founded in 2017 by Andrew Dudum to provide high-quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare. Initially, the company started out selling erectile dysfunction and hair loss treatments to men. In 2018 they expanded to offer products for women, including birth control pills. In 2020, Hims & Hers Inc. began offering mental health treatment. Currently, the company offers a range of healthcare products and services to customers throughout the United States. We attempted to reach out to the company to learn about any future plans to expand but did not receive a response. The company has faced criticism for its approach to prescribing medications. Some have claimed that having customers get prescribed medication based on the results of a brief assessment is poor clinical care. Since you never actually attend an appointment with a prescriber, some believe that the limited contact via messaging is not enough to prescribe medication and ensure that a patient is taking it safely. After your provider reviews your assessment, they send you a lengthy message back explaining what medication they are prescribing, potential side effects, and what to do if you experience side effects or a crisis. You can also message your provider with any questions or concerns that you have. While this may seem to check off all the boxes on what a prescriber would need to advise a patient, I can't help but agree that this approach is not right for most people seeking mental health medication. Having the opportunity to meet with a provider, ask questions, and talk about what you are experiencing is more helpful, in my opinion. Frequently Asked Questions About Hims Mental Health Can I use my HSA or FSA Card? You may be able to use your flexible spending or [health savings accounts for therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/hsa-therapy-mental-health/) and medication, but it depends on whether Hims Mental Health meets the requirements of your FSA or HSA accounts. It is recommended that you speak with your accountant or tax professional first. How Can I Cancel My Account with Hims Mental Health?

Final Verdict on Hims Mental Health Hims Mental Health offers medications for anxiety and depression, as well as therapy and wellness supplements for people 18-years and older. It earned 3 stars overall during our independent review and it is ideal for people who want access to fast and convenient care. With Hims, you can be prescribed medication without ever seeing a psychiatrist face-to-face, which is great for those who have been on medication in the past and know what works for them. However, if you have never been prescribed medication or have not found the right one, Hims is not right for you. Instead, you should seek out a provider that can meet with you face-to-face and provide a more in-depth evaluation. With that being said, Hims may be worth a try if you are looking for affordable online therapy. If you are seeking medication, I would strongly urge you to consider the pros and cons of getting prescribed medication without an appointment, especially if it is your first-time seeking medication.
