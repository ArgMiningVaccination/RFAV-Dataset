Whooping cough, aka pertussis, is a contagious illness caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacte-rium. Once a common childhood illness in the US, it earned its popular name from the charac-teristic whooping sound of the cough associated with the disease. /T_h e pertussis bacterium is eas-ily spread by contact with an infected child or adult in the /f_i rst two to three weeks of infection, usually before the illness has been accurately diagnosed. /T_h e incubation period is commonly /seven.oldstyle to /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle days, with a range of /four.oldstyle to /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle days. Like many illnesses, pertussis begins with a cold-like stage in which the su erer is most con-tagious, with the familiar symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, and mild cough. Within one to two weeks the cough worsens, developing into attacks or spells or /f_i ts: a rapid series of coughs followed by a long inhalation with the characteristic crowing sound or high-pitched whoop. Choking, gagging, or vomiting while coughing can be triggered by the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs. In more severe cases, a child can turn blue in the face (aka cyanosis). Although a child may be exhausted immedi-ately following a coughing spell, he or she o/f_t en appears and acts normal between spells.Straight talk on the -day cough| by Lauren Feder, MD What are the symptoms of pertussis?

By the 1970s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported, the incidence of whooping cough had decreased by 99 per - cent since the inception of the whole-cell DTP vaccine.2 In the holistic medical community, it is generally felt that individual cases and symptoms of pertussis are less severe now than in the past, due to improvements in sanitation, nutrition, and education and because of more sophisticated medical treatments for complica - tions. In the US, pertussis epidemics happen every three to five years; approximately 17,000 cases were reported in 2009. 3 According to the CDC , pertussis is \"one of the most common vaccine-preventable childhood diseases\" in the US.4 From 1999 to 2004, 91 infant deaths in the US were attributed to pertussis.5 However, since the 1980s, the number of reported cases of pertussis has increased.6 That whooping cough is becoming more common in adolescents and adults than it was in the past 7, 8 may be due to improved abilities to recognize, diagnose, and report cases of pertussis. 9 In gen - eral, pertussis cases are vastly underreported.10 Increases in whooping cough among adoles - cents and adults since the 1980s are most likely attributable to their immunity waning in the years following their vaccination. 11 Outbreaks of whooping cough are also caused If you suspect that your child has whooping cough, see your pediatrician . Because pertussis is contagious , avoid contact with others.Adolescents and adults who had the infection in childhood might get milder forms of whooping cough that can go undetected, or be diagnosed as bronchitis or a simple cough.

The symptoms of B. parapertussis are usually milder than those of B. pertussis; because of this, both infections remain underestimated. In general, infection by B. pertussis and/or B. parapertussis in the immu-nized population is common, and B. parapertussis is more prevalent than was previously known. 12 The Vaccines The original pertussis vaccine was the whole- cell diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis ( DTP) vaccine. However, the severe complications of the whole-cell DTP vaccine led to the development of the acellular pertussis (a P) version of this vaccine (DTaP). In fact, the publicity surrounding the complications of the original pertussis vaccine is, to a large extent, responsible for the public's current awareness of vaccine injuries in general. The DTaP vaccine grants immunity for 5 to 10 years.13 However, according to a study that compared the success rates of the two vaccines, the incidence of pertussis was lower in children who were given a combination of DTP and DTaP than in children who received only DTaP. This suggests that the rate of failure to immunize is higher in the DTaP vaccine.14 According to the CDC , while the rate of pertussis immunization in the US has remained high,15 whooping cough continues to reemerge. One theory for this is that the strains of the B. pertussis bacterium have evolved since introduction of the vaccines, much as other bacteria have evolved to become more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. 16 Despite widespread programs of vaccination, epidemics of pertussis continue to occur every three to five years. While the reason or reasons for this remain unclear, what is known is that immunity from vaccines wanes over time, which can result in increased incidence among ado - lescents and adults. 17 In addition, many children and adults are carriers of pertussis while showing no symptoms of the disease.Thus far, the worst case of pertussis I've seen was in an eight-month-old girl who was hospital-ized for a few days despite having had two DTaP shots. Following the hospitalization, the patient and her family came to my office for homeopathic treatment to expedite her healing. Now she is fine. Vaccine reac Tions Nowadays, the pertussis vaccine is given to chil - dren as part of the DTaP series. The five doses of this series are given at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. The pertussis vaccine is given only to children younger than seven years because it can cause severe reactions in older children. The complications of the pertussis vaccines are well documented and include local swelling at the injection site, fever, high-pitched scream - ing, convulsions, mental retardation, and death. Although reactions to the acellular form of the vaccine are milder than to the whole-cell vac - cine, severe reactions to the DTaP vaccine have occurred, including encephalitis and death. Although the B. pertussis bacterium can cause ear infections, dehydration, convulsions, and, in rare instances, even brain damage or death, one of the complications most commonly associated with whooping cough is pneumonia. Pertus-sis poses the greatest risk to infants and small children; their air passages, which are much nar - rower than those of older children and adults, can be more quickly blocked by mucus. On rare occasions, DTaP can cause serious complications. These include: fever higher than 105\u00b0 F (1 child out of 16,000)18 nonstop crying (1 child out of 1,000)19 seizure (1 child out of 14,000)20 serious allergic reaction (fewer than 1 in a million)21 The pertussis vaccine should not be given to children who have a history of convulsions, brain In the US, pertussis epidemics happen every three to five years; approximately 17,000 cases were reported in 2009. Pertussis poses the greatest risk to infants and small children; their air passages, which are much narrower than those of older children and adults, can be more quickly blocked by mucus.

Home t reatment vitamin and herbal remedy In an attempt to use a more natural preventive approach, I prefer a different course of action. With any vaccination, I recommend administering the following vitamin and herbal remedy seven days before and after the shot, to generally strengthen the body. They may also help reduce any side effects of the vaccine. Remember, your child should not receive a vaccina - tion if she is cranky or ill. At our office, we prefer that, when possible, people take only one vaccine at a time. Contact your practitioner if unusual symptoms occur following the shot. You can use this protocol in conjunc - tion with any other medications you give your child. Each day, for seven days before and after the shot, give your child the following: Briar r ose This gemmotherapy herb is a general immune strengthener. vitamin C Less than two years old, 100 milligrams, twice daily; two years and older, 250 mg twice daily.

Trea Tmen T for whooping cough If you suspect that your child has whooping cough, see your pediatrician. A case of whooping cough usually lasts about six weeks. Because per - tussis is contagious, avoid contact with others. The standard treatment includes the general support of rest and liquids. Y our doctor will prob-ably prescribe erythromycin or azithromycin, as it is felt that such antibiotics render a child less contagious. While it is still in question whether an antibiotic changes the course of the illness, people with whooping cough are generally considered no longer contagious after the fifth day on antibiot-ics. Holistic medicine and homeopathy may shorten the course and severity of the illness. But again: If you suspect that you or your child has whoop - ing cough, see your healthcare provider . noT eS 1.

From 1999 to 2004, 91 infant deaths in the US were attributed to pertussis . Dr. Jay gorDon , noted attachment-parenting-oriented pediatrician and author, com-ments on the pertussis vaccine in his online column \"Behind the Scenes with Dr. Jay\" .com Reports of whooping-cough outbreaks in California1, 2 and other states this summer are nothing new. Every four to five years, no matter how high the rate of vaccination, there are reports of increases in whooping cough. Whooping cough is a respiratory disease. Toxins in the Bordetella pertussis bacteria stimulate the produc-tion of large amounts of thick, sticky mucus that can clog the airways of tiny babies and children, making it difficult for them to take a breath without vomiting, choking, and sometimes making a whooping sound 3 as they struggle to breathe. An acellular pertussis vaccine, DTaP, was licensed for American babies in 1996.4 DTaP replaced an older, very reactive whole-cell pertussis vaccine in DTP that was associated in the medical literature with frequent reports of high fever, collapse/shock (aka hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, or HHE), convul- sions, brain inflammation, and permanent brain damage. 5, 6 It is well known that pertussis vaccines used in the US, which can contain various amounts of bioactive toxins7-11 as well as additives of aluminum12-14 and, until 1999, mercury,15 have injured the brains of some children and killed others. More than half of the 2,480 awards for vaccine injuries and deaths made under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which totaled $2 billion, involved pertussis vaccines. 16, 17 The rates of vaccination for pertussis are very high in the US. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), 84.6 percent of chil- dren between 19 and 35 months of age born during January 2005 and June 2007 had received four DTaP shots.18 By the time American children enter kinder - garten, the vast majority of them have gotten all of the CDC -recommended pertussis shots.19 In 2009, the CDC said that the proportion of US children who have received no vaccinations of any kind is only six hundredths of 1 percent (0.06%). 20 But even with this universal coverage by the pertussis vaccine in the US, and in other countries such as the Netherlands, Australia, Finland, and Canada, whooping-cough disease still has been present in these highly vac-cinated populations. 21 There are two main reasons for this. First, pertussis vaccines, widely used since the 1950s, have not prevented whooping cough from cir-culating in vaccinated populations. Unknown numbers of children and adults who have received all of the government-recommended pertussis shots can and do develop whooping cough, or are asymptomatic carriers of Bordetella pertussis. 22, 23 Because the immu- nity granted by the pertussis vaccine is only tempo-rary, health officials now tell teenagers and adults to get more booster shots. 24 But that will not matter if the scientific research indicating that the B. pertussis organ-ism has mutated and become resistant to vaccines turns out to be correct. 25 A second important reason is that whooping cough can be caused by other Bordetella organisms, including Bordetella parapertussis. 26 The symptoms of B. paraper - tussis, while often milder, can look exactly the same as those indicating B. pertussis infection. But doctors rarely recognize or test for B. parapertussis\u2014and there is no vaccine for this bacteria. The DTaP vaccine, normally given five times to children under age six, and in booster doses to teenagers and adults, does not protect against whooping cough caused by B. parapertussis. Studies conducted in highly vaccinated countries suggest that perhaps 30 percent or more of whooping-cough disease is now caused by B. parapertussis. 27, 28 So which Bordetella organism was associated with whooping-cough cases seen in California during the summer of 2010: pertussis or parapertussis? How many of the suspected cases of whooping cough were con-firmed as B. pertussis by health officials using expensive PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab tests?29Why the DTaP shot may not protect you or your community from whooping cough.The problem with pertussis vaccines| by Barbara Loe FisherUnknown numbers of children and adults who have received all of the govern ment-recommended pertussis shots can and do develop whooping cough. The truth is that, whether or not you've been vaccinated , you can get a mild or serious case of whooping cough . Above: The author speaks at NVIC 's Fourth International Public Conference on Vaccination in October 2009. whooping coughFINAL.indd 43 12/3/10 8:05:54 PMmothering | January-February 2011 44Another question: Are public-health officials be- ing transparent with the public about precisely how many children and adults reported to have whooping cough have been fully vaccinated? In 1985, when there was a great deal of publicity about whooping-cough outbreaks in eight states, much of the blame for these outbreaks was put on parents of children injured by the DTP vaccine, who were publicly calling for a safer pertussis vaccine. The allegation was that the bad publicity about the risks of DTP vaccination had caused many parents to avoid getting their children vaccinated. But 25 years ago, when I investigated those outbreaks, I found that 50 to 80 percent, or more, of the children and adults with symptoms of whooping cough had received one or more DTP shots.30 Bordetella organisms can live in pigs, cats, and dogs, as well as humans, and have been part of the earth's ecosystem for thousands of years, 31, 32 but the mass administration to humans of pertussis vaccines has been going on for only 60 years. So why are the unvaccinated being blamed for outbreaks of whooping cough in California, 33 Oregon,34 and other states? After all, most Americans alive today have received three to five pertussis shots. The truth is that, whether or not you've been vaccinated, you can get a mild or a serious case of whooping cough from the B. pertussis or B. parapertussis organisms. And both whooping cough and the pertussis vaccines carry a risk of injury or death, which can be greater for some people than for others. There are no guarantees. It is time for public-health officials and doctors to look at themselves, and to stop pointing fingers at those who have examined the benefits and risks of pertussis vaccine and come to different conclusions.
