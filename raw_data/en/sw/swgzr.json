SMITH, II* ABSTRACT Holistic Medicine traces its provenance to the foundational value or chrism of the Society of Jesus of cura personalis which directs respect be given to all individuals and to their souls \u2014 especially whenever medical healing is required. Today, the notion of best patient care should include not merely attention to somatic issues of refractory pain management but, equally, to non-somatic or existential su ffering. It is at the end-stage of life that palliative \u2014 as opposed to curative \u2014 care must be provided. When a condition is seen as medically futile, this Article advocates palliative or deep sedation \u2014 when consistent with patient values \u2014 should be accepted more fully as efficacious and humane end-of-life medical care. Roman Catholic moral theology suppo rts the ideal that extraordinary medical measures need not be provided in order to preserve life at its end- stage. The International Association of Catholic Bioethicists acknowledged in 2011 that holistic interventions \u2014 wh en appropriate and consistent with best patient care \u2014 should seek to address existential or spiritual suffering by sedation. * Professor of Law, The Catho lic University of America.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW Before history was ever recorded, healers have served society.1 Indeed, in Western society, the provenance of healing may be traced to classical Hellenic Greece.2 Other cultures have a similar history which derives from traditions which hold to the notion of \"selfless service to those in need.\"3 From these historical glosses, it may be surmised \"that whole patient care was being dispensed long before the term was coined.\"4 Professionalism, as a concept and in association \u2014 specifically \u2014 with medicine, has thought to have been first used by Scribonius, a Roman physician, circa 47 A.D. to mean \"a commitment to compassion or clemency in the relief of suffering,\" 5 which in turn was seen as the essence of caring for the whole person.6 With the founding of the Society of Jesus by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1541, cura personalis has been recognized as a foundational value or chrism of Jesuit education.7 An integral part of this value is particular acknowledgment that \"attention and respect [must be] given to the care of an individual person and that person's soul.\"8 Over time, the roles of curing and of healing began to be defined more distinctly between that of the physician and the patient \u2014 for, it is the physician's knowledge and expertise which gives him more decisive power in curing.9 In the healer function, however, it is the patient who becomes the center of power \u2014 since, the healing occurs within the patient who makes \"the healing journey.\"10 Today, it is said that there is a therapeutic alliance 1.

For this type of palliation to be efficacious, healthcare decision makers must regularly reassess patient treatment goals in order to not only learn how their pat ients define and experience pain, but the patients' thresholds for tolerating various sources of distress. 26 These thresholds are seen as being informed by a patient's personality, which has, 19.

Managing End-Stage Illness \"Managing\" death at the end-stage of life when a futile medical condition exists, presents linguistic, moral, and philosophical ambiguities regarding the voluntary cessation of nutrition, hydration, palliative or terminal sedation, physician-assisted suicide, and voluntary euthanasia. 28 Although these actions are distinct , there is a central and unifying commonality among them \u2014 specifically, their common purpose of hastening a humane death, thereby showing compassion to those experiencing refractory pain and existential suffering. 29 The purpose of this Article is to argue, and to advance the notion, that existential suffering is as valid a consideration as physical pain is at the end- stage of life. Because of this relationship, greater attention must be given by medicine to palliating the whole person and to accepting the validity of palliative sedation. As efficacious and compassionate treatment when appropriate, 30 laws should \u2014 similarly \u2014 accommodate the necessity for this procedure as its use becomes warranted under a theory of adjusted care. 31 Further, the law should validate palliative sedation as humane end- of-life medical treatment and should not complicate, and thereby hinder, what are sound medical responses \u2014 consistent with patient values \u2014 to alleviating conditions deemed medically futile. 32 Legislation allowing for death with dignity as enacted in Oregon,33 Washington,34 and Vermont35 is 27.

BEST PATIENT CARE The President's Council on Bioethics concluded in 2005 that the basic standard for clinical decision-making should be one which promotes the best patient care.38 This standard obviously must be continually adjusted as a patient's case history progresses,39 and to promote patient care anchored in mercy, compassion, beneficence, and loving charity \u2014 care which recognizes that relief of pain is the most universal moral obligation that a physician must uphold and that ther e is, indeed, a right not to suffer.40 Psychological distress, or existential pai n, however, is usually difficult to assess because evaluation requires special training and continual contact with the patients' families.41 There is a general societal aversion to the obstacles faced in proving a patient's emotional distress at end-of-life care.42 Distinguishing between depression and psychological morbidity is difficult because the symptomology of disrupted sleeping patterns, loss of energy, and lack of appetite are not exclusive response mechanisms to psychological distress, but appear in ca ncer and other terminal illnesses as 35.

Best patient care is adjusted to the developing medical needs of the patient. Essential to the standard of best care is acceptance of the \"intrinsic dignity of persons\" which, in turn, mandates that the goal of providing care must be to enhance total patient well being (somatic and non-somatic) and, at the end of life demonstrate beneficence, compassion, or charity in managing pain and suffering. 39.

Valid existential concerns are often obscured during palliative care treatment. 45 Even though a patient may have no absolute control over the wide and varied spectra of suffering, the patient still has freedom to choose what attitude is taken toward that suffering. 46 By extending end-of-life care to include psychiatric, psychological, existential, and spiritual issues \u2014 consistent with the WHO's definition of palliative care and its goal of addressing total patient needs 47 \u2014 a more complete, compassionate, and realistic approach to managing terminal illness and end-stage suffering would be implemented.48 III. ASSESSING PAIN While pain is properly seen as biological and measurable, it is \u2014 inherently \u2014 subjective, individual, and variable.49 Consequently, there is no clear understanding whether mental suffering and mental pain are, indeed, \"equivalent or identical concepts and experiences.\"50 Interestingly, some research has even suggested that the same brain regions involved in assessing physician pain are also found in a number of forms of actual emotional distress.51 The central issue confrontin g law is how to deal with the \"externally verifiable reality\" of pain.52 What level of exculpation should be granted by the state to those attending to the anguish and suffering of those at the end-stage of life.53 Can pain and suffering in death be likened 43.

Today, existential pain is seen, commonly, as an important clinical factor either reinforcing existing pain or, serving as the root cause of it. 56 A. Existential Suffering The desire to hasten death arises because of a number of conditions: inadequate pain management, psycholo gical conditions ranging from depression and hopelessness, to fears of loss of autonomy and physical functioning,57 to futile and unbearable suffering, and avoidance of humiliation.58 All of these conditions conduce to one overriding fear: loss of human dignity,59 which brings with it a fear of being forced to become but a \"passive bystander\" to all of the normal functions of life.60 B. Death Anxiety Coping with death anxiety or, in other words, the \"untarnished awareness of death,\" often brings into play psychological mechanisms such as denial-based strategies of suppr ession, repression, and new emphases on religious beliefs which \"detoxify\" death itself.61 Existential terror is, then, sought to be managed spiritually by em bracing the notion that life is, truly 54.

Merely accepting suffering as auth entic, however, does not mean that it is also meaningful.71 It remains for the physician to ascertain and then listen carefully to the spiritual parameters within each patient's character72 in an attempt to treat those seriously ill as whole persons.73 In this way, the therapy is truly patient-centered.74 Refractory existential suffering \u2014 or those symptoms which defy adequate control despite all efforts to provide relief \u2014 is difficult to distinguish during the end-stages of life from physical distress. 75 Those additional refractory symptoms most commonly reported as requiring palliative sedation are: various degrees of agitation, restlessness or distress, confusion, respiratory distress, pain, and myoclonus (e.g., severe twitching, jerking or uncontrollable shakes).76 Existential care is more often th an not left to the nursing staff.77 Even in the daily hospital bed environment, ho wever, the nursing staff must possess a special level of sensitivity to understand patients' indirect questions regarding the depth and severity of their distress over their terminal illness. Once understood, it typically falls upon the nurses to devise a procedure for providing empathetic support. 78 Palliative sedation therapy is thus defined as \"the use of sedative medications to relie ve intolerable and refractory distress by the reduction in patient consciousness.\"79 When patient suffering \u2014 physical or existential \u2014 become refractory to standard palliative therapies, the humane, compassionate, and merciful response is to offer palliative or 70.

Demoralization It has been suggested that \u2014 in the clinical setting of hospice or palliative care \u2014 a unique diagnostic category, termed the \"demoralization syndrome,\" is becoming more recognizable and should be refined and classified as a cognitive disorder. 82 Seen as a \"useful category of existential distress in which meaningless predominates and . . . profound hopelessness and [a] desire to die may result,\"83 this syndrome, if not treated satisfactorily with pharmacological therapy, should render such a demoralized patient incompetent to make medical decisions.84 Yet, interestingly, there is no conclu sive empirical evidence to support an all too popular conclusion that depr ession so impairs judgment as to prevent one from competently disapprovin g of the initiation or cessation of medical treatment.85 Sadly, this depression argument would appear to be a ruse to obstruct and even prevent end-of-life decision-making on the grounds of moral repugnancy to al ternative or surrogate healthcare providers.86 If \u2014 and when \u2014 the demoralization syndrome is accepted by diagnosticians as a cognitive disorder, it would then remain for physicians to respond with compassion and care in re mediating this medical condition. If deemed proper, under the overarching principle of medical futility, physicians should consider the reasonableness of alleviating this pathological mental state in the end-st age patient by administering palliative or terminal sedation. Such a course of treatment would be consistent with the central obligations of all physicia ns to alleviate pain and suffering \u2014 80.

Early Terminal Sedation As contentious as palliative or terminal sedation is, early terminal sedation (ETS) is even more inflammatory for some \u2014 but for others, it is seen as a progressive and humane treatment.88 Under this procedure, a patient \u2014 with consent \u2014 is sedated before \"actively dying.\"89 As such, the process combines palliative sedation with a cessation of nutrition and hydration.90 The distinction between ETS and palliative sedation is that in the former, patients are capable of receiving alimentation and hydration orally or parenterally but exercise their right to refuse this treatment. In causing palliative or terminal sedation, however, sedation is administered to those for whom nutrition and hydration are no longer life-sustaining. 91 Often analogized \u2014 incorrectly to assisted suicide \u2014 ETS should be viewed as but \"translating\" the choice of a patient to refuse nutrition and hydration by the patient with deep, continuous sedation.92 Given prognostic uncertainties on the progression of certain chronic diseases \u2014 and the desire of some patients to exercise their right of autonomy by managing their end-stage care, it has been predicted that ETS will rise 93 \u2014 especially so, as dementia case s rise within the population and patients wish to act before their cognitive powers are lost.94 Presently in America, there are more than five million Americans who have Alzheimer's disease \u2014 and this figure could be tripled by 2050.95 Indeed, someone is diagnosed with this diseas e every sixty-eight seconds.96 87.

ROMAN CATHOLIC PERSPECTIVES : HOLISTIC MEDICINE COMPATIBILITIES Catholic moral theology has never a ccepted the notion that \"human life must be sustained at virtually all costs.\"97 Even though the sanctity and sacredness of all life is a given, the Catholic tradition acknowledges \"the ethical import of at least some degree of quality of life,\" and further accepts \"at some point, a lack of quality means that life can be let go.\"98 This compassionate approach to a theology of human life in healthcare ethics is given focus and application in the dist inction drawn between ordinary and extraordinary ends taken to preserve life.99 Taking its foundational roots from positions taken by His Holiness Pope Pius XII in the 1940's and 1950's, the Cath olic position is that \"it is never obligatory to make use of medical measures that are morally extraordinary in order to preserve life.\"100 Indeed, the 1994 Catechism of The Catholic Church states unequivocally that, \"[i]f morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does not make it an absolute value.\"101 Withdrawing or withholding medical treatments are not acts of killing; for, they merely \"allow a patient to die of the underlying condition.\"102 While these courses of action may not be \"always morally righ t,\" the act of allowing one to die is morally valid \"when it is the foregoing of morally extra treatment.\"103 97.

Society needs \"to collaborate in providing and promoting the best possible holistic care of persons who are seriously ill or dying . . . so that their physical, psychological, existential, social, and spiritual needs can be appropriately addressed.\"114 2. The same standards of \"good therapeutic practice that inform other areas of health care\" should guide any and all treatment decisions for the seriously ill and the dying.115 3. A relationship between healthcare providers and those seriously ill or dying patients whom they are treating grounded in trust and benevolence promotes competent and ethical care.116 4. Existential or \"Spiritual\" Suffering should be acknowledged and addressed accordingly by utilizing those \"holistic interventions\" deemed appropriate to the individual case. 117 \"Mild to moderate levels of sedation might . . . be appropriate in some instances when existential [suffering] is refractory.\"118 What is seen by this statement is th e medical, ethical, philosophical, and spiritual acknowledgement that these fo ur disciplines are symbiotic if not complementary and not antagonistic in both their quest and their application to addressing (and thereby managing) the somatic and nonsomatic, or existential pain and su ffering of individuals holistically.
