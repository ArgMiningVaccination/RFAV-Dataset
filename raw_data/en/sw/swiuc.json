Auriculotherapy refers to acupressure or acupuncture applied to the ear. In our practice, we use auriculotherapy to treat a wide variety of health conditions- literally, anything from head to toe (and all systems in between) can be addressed! The ear is a complete microsystem. On the external ear, there are acupuncture points that correspond to every part of the body, making it a self-contained system of treatment within the whole body. While originally based on the ancient practices of Chinese Medicine, the correspondences of specific parts of the body to specific parts of the ear was first developed in modern France. This integrated system of Chinese and Western practices of auriculotherapy brings us to its modern day application in practice. HISTORY The classic texts of Chinese Medicine refers to the role of the ear as a tool for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of disease. The oldest Chinese medical text, the Neijing (\"The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine\" 500-300 BC) establishes a connection between the ear and the organs via the acupuncture meridian system. Despite this early mention, it wasn't until the 1950's that a system of auricular medicine was formalized, based on extensive research by French doctor, Paul Nogier. Nogier was intrigued by a strange scar which certain patients had in the external ear. He learned that the scar was due to a treatment for sciatica involving cauterization of this outer ear area by a lay practitioner living in France. The patients claimed to be successfully relieved of sciatic pain quickly after the cauterization. Nogier's book, \"Treatise of Auriculotherapy\", established links between sensitive points on the ear and internal organs. His view was that the points on the ear were organized very similarly to an inverted fetus as it would be resting in the womb: head towards the lobe, feet towards upper rim of ear, and body in the middle. The research was brought back to China, where additional ear points were discovered. European schools began linking the nervous system as the major explanation for how ear acupuncture works. Today, over 100 points in the ear relate to almost every organ, hormone, and system in the human body. HOW IT WORKS From a Western medical viewpoint, the nervous innervations of the ear are the leading explanation of how and why ear acupuncture works. The nerves that innervate the ear connect with our internal organs and all parts of the body. Applying pressure to the external ear stimulates these nerves, which travel to the central nervous system, stimulating neurotransmitters that alleviate pain. The ear is also richly supplied with blood vessels. Auriculotherapy improves peripheral blood flow, circulating more oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. And just like in full body acupuncture treatments, endorphins and enkephalins (our natural painkillers/ \"feel good\" hormones) are elevated after auricular treatments! In Chinese Medicine, your health depends on the flow of qi and blood in your body. This energy travels along invisible pathways, known as meridians. Meridian pathways travel all over the body, including to the ears. Stimulating ear points communicates with the meridians to help clear up any qi blockages. Resolving these blockages can help improve and prevent a variety of health conditions. IN TREATMENT Auriculotherapy is a widely accessible therapy used today by many types of health care practitioners, including acupuncturists, physicians, naturopaths, chiropractors, and therapists. Auriculotherapy can be used successfully on its own or in combination with full-body acupuncture to enhance treatment results. Ear acupuncture and ear seeds stimulate the body to heal itself and help people feel calm, relaxed, more in their bodies, and less pain. Since pretty much the whole body is represented on the ear, some of the many conditions that can be addressed with auriculotherapy include: ~ musculoskeletal issues like back pain or arthritis ~ hormonal and endocrine imbalances ~ asthma and allergies ~ mental-emotional conditions like depression, stress, and anxiety ~ insomnia and sleep disorders ~ digestive disorders and discomfort ~ skin conditions Most notably, auriculotherapy is used effectively in the treatment of addiction. The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) developed a 5-point auricular protocol specifically for the treatment of addiction, which is used by more than 2,000 drug and alcohol programs today. The 5 designated acupuncture points that are used include: Lung, Kidney, Liver, Shen Men, and Sympathetic.

EAR SEEDS Ear acupuncture involves the gentle placement of tiny, disposable needles into specific sites in each ear. These hair-thin needles are even smaller than those used for body acupuncture. The needles remain in the ear for the duration of the acupuncture treatment. Ear seeds are a completely non-invasive technique and activate the ear points by simply sticking on to the acupuncture points. These tiny, stick-on seeds come in the form of actual seeds, metals like gold or silver, or crystals. Clients can safely apply a few ear seeds to some of the many recognized therapeutic ear points (see below) and use this self-healing modality at home! ear points for relaxation + pain reduction There are hundreds of ear acupuncture points, and limitless point combinations to choose from. The ear points Heart, Shen Men, and Point Zero is a powerful 3 point combination for promoting overall relaxation and general wellbeing. Each point has its own unique energetic and action on the body: heart point: strengthens our spirit and calms the mind, invites joy, eases anxiety, treats insomnia, restlessness, and chest tightness, boosts memory and concentration. shen men \"spirit gate\": most widely used as a sedative point; quiets the heart, calms the spirit, reduces pain and inflammation, eases anxiety, and promotes detoxification. diaphragm (\"point zero\"): grounding and centering, reduces tension, promotes deep breathing, supports solar plexus and all organ systems between the diaphragm and umbilicus Book an appointment with us to experience the amazing benefits of auriculotherapy! and Western Systems of Ear Acupuncture.\" 2003.
