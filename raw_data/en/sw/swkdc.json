Beaumont is also collaborating with a coalition of 60 of America's top hospitals and health care institutions on a nationwide campaign to encourage adults to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Led by Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, the campaign \" [Get the Vaccine to Save Lives](https://ourshot2savelives.org/),\" is designed to reassure the public that vaccines are safe, effective and necessary to achieve herd immunity and return to normal activities. The health system continues to operate vaccine clinics at Beaumont hospitals in Dearborn and Troy, as well as the Beaumont Service Center in Southfield. However, the walk-in program is currently only available at the Southfield clinic. The clinics have the capability of administering up to 50,000 doses per week, dependent upon the amount of vaccine received and staff available given the stress of this third surge. All of Beaumont's hospitals are safe and remain open to all patients needing health care including emergency visits, testing and surgery. Patients should continue to go to any Beaumont Emergency Center for medical issues that need urgent attention. "}
