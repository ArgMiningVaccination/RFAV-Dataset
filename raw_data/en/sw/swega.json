Like all Chinese medicine, acupuncture is based on a philosophy of achieving physical harmony and balance. It was originally employed by using stone knives or sharp edged tools as a method of treating a variety of disease. It's been historically recorded as a treatment method dating back some 2,000 years. I've never had to use primitive stone tools to treat a patient since they've been replaced with stainless steel needles. The tools changed a long time ago, but you'd probably be surprised to know that acupuncture wasn't widely practiced in the U.S until 1973 when the first acupuncture laws were passed in Maryland, Nevada, and Oregon. In 1996 the FDA approved acupuncture needles for use by licensed practitioners and finally listed them as Class II medical devices. As word spread, those looking for natural methods of treatment turned to acupuncture, and its use in the US doubled in the decade after the FDA gave it their 'thumbs up'. I've used acupuncture to treat patients with a multitude of health problems from migraines to skin problems, neurological conditions, and even fertility issues. So... How does it work? You've probably seen acupuncture being done in movies or on TV, so you know it involves the insertion of needles into the body. What you may not know is that these needles are about as thick as a strand of hair and insertion is virtually painless. That's the 'mechanics' behind acupuncture. To understand the science, it helps to picture the body full of 'highways' or paths upon which energy travels and circulates. When a particular highway is closed, the flow is disrupted, resulting in pain or illness. Recent revelations in science show that we're complex bio-electric systems, giving us an even greater understanding of why acupuncture is so effective. Think of acupuncture points as switches on an electrical circuit. These electrical circuits often lie along nerve pathways. Manipulation of those switches can turn on or off the flow of electrical energy in the body, thus balancing the flow of energy in nerves and other tissues, stimulating the body's natural healing ability. You introduce no synthetic materials into the body. There are no side effects that are common with chemical drugs. It's a natural way to practice preventive health care, maintain your well-being and treat disease.
