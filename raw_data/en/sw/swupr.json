Chiropractors primarily perform adjustments to the spine or other parts of the body to correct alignment problems, alleviate pain, improve function, and support the body's natural ability to heal itself. We are trained to provide chiropractic care for adults, children, and infants. With our decades of chiropractic experience, onsite x-ray facility, massage therapy, and helpful products, we will put your body on a path using it's natural ability to fix itself. You'll sleep better, feel better, and live better. It's time to change your life. Your perfect pillow We are proud to offer Pillowise pillows, a unique new take on personal sleep comfort. To get the best possible rest and for your muscles to be at their most relaxed, it is important that you sleep on a pillow that is tailored to your dimensions. A simple yet effective measurement method enables you to find your perfect pillow. It is important that your pillow is not too high and not too low. An appropriate pillow, one that is the correct height and shape, will adapt to the contours of your neck, is comfortably soft and gives great support. To determine your perfect pillow match, you need to get measured! Pillowise pillows are well designed using the best materials and manufactured with great care in The Netherlands. They come with a five-year warranty to assure you of your best night's sleep night after night. Pillow size: 22in x 14in Core material: 100% premium Dutch memory foam Cover materials: Moisture regulating 100% Tencel Cover removable and machine washable at 70\u00b0F OEKO-TEX certificate for NON-TOXIC materials only CUstom orthotics Your insurance may qualify you for custom orthotics, a device designed to align the foot and ankle into the most anatomically efficient position. They look like insoles, but are biomechanical medical appliances that are custom made to correct your specific foot imbalance. Custom orthotics work on your feet much like glasses work on your eyes - they reduce stress and strain on your body by bringing your feet back into proper alignment. The plastic body of the custom orthotic helps to re-align the foot by redirecting and reducing certain motion that takes place during the gait cycle. Custom orthotics fit into your shoes as comfortably as an insole - and they have the advantage of having been made from precise imprints of your feet. Call to see if we can pre-qualify you! Total tea products The best way to kickstart a diet is to detox your body so that you start fresh. Your raging appetite is the result of the buildup of toxins in your body. When toxins build up, your body is no longer able to successfully digest and absorb all of the nutrients in your food. This leaves you feeling hungry because your body is craving nutrients that are crucial for normal body function. Despite the fact that you may be eating a sufficient amount of food, you still find yourself hungry an hour after eating. When you remove all of the toxins built up in your body with body detox tea, your body will be able to effectively absorb the nutrients from your food, vitamins, and supplements. Our herbal colon cleanse tea contains ingredients that are crucial for removing toxins, cleaning the colon, losing weight, and suppressing appetite. The best part?
