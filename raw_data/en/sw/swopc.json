[According](https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Anxiety-Disorders) to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an estimated 40 million adults in the U.S. have some kind of anxiety disorder. Worldwide, 1 in 14 people are affected. So if we feel like we're the only ones dealing with anxiety \u2014 and yes, that's how isolating it can feel \u2014 be assured none of us is alone. We've all likely experienced the feeling of anxiety, whether it's butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, heart palpitations, tension headaches, an upset stomach, or tightness in the chest \u2014 all natural occurrences when adrenaline is pumping. But there's a difference between everyday anxiousness and clinical anxiety. Key takeaways: Understanding anxiety is the first step in managing it Then, through meditation, we learn to recognize the triggering thoughts and can work to find different ways around these mental patterns Try 7 meditations for anxiety Our adrenal glands start flaring whenever we're in a dangerous situation or potential conflict, activating the \"fight or flight\" mechanism, or when we're a bag of nerves ahead of delivering a speech, a must-win sports game, or walking down the aisle, for example. That's anxiousness. But anxiousness becomes generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) when the fear or worry doesn't abate, escalating into a sense of impending doom, constant ruminating, catastrophizing, and, in some cases, panic. Anxiety on this scale can be all-consuming, debilitating, and distressing. [Stress](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/stress) can, of course, induce anxiety, and there's an overlap between the 2 in terms of the physiological reactions. Stress is a heightened emotional state that dissipates once a stressful situation is over whereas GAD is a diagnosable condition that tends to persist for long periods. Anxiety that becomes a disorder is characterized by a \"persistent and excessive worry\" where individuals can lose rational perspective and \"expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason for concern,\" [according to](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad) the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Understanding anxiety is the first step in managing it. In knowing its erratic nature, we can obtain a better sense of triggering situations and how our anxiety operates \u2014 and that's where [meditation](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/meditation-101) comes in. Anxiety is a cognitive state connected to an inability to regulate emotions. But [research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/) that a consistent meditation practice reprograms neural pathways in the brain and, therefore, improves our ability to regulate emotions. Through meditation, we familiarize ourselves with anxiety-inducing thoughts and storylines. We learn to see them, sit with them, and let them go. In doing so, we learn 2 important things: thoughts do not define us, and thoughts are not real. Within this newfound perspective, we're able to gradually change our relationship with anxiety, differentiating between what is an irrational episode and what's true. Another benefit of this skill is learning body awareness, which teaches us to bring our attention to any physical sensations felt in the moment. This [technique](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/techniques) involves mentally scanning the body, inch by inch, making us more attuned to what's being experienced physically. In exploring these sensations, we sit with our senses in the same way we sit with your thoughts. This go-to technique can provide a safe place that can be repeatedly accessed whenever anxiety starts to creep in. Anxiety has the same effect on our bodies as stress does in that [it triggers](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response) the autonomic nervous system, leading to a spike in the release of epinephrine and cortisol \u2014 the \"stress hormones.\" Too much epinephrine [can increase](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response) the risk of heart attacks and strokes; too much cortisol can affect our health in numerous ways \u2014 including increasing blood sugar levels, suppressing the immune system, and constricting blood vessels. When these hormones are released into the bloodstream, the liver produces more glucose, which is what provides the energy to activate our fight-or-flight mechanism, ultimately leading to an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels, all of which disrupts our immune system, energy levels, and [sleep](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/sleep). We meditate to counter the \"stress response,\" leading to a decrease in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen consumption. It also creates a more gradual change in the brain, which is where meditation really works its magic, [inducing](https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Citation/2000/05150/Functional_brain_mapping_of_the_relaxation.42.aspx) a set of physiological changes) that form the stress-busting \"relaxation response\" that can be seen in MRI imaging. Located deep within the brain's limbic system are 2 almond-sized nuclei called the amygdala \u2014 essentially tiny processing chips that govern our senses, memories, decisions, and moods. When it comes to how we react to life and express ourselves, this is where it all happens. The amygdala is our emotional thermostat. As with all thermostats, the amygdala is susceptible to certain forces \u2014 in this case, anxiety \u2014 ranging from a calm, rational, level-headed setting to an over-reactive, anxiety-ridden state. The more anxiety we experience, the more disproportionate and irrational the amygdala's response. And so, unwittingly, we're teaching the amygdala to no longer regulate itself. What's more, the drip, drip, drip effect of constant anxiety can reshape the structure and neural pathways of the brain \u2014 a process called [neuroplasticity](https://www.britannica.com/science/neuroplasticity). The brain gets reprogrammed by the experiences it's continually subjected to. So it follows, then, that meditation would have an opposite, more beneficial effect. Studies involving MRI scans [show](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/what-does-mindfulness-meditation-do-to-your-brain/) that the amygdala shrinks in response to meditation practice. As the amygdala reduces in size, the prefrontal cortex \u2014 the area of the brain governing our awareness \u2014 becomes thicker. By meditating, we can increase our capacity to manage anxiety. The more we practice this skill, the more [we build](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/) this [mental resilience](https://www.headspace.com/articles/mental-toughness). Anxiety disorders are characterized by a general feature of excessive [fear](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/fear) (an emotional response to a perceived or real threat) and/or anxiety ( [worrying](https://www.headspace.com/articles/how-to-stop-worrying) about a future threat) and can have negative behavioral and emotional consequences. There are several diagnosable anxiety disorders: Generalized anxiety. Worrying about things in everyday life. Social anxiety. Worrying about being evaluated negatively in social situations. Separation anxiety. Fear of separation from home or a loved one. Panic disorder. Panic attacks that strike without warning in any number of situations. Obsessive compulsive disorder. An obsession or compulsion to repeat certain behaviors or rituals. Through meditation \u2014 and understanding the trickster nature of anxiety and what it does to the mind \u2014 we learn to recognize the triggering thoughts. From there, we can work to find different ways around these mental patterns and avoid falling into \"the trap\" again. Looking for more meditations to feel calmer and less worried?

Meditation is one option out of a myriad of treatments available to help people manage, or learn to cope with, feelings of anxiety in a different way, essentially changing the relationship to anxiety, and the way it's viewed. Meditation isn't a quick-fix strategy; it does take a long-term approach. For those who may have severe anxiety, or if have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, always speak to a health care professional to talk through options and figure out how to make meditation a component of an overall treatment program. DISCLAIMER: General meditation practice and apps like Headspace are not a replacement for or a form of therapy nor are they intended to cure, treat, or diagnose medical conditions, such as anxiety disorder. Meditation can, however, be a component of an overall treatment plan when monitored by a healthcare professional. "}
