Immunity can be defined as the self defending capacity of the body to recognize and preserve the particles of the self, and to distinctly recognize and reject the things that are foreign to the human body. In short immunity is the body's ability to fight against harmful germs and infections. Biologically immunity is defined as the balanced state of multicellular organisms having adequate biological defenses to fight infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasions, while having adequate tolerance to avoid allergy, and autoimmune diseases. The immune system consists of special organs, cells and chemicals which help to fight the infections. They are the white blood cells, antibodies, the complement system, the lymphatic system, the spleen, the thymus, and the bone marrow. The organs such as bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus produce the lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are the white blood cells which are further classified into B and T cells. They attack and destroy the invading microorganisms or antigens. B cells retaliate by releasing antibodies specific to the antigen and the T cells destroys and kill the foreign invaders and abnormal cells. There are three types of immunity in human beings. They are: Innate immunity: which all the human beings are born with. The innate immunity begins to act against the invading germs from birth such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat. Adaptive immunity: which human beings develop throughout their lives as they are exposed to various diseases and pathogens. Passive immunity: also called \"borrowed\" or temporary immunity is obtained from other outer sources and it lasts for a short time. Like a newborn baby which receives antibodies from the mother through placenta and in breast milk before and after birth respectively for a short period of life.
