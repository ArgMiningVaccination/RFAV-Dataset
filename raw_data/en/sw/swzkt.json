Upon booking the Cruise, Guests who have special needs are requested to contact Crystal's Onboard Guest Services at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to discuss the details of their special needs. Crystal recommends that any Guest who is not self-sufficient should travel with a companion who shall take responsibility for any personal assistance needed during the Cruise because Crystal does not provide personal care assistance to Guests. All Guests must be able to provide for their own, or arrange for, personal care and the Ship's crew will not provide any assistance with such personal tasks.
