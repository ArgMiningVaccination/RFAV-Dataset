Simmons, J. Shalwitz, S. Pollock (2002). Understanding Confidentiality and Minor Consent in California: An Adolescent Provider Toolkit . San Francisco, CA: Adolescent Health Working Group, San Francisco Health Plan.HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THIS TOOLKIT ADOLESCENT HEALTH WORKING GROUP SUGGESTED CITATIONSAN FRANCISCO HEALTH PLANAdolescent Health Working Group San Francisco, CA San Francisco Health Plan San Francisco, CA Dear Colleagues: We are pleased to present you with Understanding Confidentiality and Minor Consent in California: An Adolescent Provider Toolkit. This is one chapter of a larger project, The Adolescent Provider Toolkit, made possible through the generous support of TheCalifornia Endowment and our close collaboration with the San Francisco Health Plan(SFHP). The Toolkit contains resources to help health care providers better meet theneeds of adolescent patients. Adolescents list concerns about confidentiality as the number one reason they might forgo medical care. A young person is more likely to disclose sensitive information if heor she is provided with confidential services and has time alone with the provider.However, providers indicate that they are mystified and confused by the various confi-dentiality and minor consent laws and about their reporting responsibilities. This toolkit,compiled by a multi-disciplinary group of lawyers, health care providers, and youthadvocates, strives to clarify these issues. Designed for busy providers, the Toolkit includes materials that you are free to copy and distribute to your adolescent patients and their families or to hang in waiting and examrooms. In addition, we will soon have a link to an online confidentiality training on ourwebsite, which you will be able to access without charge. We would like to thank The California Family Health Council and the California Adolescent Health Collaborative for their assistance with the printing and distribution ofthis resource. If you have questions regarding the Toolkit or its accompanying trainings and resources, please call the Adolescent Health Working Group at (415) 576-1170.

If the provider is unable to reach a parentand believes that treatment must be provided immediately, the providershould proceed if the youth 's medical condition qualifies as an emergency. The provider should clearly document his/her actions and decisions andrationale for treatment or interventions.A: Can consent be given verbally?Q:California statutes do not specifically require that consent be written. Often, for routine uncomplicated care, providers feel comfortable with ver-bal consent. In these cases, it is clear that the person giving consent under-stands the risks and consequences of the procedure and that the verbal com-munication is documented in the medical record. If the treatment is morecomplicated, the provider may want a signed consent form to be sure thatthe person providing consent is providing \"informed consent \" and under- stands the ramifications of the procedures performed. Health care providersshould establish an office policy to provide all staff guidance. A: A:If parents give consent to treatment, does that givethem the right to look overmedical records?Q:The general rule is that parents have a right to see medical records if the parents consented to the treatment. HOWEVER, California law gives health care providers the right to refuse access to records anytime the health care provider determines that access tothe patient records would have a detrimental effect on the provider 's profes- sional relationship with the minor patient or the minor 's physical or psycho- logical well-being. (Cal. Health and Safety Code \u00a7 123115(a)(2)). The health care provider is not liable for denying access to records under this provision if the decision to deny access was made in good faith. A:When the youth has the right to confidential care,what do I do if I 'm uncomfortable NOT telling parents?Q:If a minor has the legal right to confidential care, a provider must abide by that right or risk liability or other legal sanction. There are a few minorconsent statutes that grant the health provider the right to decide whethercontacting a parent is appropriate or necessary even over the minor 's objec- tion. One example is the minor consent drug treatment statute. See theChart A-1 confidentiality column for statutes that allow providers to sharewith parents over the minor's objection. In those cases and no others, aprovider can rely on their professional judgment to decide whether to shareinformation with parents. Providers are not legally obligated to provide services to which they are morally or ethically opposed. In such circumstances, the provider shouldrefer the adolescent to another provider, clinic, or program who can bettermeet the teen 's health care needs.TIP SHEET FOR PROVIDERS\u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002 A-3 Adolescent Provider ToolkitTIP SHEET What if the minor does not SEEM competent to makehis or her own decisions?(low IQ, drug use, adultinfluence)Q:A patient is competent if the patient (1) understands the nature and con- sequence of his/her medical condition and the proposed treatment and (2)can communicate his/her decision. Providers can make their own assessment of a patient 's competency and do not need a judicial ruling or psychiatric diagnosis in order to find apatient incompetent. When assessing whether the patient understands thenature and consequences of his/her medical condition (and can communi-cate his/her decision) take into account the following: (1) Always start with the presumption that a patient is competent. (2) Minority age alone is not a sufficient basis for determining if some- one is incompetent. The law specifically deems minors capable ofproviding consent in certain medical situations. (3) Physical or mental disorders alone are not a sufficient basis for finding incompetency. (4) The nature and consequence of the medical condition must be explained in terms a minor would understand. (5) Believing that the patient is making an unwise or \"wrong \" medical decision is not a sufficient basis for finding the patient incompetent. (6) Competency is situation specific. A minor deemed incompetent in one situation may not be considered incompetent in all situations.A:CONFIDENTIALITY AND MINOR CONSENT Q&AFOR PROVIDERS \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002 A-3 Adolescent Provider ToolkitI know that minors over 12 can consent to their ownmental health care whenthey are mature enough toparticipate in the serviceand the minor would present \"a danger or serious physical or mentalharm to self or otherswithout the mental healthtreatment. \" But, what is \"serious harm? \"Q:There is no statute or regulation that defines the term \"serious harm \". The interpretation of this term is left to the discretion and professionaljudgment of the provider. We recommend that you develop guidelines foryour staff to ensure consistency in your office/clinic/agency. The SanFrancisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) policy uses the GlobalAssessment of Functioning (GAF) scale to assess psychological andsocial functioning. According to SFDPH, a score of <60 indicates symp-toms and level of functioning that satisfies the definition of \"serious dan- ger of physical or mental health harm. \" (Lubosky, L. \"Clinicians ' Judgments of Mental Health, \" Archives of General Psychiatry, 7: 407- 417, 1962)A:How can we provide confi- dential care when thepatient 's health plan sends Explanation of Benefits(EOBS), bills, or surveyshome after a visit?Q:If you know that a health plan will automatically send out materials to your patient you can do the following: (1) Become a Family PACT provider and bill for services through this program. (2) Urge your patient to sign-up for the MediCal Minor Consent program and bill for services through this program. (3) Refer your patients to Family PACT or MediCal Minor Consent providers. See Chart A-7, \"Financing Tips for Providing Confidential Teen Services \" (5) Contact the patient 's health plan and let them know your concerns.A:A-4 Adolescent Provider Toolkit \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002TIP SHEET MANDATED REPORTING Q&AFOR PROVIDERS \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002Who is a Mandated Reporter?Q: Why and when am I required to make a report?Q:There is a list of 33 mandated reporters, but those pertaining to adolescent health services are: 1) Physicians 2) Surgeons 3) Psychiatrists 4) Psychologists 5)Psychological Assistants 6) Mental Health and Counseling Professionals 7)Dentists 8) Dental Hygienists 9) Registered Dental Assistants 10) Residents11) Interns 12) Podiatrists 13) Chiropractors 14) Licensed Nurses 15)Optometrists 16) Marriage, Family and Child Counselors, Interns andTrainees 17) State and County Public Health Employees 18) Clinical SocialWorkers 19) EMT's and Paramedics 20) Pharmacists The California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act created a set of state statutes that establish the whys, whens and wheres of reporting childabuse in California. \"Mandated reporters \" are required to make a child abuse report anytime, in the scope of performing their professional duties, they discover facts thatlead them to know or reasonably suspect a child is a victim of abuse. Reasonable suspicion of abuse occurs when \"it is objectively reasonable for a person to entertain a suspicion, based upon facts that could cause a rea-sonable person in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his or hertraining and experience, to suspect child abuse or neglect. \" The Act requires professionals to use their training and experience to evalu- ate the situation; however, \"nothing in the Act requires professionals such as health practitioners to obtain information they would not ordinarilyobtain in the course of providing care or treatment. Thus, the duty to reportmust be premised on information obtained by the health practitioner in theordinary course of providing care and treatment according to standards pre-vailing in the medical profession. \" (People v. Stockton Pregnancy Control Medical Clinic, 203 Cal.App.3d 225, 239-240, 1988) The pregnancy of a minor in and of itself does not constitute a basis for a reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse. A child who is not receiving medicaltreatment for religious reasons shall not be considered neglected for thatreason alone.A: A: A: A:What about the right of patient confidentiality?Q:Child Abuse reporting is one of the few exceptions to patient confidentiali- ty. Reporters do not need the minor or parent 's consent to share the other- wise confidential information necessary to make a report. The Child AbuseReporting Act specifically exempts reporters from any liability if they makea good faith report of abuse. When does a mandated reporter have to report sexual activity?Q:See Chart A-2 \" When am I Mandated To Report The Sexual Activity of Minors to Children 's Protective Services or Police in California? \"A-4 Adolescent Provider Toolkit \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002MANDATED REPORTING Q&AFOR PROVIDERS \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002How do I make a report?Q:1. First, call the Department of Social Services immediately (in San Francisco, 415-558-2650). If you are unsure whether you need to report,call this number for more information. If the young person lives outsideof San Francisco, call the county where he or she lives. If the place ofresidence and place of abuse are not the same, you must report in bothcounties. Let the reporter know this information at the beginning of yourreport. 2. Y ou must file a written report (DOJ form SS 8572) within 36 hours of the verbal report. See an example of the report form on the back of this page. What will I report?Q:1. Y our name, although this is kept confidential except in certain, limited, situations. 2. The child 's name 3. The present location of the child4. The nature and extent of the injury5. Any other information, including that which led you to suspect child abuse, requested by the child protective agency 6. If the child does not feel safe returning to the place of abuse or if he or she is in immediate danger, report this information as well. What happens to the reports?Q:1. The report will be investigated either by the local law enforcement agency or by the child protective services agency. 2. The report will be assessed as to whether there is a need for immediate action. 3. High risk factors will be considered to determine whether immediate face-to-face contact is required (ex. Direct interviews with anyone whomight provide more information on the situation.) 4. The report will be determined to be either a. Unfounded (false, inherently improbable, to involve accidental injury, or not to constitute child abuse) b. Substantiated (constitutes child abuse or neglect)c. Inconclusive (not unfounded, but the findings are inconclusive and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether child abuse or neglect has occurred) What happens if the report is not unfounded?Q:1. It will be forwarded to the Child Abuse Central Index and investigation will continue. 2. The child may be taken into protective custody.3. The case can be officially opened and regular in-home supervision and a number of services are provided. Will I be told about the status of the report?Q:The Child Protective Agency is required to provide mandated reporters with feedback about the report and investigation. It might be necessary to beproactive in this situation by calling the Department of Social Services. Is there a statute of limitations?Q:No. If an individual under 18 years old tells you about abuse, even if it occurred when he or she was a young child, you must report it. Other agen-cies will decide whether the case should be pursued.A: A: A: A: A: A:\u00a9 A-4 Adolescent Provider Toolkit Sources: The Office of the Attorney General, Child Abuse Prevention Handbook, http://caag.state.ca.us/cvpc/main_pub_videos.htmlHealth Initiatives for Y outh, Adolescent Provider 's Guide, 1998. San Francisco Child Abuse Council, A Training Curriculum for Mandated Reporters on the California Child Abuse Reporting Law, 1995.THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY OBTAIN COPIES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICESTIP SHEET CHECKLIST IS YOUR OFFICE CONFIDENTIALITY CONSCIOUS? Adolescents tend to underutilize existing health care resources. The issue of confidentiality has been identified by both providers and youth as a significant access barrier to healthcare. To support the promotion of adolescent care, please take a few moments to assess your office in determining whether it is confidentiality conscious. Creating a safe environment forteenagers to discuss issues concerning their health will facilitate the best possible care andcounseling to respond to their needs. Do you have an office policy about confidential issues pertaining to youth and their families? Is it the usual practice in your clinic to allow adolescents and parents to talk separately with the health care providers about their concerns? Do you educate your members and staff regarding the California laws that specifically pertain to adolescents and their right to receive carewithout their parent or guardian's consent? (Please see \"Summary ofLegal Consent Requirements for Medical Treatment of Minors\", includ-ed in this packet.) Does the atmosphere (pictures, wallpapers, etc.) create a safe and comfortable environment for teens to discuss private concerns regardingtheir health? Do you display and/or offer educational materials on confidentiality to adolescent patients and/or parents? Are you and your staff careful not to discuss patient information in open environments (elevators, hallways or waiting rooms)? When collecting an adolescent patient's medical history or discussing anything sensitive, do you make sure all doors are closed? Do you ask if your adolescent patient feels comfortable receiving messages or mail from you using the contact information they provide? At the beginning of the appointment, do you explain the parameters of confidentiality between you, your patients, and his/her parents? Do you discuss situations in which you may need to breach confidentiality? \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002 A-5 Adolescent Provider ToolkitTIPS FOR PROTECTING YOUTH CONFIDENTIALITY While adolescent confidentiality laws provide us with formal (although often confusing) guidelines for ensuring confidentiality of our teen patients, it is frequently the small stuff that can seriously com-promise an adolescent patient's confidence in his/her provider. The following is a list of tips - someobvious, some not - for preserving patient privacy and minimizing embarrassment in a clinic setting. 1. Do not discuss patient information in elevators, hallways, or waiting rooms. If an adolescent patient overhears this conversation, he or she may assume that you will also discuss his or hercase in an open environment. 2. Do not collect an adolescent patient 's medical history or reason for visit in an open area. It will be difficult for a teenager to discuss his or her personal issues honestly if s/he thinks other people will overhear. 3. When an adolescent patient gives you a contact phone number, make sure that you can leave messages. If you cannot, ask for an alternative number at which you can leave messages if necessary. 4. Likewise, do not send mail (such as appointment reminders and bills) home unless you have dis-cussed whether or not the patient feels comfort-able receiving mail from you at his or her home. If he or she does not wish to receive mail at home, try to work out an arrangement whereby mail is picked upat the clinic. TIP: Some clinics have check boxes oncharting forms indicating a teen's preference regardingmail and phone calls. Other clinics clarify what kind ofmessage might be ok to leave at a teen's contact num-ber (e.g. \"Tina\" called).5. When discussing anything sensitive, such as sexual history, weight, or substance use, make sure all doors are closed. A patient in the waiting room may overhear a discus- sion and thus be more reluctant to share informationwhen he or she sees the health care provider. 6. Think about how your clinic administers paperwork to patients. Are you asking clients to fill out forms such that other people might be able to read their answers? Give out a clipboard with the forms; also make sure that there isenough room in which to complete forms with somedegree of privacy. 7. Make sure that any clinic literature your clinic or practice distributes is small enough to fit into a purse or wallet. Asking a teenager to leave with bright, large brochures on a sensitive subject, such as gonorrhea, will causemore embarrassment than anything else. These typesof materials should be offered to teens in private. 8. At the beginning of the appointment, make it clear that a provider is required to maintain patient confidentiality, except under very specific circumstances. Periodically remind the patient that anything s/he says about sex, drugs, and feelings will not leave the room. \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002 A-6 Adolescent Provider ToolkitTIP SHEET FOR PROVIDERS PERFORMING AN ATRAUMATIC \"PARENTECTOMY \" Or, how do I provide adolescent-sensitive services when a parent or caregiver is present? Attempting to provide confidential services can cause great discomfort for youth, parents, and providers if it is not handled in a sensitive manner. The following arerecommendations that can facilitate a smooth transition from the parent-accompa-nied visit to the confidential adolescent visit. ROADMAP Lay out the course of the visit... for example , \"We will spend some time talking together about Joseph 's health history and any concerns that you or he might have, and then I will alsospend some time alone with Joseph. At the end of the visit, we will all meettogether again to clarify any tests, treatments or follow-up plans. \" Explain your office/clinic policy regarding adolescent visits. Review your policy verbally early in the interaction with the youth and parent. Acknowledge that the youth is a minor and therefore has specific legal rights related to consent and confidentiality. Introduce the concept of fostering adolescent self-responsibility and self-reliance. Reinforce that this policy applies to all adolescents in your practice or clinic (in other words, this is not specific to YOUR child). Validate the parental role in their child's health and well-being. Elicit any specific questions or concerns from the parent. Direct questions and discussion to the youth while attending to and validating parental input. REMOVE Invite the parents to have a seat in the waiting area, assuring them that you will call them prior to closing the visit REVISIT Once the parent is out of the room, revisit issues of consent and confidentiality with the youth, including situations when confidentiality has to be breached (suicidality, abuse, etc.). Revisit areas of parental concern with the youth and obtain the youth's perspective. Conduct the psycho-social interview and physical exam (ascertain whether youth desires parent's presence during PE and accommodate youth's preference). Clarify what information from the psycho-social interview and PE the youth is comfortable sharing with parent. REUNITE Invite the parent back to close the visit with both parent and youth. A young person is more likely to disclose sensitive information to ahealth care provider if the youth isprovided with confidential servic-es, and has time alone with theprovider to discuss his/her issues. Remember that even when the chief complaint is acne or an ear-ache, there may be an underlyingissues on the part of the adoles-cent (such as the need for a preg-nancy test or contraception),which will only surface whenprovided confidential services. EXTRA NOTES: Additional ways to explain your policy regarding confidentiality: A letter to all new adolescent patients and their parents, and all parents and patients on theyouth's 11th or 12th birthdayexplaining your policy. This will help families to come prepared for the adolescent and the provider to spend some time alone. Posters in the waiting area explaining adolescent consentand confidentiality and your policy as it relates to the law can also help lay groundworkthat the provider will be spendingtime alone with the youth.

Young people may not haveenough money to pay for the services that they need. Often, they are also worried that if they access afree or low cost program such as Family PACT or Medi-Cal, their confidentiality will be compro-mised. It is thus important to understand the laws and policies governing the ways in which youngpeople can access free or low cost sensitive services. California State has two programs that reimburse confidential health services for youth: Medi-Cal Minor Consent and Family PACT (Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment). Below you will findinformation on how to become a provider in each of these programs, how to determine youth eligibility, and how to receive payment for services rendered. \u00a9 Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002 A-8 Adolescent Provider ToolkitTIP SHEET FOR PROVIDERS (Continued on next page)MEDI-CAL MINOR CONSENT FAMILY PACT None Call or visit your county Social Services office.

Y our son or daughter 's body is chang- ing, and so are his or her feelings. There are many health risks during the teenage years thatwe try to prevent, such as accidents, violence, unprotected sex, alcohol and drug use, andstress. Some areas of teen health that we may talk about during the appointment are: It is good to stay close to your child. It is also important for you to allow them some time alone to talk about their health and changes in their bodies and lives. This will help yourteenager make good decisions. I encourage teenagers to share information about theirhealth with their parents or guardians.

Health care providers have tokeep those services CONFIDENTIAL. \"Confidential \" means I will only share this informa- tion if a teenager says it 's alright. I will also share this information if someone is in danger. I can contact you about most of the services your child receives. However, if your teenager receives the following services, I cannot give you information about these visits withoutpermission from your son or daughter: The prevention or treatment of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and other contagious diseases The diagnosis and treatment of sexual and physical abuse Care and counseling for drug or alcohol problems I ask that you support these rules and help your teen learn to care for their own health needs.

In order to implement this policy, the Society for Adolescent Medicine recommends the following: Health providers should inform adolescent patients and their parents, if available, about the requirements of confidentiali-ty, including a full explanation of what confidential careentails and the conditions under which confidentiality mightbe breached. Health providers must remain flexible when delivering confidential care to adolescents. Blind adherence to absoluteconfidentiality, or absence of confidentiality (in deference toparental wishes), is neither desirable nor required by ethics orlaw. Health providers should develop a disclosure plan for those adolescents who are deemed not to have capacity to giveinformed consent or for whom disclosure of information toresponsible adults becomes necessary which involves adoles-cent wishes about the manner in which information is shared. Confidentiality considerations regarding record keeping are necessary. Health providers must consider the manner inwhich written and electronic medical records might be avail-able to parties in ways that verbal communication are not, andin ways that would be objectionable to adolescent patients. Expanded efforts are needed to increase the education of health professionals regarding the laws and regulations intheir jurisdiction relating to confidentiality and informedconsent for adolescents. In addition, specific training isneeded to increase providers 'skills in effectively and appropriately incorporating confidentiality into clinicalpractice. Further research is necessary to evaluate the process of maintaining confidentiality. These investigations shouldinclude studies of the attitudes of adolescents related toconfidentiality, specific influences of gender and race/ethnic-ity, provider and parental attitudes about confidentiality, andthe approaches necessary to allow professional practices tooptionally meet ethical and legal requirements. Background There is a growing need for education of health professionals regarding ethical and legal aspects of consent and confidential-ity. Adolescents are engaging in a variety of health riskbehaviors that should be known to their health providers (1,2).In addition, the protection of confidentiality within and beyond the health care setting is becoming more precarious owing tohealth care reform, computerization of health records, andchanges in health care administration (3). Results of studiesindicate a lack of consensus among practicing health providersabout confidentiality when treating adolescent patients (4-7).A recent survey of primary care physicians in California indi-cates that physicians do not consistently discuss confidentiali-ty with their adolescent patients and do not distinguish betweenunconditional and conditional confidentiality (7). Althoughminors 'rights to confidential medical care have expanded over the past 25 years, these legal prerogatives undergo ongoingmodification. Many states have passed mandatory parentalconsent and notification laws, especially related to thetermination of pregnancy. As laws change, it becomes moredifficult for health professionals to maintain familiarity withcurrent laws determining when adolescents may consent forconfidential medical care. It is unclear if providers understandthese existing laws and policies regarding minor 's consent and confidentiality (8),(9). This article defines necessary terms and concepts, address rea- sons for confidentiality in adolescent health care, reviews legalguidelines, and provides suggestions for implementation. Definitions Confidentiality in a health care setting is defined as an agree- ment between patient and provider that information discussedduring or after the encounter will not be shared with other par-ties without the explicit permission of the patient. It is bestclassified as a rule of biomedical ethics that derives from themoral principle of autonomy and accompanies other rules likepromise-keeping, truthfulness and privacy (10). Privacy means freedom from unsanctioned intrusion. In a health care setting it involves psychological, social and physi-cal components in addition to confidentiality (11). Informed consent describes the process during which the patient learns the risks and benefits of alternative approachesto management and freely authorizes a course of action pro-posed by the clinician. Informed consent has both ethical andlegal derivations. Although usually bound together in clinicalencounters, confidentiality and consent are different.Confidentiality can occur during an encounter whether or notspecific informed consent for a treatment or intervention isgiven. For example, contraceptive options may be confidential-ly discussed before informed consent is given for any specificchoice. Under specific legal circumstances, adolescents may receiveA-12confidential care and may give informed consent for recom- mended care (12). If the legal circumstances does not justify aminor 's consent to medical treatment, the minor 's views and opinions can still be respected by obtaining assent (13,14). This is an ethical rather than a legal concept. Seeking theassent of a minor who is not legally authorized to consentdemonstrates respect for the decision-making skills of a non-autonomous individual to the extent that he/she is able to par-ticipate in the decision. This is particularly relevant for adoles-cents who are cognitively maturing, but below the age of legalmajority and still dependent upon adults for their basic healthcare decisions. Respect for the decision-making capabilities ofan adolescent demands both confidentiality and privacy. Reasons for Confidentiality The Needs of Clinical Practice The most practical reason for clinicians to grant confidentiali- ty to adolescent patients is to facilitate accurate diagnosis andappropriate treatment. Experienced clinicians recognize thatcandid and complete information can be gathered only byspeaking with the adolescent patient alone, and by clarifyingwith whom the information will be shared. If an assurance ofconfidentiality is not extended, this may create an obstacle tocare since the adolescent may withhold information, delayentry into care, or refuse care. A growing body of research has examined whether minors would seek health care if it were not confidential (15-20). Forexample, a study of Massachusetts high school students foundthat 25% would forego health care if confidentiality were notassured (15). In another study, a majority of students reportedthey would not go to their private physician for care related tosexuality, substance abuse or emotional upset, nor would theyseek care for these problems if their parents had to know aboutthe office visit (19). Thus, most adolescents seek confidential-ity when questioned about their specific health care needs. (21) Many other barriers to optimal adolescent health care have been identified, including inadequate health insurance, lack ofage-appropriate facilities, office policies, lack of training andsensitivity of physicians and office staff in adolescent issues,and inadequate physician time (22). These barriers limit theopportunity for adolescents to discuss important health andbehavioral issues. In a recent California survey, most adoles-cents reported they were unable to discuss sexual matters withtheir physicians, despite recognizing the helpfulness of suchdiscussions (23). Confidential care, unlike economic and facil-ity barriers, can be easily addressed, and integrated into clini-cal practices. Developmental Needs Adolescents seek confidentiality for reasons that derive from their unique developmental circumstance. Some teens fearparental retribution (24). Others fear damage to reputation andself-esteem (25). Most adolescents are striving for maturity,independence and adult status. In fact, most individuals overage 14 years have the cognitive ability to process medicalinformation in a manner similar to adults (26). The developmental needs and abilities of adolescents as well as the issues under discussion, help shape the physician-patientrelationship (27). For example, sexual behavior and orienta-tion, are generally felt to be highly personal matters by bothadolescents and adults. Like adults, adolescents seek privacy indiscussing these sensitive topics and may worry about parentaldisapproval. The practitioner and parent can help the adoles-cent develop independent self-care skills for even the most sen-sitive of issues by allowing the adolescent to practice confi-dential self-disclosure to the provider. The degree to which the confidential relationship contributes to the health of the teenager will depend on each adolescent 's developmental, medical, and environmental circumstances.The scope of confidentiality must be flexible and carefullyconsidered. The clinician should take into account the adoles-cent's developmental capabilities, the presenting problem, and the adolescent 's individual needs. By mid-adolescence, most teens are able to reason like adults, but because of inexperi-ence, may require more guidance in medical decision-making.Previous research has found developmental differencesbetween younger and older adolescents in understanding con-fidentiality and whether the explicit discussion of confiden-tiality facilitates disclosure of personal information (28,29).For the younger adolescent, the process of building a trustingrelationship and demonstrating that confidentiality will be pre-served was found to be as important as what was said.Moreover, Messenger and McGuire (28) conclude that a reallife experience with this process is superior to a verbal expla-nation. Gender differences have also been demonstrated(9,28,29). For example, males were found to be more open todisclosure and less concerned about confidentiality violationsthan females. Studies have demonstrated that adolescents ofeither gender view confidentiality differently depending uponthe health care setting (e.g., family planning or public healthclinic), where they expect confidentiality, as compared to pri-vate physician 's offices, where they are less sure if they will be afforded this practice (15,19). Moral and Ethical Requirements Providing confidential care to adolescents is a professional duty deriving from the moral tradition of physicians and thegoals of medicine. The first references to the principle of med-ical confidentiality are found in the codes of professionalethics (30). The fundamental statement on confidentiality inthe Western tradition is embodied in the Hippocratic Oath,which influenced all subsequent medical ethical reflections onthis matter (31). Two philosophical arguments have beenadvanced which justify the principle of medical confidentiali-ty. The utilitarian argument refers to the consequences ofbehavior and states that because confidentiality encouragespatients to fully disclose their symptoms and life circum-stances, the clinician 's capacity to help them will be enhanced. Confidentiality allows for beneficence, or the moral duty tobenefit the patient. The second philosophical argument is based upon the moral-A-12ity of the action itself distinguished from its anticipated conse- quences. In this case, confidentiality concerns basic respect foradolescent patients as persons, respect for their autonomy andrecognition of their right to privacy. Only recently have theseprinciples been applied to the medical care of teenagers (32).This has created a dilemma for professionals who must balancetheir interest in protecting the health of their adolescentpatients by providing appropriate, timely, confidential care andthe desires of parents to know about the condition of theirminor children and make decisions regarding their care. Because adolescents vary in their psychosocial and economic autonomy, it becomes impossible to apply a single moral pre-scription in all cases. It is necessary to ground confidentialityin the moral necessity of respect for the individual while rec-ognizing that it is permissible to breach confidentiality inselected instances, and only when certain requisites have beenfulfilled. Should these special circumstances not be respectedbecause a professional thinks it would be inconvenient or diffi-cult, a clear moral breach will have occurred in which a physi-cian places personal needs above those of the patient.Excessive paternalism results if confidentiality is disregardedbecause the physician decides what is \"best\" for the adolescent without a strong and persuasive reason. Paternalism has been defined as either an interference with a person 's freedom of action (33), as a \"refusal to accept or acquiesce in an individual 's choices, wishes and actions, \" (34) or as an act of coercion (35). Clinicians need to be extremelycautious when deciding to break confidentiality because it mayseriously jeopardize the provider-patient relationship (36).However, in cases of suicidal or homicidal ideation or gestures,serious chemical dependence, the youth 's disclosure of physi- cal or sexual abuse and life threatening medical conditions(i.e., eating disorders), it may be necessary to disclose privateinformation to the adolescent 's caretakers or others. Silber (37) has proposed that \"justified paternalism \" in the care of adoles- cents could be appropriate under these circumstances, provid-ed two conditions are met: reasonable evidence that an adoles-cent's capacity for autonomy is impaired; and, protecting the adolescent 's life is the central goal. Thus, protecting life out- weighs the principle of autonomy. Should the physician encounter a circumstance in which \"jus- tified paternalism \" and disclosure better serves the adolescent, there is still a moral duty to respect the adolescent. This can beaccomplished by explaining the reason for breaching confi-dentiality and involving the patient in the process of revealingthe confidential information. Legal Issues and Guidelines Legal provisions which support confidentiality include, among others, avoiding embarrassment and humiliation, protectingpersonal and family security, and avoiding discrimination ordenial of service (38). For adolescents, legal protection for themaintenance of confidentiality serves two primary purposes.The first purpose (as has been discussed) is clinical utility andencourages them to seek necessary medical care. The secondlegal purpose is to grant adult rights to those minors whodeserve them by virtue of their maturity. The minor who has achieved a level of maturity sufficient to enable him or her togive informed consent generally is entitled to the associatedprivacy of information. The law has evolved in important ways over the past several decades in the degree to which it protects, or at least, does notimpede the provision of confidential health services for ado-lescents. Nevertheless, there continue to be areas in which thecurrent legal system fails to provide adequate protection, par-ticularly with respect to current changes in the health caredelivery system, such as the rapid shift to managed care.Moreover, care management will attempt to standardize healthcare delivery methods and might threaten the unique privacyneeds of adolescents in such areas as medical records, carepathways, and gatekeeper functions. Sources of the Confidentiality Obligation in the Law There are numerous sources of the general legal obligation to maintain the confidentiality of medical information for adoles-cents (12,38). These sources include federal and state statutes,constitutional provisions, and regulations, policies, and proto-cols of federal and state agencies. Many, but not all, of theseprovisions have been interpreted in court decisions. In particu-lar, the concept of the \"mature minor \" has been developed by state and federal courts over the past several decades. The con-cept of the \"mature minor \" applies to those situations in which an adolescent has the capacity to give an informed consent andis being provided with non-complex care that is within themainstream of medical practice (39). Thus, the extent to whichthe law impedes or facilitates the protection of confidentialityin adolescent health care depends not only on the considerationof a broad range of overlapping and interconnected legal pro-visions, but also on an understanding of how those provisionshave been, or might in the future, be interpreted by the courts. Confidentiality and Consent The dual concepts of confidentiality and consent are inextrica- bly linked in the way the law affects the delivery of health careto adolescents who are younger than 18 years, the age of major-ity in almost every state. First, whenever consent for care isrequired from a parent or other third party, such as a court orchild welfare agency, it is not possible for complete confiden-tiality to be maintained. Second, some laws authorizing minorsto consent to their own care also require (or permit) that a par-ent or another person or entity be informed. Third, some lawsgoverning the confidentiality and disclosure of medical infor-mation explicitly rely on the medical consent laws in delineat-ing who controls the confidentiality of health information forminors, and even when they do not, the consent laws may pro-vide implicit support for confidentiality (40). Generally the law requires the consent of a parent when health care is provided to a minor child, although there are numerousexceptions to this requirement (12). Exceptions include med-ical emergencies, laws which specifically authorize minors toconsent to their own care and care for the \"mature minor. \" Consent may also be required from a third party such as a legalA-12guardian or conservator, for a severely mentally incapacitated person who is older than age 18 years. A legal basis for minors to consent to their own care also pro- vides a strong foundation for assuring that the care may be con-fidential. Every state has statutes which authorize minors toconsent to medical care under a variety of circumstances (41-43). In some statutes, the authorization is based on the minor 's status such as when the minor is emancipated, married, servingin the armed forces, pregnant, a parent, or a high school grad-uate; is living apart from parents; has attained a certain age; orhas qualified as a mature minor. In other statutes, the authori-zation to consent to health care is based on the type of careneeded, such as contraceptive services; pregnancy related care;diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted disease, humanimmunodeficiency virus or reportable diseases; treatment fordrug or alcohol problems; care related to a sexual assault; ormental health services. These laws reflect policy judgmentsthat certain minors have attained a level of maturity or autono-my which makes it appropriate for them to make their ownmedical decisions or that adolescents generally are unlikely toseek certain sensitive but essential services unless they are ableto do so independent of their parents. While not every state hasstatutes covering minors in each of the above categories or alltypes of \"sensitive \" services, every state has some of these pro- visions. Often the laws which authorize minors to consent to their own care also explicitly or implicitly restrict the disclosure of thatinformation without their permission. In addition, other statelaws, such as medical confidentiality statutes, sometimes referback to the minor consent provision, specifying that a minorwho has the right to consent also has the right to control thedisclosure of confidential information. Finally, the UnitedStates Supreme Court, in decisions about the extent to whichthe constitutional right of privacy protects minors, has made itclear that when a minor is sufficiently mature to give her ownconsent for an abortion she must also be able to choose to seekan abortion without the knowledge or involvement of her par-ents, albeit with a judicial order affirming her maturity (44). Confidentiality and Payment The relationship between confidentiality and payment for serv- ices is a very important consideration. The laws which author-ize minors to consent to their own care generally do not makeany provision for payment for services, and in some cases,actually relieve parents of financial liability. It may be difficult,even impossible, to assure full confidentiality unless an ado-lescent has a way to pay for services, or the services are pro-vided without charge. Generally, parents are financially liable for the health care services provided to their minor children. However, familiesoften rely on private or public health insurance to pay for partor all of the cost of care. Adolescents may be eligible to receivecertain services without charge or at an affordable cost in avariety of settings such as community or migrant health cen-ters, school-based and school-linked health clinics, and familyplanning clinics, among others. Legal provisions applicable tomany of these funding sources do provide some degree of con- fidentiality protection (43). In some cases, such as federallyfunded family planning clinics, there are sliding fee scalesbased on income, and adolescents are permitted to qualifybased upon their own income. In the absence of free care or theability to pay themselves, adolescents may have to rely ondirect payment for services by their parents or on utilizing theirfamily 's insurance coverage, if any. The necessity for a parent to sign an insurance claim in the case of private insurance, orto furnish a Medicaid card, may dramatically threaten the con-fidentiality of services. In such circumstances, the informalagreements reached between provider and the family withrespect to confidentiality assume increased importance. Protecting Confidentiality in Managed Care Settings In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in managed care, both as a service delivery method and as a financingmechanism. Increasing numbers of families - both those whoare covered by private insurance and those covered byMedicaid - are receiving their care in settings such as staffmodel health management organization (HMOs) or throughplans which use some form of managed care arrangement torestrict choice of providers, capitate costs, and perform gatekeeping functions. Each of these situations pose problems forprotecting a minor 's confidentiality. Some adolescents are con- cerned that when other family members receive care from thesame HMO or from the same primary care provider in a pre-ferred provider network, confidential information may beshared with parents. Y outh who receive care at sites such asschool-based health clinics which may subcontract with man-aged care entities, may be concerned about the extent to whichinformation communicated to the managed care plan willremain confidential. Unless adolescents can be assured thatconfidentiality will be maintained, or have the option of seek-ing care from other sources, they may avoid utilizing healthservices that would be otherwise accessible to them. Legal Limits of Confidentiality There are circumstances in which it is neither possible nor appropriate to maintain the confidentiality of information forlegal and other reasons. These include situations in which theadolescent poses a severe risk of harm to himself or herself orto others, and cases of suspected physical or sexual abuse forwhich there is a legal reporting requirement. In addition, aspreviously mentioned, there are situations in which the lawrequires a health professional to notify the parents when aminor has received care, even care based on her own consent.The most common situations in which this occurs is withrespect to abortion and drug or alcohol treatment. It should beremembered that under current constitutional law pertaining toabortion, if a state requires parental notification, it must alsopermit the minor to seek the alternative of court authorizationwithout parental involvement. Finally, when confidentialitymust be breached for ethical or legal reasons, the adolescentmust be so informed.A-12Medical Records Confidentiality protections apply to written information con- tained in medical records as well as to information that is com-municated verbally between an adolescent and a health careprofessional. Adult patients, and by extension, mature adoles-cents who are permitted to consent to their own health care,should be allowed to review their own medical records and toprotect their medical records from review by others. However,it is often more difficult to protect the confidentiality of writ-ten medical records than to do so for verbal communications-both as a practical matter, and as a result, of certain legalrequirements. As electronic medical records are becomingmore common, the task of protecting their confidentialitybecomes complex. Numerous legal requirements apply to medical records; many of these embody the same principles of confidentiality that alsoapply to verbal communications. There are, however, specificprovisions that pertain to written records, in general, andheightened protections that apply to particular types of recordsrelated to substance abuse or mental health treatment (45).While basic rules of confidentiality apply to medical records,numerous exceptions require disclosure to a variety of fundingentities such as Medicare and Medicaid, to other governmentalagencies such as law enforcement, or to peer review organiza-tions (45). In addition, with the permission of a patient or legal-ly authorized representative, medical records can be disclosedto a wide variety of persons and entities, particularly insurers(45). Nevertheless a wide range of civil liability and criminalpenalties may apply to the unauthorized disclosure of confi-dential records (45). The same basic framework applies to medical records docu- menting health care provided to adolescents. However, whenthose adolescents are minors and the care involves sensitiveissues such as pregnancy, Sexually transmitted diseases, sub-stance abuse, or mental health concerns, disclosure of therecords may be subject to specific legal requirements that bal-ance-more or less successfully-the interests of adolescents andtheir parents. For example, some states have enacted specificprovisions that give minor patients the right to decide whetheror not to release medical records that pertain to care for whichthey can give their own consent (46,47). In some cases theselaws even require that parents 'requests to review such records be refused if the minor objects (46). This is not the case inevery state or for all sensitive services, however, and evenwhere such requirement applies, a parent might be able to seeka court order to compel release of the records. Therefore, it isessential to be aware of the requirements of state law. As a practical matter, most hospitals and outpatient facilities follow a standardized policy that requires authorization from aparent or guardian for the release of records if the patient isbelow the age of 18 years. In most cases, with parent orguardian authorization, records are released without requiringthe permission of the minor adolescent patient or even if theadolescent objects (45). This usually means that a parent orguardian, possibly even including a non-custodial parent, isallowed to review the medical records of a minor child. In somecases such a policy would be consistent with state law; in oth-ers there might be a legal basis for modifying the policy to entrust greater authority to the minor patient to decide whetherrecords should be released. Health care professionals who treat adolescents should be aware that protecting the confidentiality of medical records fortheir patients who are below the age of 18 years is far more dif-ficult than protecting verbal communications. Practitionersshould review all requests for disclosure of records related totheir adolescent patients and should consider that sensitive ordamaging information might be revealed if records are trans-ferred. The clinician who cares for adolescents should seek toensure that hospital or clinic policies prevent release of recordswithout the permission of the treating professional. Whendisclosure of records is sought, treating professionals shoulderr on the side of seeking the adolescent patient 's permission before releasing the information. In some cases, such as report-ing of child abuse pursuant to legal requirements, the caregiv-er may not have discretion to refuse disclosure. However, insuch cases ethical principles would require that the mandatoryrelease of information be explained to the patient. Whenever aclinician feels that releasing records might result in harm to theadolescent patient, consultation with legal counsel should besought. Practical Issues Working to support a confidential relationship with an adoles- cent in a health care setting requires commitment. This sectionwill review some practical issues and the implementation ofconfidentiality. At an appropriate age for the patient, the health provider should set forward a \"contract, \" either verbal, or in writing, so that the patient and parent understand the concept of confidentiality.Most providers discuss this at the beginning of an encounterand reinforce it at later encounters. Some compose a letter topatients and parents at a certain milestone age (12 or 14 years)and describe the changes that adolescent status will confer tothe clinician/patient/parent relationship and how it will affectoffice procedures. The contract should clarify the basic meaning of confidential- ity. For younger adolescents it is necessary to describe insimple language that it means: \"What we talk about will be pri- vate; I will not discuss it with anyone else. \" Some adolescents may assume that if you are discussing confidentiality, you mustassume they have \"secrets. \" Therefore, it is useful to say, \"Our discussion will be private and confidential, even if you don 't mind your parents knowing about anything that we talk about. \" The conditional nature of confidentiality should be discussed with the adolescent patient. The risk of imminent physicalharm or suspected abuse are necessary exceptions to the assur-ance of confidentiality. It is helpful to use examples that makethis understandable. For example, \"Everything will be confi- dential unless something happens, such as if you becomesuicidal, or you have a severe problem for which you cannothelp yourself. \" It should be mentioned that clarifying the confidential natureA-12of the discussion is not a time consuming task. Most providers learn by experience to do this quickly and efficiently. Althoughthis confidential contract is necessary to clarify routinely, ado-lescents learn to trust the health provider by more than the ini-tial discussion. Every aspect of the relationship, from the firstdiscussion through meeting with the parent after the teenager 's examination, to the follow-up phone call, if needed, will showthe teen whether the provider can be trusted to follow the con-fidential agreement. The parent or parents might wish to give information to the cli- nician without the teenager in the room. The provider mightlearn important information from an adult about a behavior thatthe teen is minimizing, hiding or in denial about. It is best toconduct these meetings after discussing the ground rules withthe teen and parent. The provider should attempt to minimizethe numbers of these private encounters with parents and toconfine them as much as possible to the early stages of treat-ment. For most encounters, the goal is that everything that con-cerns the parents should be discussed in their presence. Thehealth professional attempts to improve communication ratherthan set up separate relationships between physician and parent.This process helps adolescent patients recognize that the care iscentered upon their needs and that they will not be excluded. Ifa provider accepts a parent 's request to talk apart from their ado- lescent, the discussion should be kept confidential. Health providers have recognized that verbal information is easier to keep confidential than information on the patient 's chart. Some state laws mandate release of records to adults whorequest them. Various approaches have been taken to protectingwritten information. Some providers have created systems ofabbreviations for commonly recorded bits of sensitive informa-tion; for example, \"SU\" to denote : sexually active; unprotected intercourse. Others have kept separate written or computerrecords with the most sensitive information recorded. It shouldbe remembered that \"shadow \" files are legally retrievable in the same manner as the standard medical record, if discovered. Forpractical purposes, most health professionals record the impor-tant points of information on the chart in the standard fashion.Every request for records should come to the provider for per-mission. If there is information that might harm the adolescentif released, the advocacy effort to block the release can be start-ed by postponing signature for the release and seeking legalsupport.

This report reviews adolescents 'need for confidential health services and major barriers to confidential care including the prerogative to provide informed consent for medical treatment and payment for health services.Privacy is generally acknowledged to be essential to a patient 's trust in a health care provider and to a patient 's willingness to supply information candidly. Recent exceptions to the traditional parental consent requirementhave been made to consider adolescents in the armed forces, those living away from home or those consideredemancipated minors. The legal need for parental consent triangulates the adolescent patient-physician relation-ship by bringing a third party into health care decision making. Confidential health care may ultimately becompromised by economic realities. Few adolescents can afford to pay for their own medical care, and fewphysicians can provide subsidized care on a regular basis. The article recommends that 1) providers reaffirmthat confidential care for adolescents is critical to health improvement, 2) physicians involve parents in themedical care of their teens, 3) physicians discuss their policies about confidentiality with parents and the ado-lescent patient, as well as conditions under which confidentiality would be abrogated, 4) health care payersdevelop a method of listing of services that preserves confidentiality for adolescents, and 5) state medical soci-eties review laws on consent and confidential care for adolescents and eliminate laws that restrict the availabili-ty of confidential care. 2. Ford, Carol A., MD, et al. \"Foregone Health Care Among Adolescents, \" JAMA V ol. 282 No. 23, December 1999. No annual national population estimates exist of the number of adolescents who think they need but do not receive health care or of their risk of health problems. Ford, et al. describe the proportion of young people whoreport foregone health care each year and the influence of sociodemographic factors, insurance status, pasthealth care, and health risks/behaviors on the foregone care. Cross-sectional analyses of data from the 1995National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health showed that on average, 18.7% of adolescents reported fore-gone health care within the past year. Factors associated with decreased risk of foregone care included continu-ous private or public insurance, or a physical examination within the past year. Factors associated withincreased risk of foregone care included older age, minority race/ethnicity, single-parent household, and disabil-ity. In addition, adolescents who reported daily cigarette use, frequent alcohol use, and sexual intercourse weremore likely to report foregone care. The results of this study suggest that adolescents who forego care are atincreased risk of physical and mental health problems. If health care professionals are to address major causesof adolescent morbidity and mortality, strategies are needed to decrease foregone care. Factors that influenceadolescents to forego care must be considered when designing systems to address adolescents 'unique health needs. 3. Ford, Carol A., MD, et al. \"Influence of Physician Confidentiality Assurances on Adolescents 'Willingness to Disclose Information and Seek Future Health Care, \" JAMA V ol. 278 No.12, September 1997. As part of a larger study on asymptomatic genital Chlamydia, Ford, et al. examines adolescents 'willingness to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) under varying confidentiality conditions. Participants A-13 Adolescent Provider Toolkit Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002A-13 Adolescent Provider Toolkitbetween the age of 15 to 24 completed an anonymous written survey measuring willingness to provide speci- men for STD testing as part of routine health care under three different confidentiality conditions: if their par-ents 1) would find out; 2) might find out; or 3) would not find out that they were tested. Of 1,114 subjectsenrolled in the larger study, 72% consented to participate in this questionnaire. Nearly all (92%) reported theywould agree to STD testing if their parents would not find out. Significantly fewer would agree to testing linkedto potential (38%) or definite (35%) parental notification. More male than female subjects were willing toagree to testing linked to potential or definite parental notification (49.5% vs. 33%). It is significant that thevast majority of sexually active adolescents report they would agree only to confidential STD testing. Privacyconcerns may place infected female adolescents at risk of complications. Since most adolescents receive routinehealth care in private practice or HMO settings, confidential testing should be available at these sites. If physi-cians 'abilities to provide confidential testing are limited because of threats to privacy associated with billing and reimbursement, changes to the systems will be necessary. 4. Hofmann, Adele D., MD. \"A Rational Policy Toward Consent and Confidentiality in Adolescent Health Care, \" Journal of Adolescent Health Care 1:9-17, 1980. Hofmann 's review examines current conflicts surrounding consent and confidentiality in adolescent health care. She contends that rules governing consent and confidentiality must respond to the unique developmental statusof youth as individuals who are increasingly capable of exercising rational choice and giving informed consent,yet still need flexibly proffered guidance and support by parents and/or other adults. Specific policy recommen-dations include: (a) the provision of options for adolescents to obtain confidential health services as necessaryfor health protection and/or as suitable for their level of maturity; (b) the establishment of counseling standardsthat require confidential services to adolescents to include developmentally appropriate guidance and supportrendered by professionals trained in adolescent health; (c) the encouragement of adolescents receiving confi-dential care to consider whether or not they should involve their parents, recognizing that most young peopleare advantaged thereby; and (d) when confidentiality is not an issue, the active participation of adolescents intheir health care decisions are affirmed by obtaining their informed consent. 5. Reddy, D., et al. \"Effect of Mandatory Parental Notification on Adolescent Girls 'Use of Sexual Health Care Services, \" JAMA V ol. 288, No. 6, August 2002. A study was performed to determine the effect of mandatory parental notification for prescribed contraceptives on use of sexual health care services by adolescent girls. 950 girls younger than 18 seeking services at all 33Planned Parenthood family planning clinics in Wisconsin were surveyed. 59% indicated that they would stopusing all sexual health care services, delay testing or treatment for HIV or other STDs, or discontinue use ofspecific (but not all) sexual health care services if their parents were informed that they were seeking prescribedcontraceptives. Results of the study showed that mandatory parental notification of prescribed contraceptiveswould impede girls 'use of sexual health care services, potentially increasing teen pregnancies and the spread of STDs. Adolescent Health Working Group, 2002FEDERAL MEDICAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS (\"HIPAA RULES \"): A BRIEF OVERVIEW Prepared by the Center for Adolescent Health & the Law What are the federal medical privacy regulations? The \"Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information \" are federal medical privacy regulations (sometimes referred to as the \"HIPAA rules \") that broadly regulate access to and disclosure of confidential medical information. These regulations were promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) pursuantto the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). When were the regulations issued? Proposed regulations were initially published in November 1999. Following the submission of thousands of com- ments, a final rule was published on December 28, 2000. The effective date of this final rule was postponed untilApril 14, 2001. Proposed modifications were published in March 2002. Following a public comment period, finalmodifications were issued on August 14, 2002. What is the scope of the regulations? The regulations address a broad range of issues related to the privacy of individuals 'health information. They create new rights for individuals to have access to their health information and medical records and also specify when anindividual 's consent is required for disclosure of their confidential health information. The regulations also contain provisions that are specific to the health information of minor children. Who must comply with the regulations? The regulations apply to \"covered entities, \" which include health plans, health care providers, and health care clear- inghouses. According to the way each of these is defined in the regulations, the vast majority of health care profes-sionals who provide care to adolescents will be required to comply with the regulations. When must the new rules be implemented? Large health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses must comply with the rules by April 14, 2003. Small health plans must comply with the rules by April 14, 2004. What do the new regulations mean for adolescents? The new regulations contain numerous provisions that will affect the confidentiality of information regarding health care provided to adolescents. Most of the general provisions of the regulations are relevant. Adolescents who are age18 or older are adults and have the same rights under the regulations as other adults. In addition, there are provisionsof the regulations that address the specific issues related to confidentiality of information for minors, including ado-lescents who are under the age of 18 and not emancipated. This summary provides only a brief introduction to theprovisions pertinent to minors. Detailed information regarding those provisions and information regarding other pro-visions of the regulations is available from other sources. What are the specific requirements for adolescents who are minors? Parents (including guardians and persons acting in loco parentis) generally are considered the personal representa- tives of and have control over and access to protected health information for their unemancipated minor children. Inspecific circumstances, parents are not necessarily the personal representatives of their minor children. When is a parent not the personal representative of his or her minor children? A parent is not necessarily the personal representative of his or her minor child in one of three specific circum- stances; (1) when the minor is legally able to consent for the care for himself or herself; or (2) the minor may legally A-14 A-14receive the care without the consent of a parent, and the minor or someone else has consented to the care; or (3) a parent has assented to an agreement of confidentiality between the health care provider and the minor. In these cir-cumstances, the minor may exercise many of the rights under the regulations. In these circumstances, the minor alsomay choose to have the parent act as the personal representative or not. What happens when a parent is not the personal representative? When a parent is not the personal representative of the minor, the minor may exercise most of the same rights as an adult under the regulations. With respect to the question of whether a parent who is not the personal representative ofthe minor may have access to the minor 's confidential information ( \"protected health information \"), the regulations defer to state or other law. If state or other law explicitly requires or permits information to be disclosed to a parent,the regulations allow a health care provider to comply with that law and to disclose the information. If state or otherlaw prohibits disclosure of information to a parent, the regulations do not allow a health care provider to disclose it.If state or other law is silent on the question, a health care provider has discretion to determine whether or not togrant access to a parent to the protected health information. What do the regulations mean for health care providers in California? California has numerous laws that allow minors to give their own consent for health care. In addition, California has laws that specify the circumstances under which parents may or may not have access to information regarding thecare for which minors may give their own consent. The federal privacy regulations would defer to those Californialaws. For adults, including adolescents age 18 or older, the federal regulations defer to state laws that providestronger privacy protections than the federal rules do. Many other provisions of the regulations would remain appli-cable to health care providers in California. What happens if a parent is suspected of domestic violence, abuse, or neglect? When a parent is suspected of domestic violence, abuse, or neglect of a child, including an adolescent, a health care provider may limit the parent 's access to and control over protected health information about the child by not treating the parent as the personal representative of the child. Where is additional information available that explains the regulations? Implementation of the regulations is being overseen by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS. OCR has established a web site with comprehensive information about the implementation of the regulations:http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/. The Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University also maintains a web site withextensive information and links regarding the regulations: http://www.healthprivacy.org/newsletter-url2305/newslet-ter-url_show.htm?doc_id=33936. What are the official citations for the regulations? Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information: Final Rule, 65 Federal Register 82461 (Dec. 28, 2000); and Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information: Final Rule, 67 Federal Register53182 (Aug. 14, 2002). The original rule and the modifications will be merged and codified at 45 Code of FederalRegulations Parts 160 and 164. In the meantime, the August 2002 modifications must be read together with theDecember 2000 version of the rules to understand the full range of what is required. How does a health care provider know what is required? This overview does not provide legal advice. Health care providers should consult with legal counsel to be sure they are aware of the specific requirements of the regulations that apply to them and how to comply with those require-ments.
