OUR CHIROPRACTIC CARE & RECOMMENDATIONS Our care and recommendations are based on the premise that: - The balance of your spine and nervous system is crucial to your overall health. - Pain and poor posture are sometimes symptoms of imbalance in the spine and nervous system (subluxation). - Chiropractic adjustments can improve the balance of your spine and nervous system, decrease your pain and increase your chances of better overall health, now and in the future. - Most people need support (Chiropractic or other bodyworkers) to keep their spine and nervous system balanced. - To get well and stay well, our recommendations focus on balancing four areas; Nutrition, Structure, Exercise, Well-being. Our bodies were designed to function for a lifestyle that was 50,000 years ago. At Chiropractic Balance have developed ways to adapt how we move, eat and think in the modern world to be more congruent with these ancestral ways. Common Symptoms Chiropractic May Help...

By aligning the spine and correcting issues with posture, balance, and correcting their proprioception, which affects issues within the inner ear and affects our spatial awareness, chiropractors can help reduce joint pain and soreness in the surrounding muscle and tissue. Because chiropractic care is non-invasive, it is often seen as a preferred alternative to medication or invasive surgery because it can help many patients find solace from their joint and muscle pain.
