We, as Naturopathic Doctors, look deeper into the processes happening in the body and use natural medicines to help facilitate healing in the most gentle way possible. Our goal is to teach you how to achieve your best health and help prevent chronic disease. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) have a scientific background with at least 8 years of post secondary education and rigorous examination to qualify for licensure. All of the NDs at Serenity Health are provincially licensed and regulated and therefore covered by extended medical plans. We study many forms of natural medicine and aim to support the body naturally towards health and away from disease. We use treatments such as botanical medicines, vitamins and supplements, acupuncture, homeopathy, therapeutic diets and lifestyle changes. Some NDs at Serenity Health also perform other therapies such as Bowen therapy which can be used for healing injuries and reducing stress levels, and injection therapies such as B Vitamin injections or IV therapy. We spend time with you to really listen and understand your goals of working together. The first visit is an hour long to go through your detailed medical history and explore many areas of your life that may be contributing to your condition and overall health. Follow up visits are typically 30 min long and we follow up on progress with your health concerns and adjust the plan as necessary. We don't just talk about one concern per visit because many times your health concerns are related and necessary to understanding the greater picture. Naturopathic doctors have a focus on prevention and can help people with chronic conditions by using natural medicines and supporting you to make diet and lifestyle changes. Although genetics play a role in our health we believe there is so much we can do to alter the expression of genes and prevent disease. can teach you what changes are beneficial specifically for you and your condition and help empower you to incorporate these changes into your lifestyle. The Naturopathic Doctors at Serenity Health are on their names to learn more about them and their individual areas of focus. "}
