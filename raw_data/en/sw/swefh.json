Guidance sessions also aim to enhance a person's innate ability to connect with and be guided by their Higher Consciousness and the divine wisdom and light of the Universe. Here's what clients have to say: Healing Sessions Healing sessions are for individuals who are experiencing physical pain or chronic illness (e.g. Autoimmune disorders, certain types of cancer, back pain and other chronic illness). These physical challenges are often rooted in spiritual energetic-emotional challenges that often need to be identified and healed so that complete healing and resolution of the physical body can occur. Oftentimes, the appearance of physical challenges in the body are a result of spiritual energetic-emotional challenges that were present prior to physical symptoms appearing. Thus, the physical challenge is often the symptom of the real issue, lesson, learning, or message that your energetic-emotional body and the universe have been trying to help you see and learn. These spiritual energetic-emotional healing sessions aim to address the root of the physical challenges in the body and may involve [DNA Healing](dna-healing-description) (ancestral and/or past life). Therefore, the initial 1 hour intuitive guidance session is an assessment and treatment planning session. Dr. Kaulana will share messages from his spirit guides identifying the spiritual energetic-emotional roots and areas for healing and discuss with you the healing protocols and process. Some healing may begin in the first session. After the initial session, additional healing sessions may be needed, with each additional session on average being 2 hrs in length, possibly occurring weekly, with some follow-up in between sessions. After completion of the healing sessions, follow-up coaching sessions are encouraged to support the healing, learning and practices identified during the healing process. PERMISSION PROTOCOL: All requests go through a permission protocol, which involves Dr. Kaulana review your request with his guides. Please know that there may be times that he is unable to accommodate your request for a session. This does not mean you are unable to be helped or to heal, it often means that they are not the most appropriate team to help you at this moment in time. We encourage you to find the person(s) who are meant to be with you on your healing journey. This protocol applies to all clients (new and current). DISCLAIMER & IMPORTANT NOTE: All guidance provided is not a replacement for psychotherapy or medical treatment / advice. If you have any health (physical / emotional) issues, seek advice from a qualified medical professional such as your Primary Care Physician (PCP), Psychologist, or Psychotherapist. Intuitive guidance sessions will provide you with additional / complementary spiritual insight, support, and guidance, but it is not a replacement for therapy or medical treatments. Here's what clients have to say: Policies If you are unable to make it to your scheduled session, please inform Kaulana at least 24 hours before your session to cancel or reschedule.
