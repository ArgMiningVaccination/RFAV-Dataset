This medication is also used to prevent [malaria](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/malaria). This medication is known as a [tetracycline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5919/tetracycline+oral/details) antibiotic. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.This antibiotic treats only bacterial infections. It will not work for [viral infections](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections) (such as [common cold](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-or-flu-quiz), [flu](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-or-flu-quiz)). Using any antibiotic when it is not needed can cause it to not work for future infections. How to use doxycycline hyclate oral Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions) before you start taking [doxycycline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14449/doxycycline+oral/details) and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. This [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) is best taken by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/anatomy-of-the-mouth) on an empty [stomach](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-stomach) (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) as directed by your doctor, usually 1 or 2 times daily. Take this medication with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) unless directed otherwise. If [stomach](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/rm-quiz-surprising-stomach-facts) upset occurs, taking it with food or milk may help. However, doxycycline may not work as well if you take it with food or milk (or anything high in [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1575/calcium+oral/details) - more details below ), so ask your doctor or pharmacist if you may take it that way. Do not lie down for at least 10 minutes after taking this medication. Take this medication 2 to 3 hours before or after taking any products containing aluminum, [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-gourmet-calcium), iron, [magnesium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-magnesium), zinc, or [bismuth](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8061/bismuth+oral/details) didanosine solution, [quinapril](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6254/quinapril+oral/details), [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/vitamin-expert)/ [minerals](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/vitamin-mineral-sources), dairy products (such as milk, yogurt), and [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/calcium-food-calculator/default.htm)-enriched juice.

Continue to take this medication daily while in the malarious area. Upon returning home, you should keep taking this medication for 4 more weeks. If you are unable to finish this course of doxycycline, contact your doctor. If you are using the liquid form of this medication, shake the bottle well before each dose.
