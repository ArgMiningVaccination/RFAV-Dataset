Our principal focus continues to be solving the significant problems in equine musculoskeletal disease as can be seen in this report but we also continue to investigate comparative disease problems and questions relevant to human joint disease including techniques and devices for human osteoarthritis and articular cartilage repair when the technique can potentially benefit the horse. The increased number of translational projects and funding support from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and human orientated industry partners support our mission of helping both horses and humans. As part of that evolution the big news for 2016 is that we completed funding for what is now going to be called the Translational Medicine Institute (TMI) (previously described as the Institute of Biological Translational Therapies but people were having difficulty with this name and understanding what we did). In 2015 we reported that we received a matching challenge of one half the cost of the building (then estimated at $65 million), followed by a $10 million commitment from Colorado State University (per President Dr. Tony Frank) and $20 million from another donor who at that time wished to remain anonymous. Since then, her name has been disclosed. It is Abigail K. Kawananakoa who has been a long term client of mine and previously donated a University Endowed Chair in Musculoskeletal Integrative Therapies. After Abigail's gift of $20 million we were left with a $2.5 million difference which has now been obtained from other sources. As I write this preface for our 2016 report in September 2017, we held the groundbreaking for the TMI on June 2, 2017 and there will be more news on that next year in our 2017 report. The vision of the TMI is to investigate next generation remedies based on living cells and their products including patient derived stem cells to treat musculoskeletal disease and other ailments and to literally be able to carry basic science discoveries in the institute all the way to bedside with entrepreneurial and regulatory abilities within the TMI. At the ORC we have developed expertise in analyzing and developing medical treatments for animal patients, and then providing knowledge gained to boost human medical advancements. This progression is known as translational medicine and is successful because of similarities in animal and human physiology and disease. Our being able to raise the funding for the TMI building in a two and one half year period is truly PREFACE transformational and will take us to a higher level. It is also an endorsement of what we have achieved already. Those achievements have come from a combination of ingenuity and work of our faculty, research associates, graduate students, veterinary students and undergraduate students as well as terrific help from our donors. In 2016 there was also major progress towards building a new Equine Veterinary Teaching Hospital and this will be located on South Campus east of the Orthopaedic Research Center buildings and north of the new TMI building. A lead gift of $10 million has been obtained from the Johnson Family Foundation and another $20.3 million identified from state funds. Plans are underway again with Tetrad (the developer \"Our principal focus continues to be solving the significant problems in equine musculoskeletal disease\" continued... Renderings of Translational Medicine Institute... 2 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 3for TMI) to build a brand new conventional hospital and then also renovate and enlarge the present Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center into a full service sports medicine center focused on rehabilitation of horses with musculoskeletal problems. Dr. Chris Kawcak has been appointed Director of the Equine Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Dr. Melissa King is in charge of the new rehabilitation endeavor. Renovation and occupancy of the Gail Holmes building as a sports medicine and rehabilitation center is planned after November 30, 2018 when we have been told we can occupy TMI. Research endeavors applicable to sports medicine and rehabilitation will be retained within the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center. As part of the imaging development progress made (albeit a little slowly) on developing a CT that will image the standing limb (the earlier unit has a circular ring which will only allow standing imaging of the head and neck). The Louis L. Borick Foundation is providing $500,000 of their total donation of $850,000 to allow us to partner with an Italian company to develop a prototype of the standing CT and this development process has commenced. Once we have the prototype we will then be ready to manufacture such equipment to be sold to equine veterinarians throughout the world. The people of our program are our strength and we added two faculty members to the program this year, Dr. Kurt Selberg who is a Board Certified Radiologist/Imager and we now have built the program to include two full time equine imagers, Drs. Myra Barrett and Kurt Selberg which is unique and a particular strength. Funding within the Kenneth Atkinson College Endowed Chair has been able to provide some of the financial support for these additions. Dr. Katie Seabaugh fills the newly created fourth position in Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation. Katie was a product of our surgical residency program and since becoming Board Certified in Surgery has also become Board Certified in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation. Dr. Ellison Aldrich completed her surgical residency in 2015 and is now a senior lecturer at the veterinary school at Massey University in New Zealand. Dr. Philippe Manchon finished his residency program in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation July 1, 2016 and has moved back to Australia to take up a position in Scone. Our new resident in Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation is Dr. Jodie Daglish and she has become an intern in imaging within the program. Because of the demand of expertise in ultrasound examination we select an intern as first year of a four year program with the latter three years being the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Program. The internship mainly involves training in diagnostic imaging and, in particular, ultrasonography. Other accomplishments at the ORC over the past year are detailed in this report. This is the second single year report because of the amount of information we have. As stated previously, our accomplishments in this report could not be achieved without our team of faculty and staff as well as the excellent support of equine funding agencies (Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation, American Quarter Horse Association and United States Equestrian Federation), industry funding, NIH funding and individual donors. With this help we continue to achieve our goals and also the new ones of TMI are particularly exciting. Another minor event that happened in 2016 is that in August I moved into transitional retirement. This involved my appointing Dr. David Frisbie as Director of Research for the ORC as well as Interim Director of Operations for the TMI and Dr. Chris Kawcak extended his duties as Director of the Equine Veterinary Teaching Hospital to include the Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Program. Chris and Dave have been with me 25 and 24 years respectively and were ready to take over these important leadership roles and are doing well. I committed to Dr. Tony Frank, the President of CSU, Best wishes, Wayne McIlwraith for four more years in transitional retirement. So far people have a smile on their face when they ask me, \"How's transitional retirement going?\" knowing that I'm doing very well at markedly lowering my work presence or consequently not increasing my leisure time. Retirement is definitely a work in progress but most of the reasons for continuing to be \"flat-out\" is how much is going on as we add the new tier of the TMI and expand our research as well as our Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Program. It has been a great 37 years for me at CSU and would not have been so without the terrific support of the faculty and staff at the ORC as well as the support of our research funders and donors. 4

This includes the development of novel imaging techniques (present and future), body fluid markers, and also molecular monitoring. The uses of these early diagnostic techniques include: a. Evaluation of the pathogenesis of bone and joint disease b. Early detection of disease processes c. Monitoring of therapy , with the long-term goal of preventing severe arthritis or failure This focus includes evaluation of biologic inhibitors of critical mediators in joint disease, novel protein therapies, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), gene therapy techniques, and mesenchymal stem cell therapies.These investigations use molecular tools such as reverse transcriptase PCR for evaluation of tissues in various stages of the disease, biomechanical and modeling studies, and imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), to monitor early events in bone disease. These include objective assessment of integrative therapies, including manipulation and acupuncture for management of musculoskeletal disease and pain, as well as rehabilitative techniques of swimming, underwater treadmilling, and hyperbaric therapy. 2016 REPORT 11The Musculoskeletal Research Program has been designated as a Program of Research and Scholarly Excellence at Colorado State University (initially designated in 2004, renewed in 2008, 2012, and again in 2014). THE MUSCULOSKELETAL RESEARCH PROGRAM COVERS ALL ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH AT COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY AND INCLUDES: 1. Orthopaedic R esearch Center, including Orthopaedic Bioengineering Research Laboratory 2. Preclinical Surgical Research Laboratory 3. Orthopaedic OncologyMUSCULOSKELETAL RESEARCH PROGRAM 2016 REPORT 13SCHOOL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING Most of the faculty within the Musculoskeletal Research Program are also faculty in the School of Biomedical Engineering. Colorado State University's School of Biomedical Engineering (SBME) was formed in March 2007 to address society's needs in bioengineering, one of the fastest emerging areas of scientific discov-ery. The SBME is an interdisciplinary program built on strong faculty and research programs in the Colleges of Applied Human Sciences, Engineering, Natural Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Drs. Christian Puttlitz, Tammy Donahue, Wayne McIlwraith, David Frisbie, Chris Kawcak, Seth Donahue, Laurie Goodrich, Kevin Haussler, Kirk McGilvray and John Kisiday of the Orthopaedic Research Center are core faculty members of the program in biomedical engineering research, which is rapidly expanding to all areas of human health. New technologies being developed at CSU are enabling people to continue active and healthy lifestyles. SBME students have the opportunity to collaborate with fac- ulty from these four colleges and eleven departments, including the highly ranked Professional Veterinary Medicine program. SBME now offers bachelor of science (B.S.), master of engineering (M.E.), master of science (M.S.), and doc-tor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. The M.S. and Ph.D. programs focus on three main research areas: bio-mechanics and biomaterials; molecular, cellular, and tissue engineering; and medical diagnostics, devices, and imaging. Within these three areas, students par-ticipate in cutting-edge research from therapies and imaging modalities for fighting cancer to improving equipment used in open heart surgery. In order to allow flexibility to explore the multiple research pos-sibilities, fully funded (stipend and tuition) lab rotation fellowships are available for first-year Ph.D. students. 2016 REPORT 15GAIL HOLMES (CHAIR) Quarter Horse Owner and Breeder RICK ARTHUR, D.V.M.

Neil David Broom, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Auckland Professor Neil Broom's initial training in metallurgy has been applied successfully to experimental tissue me-chanics that has earned him an international reputation in this field. His earlier aortic valve research fundamen-tally altered processing procedures in the bio-prostheticvalve industry world-wide. Neil's key achievements in joint-tissue research include the development of new collagen-based physical models for cartilage to account for the structural weakening occurring in the cartilage matrix arising from both early degeneration and trauma.He has provided rigorous, experimentally-based anal-yses of both the role of the strain-limiting articular sur-face, and the biomechanically critical junction region between the compliant cartilage and bone in its physio-logical state. He and his team have produced evidence of primary bone formation beneath the still-intact carti-lage adjacent to lesion sites thus clarifying the elusive pre-osteoarthritic state. His research has produced a structural gold standard for the international communi- ty of 'tissue engineering' researchers, challenging them to 'engineer' matrices that are biomechanically viable. Neil's most recent research has focused on the interver-tebral disc (IVD). He and his team have developed new structural insights into the micro-anatomy of the disc wall to explain the mechanical basis of annular disrup-tion and prolapse, these being linked to two of the most prevalent and debilitating clinical conditions of the mod-ern world - low back and radicular pain. He has shown experimentally how nucleus material interacts with the disc wall and endplate, and how combinations of flexion, torsion, and rate of loading can cause nuclear fragments to migrate out through the wall and cause prolapse. This pioneering research is the first published integration of disc micro-architecture, functional posture, and loading rate, with susceptibility to failure. Neil is an elected Fel-low of the Royal Society of NZ, and in 2013 was awarded the Society's MacDarmid Medal for his contributions to research that most benefits human health.Frank Barry, Ph.D., Professor of Cellular Therapy at the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI), National Uni- versity of Ireland Galway. Frank Barry directs a large group of researchers who focus on the development of new repair strategies in stem cell therapy and gene therapy in orthopaedics. Previously, he was Director of Arthritis Research at Osiris Therapeutics in Baltimore, Md., and a Research Fellow at Shriners Hospital for Children, Tampa, Fla. He has contributed to the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine by developing innovative and successful cellular therapies for the treatment of acute joint injury and arthritic disease. This has in-cluded the generation of a large body of new data in ground-breaking preclinical studies, and has led to the first phase of clinical testing of mesenchymal stem cells in clinical trials for joint injury. In a career that has spanned both industry and academic research, he has been a driver in the development of cellular therapy as a biological repair strategy. It is his belief that the application of new technologies in regenerative med-icine, including cellular therapy, gene therapy, growth factor augmentation, implantable scaffolds, and nano-materials, will have a profound impact in Orthopaedics.

Dr. Riley then worked at briefly at Iowa State University and in private practice during which time he became a Diplomate in the American College of Veteri- nary Surgeons. He joined the faculty at the Atlantic Vet- erinary College, Canada, in 1999 rising to the rank of professor, and completed an MBA course in Innovation Management in 2007 at the University of Melbourne. In 2010 he accepted an appointment as the inaugural professor and chair of Equine Health the University of Adelaide, establishing the equine curriculum, teaching and veterinary hospital facilities. He commenced his current position at Massey University in 2013 during the veterinary program's 50th Anniversary year. Dr. Ri- ley has focused his research on the development of biomedical tests for animal diseases using the emerg- ing technologies of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), op-toacoustics, and bioinformatics. He established the first FTIR laboratory of its kind in Canada, developed to investigate the veterinary potential biomedical in-frared spectroscopy. He has continued this work with ~US $6.7 million in funded projects to date. Dr. Riley has a special interest in biomarkers for orthopaedic disease, and humoral immunity, but is also interested exploring the full potential of emerging technologies as they apply to veterinary and comparative medicine. Dr. Riley partnered with the Orthopaedic Research Center and the Institute for Biodiagnostics, National Research Council of Canada, to develop the first FTIR test for equine traumatic arthritis and osteochondrosis. More recently, he has collaborated with Prof. Sheila Laverty at the University of Montreal and Prof. James Cook atthe University of Missouri to examine and characterize this technology further in rabbit and canine models of orthopaedic disease. He looks further to continued col-laboration and advances in this new field of research. Currently, he is continuing work with the carpal chip fracture model established at the ORS.Roger RCVS and European Specialist in Equine Surgery (Ortho- paedics); President, International Veterinary Regenerative Medicine Society Roger Smith qualified as a veterinary surgeon from Cam- bridge University in 1987 and, after two years in prac- tice, returned to academia to undertake further clinical training as a resident in Equine Studies at the Royal Vet-erinary College. Following his residency, he undertook a three-year research project culminating in the award of a Ph.D. for his studies on the extracellular matrix of equine tendon. He remained at the Royal Veterinary Col- lege, first as a lecturer in equine surgery, then as senior lecturer in equine surgery before his appointment to a professorship in December 2003. He holds the Diploma of Equine Orthopaedics from the Royal College of Veter- inary Surgeons, and is both a Diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Surgeons and a Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons Specialist in Equine Surgery. He is also an Associate member of the European College of Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging and Fellow of the High-er Education Academy. He currently divides his time equally between running a specialist orthopaedic ser- vice within the Royal Veterinary College and continuing to direct research into equine tendon disease. His main area of research is understanding the pathogenesis of tendinopathy but also has projects investigating the ep-idemiology of tendon disease in the horse, the develop- ment of a serological assay for tendonitis, and stem cell therapy for tendons. J. Richard Steadman, M.D.; Founder and Managing Partner, The Steadman Clinic; and Founder and Co-Chair- man, Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, Colo. Dr. Steadman graduated from the University of Tex- as Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. Following internship, two years in the U.S. Army, and an ortho- paedics residency at Charity Hospital in New Orle-ans, La., Dr. Steadman moved to Lake Tahoe, Calif., where he practiced orthopaedics with increasing emphasis on the treatment of knee disorders. While living there, he was named chief physician and med- ical chairman for the United States Ski Team. During his time at Lake Tahoe, Dr. Steadman developed special surgical techniques which allowed several ski team members to return to competition and win Olympic medals and championships. At Lake Tahoe, Dr. Steadman started a non-profit sports medicine foundation in order to conduct research in knee sur- gery and rehabilitation projects. That organization exists today as the Steadman Philippon Research In- stitute in Vail, Colo. In 1990, Dr. Steadman moved to Vail, Colo. By this time, Dr. Steadman had limited his practice to the surgical and conservative treatment of knee disorders. Today, Dr. Steadman is regarded as a world-renowned human orthopaedic surgeon. He is a prominent knee surgeon and the inventor of two significant new techniques in orthopaedics. His Research Institute has supported several research projects at CSU. Dr. Steadman serves as a consultant regarding clinical relevance of our research work, and the CSU Orthopaedic Bioengineering Research Laboratory has done controlled studies investigating his techniques used in human orthopaedic surgery. 62 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 63COLLABORATORS Stephen B.

Prior to 1984, the program's re-search was primarily clinical. During this time, many of the techniques for arthroscopic surgery currently used to treat joint problems more effectively and to enable continued athletic function were developed at CSU. We also identified and defined a number of new clinical conditions and documented some of the best methods for diagnosis and treatment. The goals are summarized in our research focuses. As we de- veloped arthroscopic surgical techniques to treat these clinical conditions, we identified limitations in terms of secondary osteoarthritis (OA) and articular cartilage loss and this led into phase two of our pro- gram of finding solutions through scientific research. A major goal of the program has always been to find solutions to musculoskeletal problems, especially joint injuries and arthritis. The researchers strive to offer the best possible treatment of clinical cases with continual and critical assessment of the results, which are then used to modify treatments and direct the research to- ward disease prevention. The program's goals are to use state-of-the-art research techniques to find new methods to rehabilitate damaged joints, to prevent or decrease the occurrence of joint disease and muscu-loskeletal injuries and methods of early detection, and develop better treatments to prevent permanent dam- age to injured joints and validate manual therapies and rehabilitation techniques. The ORC now includes the Orthopaedic Bioengineer- ing Research Laboratory (OBRL), and we function as a single unit. The ORC and OBRL, together with the Pre-clinical Surgical Research Laboratory (previously Small Ruminant Orthopaedic Research), and Orthopaedic Oncology make up the Musculoskeletal Research Pro- gram, which is a Program of Research and Scholarly Excellence in the university. This designation of PRSE originally granted in 2004, and has been renewed in 2008, 2012 and 2016. The significant collaborations with the College of Engineering, School of Bioengi- neering, as well as the Department of Health and Exer- cise Sciences, has added considerably to our research HistoryPROGRAM SYNOPSIS strengths. In recent years, considerable human-based funding (Orthopaedic Foundations, NIH, and corpo- rate grants) has added to our support. A significant addition to our program has been the de- velopment of the equine ambulatory sports medicine service and an equine sports medicine and rehabilita- tion residency program. This followed the accredita- tion of the new American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation specialty and four of our faculty being made Charter Diplomates. Since that time, we have added four diplomates (board certified in the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation (equine specialty). They support an ever expanding clinical and research program in equine sports medicine and rehabilitation. This has led to both considerable clinical and research advance- ments in the rapidly emerging field of equine sports medicine and rehabilitation as a specialty. Most recently, we have achieved funding of $65 mil- lion to build a Translational Medicine Institute (initially called the Institute of Biologic Translational Thera-pies) that is going to take us to a new level in ortho-paedic research in translational musculoskeletal re- search (as well as allied areas of biologic therapies and stem cell research), doing what we have always done for horses but greatly expanding our efforts in human musculoskeletal disease. This has been made possible by a lead matching gift of $35 million from John and Leslie Malone, $10 million from CSU and the $20 million gift from Princess Abigail K. Kawa- nanakoa of Hawaii. Research Activities The following are the research focuses of the ORC. Updates of recent and current projects of 2016 can be found on pages 102-192. 1. Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing Until a few years ago, we have principally addressed articular cartilage healing and continue to do so, but we have enlarged the focus to include tendons, lig- aments, and menisci. For instance, treatments of tendonitis including A-cell therapy, extracorpore- al shock wave therapy (ESWT), and mesenchymal stem cell therapies have been assessed and a new traumatic model of tendonitis validated. Projects published in 2016 relevant to this focus in-clude multiple chapters in the text book \"Joint Dis- ease In The Horse, 2nd Edition\" that was published in 2016 (see Scientific Publications and Presentations 2016) as well as a multi-center clinical study with meniscal injuries and articular cartilage injuries in the femorotibial joint of the horse showing marked improvement in our prognosis with these problems if arthroscopic surgery is followed by intraarticular injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Other projects included demonstrating that chondropro-genitor cells from the superficial layer of the articu-lar cartilage when taken from the same horse could promote articular cartilage repair whereas this was not the case with allogenic cells, as well as the use-fulness of a hydrogel to augment cartilage repair in microfractured defects with better results than if those hydrogels contained MSCs. Both of these stud- ies were published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. Other studies of importance for human or-thopaedics included a demonstration of the center of the anterior cruciate femoral attachment having a direct fiber structure needed to be reconstituted in repair as well as a study of fracture healing under re- duced gravity loading conditions led by bioengineer- ing researchers Drs. Tammy Donahue and Christian Puttlitz respectively. 2. Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease This area includes the development of novel imaging techniques (present and future), body fluid biomark - ers, and also molecular monitoring. The uses of these early diagnostic techniques include a) Evaluation of the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disease, b) Early detection of disease processes, and c) Monitoring of therapy, with the long term goal of preventing severe osteoarthritis or failure of joints, tendons, ligaments, and menisci. Work in biomarkers has progressed into imaging biomarkers with particular emphasis on the use of ultrasonography, MRI and computed tomog-raphy (CT) in diagnosing early disease change in the limb. Considerable work has also been accomplished using subject-specific finite element modeling of the equine metacarpal phalangeal joint which helps us better understand the stresses that play a role in inju-ry of this critical joint. There were a number of studies of importance in the area of early diagnosis of bone and joint disease. A study on the relationship between the radiolog- ic findings and performance outcome in survey ra-PROGRAM SYNOPSIS 74 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 75diographs of yearlings placed in the repository at the National Cutting Horse Association futurity sale showed that despite many previous concerns with lesions in the femorotibial articulation, particular- ly on the medial femoral condyle, indicated range of radiologic lesions of the medial femoral condyle of the stifle including minor defects through complete subchondral cystic lesions were not sig- nificantly associated with performance outcome. Two studies in dogs led by Dr. Felix Duerr showed that objective plain motion data could be acquired with inertial measurement units for the carpus, tar- sus, stifle and hip which allows data acquisition out-side the gait analysis laboratory in the open space but also another study showed that measuring thigh circumference in the dog is an outcome measure for orthopaedic procedures was quite inaccurate. Another study in the equine stifle defined the rela- tionship between anatomy fication of the entheses (insertions of tendons and ligaments) so that this detailed examination could be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying stifle inju- ries in the horse. Other equine studies revealed that a portable media device (iPod\u00ae touch) was able to determine differences in postural sway during quiet stance in normal horses. Postural sway is an import- ant assessment of the degree of proprioception in the limb which is also critical to soundness and can be used as an outcome tool in rehabilitation studies in diagnosis as well as prognostic studies. In ad- dition, a study assessed the comparison between computed tomographic arthrography, radiography, ultrasonography and arthroscopy for the diagnosis of femorotibial joint disease in Western performance horses and showed that tomographic arthrography (CT arthrography (enabled a global assessment and better evaluation of bone and deep intraar- ticular structures of the equine stifle compared to other imaging techniques. Another study in rabbits of the acute and chronic tissue changes and surgi- cal and traumatically induced experimental models of knee joint injury showed that both MRI and mi- cro-computed tomography could be used as means for non-invasively assessing progressive change in disease studies with these models. Publications and studies in this focus include chapters 3-8 in the textbook, \"Joint Disease In The Horse, 2nd Edition\", studies on a comparison of arthroscopy and ultraso- nography for identification of pathologic change in the equine stifle as well as radiographic localization of the entheses of the equine stifle, the relationship between radiographic findings of Quarter Horse cutting horses presented to sale and their subse-quent performance outcomes, an optimized injec- tion technique of the navicular bursa that avoids the deep digital flexor tendon, evaluation of inertial measurement units as a novel method for kinemat- ic gait evaluation in dogs, and the effective sensor position on kinematic output of an inertial sensor system in horses. 3. Improvement in the Understanding of the Pathogenesis of Exercise-Induced Traumatic Disease Catastrophic injury is a major problem in the equine athletic industry and we, as well as researchers else- where, have demonstrated that the severe fractures and injuries start as microfractures in the subchon- dral bone. Our ongoing mission is to develop meth- ods of detecting this damage in the clinical patient before it becomes severe, irreversible damage. Ex- ercising horses have been followed with imaging techniques including computed tomography (CT) and MRI, nuclear scintigraphy, defined sentinels of early damage, and fluid biomarkers as a means of identifying horses at risk studied with promising re- sults. Recently, biomechanical and modeling studies have been done to monitor early events in bone dis- ease. Modeling has been used to look at the patho- genesis of condylar fractures and other disease pro- cesses as well as mapping of pressure distribution and articular cartilage thickness in equine joints. Examples of research projects completed in 2016 in this focus of research include a study of the fail- ure to finish rate in New Zealand in flat racing Thor- oughbreds indicating a marked lower incidence of catastrophic injuries and further understanding of racing and environmental variables such as horse experience, race distance in season that were as- sociated with failure to finish a race and a study of horseshoe designs and dynamic testing of these on both synthetic and dirt race materials revealing that different Thoroughbred racing aluminum racing shoes do not have a significant impact on loading and unloading rate and that a track surface materi- al and its preparation have a more significant effect on the dynamic loading during the impact phase of the stance. In another study from New Zealand it was shown that increased density in the bone of the distal palmar metacarpus was not necessarily sig- metacarpi PROGRAM SYNOPSIS versus non-fractured metacarpi. It appears that the responses to training load can outweigh subtleties of early fracture formation and sequential longitudi-nal imaging is probably needed to make CT density measurements useful as a predictive biomarker of injury in the Thoroughbred racehorse. 4. Continued Development of Novel Therapies for Traumatic Synovitis, Capsulitis, and Osteoarthritis in the Horse Objective evaluation of currently available pharma- ceutical agents as well as new potential ones have been a significant focus of our work. These evalu-ations also include examination of specific biologi-cal inhibitors including gene therapy, novel protein therapies, and mesenchymal stem cells therapies. These newer therapies offer the potential of inhib-iting the disease process sufficiently early so that the need for palliative drugs currently used is de-creased. Recent projects summarized in this area include demonstration that mismatched equine mesenchymal stem cells suppress proliferation of lymphocytes from a different breed of horses sup-porting the ability to use allogenic MSCs as clinical treatments as well as a demonstration that dexa- methasone is an important chondroinductive agent for differentiating MSCs into a cartilage like pheno- type but that conventionally used concentrations could be markedly reduced (100-fold) without nega-tively affectively chondrogenesis. We also published a review article for a human orthopaedic journal on the ability of small molecules (growth factors) alone or in combination could be useful in the amelioration of joint disease and that progress in gene therapy had improved our options. Last but not least, a study with an adeno-associated viral gene therapy vector together with an IGF1-gene could effectively trans-duce equine articular chondrocytes and offered an-other improved therapeutic technique. 5. Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease This is a newer focus that includes objective assess- ment of integrative therapies including physical ma-nipulation and acupuncture for management of mus-culoskeletal disease and pain as well as rehabilitative techniques of swimming, under water treadmilling and hyperbaric therapy. This area also includes study of the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal problems bio-mechanically and using gait analysis (kinetics, kine- matics) and electromyography (EMG), as well as novel methods of pain detection. PROGRAM SYNOPSIS 76 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 77PROGRAM SYNOPSIS PROGRAM SYNOPSIS In recent years, the Orthopaedic Research Center has acquired the personnel and technical abilities to do more sophisticated research in the area of reha-bilitation to address critical questions at a more ba- sic level. The rehabilitation research has been led by Dr. Melissa King. In a paper published in 2017 but accepted in 2016 we showed overall improvements in thoracic limb function, joint range of motion and synovial membrane integrity and significant reduction in synovial membrane inflammation in experimental osteoarthritis with underwater treadmill exercise. The reduction in inflammation resulted in significant clin- ical improvement with regard to symmetric thoracic limb loading, uniform activation patterns, patterns of select thoracic limb muscles and return to baseline values for carpal joint flexion, compared with results for horses with simulated hand walking. Other proj- ects relevant to this research focus include an assess- ment of novel digital and smartphone goniometers for measurement of stifle joint angles in the dog although commonly used they do not accurately represent ra- diographically measured stifle joint angles. Another interesting study in the dog using owner satisfaction survey showed that stifle orthoses (braces) were well received by owners in comparison with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy for the management of cranial cru- ciate ligament disease. Impact as a preeminent equine orthopaedic research program Both nationally and internationally, the Orthopaedic Research Center provides critical new findings of sig- nificant clinical impact and has been able to attract talented students who wish to pursue careers in or- thopaedic research. Students choose this program because of its excellent reputation and because of the opportunities they have to be involved in research during their under-graduate and pre-veterinary pro- grams. Many pre-veterinary students have served as volunteers in the equine orthopaedic research pro- gram over the past 10 years; this allows students to develop a high level of research expertise during this undergraduate experience. This involvement encour- ages students to pursue advanced degrees and ulti- mately research careers rather than traditional private veterinary practice. Our program also impacts under- graduate and pre-veterinary education by applying findings from research studies to clinical veterinary medicine. The breadth of dissemination of information from the Orthopaedic Research Center is extensive, with information distributed to graduate and under-graduate students in eight Departments within five Colleges at Colorado State University. Many faculty members from these five Colleges who are partici- pants in the Orthopaedic Research Program are inter-nationally recognized; they are therefore able to share research findings worldwide to academia, the equine industry, the scientific community, and private bio- medical industry. The ORC's extensive collaboration with the Steadman Philippon Research Institute and biotechnology companies, as well as collaboration in five NIH research grants, has significantly impacted the treatment of humans with orthopaedic injuries and osteoarthritis. Human medicine, as well as veterinary medicine, has been positively affected by the dissem- ination of the ORC's findings. Program Trends 1. Faculty and Staff: Over the last 10 years, funding for our orthopaedic research and specialized per- sonnel availability has increased dramatically. Until 1994, orthopaedic research was being performed by faculty members within the Department of Clini- cal Sciences. Since that time, the ORC research in- volves fourteen full-time faculty members (includ- ing five Bioengineering Faculty) in our Center. To support the work of the Faculty Researchers, we now have eight research associates. We had elev- en Ph.D. students in the program in 2016. Current funding is around $4 million annually. 2. Facilities: Thanks to generous private donors, the construction of the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center and the remodeling of the ortho- paedic research laboratories was completed 16 years ago. In addition, a state-of-the-art equine MRI facility has been in operation for 12 years, and this was also funded by private donations. More recently, a state- of-the- art gait analysis facility has been added and the roof of the ORC Laboratories has been replaced as a gabled roof, and with additional renovations to accommodate expansion of Bioengineering. Last but not least, the groundbreaking for the new Translation-al Medicine Institute (TMI) was performed June 2, 2017 is going to provide a marked escalation in facilities as we move into a much larger role in translational re- search to people in addition to our animals. 3. Endowed chairs: We have also received three $3 million University Endowed Chairs from Barbara Cox Anthony, Iron Rose Ranch, and Abigail K. Kawa- nanakoa, a $1.5 million Chair in Musculoskeletal Imaging from the estate of Kenneth and Virginia At-kinson, and most recently, a $6 million Presidential Endowed Chair from John and Leslie Malone. We continue to pursue endowed funding to make all of our positions permanent. 4. Further development of an Equine Ambulatory Sports Medicine Service: An equine ambulatory sports medi- cine service was initiated in 2010, and has now grown to where Drs. Chris Kawcak and Melissa King have been joined by Dr. Mindy Story. There are now three research associates, Lindsie McCormick, Whitney McMillan, and Meredith Park assisting in this service offering state-of-the-art expertise in equine musculo- skeletal problems in athletic horses. Britt MacTavish joined the team as Equine Operations Manager of the program. We have three equine sports medicine residents (one in each year) and have graduated our third resident from their three-year program in 2014. The service commenced in 2011 and has continued to exceed our expectations in demand. 5. Establishment of Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Residencies: A new American veter- inary specialty, the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation was accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association in May 2009. There were 27 Charter Diplomates estab-lished by a nomination and Delphi election system. Four of our faculty, Drs. McIlwraith, Haussler, Kawcak, and Frisbie, were made Charter Diplomates of the new College. We then established an equine sports medicine and rehabilitation residency program to train future specialists in 2010. Our first resident, Dr. Dora Ferris commenced in July 2010 followed by our second resident, Dr. Erin Contino starting in July 2011, and our third resident Dr. Josh Donnell started in July 2012. These first three residents had their cre-dentials accepted and passed the examination to be-come board certified as Diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabili-tation. Drs. Ferris and Donnell have gone into private practice and Dr. Erin Contino is a faculty member in our Equine Sports Medicine Service. 6. Unrestricted Funding from Donors and Founda- tions: The period 2016 has been one of continuing to function with good support and further increase in faculty and staff positions. Donor support is critical to our continued operation and growth. 78 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 791.

Biologic therapies including mesenchymal stem cells, IRAP and PRP are also discussed with respect to their investigat- ed role in articular cartilage repair using applied equine models. Introduction Clinical joint disease of equine athletes, similar to their human counterparts, often cannot usually be classified into discrete categories. While methods to diagnose equine cartilage defects have signifi-cantly improved over the last decade, articular cartilage damage and ensuing osteoarthritis (OA) remain a challenge to treat. The status of articular cartilage often defines the level, progression and subsequent prognosis of joint disease in both hu- man and equine athletes. Conclusions The level of sophistication and general knowledge in equine imaging has greatly increased in the last decade, making joint ultrasonography for articular cartilage assessment more routine. Palliative surgi-cal care consists of arthroscopic debridement and lavage, while reparative options involve the use of marrow stimulation techniques. Restorative/repara- tive surgical options are an area of active research, including the use of osteochondral grafting, autolo-gous chondrocyte implantation Subchon- dral bone microfracture coupled with intra-articular stem cell injection is currently considered to be the optimal treatment combination for equine patients with articular cartilage defects. Following arthroscop-ic surgery, the rehabilitative goals are to provide support to the affected limb, restore joint flexibility, stability and manage peri-operative pain. In addition, biologic therapy for the treatment of equine joint disease continues to be clinically employed and of investigational interest. References 1. Johnson SA, Frisbie DD.

Introduction The literature is deficient with regard to the specific alterations in the localized mechanical environment of skeletal tissue during the reduced gravitational loading characteristic of spaceflight and how these alterations affect fracture healing in Haversian sys- tems. Additionally, studies that have investigated the role of reduced gravity on healing fractures are few and have predominately been limited to rodent models 2-5. Further, the effects of reduced gravity loading on the localized mechanical environment of mineralized tissues has not been thoroughly de- scribed due to experimental limitations. However, the use of computational techniques may aid in elu- cidating the mechanical underpinnings of skeletal adaptation and healing in mechanically unloaded environments. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a FE model to characterize the local me- chanical environment responsible for the inhibited fracture healing observed under experimentally simulated hypogravity conditions. Methods Animal Model The effects of simulated hypogravity on bone remod- eling and fracture healing were previously investigat- ed in two large animal (sheep) studies6-7. Animal use approval was granted by the Colorado State Univer-sity Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval #11-2938A). A trans-biarticular fixator (IMEX, Longview, TX) hindlimb five skeletally ma- ture sheep for 8 weeks (ExFix group). This unloading technique was shown to simulate a 0.25g environ- ment (i.e. equivalent to a 75% reduction in loading). Following a 21 day simulated reduced loading period and a resultant loss of cancellous bone mineral den- sity of approximately 18%, a 3.0mm mid-metatarsal ostectomy was performed and stabilized with an or-thopaedic locking plate instrumented with a rosette strain gage. An Earth gravity (Control, n=5) group was included in the study in which an ostectomy was created, plated, and casted, allowing full loading to be transmitted through the bone. In vivo principal strains of the orthopaedic fixation plates were cor-related to measured ground reaction forces (GRFs) of the right hindlimb. Both groups were euthanized after 28-days. Following sacrifice, non-destructive four-point bending experiments were performed on the whole, dissected metatarsal bones using a cus- tom-made fixture coupled to a servohydraulic testing machine (MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) and the resultant bending was calculat- ed. Additionally, micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) and histomorphometric analyses were performed to quantify fracture healing. Model Generation A single high fidelity finite element (FE) model of the ovine hindlimb extending from the tibia to proximal phalanges was constructed to quantify the localized stresses and strains experienced under simulated hypogravity unloading. The bony geometry of the FE model was prepared from CT imagery data of a fully mature Rambouillet Columbian ewe with no known diseases or abnormalities. Previously-published mate- rial properties were assigned to the bony structures, articular cartilage, and ligaments 8-12.

The overall modeling process is illustrated in Figure 1. Diaphyseal Fracture Modeling In order to investigate the effects of mechanical unloading on the local mechanical environment of a healing bone fracture, a 3mm mid-diaphyseal os-tectomy was created in the ExFix and Control mod- els. The mid-diaphyseal fracture and callus of each specimen were processed for histological analyses wherein callus dimensions were utilized to create a callus of equivalent mesh density for the ExFix and Control FE models. A four-point bending procedure was modeled in identical fashion to the previous experimental method and a range of linearly elastic Young's moduli values from 1MPa to 15MPa were uti- lized for the fracture material of the computational model to calibrate the model's predicted bending stiffness to experimental results 13-17. Using the ac- quired Young's moduli values, each model was then subjected to 100N and 200N GRF standing muscle forces, and the principal strains of the orthopaedic fixation plates were compared to experimental data. Finally, each model was loaded with muscle and stifle joint contact forces corresponding to 100N, 200N, and 300N GRF standing loads as well as a gait speed of 0.75m/s (corresponding to the maxi-mum speed of the housed animals, or 600N). The local maximum and minimum strain components and hydrostatic pressure within the fracture gap and periosteal callus predicted by the model were then compared with histological results obtained from the in vivo animal study. Results Model predictions for the fracture gap and callus are presented in Figure 2. As expected, hydrostatic pressure and strain predictions were greatest when a GRF of 600N (corresponding to a 0.75m/s gait speed) was imposed on both FE models and de- creased as a function of GRF. Both models predict- ed peak hydrostatic pressures and principal strains within the cortices of the fracture gap contralateral to the orthopaedic fixation plate, with both param-eters decreasing radially toward the callus periph- ery. The Control model predicted a peak hydrostat-ic pressure of -0.59MPa (compressive) within the fracture gap and maximum and minimum principal strains of 5.0% and -10.9%, respectively. The ExFix model predicted a peak hydrostatic pressure of -0.1MPa within the fracture gap and peak maximum and minimum principal strains of 3.7% and -7.6%, respectively. Conclusions In conclusion, the mechanical unloading experienced during simulated hypogravity is predicted to yield de- Figure 1. The FE model generation process. Surface geometry was segmented from a CT scan of a mature ewe before being meshed with 8-node hexahedral elements and imported into the finite element software. (Bottom) The (left) ExFix and (right) Control FE fracture models were generated by creating a 3mm ostectomy and callus (red insets) at the mid-diaphysis of the metatarsus and stabilized with a 6-hole orthopaedic plate. Figure 2. Specific hydrostatic and principal strain envelopes have been previously reported to initiate intramembranous ossification, connective tissue/fibrocartilage formation, and endochondral ossification by Claes and Heigele [13]. Plotting the data of the current study for GRFs of 100N, 200N, 300N, and 600N (points a, b, c, and d, respectively) over these previous results demonstrate the hypothesized course of healing for each model (The lower bound of each curve corresponds to the hydrostatic pressure and respective minimum principal strain while the upper bound corresponds to the hydrostatic pressure and respective maximum principal strain for GRFs from 0N to 600N). (A) Both models predicted the greatest levels of hydrostatic pressure and principal strain in the fracture gap contralateral to the fixation plate. The Control model predicted peak hydrostatic pressure and principal strains within the endochondral ossification envelope for GRFs greater than 100N while all hydrostatic pressure and strain predictions fell within the intramembranous ossification zone for the ExFix model. (B) Hydrostatic pressure and strain predictions were decreased within the fracture callus.RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing 104 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 105creased magnitudes of hydrostatic pressure and, to a lesser extent, principal strain at the fracture site, leading to subsequent reductions in overall frac- ture healing rate and quality. The latter includes de-creased stiffness due to an overall decrease in cal- lus volume and limited amounts of intramembranous ossification rather than the traditional endochondral ossification healing pathway, which is characteristic of 1g Earth loading. The FE model predictions sug- gest that reduced hydrostatic pressure and strain of the healing fracture contributed to alterations in the healing process, with animals exposed to a simulat- ed hypogravity environment inadequately healing, and only then, via limited amounts of via intramem- branous bone formation rather than the more robust endochondral ossification process typically experi-enced by animals healing in an Earth gravitational environment. Further work should concentrate on candidate countermeasures that may be able to re-store the natural loading milieu to fractures healing in hypogravity environments.

RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing 106 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 107RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing Take home message The center of the ACL femoral attachment consisted of a direct fiber structure, while the posterior portion had an indirect fiber structure. These results support previous animal studies reporting that the center of the ACL femoral insertion was comprised of the strongest reported fiber type. Clinically, the femoral ACL reconstruction tunnel should be oriented to cov-er the entirety of the central direct ACL fibers and may need to be customized based on graft type and fixation device used during surgery. Introduction Recent animal and histological studies have argued that the ACL fibers closest to the posterior articular cartilage are indirect fibers, inserting onto the femo-ral condyle at an acute angle with a two-phase inser-tion: ligament and bone 2,3. By comparison, the more anterior femoral ACL fibers, including the main por- tion of the anteromedial and posterolateral bundle attachments, are reported to be direct fibers. These direct fibers attach at larger angles (up to 90\u00b0) and histologically have a bone 3,4. The four-phase ligament attachment com- position is reported to withstand greater loads than the two-phase attachment of the indirect fibers and provide the majority of the mechanical strength at the ligament attachment site. Further investigation is necessary to describe the microstructure of the ACL femoral insertion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the ACL femoral insertion using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to de-termine the extent to which direct and indirect fiber morphology exists within the femoral ACL footprint, and establish the anatomic locations where each fi- ber type predominates. Methods A total of ten fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees from five males and five females were used with a median age of 56.5 years (range, 33-63), median BMI of 22 (range, 15-34) and no history of knee injury.

Higher magnification imaging and analysis was taken at '50%'-midpoint of central fiber insertion and '25%'- furthest posterior fiber insertion layers a quarter of the visible footprint length from the posterior end.RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing Briefly, the samples were placed in fixative (2.5% glu- taraldehyde) for 48 hours at room temperature. The samples were then submerged in 10% formic acid to decalcify at room temperature. Following decalci-fication, the samples were immersed in a 1% tannic acid solution (buffered with 0.05 M Cacodylate pH 7.2) for 4 hours and then rinsed in distilled water for 24 hours. Samples were then dehydrated in ascend-ing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) for 10 minutes each and cut into 2 mm sections. Once sectioned, the samples were placed into ascending concentrations of hexamthey- ldisilazane (HMDS) for 10 minutes. The sections were then dried in a vacuum desiccator until they were prepared to image. Samples were mounted onto a stub with conductive double-sided tape and copper tape with the surface of interest facing up toward the electron beam. The samples were then coated with 10 nm gold and scanned with a JEOL JSM-6400 scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) in the secondary electron emission mode (SEI) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Results The entirety of the fan-like projection of the ACL attachment site lay posterior to the lateral inter-condylar ridge. In all specimens a four-phase ar-chitecture, consistent with previous descriptions of direct fibers, was found in the center of the femoral attachment site. The posterior margin of the ACL attachment attached directly adjacent to the pos-terior articular cartilage with some fibers coursing into it. The posterior portion of the ACL insertion had a two-phase insertion, consistent with previ-ous descriptions of indirect fibers. The transition from the ligament fibers to bone had less interdig- itations and the interdigitations were significantly smaller (p < 0.001) compared to the transition in the direct fiber area. The interdigitations of the di-rect fibers were 387 \u00b1 81 m (range, 282-515 m) wide, while the interdigitations of indirect fibers measured 228 \u00b1 75 m (range, 89-331 m). Conclusions This study found that the center of the ACL femo-ral attachment was comprised of a direct fiber pat-tern, while the posterior portion of the ACL femoral attachment, adjacent to the posterior articular car-tilage, had an indirect fiber pattern. These findings should be taken into account during ACL reconstruc- Figure 2. Central section of the ACL femoral Note how the posteriorly AAC, anterior articular cartilageFigure 3.

Take home message It was evident that both of the new models presented in this study (ACLF- Traumatically torn ACL model and mACLT- surgical transection of the ACL and meniscus tissue) resulted in osteoarthritic-type as formation, of menisci and bone. Col-lectively looking at the articular cartilage and menisci it was noted that the mACLT model provided a slightly different pattern of degeneration than the ACLF mod- el, which could be due to the slightly different acute damages or lack of an initial traumatic impact onto the joint. Nevertheless, damage identified using the chronic MR images did closely match damage seen at dissection, thus MR imaging could be used as a means for non-invasively assessing progressive dam- age in future studies with these models reducing the total number of animals needed. Introduction The current literature indicates the occurrence of PTOA does not depend on whether or not the ACL is recon-structed following injury\u00b2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is a common method for diagnosing damage to knee joint structures. This non-invasive method is often used clinically by surgeons to deter- mine the severity of damage\u00b3. One of the most wide- ly used models is an ACL transection (ACLT) model, where the ACL is transected and degradation of the joint is monitored over time. However, ACLT models so not take into account acute meniscal damage that is often documented in conjunction with ACL tears fol- lowing large compressive tibiofemoral forces through the joint at the time of injury. For this reason, two new lapine models have been developed: a modified ACLT (mACLT) model and a traumatic impact (ACLF) model7. Similar to the ACLT model, the mACLT model destabilizes the knee by transecting the ACL; however, in the mACLT model partial meniscal transections are also introduced. The ACLF model induces ACL rupture and damage to the surrounding structures, including the meniscus, via a single blunt force impact to the ti- biofemoral joint. The objective of the current study was to use conventional MR and microCT imaging to docu- ment joint damage immediately following trauma and longitudinally in both the mACLT and ACLF models. It was hypothesized that (1) untreated acute soft tissue damage will be progressive, (2) the MR images will provide a description of damage documented at dis-section in the lapine model and (3) differences will be evident between the two experimental models. Methods Thirty-three skeletally mature (5-8 months of age) Flemish Giant rabbits (5.4 \u00b1 0.6 kg, 13 females and 20 males) were used in the study. Animals were placed under anesthesia (2% isoflurane and oxygen) and the right limb was subjected to trauma with the contralat-eral limb unaffected to serve as an internal control. Fifteen animals received a closed-joint impact to the tibiofemoral joint (ACLF), similar to previous studies. The remaining 18 animals received an ACL transec-tion as well as a radial transection in the white zone of the central region of the medial meniscus with a longitudinal transection extending though the main body and a radial transection of the lateral meniscus in the white zone of the central region with a longi-tudinal tear extending anteriorly (mACLT). MRI was used to document tissue damages in each joint fol-lowing initial trauma (acute damage), as well as just prior to euthanasia (4, 8, or 12 weeks post-trauma, chronic damage). Bones from each animal were scanned via mCT (Scanco mCT 80, Scanco Medical AG, Br\u00fcttisellen, Switzerland) with an isotropic voxel size of 25 mm. Four spatially distributed cylindrical volumes of interest (VOI) were identified for each tib-ia and femur based on anatomical markers. Follow-ing euthanasia, India ink was lightly applied to the ar-ticular cartilage surfaces to highlight surface fissures, cartilage degradation, and other irregularities.A study of acute and chronic tissue changes in surgical and traumatically- induced experimental models of knee joint injury using magnetic resonance imaging and micro-computed tomography This is a summary of an article Fischenich, H.M.

Trends in injured femurs and tibias for progressive decreases in subchondral bone quantity and quality. Conclusions The study showed traumatic and surgical ACL rup- ture and meniscal tear models of meniscus and articular carti- lage as early as 4 weeks post-injury, if left untreated. Chronic damage was noted in 87% of impacted menisci and 71% of surgically transected menisci across all time points. It is interesting to note that in the ACLF model, menisci had more acute damage to the lateral hemijoint, however chronically the me- dial hemijoint showed more meniscal damage. The opposite was true in the mACLT model; acute damage was more prevalent in the medial menis- cus, and chronically the lateral hemijoint showed more damage. The MR imaging used in this study and the dissection notes for the meniscal tissue and articular cartilage matched well. Identifying specific regions, for example anterior junction vs anterior horn, is difficult given the small size of the tissue and the slice thickness. Defining articular cartilage \"surface damage\" was difficult with MRI.

The use of computed tomographic arthrography enables a global assessment and better evaluates bone and deep intra-articular structures of the equine stifle compared to other imaging techniques. Introduction Lameness originating from the femorotibial joint com- partments is common in equine athletes, especially in Western performance disciplines.\u00b2 Once lameness has been localized to the stifle region, radiography and ultrasonography are typically used to evaluate the numerous intra- and peri-articular structures that could contribute to the lameness. 3-5 However, these imaging modalities have limitations and diagnostic arthroscopy is frequently used to evaluate the joint with higher sensitivity, especially involving articular cartilage than the other imaging techniques. De- spite the use of all of these techniques, information on deep intra-articular structures (e.g. cruciate liga- ments) and bone Computed tomography (CT) overcomes these limita- tions by offering cross sectional evaluation and when contrast media is injected into the joint (CT arthrogra-phy, CTA) intra-articular soft tissues can Comparisons of radiography, ultrasonography, CT/CTA, and arthroscopy have yet to be performed. Our main objective in this study was to compare the results of all these diagnostic techniques in horses with lameness localized to the femorotibial joints. Methods This prospective clinical study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Colorado State University and owner consent was obtained. Inclu-sion criteria required that horses had a hindlimb lameness that improved 60% following intra-articu- lar anesthesia of femorotibial joint compartments.

Compared with the other diagnostic methods, the use of CT/CTA identified more defects in the following structures: cranial mensicotibial condyle the medial cranial meniscotibial ligament, 75% were detected with CTA. Enthesopathy of the medial and lateral cra- nial meniscotibial ligaments was identified on CT in 18 and 4 joints, respectively, and was much higher than was detected with radiography.

Conclusions The detection of injuries to the cruciate ligaments and bone (trabecular, subchondral, and entheses) were more common with CT/CTA than the other tech- niques. The inclusion of CT/CTA in the evaluation of the equine femorotibial joints provides for a global assessment of structures that compose the joint and may highlight injuries that are not detected with other imaging methods.

This de- vice may be useful as a horse-mounted diagnostic tool in horses with neuromuscular disease. Introduction Postural stability during quiet standing has been evaluated in both humans and horses as an objec-tive measure of balance. It is used most commonly in people to evaluate and monitor neuromuscular disorders, such as neurologic disorders (Parkinson's disease), head trauma, and risk of falling in older adults. 2-4 In horses, postural stability has been in- vestigated for lameness, rehabilitation, and effect of visual input. 5,6 People and horses establish static bal- ance by maintaining their center of mass (COM) over the base of support, and this is achieved through the integration of visual, proprioceptive, and vestib-ular pathways. In both people and horses, the gold standard device to evaluate postural stability is the stationary force platform. The small adjustments in muscle tension to maintain the body's COM over its base of support is measured as movement of the center of pressure when standing on a stationary force platform. Body mounted devices to measure the movement of the COM have been investigated in people, and similar devices could also be used in horses to evaluate postural stability. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate a common porta-ble media device (iPod Touch\u00ae) for the assessment of postural stability in the horse. Methods Seven skeletally mature horses were utilized, and all trials were performed in the gait analysis laboratory. For each trial, the horse was positioned with fore-limbs on one stationary force platform and the hind-limbs on the second stationary force platform. Each horse was fitted with a breastplate and surcingle, with the surcingle placed just caudal to the highest point of the withers, and the portable media device in a protective case was mounted with zip ties onto the surcingle. The PMD was mounted so that its long axis was oriented cranial-caudal, and the midline of the PMD was centered over the midline of the horse. Data was collected from the tri-axial accelerometer using a commercial data logging application. At least five 10 second trials were collected for each stance condition. Trials were rejected if the horse did not remain in a static stance position, with all 4 limbs in contact with the force platform, and keeping the head and neck in a natural and comfortable position for each horse, which was maintained throughout a single stance condition. All horses underwent a to- tal of four stance conditions, which were performed in the same order in each horse: 1) normal square stance, 2) forelimb base-narrow stance, 3) normal square stance at 5 minutes following sedation with xylazine hydrochloride (0.35 mg/kg IV), and 4) normal square stance at 10 minutes following sedation with xylazine hydrochloride (0.35 mg/kg IV). From the por- table media device, total range of acceleration and standard deviations (SDs) for accelerations in the craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral (ML) directions were determined. From the stationary force platform, center of pressure (COP) displacement and velocity and their respective standard deviations (SDs) in the CC and ML directions were determined. Results There were significant differences in CC range of acceleration, CC SD, and ML SD as measured by the portable media device when stance condi- tion was altered. For the stationary force platform, there were significant differences in COP motion in all CC and ML variables (total displacement, veloc- ity, displacement SD, and velocity SD). When ex-Evaluation of a portable media device for use in determining postural stability in standing horses This is a summary of an article by Drs. V. Moorman, C. Kawcak, and M. King in American Journal of Veterinary Research.\u00b9 amining the specific effect of stance width (normal versus narrow stance), there were significant dif-ferences in ML sway identified by both the porta-ble media device and the stationary force platform. Following IV xylazine administration, there were changes to CC and ML sway variables from both the portable media device and the stationary force platform. Correlations between the variables from the portable media device and the stationary force platform ranged from 0.18 to 0.58, with higher cor-relations between SDs and in the CC direction. Conclusions The results of this investigation demonstrate the abil-ity of a common portable media device (iPod Touch\u00ae) to identify differences in postural sway between stance conditions in normal horses. This is similar to what has been documented in people, where body-mounted sensors have been able to discrimi-nate people with a higher risk of falling by examining their postural sway characteristics. We found that a measure of variability (SDs) was useful in differ-entiating stance conditions. Variability of sway data has previously been useful in discriminating sway parameters both in people and horses. Additionally, analyzing changes to variability has been identified as a useful parameter in horses following changes to sensory input. 9,10 Previously, COP velocity was identified to be highly correlated with COM accel-erations in people. 11 This was only somewhat true in our horses, but it is possible that these variables are not mimicked in quadrupeds as they are in bipeds. Nonetheless, these results suggest that portable me-dia devices should be further investigated as horse-based motion analysis tools.

However, a sim- ilar change in the pelvic sensor location significantly changed the hindlimb but not forelimb Introduction In the past several decades, there has been in-creased interest in development of objective lame-ness detection systems to supplement the subjec-tive lameness examination. The current trend is to develop gait analysis systems that are horse-mount-ed, thus, making examination outside of a gait anal-ysis laboratory possible. A number of systems have been investigated, but one inertial sensor system (Lameness Locator\u00ae) has been more thoroughly in- vestigated and has widespread clinical use. The ben- efits of this system are its ease of use, portability, and quick set up time. This system is marketed to provide objective data to supplement a subjective lameness examination\u00b2. The accuracy and short-term repeat-ability of this system have been demonstrated 3,4 and guidelines have been made for placement of the system's sensors based on anatomic landmarks. However, the effect of exact location of each sensor on the output kinematic parameters has not been evaluated. Clinically, it has been noted by this group of authors that the sensor on the right front pastern sometimes rotates, typically medially, during a data collection session. In addition, horse conformation and placement of sensors by inexperienced users may impact the chosen location of the pelvic sensor. Thus, the objective of this investigation was to exam-ine the effect of location of the right fore (RF) and the pelvic sensors on the kinematic outputs for the fore and hindlimbs. We hypothesized that the location of the RF sensor would not significantly influence the associated forelimb or hindlimb kinematic outputs. Secondly, we hypothesized that the pelvic sensor location would not have a significant effect on fore-limb associated kinematics, but hindlimb kinematics would be significantly altered. Methods Twelve horses between the age of 2 and 5 years were utilized for this study and had mild to moder- ate lameness in at least one limb. Each horse was instrumented with the inertial sensor system, which consisted of three sensors. A uni-axial accelerome- ter was attached to a felt head bonnet with velcro, a pelvic uni-axial accelerometer was mounted be- tween the tuber sacrale using Velcro tape and rein- forced with duct tape, and a gyroscope was fastened by a pastern wrap to the right forelimb. Horses were examined at the trot on a high speed treadmill, and data collection sessions occurred on two separate daily treadmill sessions. Alterations to the RF sensor were tested in three locations in random order: dor- sal midline, 2 cm rotated medially, and 2 cm rotated laterally. Alterations to the pelvic sensor were test- ed in five locations in random order: dorsal midline between the tuber sacrale, 2 cm to the right and 2 cm to the left of midline, and 2 cm cranial and 2 cm caudal to the tuber sacrale on midline. When the sen- sor location was altered (either the RF or the pelvic sensor), the treadmill was stopped, but the horse remained on the treadmill. After repositioning of the sensor, the treadmill was re-started and returned to the same velocity as the prior trials. Prior to data col- lection for each sensor location, all horses were al- lowed to re-acclimate to the treadmill velocity for 30 - 45 seconds. Following this acclimation, two twen- ty to thirty second trot trials were recorded in order to collect a minimum of 25 strides per trial. In total six trials were collected for alterations in RF sensor locations, and ten trials were collected for the alter- ation in pelvic sensor location. Treadmill velocity was maintained among trials for each horse. Kinematic Effects of sensor position on kinematic data obtained with an inertial sensor system during gait analysis of trotting horses This is a summary of an article by Drs. V. Moorman, D. Frisbie, C. Kawcak, and W. McIlwraith published in Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association.\u00b9 output variables examined from this inertial sensor system were maximum and minimum differences of head and pelvis motion (MaxDiff head, MaxDiff pel- vis, MinDiff head, MinDiff pelvis, and Vector sum). These variables are used for assessment of lame- ness in the clinical application of the system. Results There were no significant differences in any of the fore or hindlimb kinematic outputs when the RF sensor position was altered. When the pelvic sen- sor location was altered, there were no significant changes in kinematic variables associated with the forelimbs. However, pelvic sensor location had a sig-nificant effect on kinematic output variables associ-ated with the hindlimb. When the pelvic sensor was moved to either to the right or left of midline or crani- al to the tuber sacrale, there was a significant differ- ence in the variable MinDiff pelvis. When the pelvic sensor location was analyzed with sensor movement defined as towards or away from the lame hindlimb, there was also a significant differences in MinDiff pel-vis (P=0.0355). This difference was identified when the pelvic sensor was moved away from the lame hindlimb or cranial to the tuber sacrale. Conclusions The results of this investigation support that accurate anatomic placement of the pelvic sensor is important for the kinematic output of this system. The place-ment of this sensor needs to not only be placed in midline, but also needs to be placed appropriately cranial to caudal over the tuber sacrale. Therefore, placement of this sensor should be performed by an individual knowledgeable in equine lumbosa-cral anatomy. This also suggests that the kinematic results of the system should be put in context with the subjective lameness examination. If the equine veterinarian performing the examination disagrees with the hindlimb assessment of the system, repeat palpation of the tuber sacrale and replacement of the pelvic sensor may be indicated, as well as recollec-tion of the kinematic data.

Articular carti-lage specimens with ICRS grade 1 and 2 degener-ation corresponded to an increase in T2 values on MRI examination. Introduction Femoropatellar impingement (FAI) has been increasingly recognized as a cause of hip pain in young active individ-uals.\u00b2 Recent literature has shown that early joint degen-eration, such as osteoarthritis (OA) can stem from subtle deformities associated with FAI 3,4. However, identifica- tion of early OA change is challenging. While the gold standard for early OA detection is arthroscopy, it would be ideal to have arthroscopy augmented by the assess- ment of chondrocyte morphology and ECM content. The purpose of the current study was to: 1. Describe T2 mapping values from the patients' pre-operative MRI with arthroscopically determined International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grades in damaged cartilage (Grades 1-4) and healthy-appearing (Grade 0) cartilage waste specimens removed during arthroscopy to treat FAI. 2. Compare the arthroscopically determined ICRS grade of the specimens' biochemical, biochemical and IHC endpoints of damaged and healthy-appearing hip cartilage specimens. Materials and methods Twenty-four patients were prospectively enrolled, con- secutively, between December 2011 and August 2012. Patients were included if they were aged 18 years or older and met criteria that followed the clinical indi-cations for arthroscopy to treat FAI. Patients with pri- or hip trauma including fracture or dislocation or who have undergone prior hip surgery were excluded. All patients received a preoperative sagittal T2 mapping scan of the hip joint. Cartilage was graded intraopera-tively using the ICRS grading system, and graded spec- imens were collected as cartilage waste for histologic, biochemical, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Results Forty-four cartilage specimens (22 healthy-appearing, 22 damaged) were analyzed. Median T2 values were significantly higher among damaged specimens (55.7 \u00b1 14.9 ms) than healthy-appearing specimens (49.3 \u00b1 12.3 ms; P = 0.043), which was most exaggerated among mild (grade 1 or 2) defects where the damaged spec-imens (58.1 \u00b1 16.4 ms) were significantly higher than their healthy-appearing specimens (48.7 \u00b1 15.4 ms; P = 0.026). Severely damaged specimens (grade 3 or 4) had significantly lower cumulative H&E than their paired healthy-appearing counterparts (P = 0.02) but was not statistically significant among damaged speci-mens with mild (grade 1 or 2) defects (P = 0.198). Among healthy-appearing specimens, median T2 and the per-centage of collagen fibers oriented parallel were sig-nificantly correlated (rho = 0.425, P = 0.048). Conclusions This study outlines the potential for T2 mapping to identify early cartilage degeneration in patients under-going arthroscopy to treat FAI. Findings in ICRS grade 1 and 2 degeneration corresponded to an increase in T2 values. Further biochemical evaluation revealed a significant difference between healthy-appearing car-tilage and late degeneration in cumulative H&E as well as significantly lower percentage of collagen fibers oriented parallel and a higher percentage of collagen fibers oriented randomly when considering all grades of cartilage damage.Comparison of T2 mapping, histologic endpoints and arthroscopic grading of articular cartilage specimens in patients with femoroacetabular impingement This is a report of a study done in collaboration with the Steadman Philippon Research Institute in Vail published in Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery and authored by Charles Ho, Rachel Surowiec, David Frisbie, Fernando Ferro, Katharine Wilson, Adriana Saroki, Eric Fitzcharles, Grant Dornan and Marc Philippon. 1RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 -Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease References 1.

Introduction Subjective clinical evaluation of lameness has been reported to poorly correlate with objective methods of assessment typically utilized in a re-search setting. 2-4 Hence, camera based (optical) motion capture systems along with force plat-forms, allowing for objective quantification of joint kinematics and ground reaction forces, have been proposed as more accurate methods of lameness diagnosis. 3,5-7 Limitations to conventional force platform and op-tical capture methods include poor transportabili-ty of the systems, capture volume limitations, the need for multiple trial acquisition, cost of equip-ment, facilities, time and expertise needed for data collection. 3,4,8 Since data acquisition is limited to the location of the capture system, free movement of the animal in a natural environment is not pos-sible.3 Because of these factors the use of kinetic and kinematic analysis is mostly limited to the re-search laboratory. Inertial sensors or motion units are light-weight, por- table motion tracking devices that measure angu-lar velocity, orientation, and accelerations. These devices measure relative orientation of individual body segments rather than direct position. 9,10 Con- sequently, attachment to individual limb segments proximal and distal to a joint is required to calcu-late joint angles. 9-12 Data transmission is wireless and limited to the IMUs itself (i.e. no optical motion capture system requirement), permitting kinematic gait analysis at any location. 12-15 Data acquisition is also continuous, eliminating the need for multiple attempts to acquire a successful trial within a short distance or specific foot strike pattern. IMUs have been extensively used in humans and few reports have been published in the equine literature.10,11,15-18 Despite their potential to reduce or eliminate many of the disadvantages of current gait analysis tech-niques and their prospective for use in clinical as well as research settings, IMUs have not been uti- lized for canine gait analysis. The specific aim of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of an IMU-based system for kinematic gait analysis in dogs. We hypothesized that it is feasible to attach IMUs to the canine limbs and that IMU-based two-dimensional kinematic data would strongly correlate with optical kinematic analysis in clinically normal dogs. Methods Sixteen clinically healthy, medium-sized dogs were enrolled. Baseline kinematic data was acquired using an optical motion capture system. Following baseline data acquisition, a harness system was Evaluation of inertial measurement units as a novel method for kinematic gait evaluation in dogs. This is a summary of an article by Drs. Duerr, Pauls, Kawcak, Haussler, Bertocci, Moorman and King 'Veterinary and Comparative Orthopaedics and Traumatology' 2016;29(6):475-83. 1 Figure 1. Picture of dog fitted for the study depicting 2 IMUs for thoracic limb and 4 for pelvic limb data acquisition. used for attachment of IMUs. Optical kinematic data with and without the harness were compared to evaluate the influence of the harness on gait pa- rameters. Sagittal plane joint kinematics acquired simultaneously with IMUs and the optical system were compared for the carpus, tarsus, stifle and hip joints. Comparisons of data were made using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) test and evaluation of root mean squared errors (RMSE). For acquisition of IMU data, a specifically designed har- ness system was used to attach the IMUs to the study participants (Figure 1). Two IMUs were attached to the thoracic limb (laterally at the level of mid-metacarpus and mid-radius/ulna) and four IMUs were attached to the pelvic limb (laterally at the level of mid-metatarsus, mid-tibia, mid-femur and metatarsal, tibial and femoral IMUs were attached with the use of custom-designed, circumferential Velcro straps se- cured to the limb using double-sided tape to avoid ro- tation or slippage. To avoid detachment of the sensors and to provide additional stability, the Velcro straps were designed such that they wrapped around the sensor after fully wrapping around the limb. To store the wireless transmitter unit all animals were also fit- ted with a commercially available vest. The pelvic plate was made out of heat-moldable casting material and secured using elastic cords attached cranially to the vest and caudally around the tail of each dog. Results Data acquisition for IMUs was successful for every trial, however, only the data acquired during trials resulting in appropriate data for optical kinematics were used for data analysis. There were no signif- icant differences between stance duration, swing duration, stride length or forward velocity (2.4\u00b10.2 m/s and 2.5\u00b10.2 m/s; p=0.203) between dogs with and without the harness. Significant differences between optical kinematic data for dogs with and without the harness were observed in multiple sin- gle time point (max/min) joint angle measurements, the joint motion range of the shoulder, carpal, hip, and stifle joints. When comparing optical and IMU kinematic data, strong correlations (0.948-0.984) were found for all 4 joints evaluated. For the comparison of dogs with and without the harness using the conventional optical system, mean RMSE values ranged from 4.90\u00b0 to 14.10\u00b0 during swing. When compared to the range of mo-tion (ROM) during swing phase, the mean RMSE values as a percentage of the ROM ranged from 12.32% to 22.72%, with the shoulder demonstrat-ing a larger difference between the harness and no harness trials. For the comparison of the IMU data to the conven- tional optical system, median RMSE values were similar across the four joints during the swing phase and ranged from 2.51\u00b0 to 3.52\u00b0. When comparing the ROM during swing phase of a joint, the median RMSE values as a percentage of ROM for the car-pus, hock, and stifle were very similar (< 5%, see Figure 2). The median RMSE as a percentage of the hip (8.10%) was larger than the other three joints. Conclusions We identified a strong correlation between optical sagittal plane kinematic and IMU data for the car- pus, tarsus, stifle and hip joint in the study popu- lation. However, we also identified that the current attachment method interferes with several kinemat- ic gait parameters. Based on the study findings it can be concluded that IMUs provide an accurate alternative to optical kinematic gait analysis, how- ever, further investigation into the impacts on ca- nine gait and lameness and alternative attachment methods are indicated. The distinct advantages of IMU-based canine gait evaluation systems (e.g. lower cost, reduced time requirement for data ac-quisition, and use in a natural environment) warrant further research into this technology.

As the cysts enlarge, they take on more of a spheri-cal characteristic. This information will help in deter-mining the cause of disease formation and progres-sion in the future. Introduction Subchondral cystic legions in horses are common and their progression can result in significant lame- ness and morbidity. The goal of this project was to determine physical characteristics of subchondral cystic lesions of the medial femoral condyle of hors- es in order to determine the pathologic characteris-tics of the disease. Methods Computed femoral condyles with subchondral cystic le- gions from six adult horses was performed and the volume surface area and centers of cyst opening were determined. The displacement of the center of the cysts from the center of the opening was also determined. The cyst surface area-to-volume ratio was also evaluated and compared to that of a true sphere. Results Subchondral cystic legions were located in femoral condyle caudal, proximal and abaxial with respect to the cen- ter of the cyst opening. Small and intermediate vol- umes of subchondral cystic legions were irregular as opposed to larger subchondral cystic legions which were smooth and approached the area-to-volume ra-tio of that of a sphere. Conclusions These findings indicate a common pathologic pro- cess for cause and progression of subchondral cystic in the medial femoral condyles of horses. ture studies will focus on further characterizing those predisposing causes that may lead to disease.

Take home message While thigh circumference (TC) measurements are a frequently utilized outcome measure, TC measure- ments as currently performed may not be a valid outcome measurement. Introduction Assessment of muscle mass in canine patients is a commonly used outcome measure for evaluation of musculoskeletal disease. 2-7 Definitive measurement of muscle mass involves advanced imaging, making it impractical and cost prohibitive in most clinical cas-es. Limb or thigh circumference measurement with a tape measure is frequently used in both human and veterinary patients as an indirect measure of changes in muscle mass over time. 8-11 Unfortunately previous studies evaluating canine TC measurement using various tape measures have shown significant inter- and intra-observer variability. 12,13 Use of a spring-tensioned device (Gulick tape measure; GT) is recommended to decrease variability in the force used by the observer when tensioning the tape mea- sure around the limb.14,15 However, this technology is reportedly only reliable for measurements of the prox- imal antebrachium in canines and its validity for thigh circumference measurement has been questioned. 12 Without reliable methods for TC measurement, this as-sessment may give an incomplete or erroneous evalu-ation of response to therapy and intervention. The goals of this study were to further evaluate the accuracy of GT for measurement of TC. Our specific aims were to determine if hair coat clipping affects TC measurement, to determine the intra- and inter-ob-server variability of TC under constant conditions us-ing an affixed limb, and to evaluate the effect of laser guidance on inter- and intra-observer variability of TC measurements in a clinical setting. We hypothesized that hair coat clipping would not significantly affect TC measurements made with a GT, and that using a laser guidance device would decrease both intra- and in-ter-observer variability of TC measurements. Methods This study was performed in two phases: First, to evalu- ate the effect of hair coat length (pre- and post-clipping) across a range of muscle masses and to determine the inter- and intra-observer variability of TC measurement under constant conditions, cadaveric limbs were mea-sured in a fixed position.

Second, to evaluate the effect of laser guidance on TC measurement, live dogs were mea-sured with and without a device that projects a laser line across the canine limb (see Figure 1). Results This study was performed in two phases: First, to evalu-ate the effect of hair coat length (pre- and post-clipping) across a range of muscle masses and to determine the inter- and intra-observer variability of TC measurement under constant conditions, cadaveric limbs were mea- sured in a fixed position. Canine cadaveric thigh girth was manually expanded to three different levels using a custom, submuscular inflation system before and af- ter hair clipping. Second, to evaluate the effect of laser guidance on TC measurement, live dogs were mea- sured with and without a device that projects a laser line across the canine limb (see Figure 1). Conclusions We found there to be a significant difference in TC measurements of the same limb with and without hair coat, therefore evaluation of TC following thera- peutic intervention should take into account clipping status of hair coat at the time of measurement. We also found that the use of a laser-guidance system nominally (not statistically) improves inter-observer variability for TC measurements. However the high level of variability even when using laser-guidance essentially negates the clinical usefulness of this method. Overall, the high variability in TC measure-ments made with the GT should be considered when evaluating previous and future studies. The results of our study show that TC measurement is a low fi-delity outcome measure that should be utilised and interpreted cautiously in clinical practice. Even under highly controlled conditions using affixed cadaveric pelvic limbs, large and clinically significant inter- and intra-observer variability was demonstrated. Novel techniques for indirect assessment of thigh muscle mass, such as ultrasonographic measurement of TC should be evaluated for the use in canines to provide a more reliable and accurate outcome measure.

Introduction The stifle is a common source of hindlimb lame- ness in the horse2,3 among many breeds and dis- ciplines. The equine stifle joint is complex and composed of three synovial joint compartments: the femoropatellar (FPJ), (LFTJ) joint compartments.\u00b2 Stifle lameness can originate from any of the three compartments of the stifle, but is most commonly diagnosed in the femoropatellar and medial femorotibial joint compartments. 2,5 Intraarticular injection of the stifle is performed for both diagnostic analgesia and therapeutic treatment, and these injections are typically per- formed using separate approaches into each joint compartment, as communication is known to be variable among compartments. 2,5 Communication between the MFTJ or LFTJ with the FPJ has been documented, with the most common communica- tion being between the MFTJ and FPJ.2,5 A recent investigation demonstrated that lameness originat-ing within a specific compartment of the stifle was most reliably resolved with direct injection into that joint compartment. Therefore, it has been recom- mended to inject each compartment separately and not rely on joint compartment communication. There are many techniques described to inject the three joint compartments of the stifle.\u00b2 However, when compared to a single needle approach, mul- tiple individual approaches require a larger area of aseptic preparation, more than one needle stick, and the multiple needle entry points through skin may increase the risk of infection and risk to the injector as horses react most when the needle penetrates the skin. The single injection approach to the stifle is preferred by many of the clinicians at CSU, as all three synovial compartments can be accessed from one craniolateral site\u00b2; however, a specific description using measurements and ac-curacy of the technique has yet to be reported. Methods Twenty-four cadaver stifles from mid-femur to mid-tibia were collected from horses that were euthanized for reasons unrelated to the stifle joint. Each stifle was placed in a custom leg stand at approximately 145 degrees, based upon the angle measurements determined from the live horses. The technique of needle redirection at a single craniolateral site for injection of the three compartments of the stifle was performed as pre- viously reported.\u00b2 An 8.9 cm 18 gauge spinal nee- dle was inserted between the middle and lateral patellar ligaments, approximately 1-2 cm proximal to the palpable proximal aspect of the tibia and directed towards the axial aspect of the medial femoral condyle to inject the medial femorotibial joint. Once the injector was satisfied, the injection was performed with 15 mL iodinated contrast me-dia and 13 mL tap water that contained 2 mL of food coloring dye. Radiographs were acquired to identify contrast and intra-articular needle tip lo-cation. Next, the needle was retracted and kept within the subcutaneous tissues while redirecting caudally towards the cranial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Once the injector was satisfied, the injection into the lateral femoral tibia joint was performed, and radiographs were repeated. The spinal needle was then redirected proximally into the femoropatellar joint, the compartment was in-jected, and radiographs were obtained. Following A technique of needle redirection at a single craniolateral site for injection of three compartments of the equine stifle joint This is a summary of an article by Drs. M. Herdrich, S. Arrieta, B. Nelson, D. Frisbie, and V. Moorman and is in press at Am J Vet Res. needle placement into each compartment, depth and angles of needle insertion were recorded. After all three injections were completed, the leg stand was placed horizontally on the ground and each joint compartment was opened, starting with the femoropatellar joint. The presence of colored dye within each joint compartment was document-ed and leakage of dye into a subsequent compart- ment during flexion, and additional locations of dye was also recorded. Photographs were taken to document the location of dye. Results Of the 24 stifles, a total of 19 (79.1%) had success- ful injection into all three compartments. A total of 21 (87.5%) medial femorotibial joints, 22 (91.7%) lateral femorotibial joints, and 24 (100%) femoropa- tellar joints were successfully injected. The mean depth of needle insertion for successful injections into the medial femorotibial, lateral femorotibial, and femoropatellar joints were 5.8cm, 5.8cm, 5.6cm, respectively. The mean proximal angle of needle insertion for successful injections was 82\u00b0, 80\u00b0, and 18\u00b0 medial femorotibial, lateral femoropatellar joints, respective-ly (Figure 1). The mean medial-to-lateral angle of needle insertion for successful injections was 28o towards medial, 7o towards lateral, and 1o towards lateral of the medial femorotibial, lateral femorotib-ial, and femoropatellar joints, respectively (Figure 2). In successfully injected joint compartments, the most common intra-articular location for the medi-al femorotibial joint was axially (lateral aspect of the medial condyle), for the lateral femoro-tibial joint was axially (medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle), and for the femoropatellar joint was the middle third of the trochlea.

Of the three compartments, the femoropatellar joint had the highest level of accuracy. Additionally, even though a single compartment was unsuccessfully injected, this did not preclude accurate injection of the other two compartments of the stifle. This investigation also provides general guidelines for needle depth and angle of insertion, as well as documentation of the needle tip within each compartment. This information can be utilized for practitioners learning this stifle in-jection technique.

However, the clinical significance of findings needs to be considered in light of the different con- ditions and orthopaedic pathologic changes occur- ring in different breeds and disciplines. Therefore, in order for veterinarians to more accurately predict future performance and development of disease, the clinical significance of radiological findings of young horses of other breeds and disciplines must be explored. The Western performance industry has grown sig- nificantly in recent years. Subjective papers have been presented regarding pre-purchase examina-tions of Western performance horses. 8,9 Radiolog- ical abnormalities and lameness have been exam- ined in barrel horses and roping horses.10,11 Although most Western performance horses are typically Quarter Horses, their individual disciplines can af-fect the types of stresses they undergo and the clin-ical significance of various radiological findings. 9,12 With this focus on specific disciplines in mind, the first large scale study of prevalence of radiological lesions in repository radiographs of 458 yearling two-year-old Quarter Horse cutting horses was undertaken. 13 The findings of that study form the framework for the follow-up study that will be pre- sented here, comparing the radiological findings to performance outcomes, in a historical cohort study design. The goal of this study was to directly com- pare radiologic findings to performance parame-ters, thereby providing objective data to veterinar-ians and potential buyers about the association of specific radiologic lesions with performance in cut- ting horses. The authors hypothesized that many mild radiologic lesions would not be associated with reduced performance, but that more severe lesions would be more likely to be significant. In particular, the authors hypothesized that grade 3 or 4 lesions of the medial femoral condyle of the stifle and grade 4 lesions of the distal tarsal joints would likely be associated with decreased likelihood of competing and lower average earnings. Methods This study examined radiographs of 343 Quarter Horses. Radiological findings were compared to objective performance outcome parameters. The parameters were: 1) the probability of competing, 2) the probability of earning money as a three-year-old, four-year-old and as a three- and four-year-old combined, 3) average amount of money earned as a three-year-old, four-year-old and as a three- and four-year-old combined. Results Mild osteophytes of the distal aspect of the tarsus were significantly associated with lower average earnings as a four year old. The presence of osteo- phytes of the hind dorsoproximal middle phalanx was significantly associated with increased odds of earn-ing money as a four year old. Radiological lesions of the medial femoral condyle of the stifle were not significantly associated with performance outcome. Conclusions Most radiological abnormalities were not signifi-cantly associated with performance outcome. The significant association of mild tarsal osteophytes and earnings was unexpected. Also, unexpectedly, one radiological finding (osteophytosis of the dorsal proximal interphalangeal joint) was correlated with improved performance outcome.

Introduction Lameness in the stifle is a common diagnosis in performance horses.\u00b2 The first step following the localization of the lameness is to radiograph the joint. Ultrasound, CT and MRI imaging may also be utilized; however these techniques are frequently unavailable, cost prohibitive and require anesthe-tizing the animal. 3-4 Arthroscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing and treating injuries within the joint, but occasionally proves difficult due to the anatomy of the joint and requires specialized equipment and expertise. This article describes the generation of a set of radiographs that will help serve as a guide to evaluate equine stifle injuries. Methods The location of all entheses were determined by gross dissection of 8 cadaver horses with no histo-ry of lameness or associated tibia and fibula, patella and menisci were removed from a single horse, and used as a template for the radiographs. Plastinated menisci, patellar, cruciate collateral and meniscotibial liga-ments were used as guides for locating enthuses within the template, and a barium paste was ap- plied in order to visualize this location on the ra-diograph. A series of 4 radiographs was obtained for each structure and evaluated by a board certi-fied veterinary radiologist. Results A total of 48 radiographic images were produced, representing 4 images for each of the 12 structures examined. While several instances of superimposi- tion were noted, most structures were easily defined by the position of an orthogonal projection (Figure 1). Conclusions Radiography is the most commonly used tool to evaluate the equine stifle. This series of images will serve as a guide for clinicians to interpret avul-sions and enthesopathies in the equine stifle using radiographs.

This variable which includes all reasons why a horse fails to complete a race (including MSI, falls and lost rider) was lower than international fig-ures for race day catastrophic injury. Racing and environmental variables such as horse experience, race distance and season were associated with fail-ure to finish a race. Catastrophic injury accounted for approximately half the failure to finish events. Jockey falls were positively associated with less ex-perienced jockeys and horses. Introduction In recent years there has been much attention focused on the quantification of catastrophic and musculoskeletal injury, and risk factors for those in Thoroughbred flat-racing\u00b2. Epidemiolog-ical studies have emphasized the multifactorial nature of musculoskeletal events and the com-plexity of the issues in reducing the risk factors identified. 3-6 Furthermore the pattern of training, racetrack surfaces, racing conditions and regu-lation (e.g. medication use) vary between racing jurisdiction, resulting in different risk factors and rates of musculoskeletal injury worldwide. It is important to consider each event reported (race day injury, fracture, catastrophic musculoskeletal injury) is part of an integrated continuum of the in-teraction of cyclic load (frequency of high speed/gallop strides) and environmental challenge, and not as discreet entities. 7,8 Failure to finish data incorporate a spectrum of events ranging from jockeys \"pulling-up\", a horse because it was failing to \"run on its merits\" and suspected injury through to catastrophic injury and jockey falls. There is little published information on the number of horses failing to finish races in New Zealand or possible associations relating to horses not finishing races. Additionally, there appears to be limited analysis of risk factors for failure to fin- ish data in racehorse populations and there is an opportunity to gain greater understanding of the events that occur during a race that prevent hors-es from finishing. The aim of this study was to de-scribe the incidence of failure to finish a race and investigate risk factors for failure to finish events pulled-up and lost rider in flat-racing Thorough- breds in New Zealand. Methods A retrospective cohort study was used to inves- tigate all Thoroughbred flat race starts in the six years from 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2011; data were obtained from New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing (NZTR). Data available included race date, race track, race number, race class, race distance, track condition (or 'going'), penetrometer reading, horse name, horse age, horse sex, trainer, train-er location (city), finishing position in race, barrier draw (position in the starting gates), carded weight (weight allocated by race handicapper), carried weight (carded weight less any apprentice weight allowance) and domestic rating (analogous to the British horse racing \"official rating\" system). Failure to finish was classified as: pulled-up (when the jockey pulled the horse out of the race), fell (when the horse fell during the race), lost rider (when the jockey was dislodged from the horse), brought down (when the horse fell due to collision with another fallen horse), and ran off (when the horse ran off to the outside of the racecourse). Data was structured for analyses in Microsoft Excel 2007 and Microsoft Access 2007 and screened for errors using exploratory data analysis. Continuous data were assessed for normality using the Shap- iro-Wilks test. The continuous variables that were categorized into groups included weight carried, Analysis of failure to finish a race in a cohort of Thoroughbred racehorses in New Zealand This is a summary of an article by Drs. Jasmine Tanner, Chris Rogers, Charlotte Bolwell, Naomi Cogger, Erica Gee and Wayne McIlwraith published in Animals.1 race distance and field size. Ratings were allocat- ed for the class of race. The incidence of failure to finish and and corresponding binomial exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated and reported as events per 1000 horse starts for all variables. Failure to finish events were sub-categorised into a pulled-up outcome (presumably encompassing all musculoskeletal injuries as well as other equine problems) and a lost rider outcome. Poisson re- gression was used to estimate incidence rate ra- tios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals for the outcomes failure to finish, pulled-up, and lost rider within the univariable analysis. Variables show-ing association with the outcomes were analysed in multivariable mixed effects Poisson regression models (for each outcome separately) fitted in a backwards step-wise fashion. Results There were 188,616 race starts for 16,646 individual horses during the study period. The data represent-ed 6072 2-year-old starts, 43,228 3-year-old starts and 139,316 4-year-old and older starts. During the study period the horses contributed a median of 7 (IQR 3-16) race starts. There were 544 failure to finish events providing an overall incidence of 2.88 per 1000 horse starts (95% CI 2.64-3.12). There was little variation in the incidence of failure to fin-ish between racing years. Overall there were 269 (49.4%) pulled-up, 72 (13.2%) fell and 179 (32.9%) lost rider events, other failure to finish events were brought down (n = 17) and ran off (n = 7). Two hun-dred sixty-nine horses pulled up equates to 1.46 per thousand starts which is presumably a larger number than actual musculoskeletal injuries (fatal or otherwise). Discussion Internationally musculoskeletal injury reported on race day ranges from 3.1 per 1000 starts [UK data] to 4.4 per 1000 starts [US data], which is greater than the 2.88 per 1000 starts for failure to finish reported in this paper. It is unlikely that errors in re-cording or failure to record events has contributed to this low rate. The restricted sampling frame in this study of the racing event means that some data outside the racing event, such as the loss of a rider prior to race start, provided some under reporting (a horse had to break from the gate to qualify as a race start) as it has been reported elsewhere that 47% of jockey falls in New Zealand occur prior to the race start. The apparent low level of race starts, despite a rel- atively low cost racing structure, maybe due to the use of trials (non-totalisator/qualifying races) by race-horse trainers in New Zealand for education and in the final stages of race preparation. A cross-sectional survey of 2-year-old training practices identified the use of trials for education and training milestones within this age group as well as a strong emphasis in 2-year-old training being for education and condi-tioning purposes rather than with the primary objec- tive of obtaining a race start. 10 Also, racing on turf tracks within a temperate cli- mate, racetrack surfaces in New Zealand are con- sistently reported in the good to dead range of going (61% of races, median penetrometer reading 2.3-2.7). It is only in winter that the median going decreases to heavy (penetrometer reading 4.3). 11 The absence of fast tracks (less than 3% of races run in a year) may also be a protective factor in relation to the reported failure to finish rate, as fast tracks have been reported to be associated with an increased risk for race day musculoskeletal in-jury and fracture 12,13 and race day falls.14 Conclusions Overall, the failure to finish rate was lower than in-ternational figures for race day catastrophic injury. Racing and environmental variables such as horse experience, race distance and season were asso-ciated with failure to finish a race, highlighting the multifactorial nature of race-day events. Investiga-tion of the biological and industry based drivers of the risk factors, particularly season and horse experience are required to identify pragmatic man-agement changes to reduce the risk of failure to finish. Further investigation of risk factors for fail- ure to finish is required to better understand the reasons for a low failure to finish rate in Thorough-bred flat races in New Zealand.

Take home message Heterogeneity of bone density is higher in the third metacarpal bones of horses that sustain condylar fractures. This increased heterogeneity of bone density may increase shear stresses at these sites and predispose these horses to fracture. Introduction Condylar fracture is common in Thoroughbred racehorses and occurs at the parasagittal groove starting at the palmar aspect of the third metacar-pal bone. Consequently, as bone becomes more dense with exercise, the intense remodeling of this bone environment establishes a pathologic means for fracture. The goal of this project was to char-acterize the heterogeneity of bone density within the parasagittal groove as it relates to horses with condylar fracture. Methods Computed tomographic images were acquired from the limbs of 89 horses that were euthanized in the UK. Three groups of limbs were compared: those with a lateral condylar fracture, (n=42) the contralateral nonfractured limb of those same horses (n=42) and condyles from horses that were euthanized for reasons unrelated to third metacar-Qualitative assessment of bone density at the distal articulating surface of the third metacarpal in Thoroughbred racehorses with and without condylar fracture This is a summary of an article by Drs.

The six regions within the condyles were analyzed for heterogeneity of bone density in these areas. Results Bone density was significantly higher in the fractured and nonfractured condyles of horses that sustained a condylar fracture compared to controls. Fractured condyles had an increased heterogeneity in density among the six regions of interest compared to con-trols and contralateral nonfractured condyles. Conclusions A focal increase in bone density heterogeneity were seen in limbs that sustained a condylar fracture. These differences may represent a chronic patholog-ic process that predisposes horses to injury, as signif-icant changes in bone density likely establish areas of intense shear stress that can lead to microdam-age. The accumulation of microdamage can lead to a fracture.

Therefore it was concluded that these different Thoroughbred racing aluminum racing shoes so not have a signif- icant impact on loading and loading rate and that a track surface material and its preparation have a more significant effect on the dynamic loading during the impact phase of the stance. Introduction Safety concerns in horse racing are often focused on surfaces and other variables at the track sur-face-hoof interface.\u00b2 Previous research has demonstrated that surface characteristics, includ-ing composition, cushion depth, moisture in dirt tracks, temperature in synthetic tracks and the ef- fects of maintenance, all influence the mechanics of a surface 3-6. Different surfaces from one facili- ty to the next may provide different performance conditions experienced by the horse and rider. One way that trainers may attempt to control the surface-hoof interface is to use different kinds of horseshoe for various track surfaces and con-ditions. Different horseshoe designs have been developed in an attempt to optimise footing for equine athletes. For example, toe grabs and heel calks at varying heights are used in order to ma- nipulate traction. Other shoes, such as the V-Grip shoe available through Victory Racing Platesa are intended to affect slide and traction in a horse's gait. The performance of these horseshoes is pre-sumed to be dependent on the surface and gait associated with the event but research is limited. The objective of the research presented here was to quantify the dorsoventral (vertical) and cranio-caudal (horizontal) dynamic loading for 3 horse- shoe designs in a controlled laboratory setting. The 3 shoes were tested on common racetrack surface materials using a biomechanical surface tester which simulated the 2 components of fore- limb impact during a gallop: primary impact (the immediate contact of the hoof with the ground) and secondary impact (the subsequent momentary slide and stop). Methods Three different aluminium racing horseshoe de-signs were tested on 2 surface variations. The 2 different type of racetrack surfaces that the shoes were tested on were 1) A dirt sample with high sand and low clay content and 2) synthetic racing material (Polytrackb). The biomechanical hoof was equipped with a 3-axis load cell and 3-axis accelerometer. Prior to the ex- periment described above the shear strength of the samples was characterised using a standard laboratory test for consolidated undrained triaxial compression modified to be drained to better ap-proximate the behaviour of the material in situ for a racetrack. Results The 7\u00b0C synthetic material sample had a higher shear strength and lower cohesion than the 20\u00b0C sample under compacted conditions for drained triaxial test- ing. Whereas, the dirt shear strength is reported at the maximum stress, the synthetic shear strength is reported at 10% stress because the material, unlike the dirt, does not have a clear failure. Dynamic testing of horseshoe designs at impact on synthetic and dirt Thoroughbred racetrack materials This is a summary of an article by Drs. Chrissy Mahaffey, Mick Peterson, Jeff Thomason and Wayne McIlwraith published in Equine Veterinary Journal.1 144 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 145The different horseshoes did not significantly affect loading in either direction. However, the synthetic surface at 20\u00b0C had the highest peak load in both the dorsoventral and craniocaudal direction, followed by the synthetic at 7\u00b0C and then the dirt with the lowest peak dorsoventral and craniocaudal loads. Laborato- ry testing demonstrated strong repeatability. Discussion Under the controlled laboratory conditions for testing a synthetic and a dirt Thoroughbred racetrack mate- rial, horseshoe design did not have a significant im- pact on loading and loading rate with the exception of the V-Grip shoe on a synthetic surface. Although the V-Grip shoe may reduce the craniocaudal peak load rates of the biomechanical surface tester the reduction in load rate is still less than the difference found between different track materials and surface conditions. However, it should be noted that uneven localized loading of the shoe attachment points with the hoof may still make an important difference to the stresses and strains experienced by the horse. Therefore, while shoeing does not have a significant effect under controlled testing on the impact with the surface in most cases it may still have an effect on the performance and safety of the horse.

Particularly, this study enhances previously existing literature regarding the relationships of the meniscal root attachments to landmarks that will be useful for future biomechanical, surgical, and in vitro studies utilizing the rabbit stifle joint as a translational model for human knee joint degenerative diseases. Introduction It has only become recently recognized that the me- niscal root attachments provide an essential role in knee joint health\u00b2. By attaching the menisci to the tib-ial plateau, the meniscal roots facilitate the dispersion of axial loads into hoop stresses\u00b2. Previous studies have used rabbits to study the effects of a complete medial meniscectomy on the development of osteo- arthritis and have reported comparable effects in shorter time periods than humans after meniscecto-my 3,4. However, the effectiveness of a rabbit model as a translational model for meniscal root tears needs to be further investigated and compared to recent ana- tomical studies on the human meniscal roots 5-8. Before in vivo experiments in rabbits are carried out, the anat-omy of the meniscal roots needs to be understood to determine the feasibility of translating the findings into clinically significant results for humans. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively define the meniscal root anatomy in New Zealand white rabbits modeling previous meniscal root anatomy studies in humans 5,6. Reproducible and consistent measurements for the meniscal root attachments and their proximity to bony landmarks will provide an anatomic basis for further translational research in a New Zealand white rabbit model. It was hypothesized that the quantitative anat-omy of the New Zealand white rabbit stifle would be reproducible and thus confirm the usage of this spe- cies for future animal research on the progression of osteoarthritis following meniscal root tears. Methods Ten non-paired fresh frozen New Zealand white rabbit knee stifle joints were carefully disarticulated for this study. Measurements were made for all bony land-marks and ligamentous structure attachment sites on the tibial plateau.

These findings need to be considered when positioning for tibial tunnel cre-ation in ACL reconstruction to avoid damage to the ALMR insertion. Introduction Over the past decade, there has been an increas-ing emphasis on anatomic anterior cruciate liga-ment (ACL) reconstruction to best restore knee kinematics after an ACL tear. However, recent in-vestigations of anatomic ACL reconstruction have highlighted concern over iatrogenic of terior meniscal root insertions caused by (ALMR) insertion 2,3. To further the quantitative anatomy of the insertion relationship, LaPrade et al reported that, on aver-age, 41% of the ACL insertion area and 63% of the ALMR insertion area overlapped with one another. Microscopic studies of the tibial insertion site have been previously conducted to investigate quantities of fibrocartilaginous zones to relate biomechanical properties of the insertion 5,6,7,8; however, the authors are unaware of any study that has microscopical-ly evaluated the fibrocartilaginous insertion of the tibial insertion with respect to the ALMR insertion, particularly in the sagittal and coronal planes. Methods A total of 10 fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees from 5 male and 5 female specimens were used with a mean age of 52.7 years (range, 33-63 years) and mean body mass index of 22.4 kg/m2 (range, 15-34 kg/m2), and knees that displayed macroscopic degenerative changes or evidence of trauma, such as osteoarthritis, meniscal tears, or ligament injuries, were excluded. Briefly, the samples were placed in Overlap between anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and anterolateral meniscal root insertions; a scanning electron microscopy study This is a summary of an article by Drs.

The samples were then submerged in 10% formic acid to decalcify at room temperature. After decalcification, the samples were immersed in a 1% tannic acid solution buffered with 0.05 M caco-dylate (pH 7.2) for 4 hours and then rinsed in distilled water for 24 hours. Samples were then dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) for 10 minutes each and cut into 2-mm sections. Once sectioned, the samples were placed in ascending concentrations of hex- amethyldisilazane for 10 minutes each. The samples were then dried and stored in a vacuum desiccator. Samples were mounted onto a stub with conductive double- sided tape and copper tape with the sur- face of interest facing up toward the electron beam. The samples were then coated with 10 nm gold and scanned with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc) in the secondary electron emission mode with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Results Four-phase insertion fibers of the tibial ACL were identified directly medial to the ALMR insertion as they attached onto the tibial plateau. The mean per- centage of ACL fibers overlapping the ALMR inser-tion instead of inserting into subchondral bone in the coronal and sagittal planes was 41.0% 6 8.9% and 53.9% 6 4.3%, respectively. The percentage of in-sertion overlap in the sagittal plane was significantly higher than in the coronal plane (P = .02). Conclusions This study demonstrated significant overlap of the ALMR insertion by the tibial ACL insertion in the coronal and sagittal planes and supplements a previous study's evaluation of the overlapping relationship insertion ar-eas. As the ACL inserted into tibial subchondral bone, lateral portion of the ACL overlapped the ALMR in-sertion in both the planes, on aver-age, by 41.0% and 53.9%, respectively. Previous studies showing iatrogenic damage to the ALMR insertion and the results of this study illustrate the intricacy of this re- lationship, and further studies should determine what amount of ALMR insertion disruption is acceptable for a clinically successful ACL reconstruction procedure.

It appears that the response to training load can outweigh subtle-ties of early fracture formation and sequential im-aging is probably needed to make CT density mea-surements useful as a biomarker. Introduction Catastrophic injuries of the MCIII and suspen-sory apparatus are the most common cause of death in Thoroughbred racehorses. 2,3 Condylar fractures most commonly involve the lateral con-dyle of McIII or MtIII and they represent a stress induced overload injury in racehorses. The frac-tures are also believed to be result of underly-ing microstructural changes in the bone of the palmar aspect of the epiphysis of McIII or plantar aspect of the epiphysis of MtIII. 5-7 These chang- es could be induced by excessive cyclic loading during long accumulative distances of training or when the bone had not previously been exposed to maximal loading conditions. It has previously been shown that the distal epiphysis of McIII re-sponds dynamically to exercise in Thoroughbreds with significant increases of volumetric bone min-eral density (BMDv) of trabecular bone (37%) in contrast to an observed 1.6% increase in BMDv of diaphyseal cortical bone. However, regions of high mineral content can be brittle and frac-ture lines can pass through areas of highly dense bone. Additionally, abnormal microscopic fea-tures such as microcracking microfracture, and evidence of osteoclastic remodeling have been found in dense regions of the palmar aspect of the epiphysis of McIII. 10-11 The combination of pQCT and spatial statistics has been used to provide a detailed quantita-tive description of BMDv responses to exercise in young Thoroughbreds, 12 Quantitative descrip- tion of the response to training load with serial CT scans is an opportunity to provide evidence of se- rious early structural (pathological) change, which could prove useful in a clinical environment. The purpose of this study was to compare region- al proportions and spatial distributions of BMDv within loaded regions of the palmar aspect of the distal epiphysis of the McIII between Thorough-bred racehorses with or without condylar frac-tures of that bone. Methods Archived limbs from Thoroughbred racehorses with a condylar fracture (n=6 limbs) and control limbs from Thoroughbred racehorses without a condylar fracture of the McIII (8) were available for analysis. Donors of nonfractured limbs were cho-sen to match donors of fractured limbs on the ba-sis of age, sex, limb and number of starts. The pQCT images of the distal epiphysis were ob- tained with a pQCT scannera and these methods have been described elsewhere. 13 Twenty contigu- ous scans (voxel size, 0.5 mm) were obtained and each CT image was then divided into 6 palmar ROIs to account for the contact area of the proxi-mal sesamoid bones on McIII and for the anatomic locations of the condylar fractures. Results No significant differences were identified between limbs with and without condylar fractures of McIII with respect to sex, age, total starts, or limb side of the associated horses. Median number of race starts were 6, and median age were 4 years. No significant differences were identified between fractured and nonfractured limbs for any spatial analysis statistic.Quantitative comparison of bone mineral density characteristics of the distal epiphysis of third metacarpal bones from Thoroughbred racehorses with or without condylar fracture This is a summary of an article by Drs.

For the L2P ROI region of interest where lat-eral condylar fractures occur, significant (P < 0.01) strong to marked clustering (I = 0.075 to 0.93) of high BMDv was identified in all fractured condyles and significant (P 0.01) weak to strong clustering (I = 0.39 to 0.90) of high BMDv was identified for 7 nonfractured condyles. Discussion The horses from which fractured and nonfractured MCIIIs were obtained for the present study repre- senting a fairly homogenous group with respect to age and number of race starts but we were lack - ing in data describing the training program and the temporal fat between periods of rest and ac-cumulated fast exercise. Consistency of the racing and training environment within New Zealand may have helped reduce between horse variations. Previous work by this group has revealed the ra- pidity of bone response to race training stimuli and the sensitivity of pQCT to detect these changes in horses. 8,12,13 The location and nature of the response in the distal epiphysis of McIII are dependent on the magnitude and frequency of the training load. It is thought that the placement of the ROI on either side of the fracture line in the study reported here could have decreased the sensitivity of the results. This was done to avoid low BMDv artifacts result-ing from a voxel-sharing effect within the fracture gasp on all images of fractured condyles and mi- crostructural changes around fracture lines could have been missed. These horses were all three year old or older and had raced representing a more mature age of bone remodeling in controls as well as fractured horses. Spatial analysis identi- fied clusters of low BMDv within high BMDv which may have represented focal areas of porosity in both limb grounds. Training data and serial images would be important to obtain a greater understand- ing of the relationship to load, bone response and fracture risk. Conclusions BMDv characteristics of the distal epiphysis of McIII reflected training load and fractured characteristics were subtle. Serial imaging techniques in connection with detailed training load are required to elucidate the onset of pathologic response to load in horses.

This strain dependence can be included in computational models of skeletal muscle performance with a fully nonlinear hypervis- coelastic model. Introduction As skeletal muscle is non-linear2,3 and time depen- dent4,5, this makes manually detecting proper resting length via passive muscle tension a challenge. To improve simulations such as finite element analyses, which can aid in surgical procedures by identifying proper muscle tension, we must first develop a com-plete understanding of the time and strain dependent properties of skeletal muscle. Many recent investiga- tions into skeletal muscle properties have focused on hyperelastic material properties 2,3,6,7,8. However, the number of studies examining the time dependency are limited to compressive conditions 8,9,10,11,12, single fiber4,13 or whole muscle investigations14,15,16, or utilize a linear or quasi-linear viscoelastic response5,17. Thus, the goals of this study were to (1) examine the time and strain dependent material properties of skeletal muscle tissue subjected to consecutive stress relax- ation cycles and to (2) implement a fully nonlinear hy- perviscoelastic model to capture muscle nonlinearity in both time independent modulus and viscoelastic relaxation behavior under passive tensile conditions. Methods Longitudinal (along the fiber direction) load-relax- ation tests were performed on nine tibialis anterior (TA) muscle samples harvested from nine New Zea-land White rabbits (one sample per animal). Speci- mens were 22.0 \u00b1 4.1 mm long and 5.4 \u00b1 1.0 mm wide as measured with digital calipers. A pre-stress con-dition corresponding to 0.1% of the ultimate stress of the muscle by direction was applied. Samples were subject to five load-relaxation cycles of 0.7 mm Skeletal muscle tensile strain dependence: hyperviscoelastic nonlinearity This is a summary of Drs. B.B. Wheatley, D.A. Morrow, G.M. Odegard, K.R. Kaufman, and T.L. Haut Donahue, and was published in The Journal of Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials. 1 Figure 1: Midbelly specimens were excised from the tibialis anterior (A) along the fiber direction (vertical arrow), loaded, and tested in a material testing system with thin film grips (B). Figure 2: Stress-strain data for all peak (black diamonds) and equilibrium (red circles) data from all nine samples. Note the nonlinear behavior for both peak and equilibrium responses in addition to the dispersed strain values. (mean strain of 0.031 \u00b1 0.002 standard error of mean) followed by a 300-second relaxation period. Individ- ual relaxation steps were fit with a three-term linear Prony series. Prony series coefficients and relaxation ratio were assessed for strain dependence using a general linear statistical model. A fully nonlinear con- stitutive model was employed to capture the strain dependence of both the viscoelastic and instanta- neous components. Results Instantaneous modulus (p<0.0005) and mid-range relaxation (p<0.0005) increased significantly with strain level, while relaxation at longer time periods decreased with strain (p<0.0005). Time constants and overall relaxation ratio did not change with strain level (p>0.1). Additionally, the fully nonlinear hypervis-coelastic constitutive model provided an excellent fit to experimental data, while other models which in- cluded linear components failed to capture muscle function as accurately. Conclusions This study shows that the viscoelastic response of skel-etal muscle depends significantly upon strain level as evaluated by comparison of the relaxation response of five consecutive load-relaxation cycles. Furthermore, a novel fully nonlinear model including both an explicit hyperelastic strain energy density function and a strain dependent viscoelastic formulation provided an excel- lent fit to experimental data. To capture the complete range of muscle tensile behavior, the non-linearity of both the time dependent and time independent prop- erties must be modeled.

Iatrogenic injury of attachments ligament Surg Sports Trauma- tol Arthrosc. 2014;23(8):2360-2366Take home message Comparing longitudinal results from two models of combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal injury, show that traumatic induction of tissue in-jury is more representative of the clinical scenario and should be considered for use in future studies of Post-traumatic Osteo-arthritis. Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is becom-ing more widely accepted as a whole joint disease where changes occur progressively across all tissues As such, it is important to monitor temporal changes and assess multiple tissues, including articular car-tilage, meniscus, and subchon-dral bone. Trauma to the joint can cause an early onset of osteoarthritis, known as post traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Noncontact injuries such as jump landings\u00b2 as well as plant-ing and twisting motions\u00b3 often result in a combined meniscal and ACL injury. Many previous studies have focused on injury to either the ACL or the me-niscus 4,5 but few studies have combined these initial clinical injuries. The objective of the current study was to compare mechanical and histological changes in the meniscus and articular cartilage between two lapine models of knee joint Comparison of two models of post-traumatic osteoarthritis; temporal degradation of articular cartilage and menisci This is a summary of an article by Drs. K.M. Fischenich, K.D. Button, C. DeCamp, R.C. Haut, and T.L.

Methods This study was approved by the All-University Committees on Animal Use and Care at Michi-gan State University and Colora-do State University. Thirty-three mature Flemish Giant rabbits (5.42 \u00b1 0.57 kg) aged 9-12 months were used in this study. The animals were random-ly separated into two groups, ACLF or mACLT, and three time points, 4, 8, or 12 weeks, for a total of six groups. Right limbs were injured, and the left limbs served as unaffected controls. Animals in the ACLF group un- derwent a single impact to the tibiofemoral joint. With the joint flexed 90, a mass was used to strike the distal femur causing ACL rupture and other acute joint damage. A drawer test was performed to verify ACL rupture. Animals in the mACLT group underwent surgical tran-section of the ACL, and both the medial and lateral menisci were damaged with radial and longi- tudinal cuts created with a scal- pel in an attempt to generally mimic the acute joint damages in the ACLF model. Indentation relaxation tests were performed on both tissues in a room tem- perature, 0.9% phosphate-buff-ered saline fol- lowing mechanical evaluation. the articular carti-lage was histologically graded by four blind graders in three categories (GAG coverage, fis- sures, and tidemark integrity) using a modified Mankin scale, previously described. Results Both models resulted in dam-age indicative of osteoarthritis, including decreased meniscal mechanics and GAG coverage, increased permeability and fis- suring of articular cartilage, and decreased GAG coverage. The mACLT model had an early and lasting effect on the menisci mechanics and GAG coverage, Figure 2: Averages and standard deviations of various data from the tibial ACLF * Denotes significant difference (p < 0.05) from control.while cartilage damage was not significantly affected until 12 weeks. The ACLF model result- ed in an earlier change of artic- ular cartilage GAG coverage and fissuring in both the 8 and 12 week groups. The menisci were only significantly affected at the 12 week time point in the ACLF model. Conclusions Both models caused changes to the articular cartilage and menis-ci indicative of PTOA, but the pro- gression and severity of changes differed between models. Be-cause of the limited sample size in each model at various time points, the current results are in-formative but preliminary in a sta-tistical sense, and suggest future studies are warranted to directly correlate data between models at each time point. The mACLT model, however, was noted to have the earliest effect on menis-ci mechanics and GAG coverage, sporadic changes to the articu- lar cartilage mechanics, and late changes to the articular cartilage GAG coverage and overall fis-suring of its surface. The ACLF model resulted in more gradual changes with GAG coverage of articular cartilage decreasing and fissures increasing in the mid to late time points, while the menis-ci were affected more at the later time points. For this reason, de-pending on the objective of the study, one model may be pref- Figure 3: Averages and standard deviations of meniscal ence (p < 0.05) from control.

Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease that is currently under investigation for treatment with gene therapy. There is no cure for OA, only palliative treat- ments to relieve pain and inflammation associated with the disease.\u00b2 Viral vectors such as adenovirus- es, retroviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have been examined in gene therapy trials, many of which express genes for anabolic factors, catabolic antagonists and molecules involved in the regulation of free radicals, transcription and apoptosis.\u00b2 AAV, specifically, is a model vector for gene therapy due to its lack of pathogenesis, ability to infect multiple cell types and ability to promote long term gene ex- pression. 3-4 IGF-I is one of many anabolic factors that has been associated with cartilage repair.5-6 This ar- ticle describes the use of an AAV therapeutic gene vector to deliver IGF-1 in vitro. Methods An optimized nucleotide sequence for IGF-I was developed and purchased from a commercial com- pany. This sequence was put into a mammalian ex- pression vector to ensure its expression in tissues, and further put into a self-complementary AAV (se- rotype 2) vector (scAAV2). Cartilage was aseptically collected from the trochlear ridge of cadaver horses aged between 2-5 years. The tissue was digested to obtain cells (chondrocytes) which were then plated in culture for 3 days. Chondrocytes were transduced with the scAAV2IGF-I for 4 hours, and placed back in culture for 7 days. At this point the culture media was collected for ELISA analysis, and the cells were collected for RNA analysis. Media samples were evaluated for IGF-I and collagen, type 2 protein content using commercially available ELISA kits, as well as for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content using a dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB) spectral analysis. mRNA was isolated from the trans-duced chondrocytes and converted to cDNA for PCR analysis, also using commercially available kits. PCR data was analyzed using the comparative Ct method with 18S as the housekeeping gene. Results Cells genetically modified with scAAV2IGF-I se- creted significantly higher extracellular levels of IGF-I and collagen, type 2, but insignificant lev- els of GAG than did those used as negative and positive controls (Figure1). There were 885 genes that were significantly upregulated and 1,320 that were significantly downregulated in cells transduc-ed with the scAAV2IGF-I compared to the positive and negative controls. These genes are further divided into \"GO\" categories (gene ontology), rep- resenting the behavior of a group of genes with a specific cellular function. The genes that were significantly upregulated, including IGF-I and nu- merous types of collagen, are primarily associated with the extracellular matrix, cartilage develop-ment and chondrocyte differentiation; such pro-teins are often associated with healthy cartilage and increased chondrocyte graft incorporation into full thickness cartilage defects. 7 Significant- ly downregulated genes, including aggrecanase type 1 and MMP1, are primarily associated with cell death and apoptosis. Conclusions Therapeutic use of scAAVIGF-I as a gene therapy vector provides a clinically relevant increase in IGF-I that is conducive to cartilage healing.

Introduction A number of publications have assessed equine mesenchymal stem (stromal) cell (MSC) therapy as a treatment for musculoskeletal injuries in the horse2,3, the majority focusing on the use of autologous MSCs derived from adult tissues 2,4-6. The efficacy of au- tologous MSCs is supported by clinical studies in horses 5,7 and experimental evidence that suggests intra-articular therapy at 4 weeks (the period of time required for MSC isolation and expansion) can be beneficial to articular cartilage repair. However, earlier treatment might be advantageous in some instances and allogeneic MSCs (allo-MSCs) offer an immediately available treatment. There have been recent preclinical studies of equine allo-MSCs 9-11, but no reports on the safety and efficacy of this therapy in the horse. MSCs display 2 important properties related to the host immune system that might contribute positively to their effects following transplantation, namely im-munomodulatory effects and lack of immunogenici- ty 12. Absence of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecule and co-stimulatory antigen CD86 on the surface of equine MSCs has been suggested as preventing triggering of an immune response. The aim of the work here was to determine their immu- noregulatory effects of equine bone-marrow derived MSCs and their influence on the T-cell subsets in an in vitro system prior to clinical application. Methods Phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 3 Thoroughbreds (recipients) were co-cultured with BM- from 3 Connemara and horses were haplotyped using microsatellites to con-firm mismatching. Optimisation of the lymphocytes of equine anti-CD4 and Connemara and BM- MSCs were isolated, expanded and characterised by tri-lineage differentiation. Finally, BM-MSCs from both breeds were set up in co-culture at different ra- tios with stimulated Thoroughbred lymphocytes. Pro- liferation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells was determined by flow cytometry. Results A high proportion of CD4/CD8-positive lympho- cytes were found in freshly isolated PBMCs al- though the percentage decreased after 4 days of culture. Mismatched BM-MSCs inhibited prolif- eration of stimulated lymphocytes in a dose-de-pendent manner, with the greater suppression occurring at a 1:10 ratio of BM-MSCs to PBMCs. Proliferation of CD4+ 1:10 with statistical signif- icance in the case of CD8 cells, while that of the CD4/CD8 double-positive population was similar to the phytohaemagglutinin control. Conclusions The results demonstrate dose-dependent immu- nosuppression of stimulated lymphocytes by mis- matched equine future application in allo-MSCs clinical treatment.

Conventionally dex is used in laboratory studies at a concentration of 100 nM. This study demonstrate that the concen- tration of dex could be reduced 100-fold without af- fecting chondrogenesis. Introduction Mesenchymal stem cells possess favorable prop-erties for cartilage tissue engineering as they can be readily culture-expanded, and secrete robust quantities of cartilage-like extracellular matrix (ECM) after seeding into scaffolds and culture in the appropriate biochemical environment in vitro. Dex is an important chondroinductive agent that is known to improve MSC chondrogenesis in vitro 2, and may support cartilage repair if delivered to defect sites along with MSC-seeded grafts. How-ever, the design of in vivo delivery is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding the minimum dose of dex that can support robust chondrogen-esis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dex concentration on MSC chondrogenesis using a laboratory model. Also, the effect of timing of administration was investi- gated by withdrawal or delaying inclusion of dex in culture medium. Methods MSCs were isolated from bone marrow aspirates from the iliac crest of 2-5 year old horses. Cul- ture-expanded MSCs were seeded into agarose hydrogel, and maintained in baseline chondrogen-ic medium consisting of high-glucose Dulbecco modified Eagle 1% ITS+ ascorbate-2-phosphate, 5 ng/ml recombinant human transforming growth fac-tor-12. Cultures were maintained in 1 or 100 nM Dex, or in Dex-free medium. After 15 days of cul- ture samples were evaluated for ECM accumula- tion including histology, gene expression of genes chondrogenesis, and secre- tion of prostaglandin E2. Results Extracellular matrix accumulation was not signifi- cantly different between 1 and 100 nM dexameth-asone, but was suppressed ~40% in dexameth- asone-free cultures (Fig. 1). Accumulated ECM stained positive for type II collagen. Prostaglandin E2 secretion, and expression of catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase 13, and type X collagen was generally lowest in 100 nM dexa- methasone and not significantly different between 1 nM and dexamethasone-free cultures. Dexameth-asone could be withheld for at least 2 days with- out affecting ECM accumulation, while withdrawal studies suggested that dexamethasone supports ECM accumulation beyond day 6. Effects of Dexamethasone concentration and timing of exposure on chondrogenesis of equine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells This is a summary of an article by Drs. John Kisiday and Suwimol Tangtrongsup published in Cartilage.\u00b9 Figure 1. Extracellular matrix accumulation after 15 days of chondrogenic culture. For each assay different letters denote significant differences (p<0.05).Conclusions One nM dex was sufficient to support chondrogen- esis and robust cartilage-like ECM accumulation despite not having an effect on prostaglandin 2 se- cretion, which suggests that the positive influence of dex is not due to anti-inflammatory properties. While early exposure to dexamethasone was not critical, sustained exposure of at least a week appears to be necessary to maximize ECM accumulation.

Introduction Intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) is a com- monly used technique for delivering high concentrations of antibiotics to the distal limb of horses while decreasing adverse effects2,3. Local anesthetics are commonly used in distal limb IVRLPs for both cattle and humans4-6. One previous study had evaluated the concurrent use of ami- kacin sulfate and mepivacaine hydrochloride in IVRLP, and found no change in the propensity of the horse to move its limb or amikacin levels in joint fluid. However, the study did not seek to investigate the ability of me- pivacaine hydrochloride to alter nociceptive thresholds distal to the tourniquet or to determine the antimicrobial activity of the synovial fluid samples after using the com- bination mepivacaine and amikacin. The objectives of this study were to determine the ef- fects of the addition of mepivacaine hydrochloride to a regional limb perfusion of amikacin sulfate on synovial fluid amikacin concentrations, synovial fluid antimicro- bial activity, and on sensation distal to the tourniquet. Methods The study was completed in 9 healthy, adult horses. After sedation with detomidine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/kg IV) and butorphanol mg/kg IV), an Esmarch tourniquet was applied proximal to the carpus. One IVRLP treatment was randomly adminis- tered by cephalic vein to each limb: amikacin alone (1 g amikacin in 60 mL saline) or amikacin with mepiv- acaine (1 g amikacin and 500 mg mepivacaine in 60 mL saline). Opposite treatments were repeated after a 24 hour wash-out period. Amikacin concentration and antimicrobial activity were determined for synovial fluid taken from the middle carpal joints at tourniquet removal and 30 minutes following tourniquet removal. Zone of inhibi- tion was determined for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and amikacin concentration was de- termined using high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. nociceptive thresholds (MNTs) were determined at 3 dorsal metacarpal locations prior to and after se- dation, after Esmarch tourniquet application, and 30 minutes after IVRLP prior to and after tourniquet re- moval using a pressure algometer (Wagner Force Dial FDK/FDN Series Force Gage, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT) as previously described 8,9. The effects of mepivacaine hydrochloride on antimicrobial activity and mechanical nociceptive threshold during amikacin sulfate regional limb perfusion in the horse This is a summary of an article by Drs. Aim\u00e9e Colbath, Luke Wittenburg, Jenifer Gold, Wayne McIlwraith and Valerie Moorman published in Veterinary Surgery.\u00b9 Results Two limbs from each treatment group were removed because of undetectable amikacin concentrations for a total of 14 data sets analyzed. Synovial fluid ami- kacin concentrations (Table 1) and zone of inhibition (Table 2) were not significantly different between treatments at any time point. MNTs were significantly increased 30 minutes after IVRLP prior to and following tourniquet removal us- ing (19.5 \u00b5g/mL, 18.7-25.6 and 15.3, 13.2-20.5, respectively) (Table 3). Conclusions The results of our study suggest that the addition of mepivacaine hydrochloride to amikacin sulfate for IVRLP did not negatively affect synovial fluid con- centrations of amikacin or synovial fluid antimicrobial action up to 60 minutes IVRLP. The addition of me- pivacaine hydrochloride was successful in increasing the MNT of the dorsal metacarpus. Therefore, mepiva-caine hydrochloride alone or in combination with ami- kacin sulfate may be valuable in producing analgesia of the distal limb in the horse.

There is still a great deal of research needed to determine the most advantageous methods for promoting healing and repair in joint tissues. Introduction Joint disease has been characterized as an organ dis- ease in which there is multiple tissue involvement.\u00b2 Treatment of joint disease is a well-recognized problem as there is often a deficit of growth factors and anticat-abolics associated with the tissues most often involved with this disease. Small molecules have been used alone and in combination with surgery and additional biologics as an aid in healing injured joint tissues.\u00b3 This article provides a summary of the most commonly used biological approaches to repairing, halting and minimiz-ing the progression of joint disease. Methods Specific growth factors, when used alone or in combi- nation with surgery or individual biologics, have been the focus of study for improving cartilage health and repair. Such growth factors include bone morphogen-ic proteins (BMP-2), insulin like growth factors (IGF-I), fibroblastic growth factors (FGF), platelet derived growth factors growth factors (TGF), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and transcription factors such as SOX9. Individual biologics have also been used in combina- tion with growth factors for the treatment of a wide range of joint disease. These treatments are harvest- ed from the animal's own blood or cells, and include the use of autologous conditioned serum (ACS), plate-let rich protein (PRP), concen- trates (BMAC) and autologous protein serum (APS). Gene therapy has also been utilized as a method of increasing proteins made from genes delivered using viral vectors such as adenovirus, adenoassociated vi-rus as well as other vectors. Results Growth factors, when administered on their own, can often result in beneficial outcomes, such as Small molecules alone or in combination to treat joint disease and progress toward gene therapy This is a summary of an article by Drs. Laurie Goodrich and Wayne McIlwraith published in Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics.\u00b9increased extracellular matrix production and pro- liferation of progenitor cells; however, some also have negative consequences when given at too high or too low of a dose.4-6 These include an in- crease in synovial thickening and fibrosis, specifi- cally with TGFbeta.7-8 Biological treatments have also proved beneficial in that they are harvested from the animal's own blood or cells, and more closely mimic the body's inherent approach to wound healing. Concerns that often arise with the use of these biologics in-clude the effectiveness in older, more advanced OA populations and long term beneficial effects. Gene therapy has become increasingly popular as a therapeutic treatment for OA in both humans and animals (Figure1). Over the years there have been a number of vectors with which gene therapy was accomplished; however adeno-associated viruses have become the vector of choice for orthopedic is-sues. They exhibit a low immunogenicity, long term protein production and ease of vector production. Conclusions Providing therapeutic healing through the use of growth factors and biologics is developing rapidly. While there is strong evidence to suggest that these therapies can be extremely beneficial, there is still quite a bit of research to be done in order to determine the most effective use of these methods to maximize joint repair and healing at all stages of joint disease.

This suggests allogeneic equine BMDMSCs may be a valuable stem cell source for the treatment of mus- culoskeletal disease in the horse. Introduction Although there are multiple sources of stem cells in the horse, BMDMSCs are commonly used for mus- culoskeletal injury\u00b2 and have been found to have increased chondrogenic abilities when compared to adipose-derived MSCs\u00b3. However, expansion of MSCs has multiple clinical disadvantages. Currently, BMDMSCs require 2-4 weeks for culture expansion before treatment may be pursued. This process is expensive and time consuming. Additionally, there is some evidence that BMDMSCs from diseased or older donors may be of decreased quality 4,5. Allogeneic (non-self) BMDMSCs may by pro-viding an \"off-the-shelf\" treatment, allowing for immedi- ate treatment and careful selection of superior cells from young, healthy donors. However, the immune properties of allogeneic stem cells must be examined prior to the incorporation of these cells into clinical practice. Previous studies have found allogeneic BMDMSCs capable of immune suppression in vitro 6-8. In addi- tion, these cells have been used clinically with a low rate of joint flare and clinical success 9,10. However, we are unaware of any study that has directly compared the immune properties of allogeneic and autologous BMDMSCs in vitro. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the immunomodulatory properties of autologous and allogeneic equine BMDMSCs and to identify the mechanism for the immunosuppres-sive properties of allogeneic BMDMSCs. Methods We conducted studies to assess the immunological properties of equine allogeneic BMDMSCs compared with those of autologous BMDMSCs. For assessment of inherent immunogenicity, the relative ability of allogene- ic and autologous BMDMSCs to stimulate spontaneous proliferation of equine lymphocytes was compared. This was performed by co-incubating polymorphic mono- nuclear cells (PBMCs) with BMDMSCs for lymphocyte proliferation using carboxyfluo-rescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Cell Trace; Thermo Fischer Scientific), and analysis by flow cytometry. The immunosuppressive activity of autologous and allogeneic BMDMSCs was evaluated by adding au- to activated lym-Autologous and allogeneic equine mesenchymal stem cells exhibit equivalent immunomodulatory properties in vitro This is a summary of an article by Drs.

Fifty-six and 12 autologous combinations were evaluated. In addition, assays were performed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which equine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suppress lymphocyte function. Potential mechanisms evaluated included production of pros-taglandin E 2 (PGE2), nitric oxide, transforming growth factor-beta, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Inhib-itors for each of the pathways were added to co-cul-tures of stimulated PBMCs and BMDMSCs and lym-phocyte proliferation was measured using CFSE by flow cytometry. Once the mechanism of immune suppression was identified as prostaglandin- E 2 (PGE2) mediated, PGE2 levels were measured in the supernatants of untreated MSCs and PBMC cocultures as well as cocultures treated with a PGE2 inhibitor. Data was collected using a commercially available ELISA (PGE 2 Parameter Assay Kit, R&D systems\u00ae) per the Results Immunogenicity testing revealed autologous and allogeneic BMDMSCs both induced mild but equiv- alent levels of spontaneous lymphocyte activation in vitro. Increased lymphocyte proliferation was only found at ratios of 1 autologous MSC per 10 PBMCs, or 1 allogeneic MSC per 10 or 50 PBMCs (P<0.05) (Figure 1). When immune suppressive ability was compared, a statistically significant and equivalent immune suppression was noted for autologous and alloge- neic BMDMSCs at 1 MSC per 10 PBMCs (Figure 2). Likewise, IFN expression by PBMCs decreased in a dose dependent manner with the addition of allogeneic and autologous MSCs, and allogeneic and autologous BMDMSCs had equivalent IFN suppression (Figure 3). Finally, we found that incubation of MSCs with acti- vated PBMCs in the presence of an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway, indomethacin, resulted in a significant reversal of the immune suppres-sive effects of allogeneic MSCs (Figure 4). This indicates that allogeneic BMDMSCs use the cyclo- oxygenase pathway as a mechanism of immune Figure 1. Lymphocyte proliferation assay: Relative nonimmunogenic at low ratios of MSCs:PBMCs. No difference was detected between the immunogenicity of autologous and allogeneic MSCs at any ratio. However, a small degree of immunogenicity was noted when autologous MSCs were added at a ratio of 1:10, and allogeneic MSCs were added at ratios of were immunosuppressive, shown by a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation at a ratio of 1 MSC per 10 PBMCs.

PGE2 lev- els in supernatants from MSCs/PBMCs cocultures treated with indomethacin showed a significant decrease in PGE 2 (P<0.05) confirming indometha- cin effectively blocked the PGE2 pathway. Conclusions Autologous BMDMSCs are extensively used for the treatment of equine tendonitis, desmitis and osteo-arthritis in the horse. Although allogeneic BMDMSCs could be a more convenient, cost-effective, and po-tentially increase the quality of cells by donor selec-tion, little is known about their immune properties compared to autologous BMDMSCs. To determine whether allogeneic or autologous BMDMSCs elicited an immune response from PBMCs, cells were co-cultured and lymphocyte proliferation assessed. We found a small, but equivalent amount of lymphocyte proliferation at high ratios of MSCs to PBMCs. In contrast, when MSCs were co-cultured with stimulated PBMSCs, MSCs were noted to be immu-nosuppressive causing a decrease in lymphocyte pro-liferation. Previous in vitro studies using human and equine BMDMSCs support our findings demonstrat-ing an increase in the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs preactivated with IFN and a decrease in pro-duction of inflammatory cytokines when MSC media was used to treat stimulated PBMCs 11,12. Our study demonstrated the source of the MSCS (allogeneic or autologous) is not an important vari- able in determining the degree of immune sup- pression in vitro. This finding could have significant clinical implications as allogeneic BMDMSCs may be a more convenient and less expensive product for the treatment of musculoskeletal disease in the horse. This study suggests that further in vivo stud- ies are warranted to compare the behavior of allo- geneic and autologous cells within the normal and inflamed joint. The pathway of MSC immunosuppression has been investigated in the human, murine, and canine 13-15. Our study found that only PGE2 was an important me- diator of immunosuppression by allogeneic BMDM-SCs. This finding is in agreement with a previous study which investigated the role of interleukin-6, nitric oxide, and PGE 2 as mediators of immunosup- pression by allogeneic BMDMSCs. Based on our findings, we suggest that further re- search should be conducted in vivo to compare the relative clinical benefits of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties of allogeneic and au-tologous BMDMSCs. In allogeneic and autologous BMDMSCs appear to be equally immuno-suppressive in vitro. It also appears that equine MSCs principally use the cyclooxygenase pathway for sup- pression of T cell function.

However, none of the de- vices accurately represented radiographically mea- sured stifle joint angles. Additional veterinary studies are indicated prior to the use of novel goniometers. Further investigation into a superior goniometer for the veterinary market is warranted. Introduction Goniometry is frequently used as an objective out-come measure during rehabilitation to assess the clinical progression of orthopedic patients in veter- inary and human medicine. 2,3 consid- ered a simple, reliable, low-cost, and time-efficient outcome measurement readily available for practical clinical application.4,5 Currently used tools for measurement of joint range of motion include radiography, the commonly used plastic UG, and more specialized technologies such as electrogoniometers, bubble inclinometers, fluo- roscopy, and kinematic gait analysis. 5-8 Regardless of the device used, these methods require time to obtain measurements and some require additional equipment that may not be widely available to clini-cians. 5,9 The challenges inherent to veterinary prac- tice require devices and methods that allow observ- ers to accurately, reliably, and efficiently measure joint angles in a broadly diverse set of patients. Smartphone-based applications provide clinicians with alternative goniometers that are readily avail-able, easily transportable, can allow for sharing of patient data, and can be less expensive than some other specialized devices used for range of motion measurement. Such applications are increasingly considered acceptable alternatives for various in-dications in human medicine. 5,11,12 However, to our knowledge, the use of smartphone-based appli- cations has not yet been evaluated in dogs in the peer-reviewed literature. The purpose of the study reported here was to eval- uate the reliability and accuracy of 3 novel goniom- eters (2 smartphone-based applications and a novel digital goniometer) for angle measurements of the stifle joint in dogs and compare the results with those obtained by use of a UG, with radiographic measure-ments used as the gold standard. We hypothesized that there would be no differences in these variables among the 4 goniometry devices. Methods Eight canine cadaver hind limbs from medium-sized dogs euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study were utilized. Limbs were excluded if palpable ortho-pedic abnormalities of the hind limbs were present. The limbs were individually mounted on wooden platforms, simulating lateral recumbency, in three random stifle angles within the published normal range of motion, resulting in a total of 24 angles. This design allowed the limb to be raised in a lateral posi-tion off the wooden platform allowing circumferential palpation of the limb mimicking a clinical setting (Fig-ure 1). The lateral incisions were cosmetically sutured in a simple continuous subcuticular pattern. Radiographs were obtained of the limbs at each in- dividual angle prior to goniometric measurements being performed. The limbs remained in each posi-tion/angle until all observers completed their mea-surements of the respective angle. The nuts were then loosened from the bolts affixing the tibia to the wooden platform, the tibia was moved to a different angle and the nuts were tightened. The limbs were then radiographed and goniometric measurements were obtained in their new position. This sequence Assessment of novel digital and smartphone goniometers for measurement of canine stifle joint angles This is a summary of an article by Drs. Freund, Kieves, Hart, Foster, Jeffery and Duerr published in the American Journal of Veterinary Research 2016;77(7):749-55.\u00b9 of limb fixation, radiography, and goniometric mea- surement was performed on each limb in each of the three random stifle angles per limb. Four goniometers were used in this investigation (see Figure 2). All applications were installed on a single iphone that was used throughout the dura-tion of the study. Three evaluators, trained in the use of each novel goniometer and experienced in utilizing the UG in daily practice, performed all mea- surements. The evaluators were given written and verbal instructions on the use of the methods and allowed the opportunity to practice with the devic-es prior to beginning measurements. The order in which the evaluators used each goniometer was designed such that no device was used repeatedly for measurement of subsequent angles. After com- pleting a set of measurements with one device and prior to measuring with the next, the presentation of the limbs was randomly rearranged by one of the au- thors that did not perform any measurements. This was performed out of view of the evaluators, in an at-tempt to eliminate any recall of previously measured angles. This resulted in 96 measurements that were independently performed by three evaluators in trip-licate fashion, for a total of 864 measurements. For the assessment of bias, the mean of the three replicates of the radiographic angle was treated as the true value, and the mean of the three repli- cates of each angle measured by each observer as the measured value. In order to determine the ap-propriate statistical method for estimating bias, the relationship between measured and radiographic values was assessed for each device using simple linear regression. The correlation coefficient (R) was <0.99 for all goniometers, therefore Deming regres-sion was used to assess the relationship between the angle measured by each device, and the radio-graphic value. Constant bias and proportional bias were considered present if the confidence interval for the y intercept or the slope of the regression line did not overlap 0 or 1 respectively. The regression equation, measured value = (slope*radiographic val-ue) + y-intercept, was used to predict the measured angle when the radiographic value was 50 or 100 degrees. Bias at these angles was then calculated using bias (%) = (measured value-radiographic value)/radiographic value*100. Total error observed (TEo) was calculated at 50 and 100 degrees using the Figure 1: Drawing illustrating the cadaveric set up: (A) Model design as seen when viewed from above; (B) Model design as seen when viewed from the side.

HALO had the lowest correlation with R of 0.78. DrGoniometer and IHandy had an R of 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. BIAS - Deming regression showed evidence of pro- portional and constant bias for all the devices except DrGoniometer for which the confidence interval of the slope and y intercept overlapped 1 and 0 re- spectively. Both UG and IHandy showed a positive constant bias and HALO a constant negative bias. DrGoniometer had the lowest bias at both 50 and 100 degrees, HALO had the greatest bias at 100 de- grees, and IHandy at 50 degrees. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT - All four devic- es exceeded the TEa of 5%, and therefore failed to meet the authors' requirements for acceptable accuracy to represent radiographic measure-ments. UG performed the best at 100 degrees (TEo 18.51%) and DrGoniometer the best at 50 degrees (TEo 24.69%). HALO performed the least well of the four devices at both 100 and 50 degrees (TEo 36.90 and 46.46% respectively). Conclusions When evaluating whether a device is useful to de- termine a clinical measurement, several approaches can be considered. Reliability is frequently evaluated by means of the coefficient of variation. Accuracy of a device can be assessed in many different ways, including the correlation coefficient and bias. Calcu- lation of total error integrates both CV and bias and comparison of total error with the total allowable er-ror determines if the device meets the needs clini-cians or researchers. R describes the strength of a linear association between devices, and is therefore not an ideal assessment of actual accuracy. 5 Bias, an expression of inaccuracy, is an assessment of the closeness of a measurement with that of the true val- ue. The evaluation of bias is beneficial in that it can be used to predict the extent of inaccuracy for differ-ent magnitudes of measurement. If proportional bias were present, this would indicate that the degree of overestimation or underestimation varies for large angles versus small angles. Constant bias, where the degree of error remains independent of the mea- sured true value, would indicate that a device consis- tently under or overestimates the true value. 6,7 The results of this study demonstrate that no test-ed novel goniometer performed better than the UG. The UG demonstrated a low proportional and constant bias, percent bias, as well as TEo when evaluated at acute and obtuse angles. For clinical evaluations of progression after implemented ther-apy, the relative lack of variability is likely the most important factor to consider. The UG also had the highest correlation with the true angle as measured on radiographs, estimated by R. Goniometry is most frequently used to assess clin- ical progression, such as evaluating the success of a treatment by comparing serial stifle joint angles. Given this purpose, the comparison of a goniom-eter to the radiographic measurement is likely not the most essential outcome measure for device assessment. Rather, how much a device varies between repeated measurements, between pa- tients, and between other devices has the greater potential effect on outcome measures. Therefore, while DrGoniometer had the lowest percent bias, or highest measured accuracy when compared to the radiographic measurement, this does not suggest that DrGoniometer would be the best alternative to the UG. For the novel goniometers, IHandy demon- strated a similar proportional bias to the UG, while HALO resulted in the largest proportional bias of all devices tested. While the UG remains the preferred goniometer, IHandy would produce the most similar results to the UG in clinical use.

Soft tissue mobilization focuses on restoring movement to the skin, connective tissue, ligaments, tendons, and muscles with the goal of modulating pain, reducing inflammation, improving tissue re-pair, increasing extensibility, and improving function. Joint mobilization is characterized as nonimpulsive, repetitive joint movements induced within the pas-sive range of joint motion with the purpose of re-storing normal and symmetric joint range of motion, to stretch connective tissues, and to restore normal joint end-feel. Manipulation is a manual procedure that involves a directed impulse which moves a joint or vertebral segment beyond its physiological range of motion, but does not exceed the anatomical limit of the articulation. The primary biomechanical differ-ence between joint mobilization and manipulation is the presence of a high-speed thrust or impulse. Spinal manipulation involves the application of con-trolled impulses to articular structures within the axial skeleton with the intent of reducing pain and muscle hypertonicity and increasing joint range of motion. Objectives of treatment Soft tissue and joint mobilization are used to assess the quality and quantity of joint range of motion and as a primary means of treating musculoskeletal disor-ders. Subjective assessment of the ease of joint mo-tion, joint stability, and joint end-feel provide insights into the biomechanical and neurologic features of an articulation. Goniometry is often used to objectively quantify and document the amount of flexion or ex-tension present at an articulation. The objectives of soft tissue and joint mobilization are typically to re-duce pain, restore tissue compliance, and to improve overall tissue mobility and joint range or motion. Ma-nipulation is more often used to address localized pain and joint stiffness, with less focus on the sur-rounding soft tissues.\u00b2 Manual therapy techniques can also provide an adjunct to therapeutic exercis-es and rehabilitation of neuromotor control, where applied forces are used to induce passive stretch- ing, weight-shifting and activation of spinal reflexes, which help to increase flexibility, stimulate proprio- ception and strengthen core musculature.\u00b3 Peripher-al nerve and nerve root mobilization techniques and exercises are also used for post-operative rehabili- tation of low back pain. Few formal studies exist to support the use of active joint or spinal mobilization techniques in horses. Most mobilization studies in horses involve a period of induced joint immobili-zation by a fixture or cast followed by allowing the horse to spontaneously weight bear and locomote on the affected limb, without evaluation of specific soft tissue or joint mobilization techniques. Joint mechanics The use of palpation techniques to qualitatively and quantitatively assess joint motion requires an un-derstanding of joint mechanics. Joint motion can be categorized into three zones of movement: physio-logic, paraphysiologic and pathologic (Figure 1). The physiological zone of movement consists of both active and passive joint motion within all possible di-rections of movement (e.g., flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation). Passive movement of an articulation from a neutral joint position first involves Joint mobilization and manipulation for the equine athlete This is a summary of an article by Dr. Kevin K. Haussler published in the Veterinary Clinics Equine.\u00b9evaluating the range of joint motion that has minimal, uniform resistance. Then as the articulation is moved toward the end range of passive joint motion, there is a gradual increase in the resistance to movement which terminates at an elastic barrier (i.e., joint end feel). The end range of motion begins with any palpa- ble change in resistance to passive joint mobilization. Joint end feel is often evaluated by bringing an indi- vidual articulation to tension and applying rhythmic oscillations to qualify the resistance to movement. Normal joint end feel is initially soft and resilient and gradually becomes more restrictive as the limits of joint range of motion are reached. A pathologic or restrictive end range of motion is palpable earlier in passive joint movement and has an abrupt, hard end feel when compared with normal joint end feel. Each articulation within the body has unique palpatory end feels for each of the directions of joint motion (e.g., flexion, extension, lateral bending, etc.). The goal of palpating passive joint movement is to evaluate each articulation of interest for quality of joint motion, the initiation of resistance to motion and type of end feel, and the amount of motion within each of the principle directions of movement. The paraphysiological space is bordered by the elastic and anatomical limits of an individual joint. Joint motion into the paraphysiologi- cal space occurs only with the application of high ve- locity forces associated with joint manipulation. The anatomical barrier of the joint marks the junction be- tween the paraphysiologic and pathologic zones of movement. The pathological zone is characterized by the application of excessive forces or joint motion which causes an articulation to move beyond its ana-tomical limits and results in mechanical disruption of intra- and periarticular structures and subsequent joint instability or luxation. Clinical indications Joint mobilization and manipulation provide import- ant diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ad- dressing equine axial skeleton problems that are not otherwise available in veterinary medicine. Most of the current knowledge about equine manual ther- apies has been borrowed from human techniques, theories, and research and applied to horses. Thera- peutic trials of joint mobilization or manipulation are often used because of limited knowledge about the effects of manual therapy in horses. The indications for joint mobilization and manipulation are similar and include restricted joint range of motion, muscle spasms, pain, fibrosis, or contracted soft tissues. The principal indications for spinal manipulation are neck or back pain, localized or regional joint stiffness, poor performance, and altered gait that is not associated with overt lameness. A thorough diagnostic workup is required to identify soft tissue and osseous pathol-ogy, neurologic disorders, or other lameness condi- tions that may not be responsive to manual therapy. Clinical signs indicative of a primary spinal disorder include localized musculoskeletal pain, muscle hy- pertonicity and restricted joint motion. This triad of clinical signs can also be found in a variety of low- er limb disorders; however, they are most evident in horses with neck or back problems. Clinical signs in-dicative of chronic or secondary spinal disorders in- clude regional or diffuse pain, generalized stiffness, and widespread muscle hypertonicity. In these cas- es, further diagnostic evaluation or imaging should be done to identify the primary cause of lameness or poor performance. Joint mobilization and manipulation are critical com- ponents in the management of muscular, articular and neurologic components of select musculoskel- etal injuries in performance horses. Musculoskeletal conditions that are chronic or recurring, not readily diagnosed, or are not responding to conventional veterinary care may be indicators that manual ther- apy evaluation and treatment is needed. Joint mobi- lization and manipulation are typically more effective in the early clinical stages of disease processes ver- sus end-stage disease where reparative processes have been exhausted. Joint manipulation is usually contraindicated in the acute stages of soft tissue in- jury; however, mobilization is safer than manipulation and has been shown to have short-term benefits for acute neck or back pain in humans. Manipulation is probably more effective than mobilization for chron- ic neck or back pain and has the potential to help restore normal joint motion, thus limiting the risk of reinjury. It has been theorized that spinal manipula-tion preferentially influences a sensory bed which, in terms of anatomical location and function, is dif- ferent from the sensory bed influenced by spinal mobilization techniques. Manipulation may preferen- tially stimulate receptors within deep intervertebral muscles, while mobilization techniques most likely affect more superficial axial muscles. Only one study Figure 1: Graphic representation of joint mechanics as it relates to the zones of joint motion. 184 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 185has compared mobilization to manipulation in hors- es and spinal manipulation induced a 15% increase in displacement and a 20% increase in applied force, compared to mobilization. At most vertebral sites studied, manipulation increased the amplitudes of dorsoventral displacement and applied force, indica-tive of increased spinal flexibility and increased toler-ance to pressure in the thoracolumbar region of the equine vertebral column. Joint mobilization and manipulation techniques Selection factors for considering mobilization versus manipulation include the technical training and skill of the practitioner, perceived risks versus benefits, the presence of acute pain and inflammation, and pathoanatomic considerations. Joint mobilization is easier to apply, requires less psychomotor skills, has minimal risks, and can be used in the presence of acute pain and inflammation, compared to manipula-tion. Manual therapy procedures are also dependent on the ability of the patient to relax and the patent response to the applied force. Characteristics of joint mobilization and manipulation include factors related to specificity, leverage, velocity, amplitude, direction, and prestress of the applied force. Additional factors are related to joint position and frequency or oscilla- tion of the applied forces. Levers are used to increase mechanical advantage and assist in applying force to an articulation or body segment to induce joint motion. Long levers include using the limbs or head and neck as levers to induce spinal motion, instead of the inducing motion at one or two individual ver- tebrae by using transverse or spinous processes as short lever contacts. Velocity relates to the speed of the impulse applied to move a vertebra or body seg-ment and displacement is the distance over which the applied thrust is applied. Amplitude refers to the amount of force applied. With long-lever techniques, lower amplitudes of force are required to induce similar joint motion as short-lever contacts. Howev-er, the rationale for using short-lever techniques is to increase the specificity of the applied thrust, since a single vertebral process is contacted on the vertebra of interest with short-lever techniques. With long-le- vers, it is likely that multiple articulations are included between the doctor's contact and the body segment of interest, which produces a more generalized treat-ment effect. Using a specific anatomical contact is theorized to address a single articulation; however, studies on treatment effects indicate that specific contact techniques produce local, as well as, regional and systemic effects. The therapeutic dosage of joint mobilization or manipulation is also determined by the number of vertebrae or body segments treated and the frequency of the applied treatments. Source KK Haussler.

However, a high percentage of owners in both groups reported positive satisfac- tion. Pet owners selecting stifle orthoses should be advised of the potential for complications including persistent lameness, skin issues, non-acceptance of the orthosis, and the possible need for subsequent surgical intervention. Introduction Injury to the cranial cruciate ligament is a common cause for the development of hind limb lameness, de- velopment of stifle osteoarthritis, and associated pain in the canine patient. 2-5 Despite the high prevalence, there is still controversy about the best overall course of treatment. Surgical treatment is frequently advocat-ed, and has proven to be effective in the restoration of limb function. 5-9 The literature most strongly supports Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO) as the sur-gical procedure of choice, allowing return to normal function after surgical treatment of CCLD. Non-sur- gical management of CCLD has been investigated and is most commonly suggested for dogs weighing less than 15-20kg. 10 However, improvement in lame- ness with non-surgical management of CCLD has also been reported in dogs weighing >20kg. 11,12 Non-surgical management of CCLD has recently changed with the introduction of canine rehabilita- tion therapy and other novel management options such as stifle orthoses.13,14 Orthoses (also referred to as 'braces' or 'orthotic[s] device[s]') are medical devices used to support or protect an injured leg,14 and frequently defined as any medical device added to the body to support, align, position, immobilize, prevent or correct deformity, assist weak muscles, or improve function.13,14 Anecdotally, stifle orthoses are occasionally utilized for non-surgical management of CCLD. 14 However, to the authors' knowledge, no peer-reviewed reports of clinical outcome of stifle orthoses for the management of CCLD are avail- able. The goal of this study was to report outcome and satisfaction of pet owners that chose to employ a custom-made stifle orthosis for the management of their dog's CCLD, in comparison to owners that elected TPLO.Comparison of pet-owner satisfaction with stifle orthoses (braces) or tibial plateau leveling osteotomy for the management of cranial cruciate ligament disease in medium to large breed dogs This is a summary of an article by Drs. Hart, May, Kieves, Mich, Goh, Palmer and Duerr published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 2016;249(4):391-8.1 Figure 1: Orthoses (also referred to as 'braces' or 'orthotic[s] device[s]') are medical devices used to support or protect an injured leg. 186 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 2016 REPORT 187RESEARCH | FOCUS 5 - Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease RESEARCH | FOCUS 5 -Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease Methods The Orthopets' client database was searched for dogs who received a custom-made stifle orthosis for treatment of CCLD (ORTHOSIS group) from 2008 to 2013. These cases were recruited from veterinarians across the US. Only dogs that had not previously un- dergone surgical intervention for CCLD were includ- ed in the study. Dogs that were treated simultaneous-ly with an orthosis in addition to surgical treatment were also excluded. Similarly, CSU's hospital data- base was searched for dogs that underwent TPLO surgery for treatment of CCLD (TPLO group) between 2002 and 2013. For each database, only dogs where owners provided an email address were included. Survey requests were sent via email to the iden- tified clients including questions on the following categories: CCLD presentation (affected limb(s), breed, weight, and age), treatments performed, aftercare, complications, level of client compliance and satisfaction, and considerations made when choosing treatment. Results OWNER RESPONSE - For the ORTHOSIS group, 819 owners were invited to participate in the sur- vey, while 203 owners were invited for the TPLO group. The TPLO group represented owners of dogs presenting between 2002 and 2013, and the ORTHOSIS group cases were identified from or- thoses provided between 2008 and 2013. The re-sponse rate for the ORTHOSIS group was 25% (n = 203/819) and 37% for the TPLO group (n = 76/203; P = 0.003). Owners were not required to answer all of the questions and for some questions multiple answers were allowed; hence subsequent data is reported including the number of respondents for each question. DEMOGRAPHICS - There were no significant dif- ferences for dog weight between the TPLO group (31.4 \u00b1 10.5 kg) and the ORTHOSIS group (34.1 \u00b1 13.4 kg; P = 0.10), or limb distribution (P = 0.68). All dogs in the study were medium to large breed dogs. Dogs in the TPLO group started showing signs of lameness at a significantly younger age than dogs in the ORTHOSIS group (5.5 \u00b1 2.6 years in the TPLO group compared to 7.8 \u00b1 3.6 years in the ORTHOSIS group; P = <0.001). TREATMENT DECISION FACTORS - Eighty-one per- cent (n = 162/199) of selected responses from owners in the ORTHOSIS group were \"cost\", \"convenience\", or \"personal preference\" as the most important fac-tors for choosing the treatment of their dog com-pared to only 25% (n = 17/67) in the TPLO group. Con-versely, \"veterinarian recommendation\" was selected as the most influential by 75% (n = 50/67) of the TPLO group owners compared to 19% (n = 37/199) of own- ers in the ORTHOSIS group (P = <0.001). AFTERCARE - Sixty-three percent (n = 40/63) of the TPLO group and 53% of the ORTHOSIS group (n = 80/152) did not pursue rehabilitation (P = 0.14). When asked why they did not pursue rehabilitation, 46% of the TPLO group (n = 16/35) and 33% of owners in the ORTHOSIS group (n = 30/92) reported \"Not advised of necessity\" (P = 0.06). OUTCOME ASSESSMENT/OWNER SATISFACTION - Eighty-five percent (n = 129/152) of owners that pur-sued orthoses for their dogs, and 90% (n = 57/63) of the TPLO group, replied they would repeat the cho-sen treatment again if they were given the choice (P = 0.27). A statistically significantly larger number of owners in the TPLO group rated the ei-ther <0.001). When owner-report- ed lameness after intervention, 98% (n = 62/63) of the dogs in the TPLO group and 88% (n = 128/146) in the ORTHOSIS group showed mild/no lameness (P = 0.01; see Table 2). COMPLICATIONS - Forty-six (n = 70/152) percent of owners reported their dogs experienced skin issues while wearing the orthosis and 32% (n = 22/69) of those cases required medical attention and multiple adjustments to the orthosis according to owners. In comparison, 5% of owners in the TPLO group re- ported complications (n = 4/76). Owners reported 2 cases of suspected patellar tendinopathy, 1 draining fistula that required removal of the TPLO plate, and 1 acute case of NSAID toxicity. In review of the med- ical records, there were no additional documented complications for the TPLO group. The majority (60%, n = 91/151) of dogs who received an orthosis experi-enced a 1 to 2 week long adjustment period to get used to wearing the orthosis. Eighty-eight percent (n = 134/151) of owners reported their dog was wearing the orthosis after the initial adjustment period: 43% (n = 65/151) of dog owners reported their dog was wearing the orthosis every day, 15% (n = 23/151) re-ported 3-6 days/week, than (n = 52/151). Thirty-eight percent (n = 58/151) of owners reported their dog tolerated the orthosis 'very well - my dog actually seems to like wearing the device', 33% (n = 50/151) reported 'well - my dog seemed reluctant to have the device applied but seems to like wearing the device', and 19% (n = 28/151) reported 'fair - my dog seems reluctant to have the device applied and does not seem to like wearing it but will tolerate it.' Eleven percent (n = 17/151) of the owners reported that their dog does not wear the orthosis at all: 7% (n = 10/151) reported their dog did not tolerate the orthosis due to fit issues or skin concerns, 2% (n = 3/151) reported their dog didn't need the orthosis anymore since the lameness had resolved, and 3% (n = 4/151) reported \"other\" reasons. Five percent reported their dog never tolerated the orthosis (n = 7/151), and 11% (n = 16/151) of the ORTHO- SIS group reported that their dog received subse-quent surgical procedures on the orthosis-managed limb (TPLO, n = 7; meniscal removal only, 4; tibial tuberosity advancement, n = 2; tightrope procedure, n = 2; did not specify, n = 1). Conclusions Based on the results of this survey and previous re-search, it can be concluded that non-surgical treat- ment is a viable alternative for dogs that cannot undergo surgical treatment for CCLD. If an orthosis is considered as part of this management, owners should be given appropriate counseling regarding potential complications such as skin issues and un- willingness to wear the device, as well as the risk of subsequent surgical intervention. Owners should also be aware that the majority of patients so treated are chronically \"orthosis-dependent\". It is also im- portant to note that long-term data on development of osteoarthritis is not available. References 1. Hart JL, May KD, Kieves NR, et al.
