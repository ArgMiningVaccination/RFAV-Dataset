In the US currently, it is an alternative healthcare practice. According to Ayurveda, there are five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether) that combine to form three Doshas, or functional energies. Vata( the energy of movement formed by the combination of air and ether), Pitta (fire and water combine to form the energy of metabolism), and Kapha (earth and water combine to form this energy of cohesion). At the time of conception, these energies combine and govern our constitution through our structure, function, affinities and tendencies. The mind is clear, light and blissful and carries the quality of Sattva. This can go out of balance when there is Rajas (ambition, restlessness, irritability and feverishness) in the body or Tamas (heaviness and dullness). These qualities or Gunas keep changing; as an example, we do need Rajas to wake up and Tamas to sleep! In this blog post, we will explore how yoga and meditation can be used to balance the Doshas and promote overall health and wellbeing. These practices are considered Sattvik as they restore the blissful, clear quality of the mind.
