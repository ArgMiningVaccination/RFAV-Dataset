A buzzword in the health community, inflammation is linked to all sorts of problems in the human body- pain, arthritis, obesity, and beyond, but here's one that may not have occurred to you before: Chronic inflammation is linked to cortisol imbalance The brain's foremost stress hormone, cortisol, is produced by the adrenal gland, and keeping it in balance is critical for maintaining the health of every cell in the body. By raising inflammation, a poor diet is helping to throw your cortisol rhythm out of balance and thereby, results in the following symptoms: - Anxiety and depression - Problems falling and staying asleep - Weight fluctuation - Decreased memory - Immune system dysfunction A plan for eating clean to fight inflammation and cortisol imbalance Diet, along with sleep, is one of the most powerful ways you can control cortisol rhythm and the functioning of your adrenal glands. - We start by ditching the processed foods. As much as possible, try to limit your intake of drive-thru or ready-made meals. - This goes along with controlling the quality of fats and sugars you intake. - Focus on anti-inflammatory foods or supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids, spices such as turmeric, cloves, and ginger, - Avoid caffeine and alcohol late at night: Both are great at disturbing your natural flow and interfering with the quality of sleep. This is not a radical change in your diet, but it does ask that you take some care in avoiding the pitfalls of ready-made meals and exercising more care over the ingredients you consume. We can help you identify behavior that is causing inflammation and cortisol levels to remain high and quality of life low. Give our office a call to schedule an appointment today. "}
