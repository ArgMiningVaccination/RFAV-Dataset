What is High-Dose IV Vitamin C Therapy? IV Therapy is a treatment where medicine, vitamins and fluids are delivered intravenously through the veins. This allows the therapy to quickly move to where it is needed. High-dose vitamin C infusions have been gaining popularity in recent years as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy. Vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant that has many important functions in the body, including supporting the immune system and skin health. High doses of vitamin C are thought to offer additional health benefits, including improving energy levels, reducing stress, and fighting inflammation. One of the main benefits of high-dose vitamin C infusions is the ability to achieve much higher blood levels of the nutrient than can be obtained through dietary sources or oral supplements alone. This is because high doses of vitamin C are rapidly excreted from the body when taken orally, whereas intravenous (IV) administration allows for much higher blood levels of the nutrient to be maintained over time. High-dose vitamin C infusions have been used for a variety of health conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and depression. Although research on the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C for these conditions is still limited, some preliminary studies suggest that the therapy may have therapeutic benefits, especially for those with chronic diseases. In addition to its potential therapeutic effects, high-dose vitamin C infusions have also been touted for their ability to improve energy levels, reduce stress, and enhance overall wellness. Some people report feeling more energetic and refreshed after receiving a vitamin C infusion, while others claim that the therapy has helped to reduce their stress levels and improve their overall mood. While high-dose vitamin C infusions are generally considered safe, some people may experience side effects such as nausea, dizziness, or headache. Overall, high-dose vitamin C infusions offer a unique way to boost vitamin C levels in the body and potentially offer therapeutic benefits for a range of health conditions. As with any CAM treatment, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider before starting high-dose vitamin C infusions to determine if they are safe and appropriate for you. What conditions can be potentially helped by high dose vitamin c therapy? What Are High Dose Vitamin C IV Sessions Like & What are the Fees? After determining the personalized combination of nutrients, medicine, and vitamins necessary for your treatment, you will be taken to a private room for administering the IV. The registered nurse will disinfect the site of injection. After insertion, the fluid drips from the bag then into your bloodstream. High dose vitamin c iv infusions typically take 1-2 hours depending on the dose. The speed of the results depends on what you are trying to address. For example, if you are trying to manage a chronic condition, the results take longer than simply addressing an acute infection. 10g - $100 - $400 Monday - Thursday Appointments Available Meet Your Provider Joanie Jackson, RN, BSN, MSN is a board certified Family Nurse Practitioner.
