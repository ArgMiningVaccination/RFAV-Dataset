The functional avidity is determined by exposing T-cell populations in vitro to di erent amounts of cognate antigen. T-cells with high functional avidity respond to low antigen doses. This in vitro measure is thought to correlate well with the in vivo eector capacity of T-cells. We here present the multifaceted factors determining and influencing the functional avidity of T-cells. Weoutline how changes in the functional avidity can occur over the course of an infection. This process, known as avidity maturation, can occur despite the fact that T-cells express a xed TCR. Furthermore, examples are provided illustrating the importance of generating T-cell populations that exhibit a high functional av idity when responding to an infection or tumors. Furthermore, we discuss whether criteria based on which we evaluate an e ective T-cell response to acute infections can also be applied to chronic infections such as HIV . Finally, we also focus on observations that high-avidity T-cells show higher signs of exhaustion and facilitate the emergence of virus escape variants. The review summarizes our current understanding of how this may occur as well as how T-cells of di erent functional avidity contribute to antiviral and anti-tumor immunity. Enhancing our knowledge in this eld is relevant for tumor immunotherapy and vaccines design. 1. Introduction CD8 T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity, and a large number of studies in both human and mice indicatethat antigen-specic CD8 T cells are directly involved innot only the control of viral replication, but also tumorgrowth [ 1-25]. Especially CD8 T-cell immunity against HIV replication, and thus the prevention of the diseaseprogression, is well documented. This is primarily basedon the following observations: (a) depleting CD8 T cells in the macaque model of AIDS leads to a loss of control of virus replication [ 4,5,26], (b) HIV-specic T-cell responses can be detected in previously virus exposed butpresently uninfected individuals [ 27-30], and (c) a higher numbers of polyfunctional T cells are found in individualswith nonprogressive infection or in the so-called \"elitecontrollers\" [ 9-11], although there is a long-term debate asto whether this is a cause or a consequence of viral control [31]. Polyfunctional T cells characteristically show high IL- 2 expression and strong ability to upregulate granzyme B and perforin. They have a high proliferative capacity and aresuperior in controlling HIV infection. Furthermore, it hasbeen demonstrated by the whole genome analyses that HLAclass I alleles are the genetic factors most strongly associatedwith nonprogressive infection [ 8,15-22,32,33]. The aforementioned polyfunctionality is a well- established important indicator for the ability of T cellsto control a virus infection. However, this parameter doesnot reflect the ability of how a T-cell or a populationof T cells responds to a specic antigen. Instead, thepolyfunctionality is usually assessed upon exposing T cellsto peptide-MHC [pMHC] ligands at close to saturatingconcentration. In this situation, it can be that T cells showsimilar cytokine response patterns, although T cells might2 Clinical and Developmental Immunology respond signicantly di erent upon exposure to limited or physiologically relevant amounts of a ligand in vivo and in vitro . In contrast, the functional avidity is a biological measure that describes how well a T-cell responds in vitro to a given concentration of a ligand. By denition, T cells withhigh functional avidity respond in in vitro tests to very low antigen doses, while T cells of lower functional avidityrequire higher amounts of antigen before they mount animmune response similar to that of high-avidity T cells.The functional avidity can be considered as a quantitativedeterminant of the activation threshold of a T-cell clone.In vivo, T cells of high and low avidity are exposed to similar antigen doses, but numerous correlations existbetween the functional avidity and the e ectiveness of an antiviral immune response, some of which will be discussedlater in this paper. Of note, ex vivo studies have shown that distinct T-cell functions (e.g., proliferation, cytokinesproduction, etc.) are triggered with di erent thresholds [ 34- 37]. The purpose of this paper is to provide information on what distinguishes the functional avidity from otherparameters used to describe the ability of T cells to recognizeantigen and to summarize the known factors that determinethe functional avidity of T cells as well as the functionalavidity maturation of a T-cell population. The latter refersto increases of the overall functional avidity with which apolyclonal population responds to antigen. Moreover, wesuggest that combining functional avidity assessment andpolyfunctional analysis might lead to better predictionsconcerning the ability of a T-cell population to control achronic infection than when both tests are independentlyperformed. Finally, we will critically discuss the generalconsensus that high-avidity CD8 T-cell responses are alwaysbetter in controlling virus infections by presenting evidence that this might not be the case in chronic infections, particularly during HIV infection. 2. Factors Impacting the Functional Avidity of aT - C e l lC l o n e The functional avidity inversely correlates with the antigen dose that is needed to trigger a T-cell response. It isdetermined by ex vivo quantication of biological functions such as IFN- production, cytotoxic activity (ability to lyse target cells), or proliferation. The concentration needed toinduce a half-maximum response (EC 50)i so f t e nu s e dt o describe the functional avidity of T cells. In particular, itcan be used to describe how monoclonal but also antigen-specic polyclonal T-cell populations respond functional avidity of a T-cell clone ( Figure 1 )i s primarily impacted by (a) the a nity of the TCR for the pMHC-complex, that is, the strength of the interactionbetween the TCR and pMHC [ 38,39], (b) expression levels of the TCR and the CD4 or CD8 coreceptors, and (c) thedistribution and composition of signaling molecules [ 40,41]as well as expression levels of molecules that attenuate T-cell function and TCR signaling. 2.1. A nity, Avidity, and Functional Avidity of a T-Cell Clone. The terms a nity, avidity, and functional avidity are often incorrectly interchangeably used. The TCR a nity ( Figure 1 ) refers to the physical strength of the monomeric interactionbetween the TCR and a pMHC-complex [ 42,43]. The dissociation constant (K D)f o rd i erent pMHC-TCR pairs have been determined by surface plasmon resonance [ 44]. Several reports indicate that a lower K Dand thus a stronger interaction lead to a better T-cell response [ 45,46]. Another parameter that has been shown to influence the T-cellresponse e cacy is the half-life ( t 1/2) value of the interaction between the TCR and the pMHC-complex; longer t1/2times also result in more potent T-cell stimulation [ 45,47,48]. It still remains controversial which of these two parameters, theK Dor thet1/2value, o ers a better prediction of how T cells respond to antigen stimulation [ 48]. Low K Dvalues result from slow o -rates and/or rapid on-rates. Thus, pMHC-TCR interactions, which have a long t1/2time, usually also show al o wK Dvalue. This relationship may in parts explain why both K Dand thet1/2time have been reported to correlate with the e ciency of T-cell activation. However, both low KDand long t1/2values are thought to permit completion of intracellular signaling cascades leading to T-cell activation[42,49]. However, a clean biochemical determination of K Dvalues andt1/2times is rather complicated, and it requires the availability of soluble pMHC-complexes and a soluble formof the TCR. Moreover, it needs to be considered that thebinding kinetics can signicantly vary depending on whetherthe interaction is measured with soluble or membrane-bound ligands [ 50]. Alternatively, a more practical but less precise way to assess the strength of pMHC-TCR interactionis to stain living T cells with pMHC-multimers. Bindingkinetics can then be determined by measuring fluorescentintensity of cell-surface bound multimers [ 51-53]. As the latter involves binding of a ligand via multiple interactions(i.e., the pMHC-multimers bind to more than one TCR),such measurements are best described by the term avidity,which is normally used to refer to the strength of multimericreceptor-ligand engagement ( Figure 1 ). In contrast to the physical parameters a nity and avidity, the functional avidity describes how well a T-cell responds to antigens. Though all of the three parameters correlate in most cases, that is, high-a nity T cells often have a high functional avidity, this does not need to be the case. There areseveral factors besides the antigen recognition ability of theTCR that can impact the T-cell response. In principle, T cellscould express a high-a nity TCR, but due to other factors, for example, inhibitory molecules, it might show a veryweak response to antigen stimulation. Thus, determining thefunctional avidity is not only often more practical, but isalso the only one out of the three parameters that actuallydescribes the functional outcome of the stimulation. Notably, the level of TCR expression impacts the func- tional avidity. Even though T cells are functional when theyClinical and Developmental Immunology CytotoxicityCytokines productionSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) Assessment of T-cell functions in presence of decreasing antigen Coreceptor Fas/FasL Costimulatory/coinhibitory molecules and their ligandsPeptide-MHC (pMHC) molecule and perforinFunctional avidity of the T cellsafnity avidityStrength of the binding between one peptide-MHC (pMHC) molecule and one TCR Strength of interaction between multiple TCR and pMHC moleculesSurface staining with tosurface immobilized receptors - K Dvalues, on- and o-rates, and T 1/2can precisely be determined - Fluorescence intensity of surface boundpMHC multimers - Cell surface Cytokines production- Cytotoxic activity(ability lyse cells) Proliferation capacity Figure 1: Schematic representation, denition, te chnique of measurement and readout of TCR a nity and functional avidity. express very little TCR, it has been shown that reduced expression levels go along with decreased ability to respondto antigen [ 54]. T cells with reduced TCR expression levels are impaired in their proliferative capacity and in their abilityto secrete IL-2 and IFN- [55]. 2.2. Coreceptor Clone. CD4 and CD8 coreceptors bind to the MHC classes II and I, respectively [ 56], and stabilize the pMHC-TCR interaction. This is for instance illustrated by the fact that pMHC-multimers bearing a mutation in theCD8 binding site bind less e ciently to T cells [ 57], and this is particularly prominent when a TCR binds with low-anity to a pMHC-complex [ 58-60]. The importance of the coreceptor engagement for pMHC-binding to the TCR is alsounderlined by observations that antibodies against the CD8coreceptor can decrease or block the extent to which pMHC-multimers bind to a TCR. There are even antibody clonesenhancing the binding [ 61]. This might occur by inducing a conformation that facilitates better binding of the coreceptorto the MHC. This antibody enhancement or blockade iseven more critical when a TCR engages a low-a nity ligand[61]. Moreover, coreceptor engagement supports TCR signal transduction by bringing Lck in close proximity to theTCR complex [ 62,63]. Reducing this coreceptor engagement of Lck lowers the TCR sensitivity to antigen stimulationand thus decreases induction of e ector function [ 39,64]. However, the enhancement of the coreceptor MHC bindingis more critical for clones. Thus, high-a nity pMHC-TCR interactions are in contrast to low-a nity binding characterized by a relative CD8- independence for both T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicityas well as for multimer binding [ 57,58,60]. The aforementioned observations indicate how critically the presence or absence of the coreceptor impacts the abilityof T cells to respond to a pMHC-complex. In addition,several examples indicate the extent to which variations in coreceptor expression levels or binding ability to MHC molecules impact T-cell function. In mice, downregulationof CD8 expression and reduced ability of T cells to respondt oa n t i g e nh a v eb e e ns e e nf o l l o w i n g Listeria monocytogenes or V accinia virus infection [ 65]. Moreover, there is a polymor- phism in the 3 domain of the HLA-A 68 molecule resulting in weak binding of the CD8 coreceptor to the MHC. Whenthe HLA-A 68 sequence is articially altered to restore CD84 Clinical and Developmental Immunology binding, then this altered molecule is recognized by TCRs that fail to respond to normal HLA-A68. Thus, restoring coreceptor engagement rescues cytokine production and T-cell proliferation, even though the pMHC-TCR interactionitself remains unchanged [ 66,67]. Moreover, self-antigen- specic T cells can downregulate CD8 expression to reduce their functional avidity and thereby their autoreactive poten- tial [ 68]. 2.3. Alterations in TCR Signaling Can Impact the Functional Avidity. TCR signaling is initiated when Lck within the CD3 molecule. This provides a docking site for ZAP-70, which in turn getsphosphorylated by Lck [ 69]. Activated ZAP-70 leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of linker for ofT-cell a signaling cascade thatleads to Ca 2+mobilization as well as to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway[70,71]. Dierent lines of evidence indicate that T cells can adjust or tune the sensitivity of their signaling apparatus indicatingthat functional avidity is not xed [ 72]. In the thymus, TCR-signaling sensitivity is thought to be augmented by a micro RNA (miR181a), and this occurs via targeting multiple phosphatases that otherwise inhibit the TCR signal[73,74]. This goes along with observations that T cells respond to ligands in the thymus to which they much lesseectively respond in the periphery [ 75,76]. Furthermore, TCR signal transduction is thought to be ne tuned byinhibitory molecules such as CD5 [ 77]. CD5 expression levels presumably correlate with the strength with which aT-cell clone responded to its positive selecting ligand [ 77]. CD5 is an immune-tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearingreceptor that could antagonize overt TCR activation inperipheral T cells [ 78] and has been shown to be involved in peripheral tolerance by adjusting T-cell reactivity [ 79]. Along those lines, higher antigen sensitivity is determined by thesuperior ability of high-avidity T cells to achieve thresholdlevels of CD3 phosphorylation through increasing the amount of activated Lck [ 80,81]. If and how these and other pathways impact the functional avidity of T cells need to be better determined.However, the ability of peripheral T cells to alter theirantigen reactivity has been reported. Deprivation from MHCmolecules has been shown to increase CD4 T-cell reactivity[82], but also the opposite e ect has been observed [ 83]. 3. Factors Impacting the Functional Avidity at the Population Level The overall functional avidity of a heterogeneous oligoclonal T-cell population that forms during an infection [ 84-88]i s primarily impacted by the ratio of recruited clones with highversus low functional avidity. Thus, the stimulatory potency and the range of functional avidity that antigen-presentingcells [APC] recruit during an immune response stronglyimpact the avidity of the emerging T-cell population. Whether or not an APC is able to recruit not only T cells withhigh but also low functional avidity is critically impacted bythe net level of costimulatory and inhibitory molecules, butalso by the magnitude of antigen presentation. 3.1. Impact of Costimulatory and Inhibitory Molecules. The interaction between T cells and DC involves several molec-ular contacts between not only costimulatory but alsoinhibitory molecules. Expression levels of these moleculescan modulate the T-cell activation threshold which inturn impacts the functional avidity of the emerging T-cellpopulation; that is, if the threshold is for a particular reasonvery high, then only T-cell clones which have a rather high functional avidity will be activated and the overall functional avidity of the merging population will be high. An example for the modulation of T-cell activation thresholds is the to low-a nity ligands [ 89]. Moreover, it has been shown that APCs which express higher levelsof B7.1, but also ICAM and LFA3, induce T cells withhigher functional avidity. Those were shown to proliferatemore vigorously, produce more cytokines, and kill targetcells more e ciently in both primary and secondary T-cell responses [ 90,91]. Similar observations were made using a combination of B7 costimulations and -CTLA-4 anti-body- mediated blockade [ 92]. On the other hand, APCs can express molecules that induce negative signals in CD8 T cells such as PD-L1. Theexpression of such inhibitory receptors is mostly drivenby persisting antigen stimulation in chronic infections ortumors [ 93,94]. 3.2. Antigen Doses and Antigen Presentation. Several in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that antigen exposure influences the antigen sensitivity of the emerging T-cell population[95-97]. It was shown that CD8 T cells expanded by low doses of peptide successfully lyse target cells expressingless antigen and mediated increased viral clearance thanCD8 T cells stimulated with high peptide doses [ 97]. DC presenting di erent densities of pMHC-complexes had distinct influence on the functional avidity of respondingCD8 T cells in immunized mice. In particular, low antigendoses were associated with high avidity and higher capacityof recall responses to recognize melanoma cells [ 96]. Thus, the ligand density that is presented during an infection and during T-cell priming can impact what types of T cellsemerge [ 40], which seems to be particularly important in the context of vaccination [ 97]. The amount of pMHC-complexes presented by an APC critically depends on the stability of the individual pMHC-complex. Surface pMHC-turnover rates also impact whichtypes of T-cell clones become activated [ 98,99]. Interestingly, DCs seem to be able to present pMHC-complexes muchlonger than other cells, which likely supports their nonre-dundant role in initiating T-cell responses [ 100]. More recently, the impact of the peptide dose on CD8 T-cell avidity has been investigated in melanoma patientsClinical and Developmental Immunology 5 vaccinated with di erent doses of Melan-A/MART-1 peptide. Melan-A-specic CD8 T cells from patients vaccinated doses had functionally high-avidity T cells withlow CD8 dependency. In particular, they showed enhanceddegranulation and cytotoxic activities and lower levels ofCD8 expression [ 101]. These observations facilitated the development of new immunotherapy approaches against cancer and chronic infections. 4. Functional Avidity Maturation The functional avidity of a T-cell population often increasesduring the course of an immune response and followingpathogen reexposure [ 102]. Along with that, enhancement in pMHC-multimer binding has been reported [ 103]. T wo principle mechanisms have been shown to contribute to theavidity maturation phenomenon. Clonal remodeling in thepopulation of antigen-specic T cells occurs massively inprimary infections [ 104], recall responses [ 105,106], and for instance during persisting infection like CMV in humans [107]. During this remodeling, the progeny of T-cell clones with high functional avidity become more prevalent. In pri-mary infections, the di erences in expansion length between T-cell clones with high or low functional avidity account forthis phenomenon [ 104]. However, the mechanisms driving clonal remodeling in secondary infections are less clear, butit is likely caused by antigen competition between high andlow-a nity T cells clones [ 108] and possibly by alterations in the T-cell stimulation threshold. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that even T cells expressing the same TCR can di er in their func- tional avidity and that the latter depends on the state ofdierentiation of T cells. For instance, it has been shown that during an LCMV infection, the functional avidity ofTCR transgenic T cells increases [ 81]. Moreover, it has been observed that memory T cells can exhibit a higherfunctional avidity than that of na \u00a8ve T cells [ 109,110]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute tothe maturation of the functional T-cell avidity at the clonalT-cell level. Those include (1) the formation of clustersthat comprise several TCRs and other molecules able toreinforce the immunological synapses and changes in thecholesterol content of the membrane contribute to suchdierences [ 111-113] and (2) the optimization of the signal transduction machinery, for example, by increasing the amount and the basal phosphorylation levels of signalingmolecules [ 81,114]. Moreover, it has been shown that the expression of Lck correlates with the production of IFN- , whereby minor increases in Lck expression lead to majorincreases in IFN- production [ 57]. In contrast, it has also been reported that the functional avidity can decrease [ 65] or remain similar (as seen for OT-1 TCR transgenic T cells[104]) during an infection, and whether or not memory T cells are truly more sensitive than na \u00a8ve T cells remains controversial. Overall, functional avidity maturation allows faster virus clearance/control at the time of antigen reencounter and aprogressive acquisition of coreceptor binding and costim- ulatory signal independency [ 81,115,116]. In the context of peripheral tolerance, however, the continuous exposureto antigen in the context of molecular mimicry mightlead to a nity maturation which in turn may result in autoimmunity [ 72]. Besides this consideration, it has also been shown that autoreactive T cells undergo limited avidity maturation [ 117]. In contrast to these processes that follow acute infection, the dynamics in the T-cell population in chronic infectionsappear to be di erent. We recently demonstrated that HIV- specic CD8 T cells undergo a massive TCR renewal for instance following a virus rebound [ 84]. Interestingly, it has been observed that changes in TRBV populations overtimego along with a loss of low-avidity T cells clones or moregenerally speaking an increase in functional avidity [ 118]. These observations will be discussed in more details in thenal sections of this paper. 5. The Functional Avidity of T Cells as a Correlate of Immune Protection There is a general consensus that higher functional avidity CD8 T-cell responses are of higher e cacy to eliminate cancer cells and to clear acute virus infections, a notion that issupported by a large number of reports [ 103,106,119-121]. It was for instance shown that high functional avidity T ax-specic CD8 T-cell lines\u2014which use a very diverseTCR superior to eliminateHTLV-1-infected cells than low-avidity T ax-specic CD8 Tcells. These cells were also able to recognize a latent T axlevel (detectable only by RT-PCR) produced by adult T-cellleukemia cells (ATLs), thus possibly leading to the preventionof HTLV-1 infection [ 122]. For tumors, high functional avidity T cells mediate better T-cell responses [ 119], though it needs to be said that tolerance-enforcing mechanisms e ectively remove high- avidity self- and tumor-antigen reactive T cells [ 123,124]. Thus, tumor-reactive T cells will in most cases have a lowerfunctional avidity than what can be observed during acuteinfections. Low antigen expression and absence of inflammatory and costimulatory signals may be partially responsible forthe low immunogenicity of many tumor cells. The presence of higher-avidity CD8 T cells may be particularly relevant to overcome the tolerance to tumor antigens. This may beachieved by dening a combination of adjuvants and byregulating antigen doses in vaccines [ 97,125,126]. Indeed, higher-avidity T cells are preferentially triggered leading toa more rapid and e ective target-cell elimination [ 14,26, 97,119,127-129]. Consistently, in both mice models, induction of higher-avidity CD8 T-cell responsespromoted more e cient tumor rejection [ 101,130]a n d earlier target cell lysis in the context of viral infection,reducing viral burden more e ectively than low-avidity CD8 T cells. In addition, this activity does not depend on thefrequency of antigen-specic CD8 T cells [ 131].6 Clinical and Developmental Immunology There are also several studies correlating the presence of certain MHC alleles with di erences in the diversity and functional avidity of T-cell clones that emerge during tumors or chronic infections. For example, H-2Kbm8mice express an H-2K allele that di ers in four amino acids from H-2Kb. Compared to C57BL/6 mice, the H-2Kbm8mice generate herpes simplex (HSV-) higherresistance to HSV infection [ 14]. Similarly, C57BL/6 mice are less susceptible to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection than BALB/c mice. Among the many possible explanations, it has been observed that the H-2d alleles induce the generation of immunodominant antigen-specic CD8 T-cell populations that use a morerestricted TCR repertoire, and that is less e cient in lysing target cells than what can be observed in C57BL/6 mice. Thisresults in continuous T-cell stimulation and thus in cytokine-mediated immunopathology [ 132]. Furthermore, the strongest genetic association of the ability to e ectively control HIV infections points at the MHC locus [ 32] and at the presence of certain MHC molecules such as HLA-B 57 [ 133]. In line with the earlier mentioned, the latter is thought to strongly impact therepertoire and the quality of HIV-specic T cells and thusenabling an enhanced virus control. In contrast to these observations, the relevance of high- and low-avidity T cells in chronic virus infections andestablished tumors [ 86,134,135] remains to be deter- mined, in particular, since some studies have challenged thesuperiority of high-avidity CD8 T cells [ 136,137]. Indeed, low-avidity T cells (1) might better distinguish betweentumors overexpressing self-antigens and healthy self-tissue[136] and (2) might during chronic viral infections and tumors be less sensitive to activation-induced cell death(AICD) [ 129,138], senescence and exhaustion, leading to protracted survival of functionally-competent T cells, and (3) are less likely to induce viral or tumor escape [ 26,134, 139]. In the context of chronic-controlled infections, such as CMV and EBV , the T-cell responses to immunodominantantigens have a more diverse repertoire with higher TCRavidity than that of subdominant clonotypes. However, theya r ea l s om o r ep r o n et os e n e s c e n c e[ 140]. In addition, in vitro stimulation at high antigen concentrations induces higher AICD [ 138] and more pronounced inhibition of proliferation in high-avidity than in low-avidity T cells[129]. Finally, we [ 36] and others [ 141] have shown that high-avidity CD8 T cells express higher levels of the T-cellexhaustion marker PD-1 than those of low-avidity CD8 Tcells. In addition, in the context of tumor immunity, skin depigmentation is considered as a good prognosis indicatorin melanoma patients, since it is a sign of immune activationagainst tumor/self-antigens, and a high frequency of CD8T cells was observed in depigmentated tissue from patients[137]. These were MC1R HLA-A2-specic, and despite harboring low functional avidity, they were IFN- and granzyme B [ Interestingly, of mice tolerant to the hemagglutinin (HA) antigenand bearing a renal carcinoma overexpressing HA led to the expansion of low-avidity HA-specic CD8 T cells. Thesecould only target tumor cells expressing high antigen doses,thus allowing the destruction of HA-over-expressing tumorsbut not healthy pancreatic cells [ 136]. However, it is worth mentioning that depending on the biology of the pathogen, T cells endowed with di erent func- tions and tropism are required, and, thus, a generalizationof the features of a universally e cient T-cell response is complicated or may be not possible. 6. Functional Avidity as a Correlate of Control in HIV Infection With regard to HIV infection, contrasting conclusions on the relationship between functional avidity and virus controlhave been reported [ 142-146]. Some studies indicated that protective HIV-specic CD8 T-cell responses (e.g., thoseobserved in HIV-infected patients with nonprogressive infec-tion) were of high functional avidity and mediated superior variants recognition [ 86,135,143,147,148]. In these studies, high-avidity CD8 T cells were not only mostly poly-functional, endowed with potent virus suppressive activity,increased cross-reactivity, and associated with low levels ofvirus replication [ 86,135,147], but were also characterized by an increased T-cell turnover and senescence [ 86]. However, most of these studies focused on HIV-specic CD8 T-cell responses directed against only one epitope, andanalyses were performed on single clones derived from T-cell expansion which may not reflect the in vivo /ex vivo prole of T cells [ 38,39]. In addition, since the majority of studies reporting correlations between functional avidity andvirus control are cross-sectional and not prospective studiesin unselected populations, it is not possible to determinecausality between avidity and virus control. More recently, it was shown that gag-specic and HLA- B-restricted CD8 T-cell responses, usually associated avidity were of higher functional avidity in controllersthan in noncontrollers. Finally, consistently with the above-mentioned studies, protective T-cell responses KK10and KF11 (restricted 2705 and B5701, resp.) avidity than all the other HLA-B-restricted epitopes [ 147]. Conversely, other studies indicated that the functional avidity of HIV-specic CD8 T cells is not di erent between patients with progressive or nonprogressive chronic infec-tion or between gag- and other HIV-specic CD8 T cells[150] and also that uncontrolled virus replication seen in progressive HIV infection occurs despite the presenceof high-avidity HIV-specic CD8 T-cell responses [ 142- showed that polyfunctional virus-specic CD8 T-cell responses in thecontext of chronic viral infections were predominantly oflow functional avidity [ 36]. In addition, when the avidity Immunology 3fold di erence int1/2for HLA-multimer interaction was found. In contrast to the clone of lower a nity, the one with higher a nity did not show cytotoxic activity, cytokine production, orproliferative capacity following stimulation with the cognate antigen [ 153]. Furthermore, CD8 T cells transduced with a high-a nity TCR showed greater binding activity toward the specic multimer, but impaired cytotoxicity [ 153]. Finally, it was also reported that high functional avidity T-cell responses preferentially led to viral escape, T-cellclonal exhaustion, and senescence [ 26,86,134,139,141, 154]. Indeed, CD8 T cells have distinct ability to select for escape mutations for the same epitope depending onHLA restriction. The HLA restriction which confers higheravidity for the epitope induces a substantially higher level ofsequence variation and clonal turnover which in turn leads tofaster viral escape [ 134] and T-cell senescence [ 86]. However, to some extent, the emergence of viral variants escapingrecognition from higher avidity T-cell responses may also beinterpreted as an argument to support the e cacy of high- avidity T cells against HIV . Furthermore, the specicity ofCD8 T-cell responses is critical, since cells directed towardhighly variable regions may nonetheless not be able tomediate virus control. In case, they might only cause theemergence of virus escape variants. Moreover, TCR aviditycorrelates with PD-1 expression levels, and, consistently,high-avidity CD8 T cells displayed an impaired survivalinin vitro culture at low levels of antigen stimulation. In vivo , subdominant clonotypes not only are of low functional avidity and express lower PD-1 levels than those of dominant clonotypes, but also respond more e ciently to variant epi- topes, thus displaying a greater capacity of cross-recognition[141]. Although increased PD-1 expression might also be interpreted as a marker of increased activation of higheravidity T cells [ 155], in the context of chronic infection such as HIV , PD-1 is predominantly considered as a marker ofexhausted cells [ 156]. Although large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to further elucidate the dynamic relationships betweenfunctional avidity, immunodominance, and viral escape, theaforementioned information suggest that lower functionalavidity T-cell responses might be more suitable in the contextof HIV infection. 7. Functional Avidity of T Cells in Acute HIV Infection A better understanding of the immune response during primary HIV infection (PHI) is of particular relevance, sinceHIV-specic CD8 T cells in PHI are temporally associatedwith the initial control of virus replication [ 2]. Of interest, Lichterfeld and colleagues suggested that high-avidity HIV-specic CD8 T-cell presentduring early infection (dened as HIV seroconversion within6 months) but are then selectively depleted overtime [ 118]. T o our knowledge, there is no previous study addressing theissue of the functional avidity of HIV-specic CD8-T cellsin a cohort of HIV-infected patients with very early acute infection (based on stringent criteria of enrollment). However, we recently had the opportunity to investigate the functional avidity of HIV-specic CD8 T-cell responsesin a true PHI cohort (i.e., presence of an acute clinical syndrome, a negative HIV antibody test, a positive test for HIV RNA in plasma, and presence of fewer than three positive bands in a Western blot) [ 157]. In this context, we observed that the functional avidity of HIV-specicCD8 T-cell responses was signicantly lower in PHI thanin chronic infection and remained low after several yearsof antiretroviral therapy (Vigano and Harari, unpublishedobservation). Conversely, we noted ( Figure 2 ) an increase in the functional avidity of HIV-specic CD8 T cells inpatients experiencing a virus rebound following treatmentinterruption [ 84]. These observations might be explained by two nonmu- tually exclusive mechanisms: rst, the progressive selectionof clones with higher functional avidity and, on the otherhand, the recruitment of new clones with higher functionalavidity. The potential combination of these mechanismswould induce a modication of the TCR repertoire [ 84,103, 106,107,118]. 8. Perspectives and Hypothesis Detailed monitoring of phenotypes and functional charac- teristics of T cells in di erent viral infection has strongly augmented our understanding of the relationship betweenviral infections and the immune response they induce. Werecently made thorough comparisons of the types of T cellsresponding to infections that the immune system rapidlyclears ( Influenza (Flu) or Adenovirus (Ad5)), or infections caused by CMV and EBV as well as HIV infections inthe acute and chronic phase. We saw that the functionalavidity of T cells specic to Flu and Ad5 was similar tothat of T cells in the acute phase of HIV infection. Incontrast, signicantly higher functional avidities of T cells were noticed in the chronic progressive and nonprogressive HIV infection, but interestingly those were comparable tothe functional avidity seen during chronic CMV and EBVinfections. Furthermore, when patients were treated duringacute infection but experienced a virus rebound followingtreatment interruption (TI), the functional avidity of HIV-specic CD8 T cells increased (AH and SV unpublishedobservations). 9. Summary Functional T-cell avidity is a critical attribute of antiviral andantitumoral immunity. The strength of interaction betweenthe TCR and pMHC-molecule, expression levels of thecoreceptors, as well as signaling particularities are pivotal indetermining the functional avidity of a T-cell clone. It is well established that T-cell populations can over the course of infection or upon multiple exposure toinfections or infectious exacerbation undergo signicantchanges in the ability to recognize cognate antigen.

(e)Increase in the functional avidity of HIV-specic CD8 T cells of patients treated during acute infection who interrupted the antiretroviral therapy [TI] and experienced a virus rebound. later is at a rst glance somewhat surprising as T cells, unlike B cells, express a xed TCR and cannot undergosomatic hypermutation. Predominantly, the clonal compo- sition impacts the functional avidity of the T-cell population and avidity maturation. In addition to the reinforcement ofthe immunological synapses through the formation of TCRclusters, the optimization of the signal transduction machin-ery further contributes to avidity maturation. However, theunderstanding of mechanisms underlying this phenomenonis still limited, and further studies need to be undertaken tobetter understand how all these possible variations and likelymany yet unknown ones impact the functional avidity of Tcells when responding to di erent types of infections. In the context of viral infections, functional avidity maturation allows faster virus clearance by recall T-cellresponses. However, the role of high versus low functionalavidity T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV remainsunclear. Here, it needs to be considered that high-avidityT cells exhibit greater T-cell exhaustion and lead to rapidemergence of escape variants suggesting a pivotal role of low-avidity T cells. Studies to better delineate the factors influencing the functional avidity of T-cell responses are relevant in orderto allow ne tuning of the prole of vaccine-induced T cells.We consider that the goal of vaccination or immunotherapyagainst acute infections and to induce pathogen clearanceshould be the induction of high-avidity T cells, since such cells most e ectively eliminate infected cells. Conversely, when pathogen clearance cannot be achieved, then theultimate goal is to provide durable control of a persistent pathogen. A vaccine that deals with such a situation shouldbe designed to generate low-avidity T cells, since those might be more suitable to generate a pool of long-lasting e ector T cells in a situation of chronic infection.
