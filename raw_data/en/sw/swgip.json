This weekend when qigong master Effie Chow visits Spokane, Grieve has a private appointment. \"I felt I'd keep an open mind because this is a centuries-old healing tradition,\" said Grieve, a Spokane mother of four grown children, who suffers from lupus. A month's worth of acupressure and qigong treatments with Dr. Linda Chiu Hole of Spokane already has helped relieve Grieve's \"awful tiredness\" and the stiffness in her right hand. This weekend, Grieve will attend Effie Chow's series of lectures and workshops on \"Qigong: Miracle Healing\" in Spokane. Chow, a San Francisco nurse and acupuncturist, will speak at the Masonic Temple Friday evening, present a healing workshop at Crescent Court on Saturday, sign books at Peking North Saturday evening, and lead a session on medical qigong for health professionals on Sunday. Chow served as an advisory panel member for the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine. She co-wrote, with Dr. Charles McGee of Coeur d'Alene, \"Qigong: Miracle Healing From China.\" Case histories in the book sound almost biblical: the woman cellist with multiple sclerosis who healed enough through qigong to walk, drive and play the cello again. The 62-year-old stroke victim paralyzed on the right side for two years who began to walk and garden again. The 2-year-old little girl with cerebral palsy who learned to stand and walk after qigong treatments. But Sister Eileen Croghan, provincial superior of the Sisters of Providence, who are co-sponsoring Chow's visit, says, \"It's not miraculous healing. I think it's using the body's own mechanisms in a way that enhances and heals us.\" Qigong (pronounced chee-gung) is a traditional Chinese healing art, which, according to Chow, has been kept secret for 4,000 years. The knowledge was closely guarded and saved and military leaders and Buddhist priests. It went underground during China's Cultural Revolution and only recently emerged. Today, qigong has spread to the masses in China, where it is practiced, along with another exercise called t'ai chi, by millions of people each morning in public parks. Moyers and his crew captured qigong on film during his \"Healing and the Mind\" series. They traveled through Shanghai parks and hospital qigong units to research this healing practice. \"The last few years of my father's life were so uncomfortable for him,\" Moyers said after observing elderly Chinese people practice qigong. \"He had chronic headaches. I took him to several major medical centers in the United States, and nobody could help him. I watch these people and I keep thinking that there is something here that might have helped him by enabling him to deal with that pain.\" Qigong consists of a number of exercises, centered around the breath, which help people to feel and move the vital life energy in their bodies. The Chinese word for this energy is qi or chi. \"The free flow of qi gives us health,\" says Chow. \"The blockage of this energy is what creates dis-ease in the beginning. Then it becomes a disease: cancer, a cardiovascular condition, diabetes, asthma.\" Hole, a Spokane physician who works with qi in her practice, says, \"I thought about it as having traffic jams in your energy flow. When the traffic jams, the energy becomes stagnant and you end up with a physical symptom.\" To most American doctors, however, the concept of qi is unproven, and simply makes no sense. \"It's been very difficult for many doctors to accept this because this wasn't how we were trained in medical school,\" says Dr. Sherrill Pratt, a retired Spokane pediatrician, who has attended Chow's weekend workshops. Pratt was surprised by Chow's results during these sessions. She believes qigong would be effective for relaxation, pain relief and improving general well-being. When Chow teaches a patient to use qigong, she begins with a breathing exercise. She asks the person to stand up straight, and to imagine a silver thread extending up from the ground, to the tailbone, up the spine and out of the top of the head. She teaches the person to breathe deeply into the belly, not the chest, exhale gently through the mouth, and imagine the qi moving throughout the body. Chow grew up in a small Chinese community in Duncan, B.C. Her family used traditional Chinese medicine, including qigong. As an adult, Chow became a registered nurse, but eventually she yearned to blend Western and Chinese medicine. She began working as an apprentice with acupuncturists and qigong masters in Hong Kong. She discovered she could actually feel qi. \"It feels like a puff ball,\" Chow says. \"Sometimes like a cloud. There's a substance there. When you feel good, it's like you feel light, elevated, clear of mind and spirit.\" , DataTimes ILLUSTRATION: Color photo "}
