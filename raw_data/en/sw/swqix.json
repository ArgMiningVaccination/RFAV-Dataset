I think there's still a novelty factor, which in certain respects I feel I've benefited from. Though I am very conscious that women seem to be held to a lower standard by some in the music community, and so often are used to almost...decorate bands full of men instead of really being called upon to provide a substantial contribution. and I think that kind of thing, the pretty girl tambourine player or the lady backup singer can often lead to a generalization of all women in music as only marginally talented, which is a shame, because obviously that's complete crap. As far as moments I could point to...for some reason when I think of sexism in music I so often think of sound guys at clubs and bars. I've never been condescended to more as a live performer than by sound guys. I've been called \"cute\" for asking someone to turn up my monitor, been asked when loading in if I was \"the violin player\" and when I said no, was told \"but you're the girl\", been called \"bitchy\" or a \"diva\" for asking for cables or a glass of water. this makes me realize I need to meet some older female musicians and talk to them. \"I'm sure they did and I hope the reason I can't remember any right now is because it sank in and became one with me. my advice would be: force yourself! if you're scared of it, if it seems hard, it's probably going to make you better. do things you think you aren't good enough to do.\" \"voice: always have sung. always! before I could talk! guitar: was obsessed with Eddie Vedder when I was 13 and desperately wanted to rock. banjo: a renewed interest in americana and bluegrass in my late 20s, plus I love the way they sound truly, if I had the time and the money to become skilled at every instrument i thought sounded pretty, i would.\" - Instruments: My own groups Sokolov solo through quartet and recently a 18 voice group I ahve been writin for chorally plus a few collaborative projects with other singers - Years playing: vocals, keyboards, piano I am the leader.

There is a certain boy club involved in the music business. There is also the gender difference that has to do with an attitude and comfort around self promotion that I don't think many of the woman musicians I know have to the same degree that their male counterparts have. I think there is also a cultural bias around fear of the fierce expressive feminine power. Not really. You had Laura Nyro, Betty Carter. These were powerful woman, who I believe because of their gender wereignored or scorned by the press far more than their male counterparts. Stay true to your voice and just keep on doing it. Keep on doing it. Make relationship. Long term relationship with players, producers, engineers. Been singing and playing since I was tiny - Instruments: Two. My band & a band called Fools for April - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Piano I write all the songs. I co-produce the records, and do alot of sole production at my home studio. I'm involved in all marketing and business decisions, though I like to have other members of the business team take initiative to make strides forward. \"Guitar: 1959 Gibson ES-330. Amp: Carr Rambler Martin Travel Acoustic Guitar\" \"Yes. There is a double standard. Aesthestics, sexy-ness, etc play a much more significant role. Then if you ARE attractive, it's often presumed your talent is inversely proportionate. Often when people see the face of a woman fronting music, they immediately assume \"\"chick-rock\"\" or some pre-conceived idea of girl music. You have to work harder to prove your musicianship. I didn't choose to be female, and while my life perspective certainly influences what I write about, I consider a great song, or music, about the overall human experience... not a male/female specific experience. \" \" In modern times it seems, female musicians success has become more focused on aesthetics, sexiness, etc. Then that sexiness is often taken as an over-compensation for lack of talent. I think back to Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, Nina Simone, etc... and it seemed that they had their own style and it wasn't necessarily what most people would deem as sexy or glamourous.... but it was theirs and it was respected. \" \" Music is universal. It lives beyond race, sex, religion, time. Live your music. Don't let others trick you in to thinking it has to fit in a tiny box based on any of the above.\" I had a guitar already and it seemed the most obvious for songwriting. - Instruments: just myself, Megan Reilly - Years playing: vocals, guitar \"I do all of it. I think most people do these days. There are several guys who play with me. Because I play with these distinguished players and am a bit younger than they are I sometimes feel self conscious taking charge but they have made work incredibly easy for me, giving invaluable advice and support.\" I play a Fender Bullet guitar and a Fender Princeton Reverb amplifier. I found my guitar at a consignment store in Memphis when I was eighteen. Jeff Evans of the Gibson Brothers saw it and told me I should go see it. People comment on it a lot. It's the only electric I've ever played. I love the sound of it. And I love the sound of my amp. Someone always assumes my guitar belongs to my husband. I suppose I could stop asking him to carry it! I would have to believe it's a lot easier for us now. \"In a recent conversation after one of my shows, I asked a friend, \"\"Am I going to be fifty years old lugging my amp onstage at The Mercury Lounge? And he said, \"\"Yes\"\". We work on our art because we are meant to do so no matter the recognition. The best thing any musician can do is follow their instinct.\" I never wanted to just sing where my fate depended on finding other musicians. So I taught myself guitar and began writing my own songs. - Instruments: Cady FInlayson Band, Cady FInlayson & VIta Tanga, Police Pipes and Drums of Bergen County - Years playing: violin (Irish fiddle) \"For the band, I am the bandleader responsible for all business/marketing decisions (with input from everyone). Artistic decisions are made more from a group perspective. For the duo, we are equal in artistic decisions and my partner handles some aspects of the business work (i.e. making station ids for radio) while I handle the booking and marketing aspects. In the studio,(duo) we come in with a basic arrangement worked out, and often work through our different ideas during the mixing, as we often like different sounds. UlTImately we come up with something that is satisfying to both of us (sometimes with a lot of debate!)\" \"I play on a 5-string fiddle made by Eric Aceto, who is a maker from Ithaca New York.It is an electric-acoustic (can sound completely acoustic when amplified) I also have a wireless system for the shows I do with the Police Dept. and that is a Sennheiser wireless system. For band shows I have a pa system EV speakers and powermate board. \" \"I have never felt what I hear some people talk about , i.e. a separate struggle as a woman. I work with a lot of men (i.e. in the police group I am the only woman) and I work in a genre (Irish music) that more than anything else is about the music (as compared to pop music that can be more about the dress). The only thing I have noticed is that women and girls do come up and say how nice it is to see a woman onstage. ...and sometimes they give me a hard time at music stores if I want to match my cables (color)!\" I see that in rock it is much more common now to have women in the band, and also organizations such as GoGirlsmusic and \"Women in Music\" that are there to support women in music. \"I think the one thing to remember is that every path is different and what is right for you may not be right for someone else. It is important to have a strong sense of who you are as a musician (and this may change over time) and to choose projects that reflect that and that excite you. If you hang on to \"\"what is music\"\" for you and what makes you want to jump up in the morning and play, then all the tough aspects of the music industry are just challenges that you will find a way to navigate with your soul intact. -Cady Finlayson Spirited Irish fiddle with a Global Twist cadyfinlayson.com www.fiddleandguitar.com\" I fell in love with the violin hearing it as a child and I have had that feeling ever since! - Instruments: Varies - Years playing: voc \"In my main group (Andrea Wolper Trio/Quartet/Quintet), I'm leader and, for some of the music, arranger and/or composer. Objects in Mirror: leader. TranceFormation: co-leader (TF is a leaderless improvising trio Connie Crothers and Ken Filiano). In the studio, co-producer. I feel the pressure of being in charge of everything, though. I make just about all my business and marketing decisions (only in parts of Europe, where I have an agent, do I have some help).\" \"Sennsheiser E865 Preamp\" \"The differences aren't about actually being a musician, and have everything to do with culture and perception. My genres (jazz and improvised music) historically have skewed toward macho. Singing tends to be undervalued by many practitioners and listeners in these genres. And, historically, most women in these genres have been singers, and most singers have been women. So sometimes being both -- a woman and a singer -- can leave one feeling somewhat marginalized. Additionally, I sometimes find it difficult to make demands or express expectations of the members of my groups (most of whom have been male). I believe this is because in life in general it can be difficult for women to balance being direct and assertive with concerns about being perceived as \"\"shrewish\"\" or aggressive. At my age I'm still trying to understand how to communicate clearly in a way that's respectful of everyone including myself.\" I think so. For one thing, more and more women instrumentalists are emerging within the newer generations, and I believe the younger men are more accustomed to interacting as equals in musical settings with women. While most singers in my genres historically didn't go to music school (college and post-grad), now many do. I have very mixed feelings about the impact of advanced music education in academic settings, but that's another conversation; one benefit, I believe, is that the women who attend music school probably start out on a more equal footing with the men and, as above, women and men are more used to interacting and thinking of one another as colleagues. \"I can't think of any advice I was given. The advice I'd give is: Be smart, be strong. Cultivate mentors IF you honestly connect with their music and personality. Try not to worry about what other people think of you. Express your music from the deepest, most honest place you can find. Take advice that's meaningful to you, and leave the rest behind.\" I've sung my whole life. It's always been part of how I've expressed, entertained, comforted myself, as well as one of the most powerful ways I have to communicate my inner life and connect with other people. It's such a direct, immediate route to and from the full range of human thoughts and feelings. - Instruments: 4 different bands. - Years playing: Vocals/Guitar I'm the singer and songwriter in the band. I have a strong sense of what I want my music to sound like, but I usually surround my self with like minded and creative musicians that naturally ads something to the music, without me having to direct them. I like an open environment when I record. It requires a lot of trust in the people you work with, but trust is important for the creative flow. In business and marketing, I'm very hands on. I have run my own ship, without a manager for most of my career, so I'm at this point quite experienced, when it comes to contracts, negotiations as well as marketing strategies. But, I am quite tired of wearing that hat and hope to find people that I can trust to take that role in the future. Fender telecaster, Duesenbrg guitar, Martin guitar, 1960 vintage Hummingbird, Vox AC30. I have never identified my self so much with being a woman doing music. I'm just a person doing music. I am almost always around men in my musical work and I never really think about it. Gender has never been an issue. There is a difference I guess. But womens role in society has changed a lot through out the past decades and this was reflected in the way they were portrayed in the media of course. Billie Holiday would sing songs with lyrics like \"I'd rather my man would hit me, than just get up and quite me, Ain't nobodys business if I do\". You wouldn't hear a woman on the radio singing about this in our day and age. We still have young girls and women in music today that fits someones airbrushed fantasy, but who am I to judge. I feel women like Patti Smith paved the way for our generation females in Rock, where ugly can be beautiful. Its brave for women to give up being pretty as a tool in your box. I think she is beautiful, when she spits and hisses and scratch at your soul. She is my hero. Perseverance. That's the best advice I've been given and that's what I'd say to anybody asking me for advice. If music is your life, its not really a choice is it? You just have to. I've been singing since I was a kid. It was a way for me to shut the world out and keeping my self sane. I started to play guitar so that I could write music. - Instruments: 40 years + - Years playing: vocals/guitar/piano/bass/accordion singer/songwriter/musician (bass, accordion, guitar) Martin guitar, Taylor guitar, G & L bass, Hohner accordion, various keyboards \"yes record companies sign fewer women and it's still an industry dominated by men the moment that was made clear was when an executive at Chrysalis Records said they wouldn't sign me because they already had Pat Benatar and someone going into a record store would not buy 2 records by a woman.\" \"yes- women musicians today don't feel they have any constraints also, a woman musician in a band is now considered an asset, something cool\" \"the only advice was to have no expectations. I would tell a woman starting out to do it because she loves music and can't see herself doing anything else. I would tell her to do it for the love and satisfaction of creating music. I don't think this advice is any different from what I would tell a man. The only difference is I might tell a woman don't be surprised if you still viewed as a \"\"chick singer\"\". \" I play many instruments. Each has a different story. - Instruments: Four - The Swear (my main group, vocals, guitar, songwriting), Ghost of Summer Suns (solo project), Granville Automatic (guitar, songwriting), Supervisor of the Loveless Average (bass) - Years playing: Guitar, bass, mandolin, vocals \"The Swear & Ghost of Summer Suns: I run everything - I manage, book, do PR/marketing, manage websites, promote, write songs, play, etc. Granville Automatic: the duties are shared between both bandmates. Supervisor of the Loveless Average: I just play bass.\" \"Guitars: two Gretsch duo jets, one Gretsch white penguin (I'm endorsed by Gretsch); Les Paul Standard, Epiphone Les Paul, Telecaster, 1978 Marshall JCM800, Sovtek Mig 50, Vox AC15\" Yes, though I try to ignore it. I'm the only girl in the Swear and we all hate it when we are asking to play \"all girl\" stages or events. The biggest pet peeve of mine is that people (including soundguys, etc.) don't ever think I play guitar. They assume I'm just the girl that sings. So when I bring in my amp and start playing I hear a lot of \"you are pretty good for a girl\" or \"you don't play guitar like a girl.\" No, not really. I don't think it matters if you are male or female. My advice is to get used to hearing the words \"no\" and \"we'll pass\" - and use them as motivation. I like the power of electric guitar and bass. - Instruments: i write the music! - Years playing: i'm primarily a composer \"hello! have you ever heard of anything outside of pop music? jazz? classical? the music formerly called classical? contemporary music written by people with a wide range of influences outside of pop??\" pencil, paper, computer, keyboard, cello no it's much easier for younger women to enter into composition now \"no no special advice for a young woman musician - it's really tough for everyone, and my advice isn't about the business side of music anyway, except for the obvious, which younger people seem to have no problem figuring out - get to know someone with power in the field.../my advice is strictly about how to work with musical ideas and performers/ \" \"piano - mother started teaching me violin - they gave me one in grade school because they didn't have a small cello i became serious about violin but as an adult switched to cello, which i had fallen in love with when i was really young and saw a documentary on pablo casals/\" - Instruments: Roulette Sisters, Les Chauds Lapins, Gloria Deluxe, Poor Baby Bree, Young @ Heart Chorus, JG Thirlwell's Manorexia, Lia Ices, SIcular, Rocketship Park, - Years playing: viola, violin, vocals I generally prefer to be the main melodic instrument, because it's rare to see violists in that role in bands. I act mostly as a sider person, but with the Roulette Sisters I am often the contact for gig scheduling and pitching. \"1992 Viola, House of Weaver, DC Barcus Berry pick-up\" Every time I have a gig (unless I'm with my all-girl band The Roulette Sisters) it's painfully obvious how few women are in this industry. I'm not expected to know how to improvise or follow charts, because it's assumed that as a viola-player I'm a meek classical musician. I have to use sexuality and flirting to get gigs, because, honestly, sometimes it's REALLY paid off. I participated in an all-women's composition festival, and the quality of work was really embarrassing throughout the weekend. Women are not representing the avant-garde or experimental music scene in NYC in a very clear way, and I think I realized that when I sat back and tried to make a mix of music for a lesbian friend, wanting to showcase NYC talent. The mix was 3 songs long. I wish I knew older women musicians, period. Nobody gives anybody advice in NYC. We're all so desperate for the gigs, it's dog eat dog. Started on violin, but as I approached the 6'1\" stature I was to become my teacher suggested (at age 11) that I move to violin's bigger cousin the viola. - Years playing: vocals and guitar I am the songwriter, performer and marketing machine. I have a producer in the studio and work with additional PR people as needed. Martin guitar, Bose L1 sound system For a long time, I was surrounded by men and the few women I ran into were highly competitive. It was hard to find a female friend in the industry. That has changed dramatically. More women support each other and work together which is heartening. More men take us seriously. My guess is that, with the support of other women, we've learned to take ourselves more seriously and do not feel that we have to prove ourselves to the men in the industry. I'm always blown away by the heart and soul that comes from more mature women in music. Self-consciousness fades and they are directed by an inner sense of purpose that enables them to really connect with their audience. The more comfortable they are with themselves, the more they give. It's a beautiful thing to watch women move into that phase. Of course, some younger women have it as well but, generally speaking, it takes time to develop. \"I've received tons of advice but the most valuable advice was to listen to myself. No one knows what your vision is but you and you can't build a career out of other people's wants and desires. When people give you advice, it's based on their perception, their limitations, the obstacles they've faced and the failures they've had. You can't limit yourself to someone else's experience. That said, it's helpful to find someone you can talk to who is honest, has integrity and is capable of being objective. My closest friend is someone in the industry who holds me accountable to the goals I've set for myself. If I become lazy or discouraged, I have someone who will take me aside and question me. I'd rather have that in this business than someone to flatter me. Compliments are nice but you can only learn what you've done right and not what needs to be improved. \" Singing came naturally to me and there was a guitar in our house when we were little. I loved playing with it. - Instruments: God's Own (G.O.) - Years playing: vocals I own an independent record label for which I write, produce, promote, and market. I'm a songwriter and vocalist. I've produced a gospel CD titled \"No Greater Force\" featuring the legendary Dorothy Norwood and other great talents. In gospel, I don't believe any difference is as obvious. If there is a difference, it would be due to the culture in which we live and the pressures put on women to sell themselves rather than their music. Yes. The older generation seems to have contributed music with much more meaningful content. However, there are countless musicians today who contribute powerfully meaningful content in their music. As Dorothy Norwood has told me, I would say \"persevere\" and \"stick with what works for you\". I began singing because I enjoyed the singing of certain others, and I was so deeply moved by it. Then, I realized how much others were moved by my live singing. - Instruments: 4 - Slydell, Blackswan, Jenny Lewis with The Watson Twins, and our current project The Watson Twins - Years playing: vocals & guitar \"All duties are shared with my sister Leigh, the other twin, we are the main song writers and we trade off singing lead and playing guitar. In the studio we are very involved in the entire process. From choosing the musicians, studio location, sounds, instrumentation, mixing and mastering. Our first record was a self-released EP called \"\"Southern Manners\"\", because we were without a label at the time my sister and I and our manager, Lisa Klipsic, were very \"\"hands on\"\" out of necessity. Nothing was going to be done unless we pushed to make it happen. At this point in our career we now have a team of people working on our project, but we still remain very involved and hands on from a creative and business standpoint. I think that's because we have been that way since the beginning.\" Vintage Yamaha Acoustic guitar, Beta 58 Mic, some percussion (i.e. tambo, shakers, etc.), harmonica and vocal chords \"Yes, the music industry is definitely a male dominated field. I think women have made a lot of progress in the past few years which is very exciting but it's not always easy to be \"\"heard.\"\" I spent a lot of years trying to voice my ideas and opinions to male producers and engineers in the studio... most of the time the reaction was that they were uninterested. I think because I didn't know as much technically and on top of that being a woman, it was tough to earn their respect. Now that my sister and I are the main artists and it is our project, we have sought out people that respect us and treat us equally in the studio and on stage.\" Yes, there are more women in the music industry which is amazing and with that there has been a lot of progress in how we are viewed. I think the women's movement through out the last 40 years a pretty accurate comparison to the music business, we have made great strides but still have a ways to go. \"Patience and Persistence Give yourself room to be human \" My mom played guitar so there was always one in the house and it seemed like a good tool for writing. - Instruments: Ike Turner/ Jimmy Smith - Years playing: voval/keyboard Vocals and Keys and leader Yess...when it was thought by others that I had to lye down Yes.......from solid music with melodies and words to non singing non musical taqlking in tune/notune noisiness (LOL) Don't lay down I did not choose to play piano...my mother chose it for me...which now I apppreciate...due to composing and being able to sight read and just be great!!!!! - Instruments: synagogue choirs, Duke U. choir, Zamir, Back Bay Chorale, Euphoria (a cappella jazz quartet), many musicals (musical direction) - Years playing: voice, piano \"In choruses I sing Alto I or Soprano II. Sometimes I run sectionals, assistant conduct, or run rehearsals. In musicals I musical direct - casting, teaching all music, providing accompaniment for rehearsals, hiring and rehearsing the orchestra or pit band, and playing/conducting the music for the show's run. For Euphoria, I handled business, music commissioning, recording and post-processing, and sang alto with the band.\" \"Several good Shure vocal mics; an eight track mixing board; four high quality monitors; two high quality performance speakers A 1923 Steinway A grand piano An absolutely amazing unaccompanied vocal music library of printed music, of many genres and times.\" \"Being a woman in music is often different, and almost never in a good way. I had to fire a first violinist in a show orchestra because he wouldn't follow my conducting. His stated reason was that I was a woman and therefore couldn't conduct. Everyone else in the orchestra had no trouble following my conducting. That made it painfully clear.\" \"There are many more woman conductors of major and minor instrumental orchestras than there were forty years ago - and they still aren't that common. More women play jazz than did forty years ago - but we're still in the minority.\" Only do it if you really love it and can't/won't do anything else. I don't feel like I chose it. It chose me. I wasn't even big enough to get up on the piano bench by myself (I was 3 1/2 when I first started taking lessons). - Instruments: mostly solo, but was in folk duo The Nonchalants from 1997-2000 - Years playing: guitar and vocals \"I work solo most of the time, so that about sums it up. When the gig calls for a duo/trio/band, I line up the playsers, most of whom I've generally played with before. I do my own booking and marketing via email and social networking sites. My husband really produced my first two CDs as a solo artist (we met working on the first record), and while I deferred to him much of the time, I found it pretty easy to offer up a strong opinion. Of course, that might've been the lovely nature of our relationship at work, too. For the next CD, which I'm getting ready to make this year, I'll be interviewing other producers here in Austin. I have my ears on one in particular, and I'm looking for a great and collaborative experience.\" \"Main guitars: Gibson acoustic songwriter Gibson 3/4-size hollowbody electric; Guild classical; Les Paul epiphone electric. The PA is an assemblage of gear I've picked up over the years. I generally use a Shure 58 mic for gigs. I use an A/B pedal on stage to switch between guitar signals, a pretty typical DI box, and, of course, a Boss stage tuner. Otherwise, I'm pretty effects-free. My husband's a professional musician (full time) and recording engineer, so I like to play w/ some of his gear when he's not looking. For composition (in addition to guitar), i often turn to the upright piano in the house or my Korg X5 keyboard.\" \"Being a woman and ANYTHING is different from being a man. It's most often made clear when you walk into a music store to buy gear. The \"\"can I help you little lady?\"\" vibe rings like an out of tune bell. I get particularly nerved when the same sales clerk moves on to help a guy and you can hear them both playing Stairway to Heaven and trying to out-testosterone each other. I think most of us gals here in Austin think it's harder to get a good gig than it is for guys. Sure, you can book a coffeehouse no sweat, but if you were to look over the extensive music listings each week in the Austin Chronicle you'd find the large percentage of gigs going to men. The women who appear in the club listings are stunning and great, but it's the same line up of women from week to week. No question -- they've paid their dues and deliver the goods. But there's not a lot of great gigs for women in this town. Which may mean (and I don't have data on this, mind you), that it's harder to get audiences interested in women artists than men. I dunno! Finally, let me say that when I play with other people, I'm almost always playing with men. And my experience is that there's no sexism at all among players. A good musician is a good musician. And that's incredible fun.\" Not really, but that might be Austin. We're lucky enough to live in a town where music lovers are as old as they are young. And that's also reflected in the array of ages of working musicians here. I can think of amazing female musicians that span the ages of 16 to 60. I don't know that you'd find that in a lot of other towns. \"I didn't start to play music publicly until i was well into my 30s, and by that time, most people knew better than to give me much advice. I'd have been wise to ask for some, btw. But to any young woman musician, I'd offer: 1) Go out to hear other women perform. They're not your competition--they're your tribe. 2) Practice your instrument. The fastest way I earned respect (especially among men) was by picking up a guitar in front of people and surprising them. 3) If you're a singer-songwriter, study the craft of lyric writing, and study it hard. I wish someone had said this to me earlier. I won some songwriting competitions when I first started to play in public, so I thought I knew what I was doing. Wow -- what I didn't know could've filled an ocean. It still can, but at least I've got a lifeboat now. 4) Don't be an apologist on stage. I've seen this in both sexes, but it's particularly true of younger women I've seen. We've all got insecurities about one thing or another, but the stage isn't the place to work it out. Trust me, your audience does not wanna see it. 5) Supplement your big dream with a little strategy. Map it out: what do you want to do, and how are you going to get there? What resources do you have, and what do you need? What do you do really well, and what do you need to do better? Who in your life can help you? I know you want it all *now* but a little planning will keep you on track til you actually get there. And quit saying I sound like your mother. All most mom's really want is for their kids to be genuinely happy and for them to have a plan. Finally... 6) Have a blast doing this! You've chosen the coolest thing in the world to do with your time on this planet. You'll have days when you hate having to work your day job, when you can't get a gig to save your soul, when you it looks like there's no way you'll get the money to record, and when everything else in your life feels like an obstacle. Don't let any of that turn you into a victim. The second you hear the voice of \"\"Poor me\"\" come out of your mouth just hush up and remember: you are doing the coolest thing with your time on the planet that you could possibly do. So go do it. [Thanks -- this was fun. I think I'll go pick up my guitar now.]\" My dad put a guitar in my hand when I was 8 years old. That, and it's easier to practice quietly on a guitar. Who wants to be heard making serious gaffs? Especially when your husband's a brilliant player? - Instruments: school, church, university - Years playing: piano, organ I've been a published composer since 1957. gear? I have no gear. If you mean musical instruments, I have a Steinway piano model D (concert grand), clavinova, synthesizers, organs at church. Well, yes--we have to use the women's room. Yes. Women composers a bit more accepted now, as are women conductors. Not too much of a change with women performers--much earlier accepted. Learn to play an instrument well, learn to sing, learn to conduct, develop an outgoing personality, don't give up. We had a piano at home. - Instruments: Always under my own name - Years playing: Vocals It is \"my\" band. I am not \"in\" a band. In the studio, I tell the musicians to play what I sing. In business/marketing. I leave that to the business and marketing people. My voice and my body and my dancing shoes. Not really. I see differences between women after the seventies. Women entertainers were suggestive until then. Women have become way too salacious since then. There is little left to the imagination. My manager Jim Lewis gave me ALL of my advice about making it in the music industry. He told me to learn my craft and be prepared to work as opposed to chase being a star. Work hard and learn your craft. And surround yourself with people with steady incomes. It was the one I was given. - Years playing: vocals, guitars, keyboards, etc. I am the songwriter, producer, etc. In the studio, I normally record myself, and then bring in a mixer at the end. My husband is my manager, and together we make most of the decisions. \"Martin acoustic guitars, Vox and Ampeg amp. Roland RD-700 Keyboard. Mini Moog, Woodpecker Mic.\" It depends on the crowd you are targeting. Young teenage boys are more likely to listen to electric guitar driven indie bands. My music seems to attract more of an older crowd, which is probably not the biggest music buying crowd. But I think they relate more to my music. I think the music business has changed drastically for everyone, whether man or woman. Everyone, even those who have been in the business for years seem to be lost on what to do to market an artist. This makes things difficult, because it is very hard to get good advise or help from others. At the same time, it opens many doors and allows for creative marketing. It seems like their really are no rules now. The social media sites are the biggest blessing, as they let you take the music directly to the listener. The best advise I have ever received, and can give is to stay true to yourself. If you try to sound like someone else to make others happy, it is not going to work. You need to develop your own sounds and style, and do that the best you can. I have been playing piano since a young child. I started playing guitar in my early 20's, as it gave me another way to express myself. - Instruments: The Cardinals, my Australian band - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, piano & ukulele I am the lead singer and a solo artist so in terms of decisions for my business I oversee and create pretty much everything to do with it. \"Gibson Emmylou Harris Acoustic/Electric Taylor 4 series Acoustic/Electric Gibson Les Paul Junior Special Roland FP4 Orange Amp Kala Ukulele Maton Baby series Acoustic Guitar\" Yes definitely it's different. I have had to work at being a pretty tough girl to get heard and things actually be done, particularly at gigs when you're starting out in shitty dive bars and everyone treats you like an idiot. Confidence, strength, education in the business and the ability to not get to emotional about things is something I have definitely had to build up as a girl to be able to get anywhere in this industry. I'm not a boy so I don't know what it's like for them, but I think they may have less of a hard time letting things get to them on a personal and emotional level. It's way more all about sex and image of a female artist these days. Creating more avenues for a female artist to expand their brand/product outside of music which is great but also sad that it's not just solely about the music anymore. People buying into a female musician now look into the whole package to decide wether or not they like the music. I personally think it should all be down to what your ears hear and then what your soul or hearts feels or takes from that, and who cares if that amazing music is not coming from a supermodel pretty artist wearing guccis! Don't rush. Things take time and you need to make sure you are ready mentally and physically for a job in music. Get great people that you would trust you life with around you and weed out any bad or negative energy people immediately! I can write my songs easily on these instruments and I like to play rythym guitar live to still be in the picture instrumentally as well as singing of course. - Instruments: Amy Cervini Quartet, Monday Off, Couples Therapy, Jazz Country - Years playing: Vocals I am a leader or co-leader in all the bands mentioned above. I co-produced my records and am making all business and marketing decisions on my own. Shure SM 58 Beta, AER \"The difference to me lies mostly in being a vocalist, not a woman. Being a vocalist forces you to be a bandleader in most situations. That makes the reality of making a living as a musician much different than if the opportunity for side man work were more available. I grew up being one of a few women in every band I played in. But...there were always other women dreaming of being musicians. There weren't very many women instrumentalists that i looked up to as a kid but it did help to see so many other girls with me dreaming of becoming professional musicians. Even more inspiring that so many of us did! \" I see differences in different generations of musicians in general. In the same way that there are bitter women in the jazz industry there are bitter men. They may have different reasons for being bitter but...bitter is bitter. There are just some people out there who are more inspiring than others. I haven't seen that being directly related to one's sex. That being said...I have heard from countless women musicians that they've had a much harder time in the industry. That they are discounted and the fact that they are a woman has hindered them. I think that the jazz industry is making strides in accepting women as equal players on the scene but am still seeing that most women make it as leaders or not at all. There are exceptions of course but that seems to be the trend. I love going to see Darcy James Argue's Secret Society because it feel like highschool -- there are so many women in that band. And it's not a big deal. That's the best part. \"I've gotten a lot of advice, some great, some awful. I would say that any musician should follow their dream. If you love to play standards - play standards. If you love to play free - play free. People can hear the love you have (or lack thereof) even if they can't describe what it is they're hearing. If you are honest and genuine about your music the audience will feel that and become interested in what you have to say. Surround yourself with other musicians who make you feel good. If they can play rings around the next guy but have a horrible attitude on the stand and off, they won't make you feel or sound good. Music is your business. Don't forget that. Also, don't forget that you have a responsibility to your audience. Believe in what you do and they will come with you on whatever journey you take them on.\" I played classical piano very intensely until I was 18. I also played saxophone both jazz and classical. When I started playing saxophone I was asked to sing with the big band. It became a very strong personal passion. I went to New England Conservatory for my Undergrad as a saxophonist and ended up a vocalist. It chose me. - Instruments: one - Years playing: vocals Little Sister in all three places. I give advice when I think its necessary. \"Live Mic - Shure, KS79 Recording Mic - Milab, can't remember the number Mic Stand - Hercules, grip lock Inner Ears - Ultimate Ears, UA10s Side Table Flowers\" Most definitely. The music business is a man's world. When I tour, I am always out numbered by men. Their talk, their play, their needs, what is important to them is totally different from me and I am constantly trying to find a balance between my needs and theirs. I believe, at least with the men I work with, that they are not trying to make it difficult or that they are even trying to get it their way, it is just that they don't understand the importance of my needs because they are not theirs. I also believe that when a woman asserts herself or is in control she is labeled one of many labels, which can makes it harder. No one wants to be labeled. As far as a moment that made that difference clear, well, there are too many moments a day that make it very clear. I believe the problems are the same for every generation of women, past, present and future, because I believe it is based on the fact that are needs are totally different and that won't change. However, I do believe that we have it easier than the women in the past because we have more rights, we have stronger voices and we are not as intimidated by the labels. I hope that the women in the future will face less labels and that an understanding of our differences will be more accepted and therefore a the balance will be found more easily. I also hope there will be more woman in the business not just as musicians but as crew, managers etc.. I got a lot of good advice by many people. I suppose my advice would be to find your voice. Don't expect anyone to know what it is you need or to understand why you need it, but to let them know by telling them. Touring is a very difficult way to make a living, its hard on your body, your mind, your partners, mostly your children. It demands a lot to find the balance in all things, but it is very worth it. Its easy. - Instruments: 1. BettySoo - Years playing: vocal, acoustic and electric guitars, accordion, a little piano, various other... I lead the band.

Fender Woody Pro Jr amp\" Yes. Family choices end up affecting the sexes differently. Public perception, expectations, etc. - it's all different. People don't expect (and many times, want) the same level of musicianship, creative prowess, instrumental mastery, and ambition from women and men. The moments come all the time. It's a steady stream, and it's a common joke: \"pretty good...for a girl.\" Not really. I think women have to break molds, stereotypes, and fight for their equal footing in every generation - and in more fields than just music and music business. Roseanne Cash just tweeted at me today (she doesn't know me): \"Work hard, keep your head down, and never give up.\" Jimmy LaFave has mused that most musicians who successfully run their own business might make better publicists, radio promoters, booking agents, etc. than most those who enter those fields without being working musicians first. Terri Hendrix has demonstrated to me that you have to work on the art and craft of writing, entertaining, and serving while also doing \"the part that ain't art.\" There are so many who've given me great advice. If I were to give advice, I'd tell her there's always room on the shelf for more good music; people don't stop liking artists they love just because they like someone new. So don't look at music as a competition. Celebrate the greatness you see in everyone around you. Build others up. Champion your friends. Put others first. And yes, everyone else feels like a fraud too. I've always sung - with my family and in church. Guitar was added to accompany the voice.

It takes a strong will and clear communication to be a woman in the music industry. Women still have to fight their way to the top of this business and are constantly put into a lesser role by males. They always want to \"help\" the woman and it's even more exaggerated with regards to female singers. Yes, the newer generations are beginning to be able to take advantage of all the efforts that their predecessors made to create a more level playing field. They are also, on average, better musicians so they garner their own respect onstage and in the studio with fellow male musicians. \"Not really in the beginning. But, my peer colleagues and I began to see patterns. The same kind's of experiences were happening to all of us. So, we banned together to educate the younger generations to facilitate change. My advice to anyone, be they male or female is to do what you want and don't let anyone tell you different. You are the artist and even if only 20 people get what you do right now...who knows what will happen in the future. Never compromise yourself, because you have to continue to live with yourself throughout this lifetime. \" I'm a natural singer and rhythm maker -- can't imagine not singing for a living, actually - Instruments: 2 soaring rhino / Tone - Years playing: labtop/vocal \"In Tone i am the music maker, and then Kristian, the other band member is a VJ.

Tone have a great record company and I participate in almost every decision regarding Tone, but our maneger takes care of a lot of the parctical ma that i am greatfull of, because i not that good at this.\" Labtop, sometimes different instruments, Microphone, midi controllers. Yes i think there is a huge difference being a woman in the music industry. The most clealy example is that I once was nominated for a music price, and a guy came up to me a said he thought that it was only because i was a woman and not for my music. I guess that the sex object issue has always been an huge factor for the women musicians. Now it is a bit more, but when we look back it is kind of the same. But there are a lot more female musicians with stronger messagses today, not only singing about Love and break ups. \"Allways take a moment with yourself before saying yes to anything. There are a lot of people giving all kind of promisses but they can not deliver. If you know you are good then relaxe and have fun, but know your goal.\" \"I love the idea that I can controle everything. Having a Labtop give you the possibility to be the conductor of every instrument/sound in the world. You can shape the sound into your own and even invent new sounds. My Labtop as an instrument give me the chance to play with the sound around us, by recording them and the manipulate them in the programs.\" - Instruments: too many to name - Years playing: voice Leader most of the time I have a PA Yes, mostly because very few men don't get gigs they want due to age, ethnicity, or weight. Looks matter so much more if you're a female. Yes, but way to long to get into. I will say some better and some not. No one told me this but I would say, always keep an open mind. Learn many things, don't be elitist. Natural ability - Instruments: The Veynz, The Diamond Star Halos, Emily Jane White - Years playing: Guitar and Piano I am a collaborative band leader. I also manage myself. \"1962 Gibson J-45 1955 Gibson ES200 Fender Tube Amps Roland Digital Piano\" Of course, it's different. You are treated differently. You are always put into question and expected to \"prove\" yourself as a musician. I've been talked down to and invalidated especially during sound checks. Music press is a clear area where sexism is unveiled. A woman's looks are often acknowledged and she's often compared to the pool of recognized female vocalists in her genre. I unfortunately don't know very many older female musicians. The few I have met, I was really interested in their story as a woman in music but I never got to spend enough time to hear the full story. I've found most musicians to be pretty private about their experience. Stay true to yourself and learn to say \"no.\" It's also helpful to be part of a community of supportive female musicians who have cultivated a consciousness around the trials of being a woman in music. My parents encouraged me to play piano throughout my childhood and teenage years. I picked up the guitar when I was 15 because and later on became very inspired to play more rock oriented music. I then discovered song writing and have written both folk and rock songs using the piano and guitar. - Instruments: two. D.E.F & J*DaVeY - Years playing: vocals my partner & i play an equal role in the band's business & marketing, & we are assisted by major management & our label in that area. i am the front person, so not only am i singing all of the song's but i am writing them as well. i also assist with a bit of the production, although i don't play any instruments. of course there's a difference. sometimes a strong & self-aware female artist is intimidating & often cast aside because men in this industry may find it a bit easier to deal with passive women. we're sexually demoralized, so even the strongest female artists have an over-sexualized image thus painting the picture that a woman's power is solely in her vagina. this industry isn't ready to deal with a straightforward, strong minded, & self-aware female who doesn't have to sexually demoralize herself to get her way. this difference is made clear to me everyday, all i have to do is turn on the television or flip through the magazines. earlier generations of women musicians seemed stronger & a bit more inventive than female artists of today. you had strong performers like tina turner who was the queen of outlandish costumes & performances, an early genre bender who really took chances. women like grace jones, annie lennox, grace slick, dale bozzio--strong women who's art relied on a boldness that far surpassed their sex. their strong essence was the sexy thing, not their sexy outfit & dirty lyrics. someone once told me to always stick my guns. i'd say the same. always assert yourself. always show them who you really are. never let em see you sweat. My voice has a unique thing about it, & lyrically i always felt like i had something strong to say. I started off as a rapper & hated my singing voice, but other people would hear me sing & suggest that i do it more often. - Instruments: My first band was the Pillow Queens. I also played with David Israel for a while. Now I am with Woven Bones full time. - Years playing: Drums \"I am fairly new to Woven Bones, we have been together for about a month. We are a three-piece so it has been pretty easy to bond and get to know each other. A lot of the business decisions are handled by Andy (the leader singer and guitar player). In the Pillow Queens, we made all the big decisions together. I tried to take on the role of facilitator. I like being the backbone of the band rhythmically, and I also like to create a supportive atmosphere where people can feel comfortable trying out new things musically and be themselves. I see a similar role for myself with Woven Bones. But for now I am just focusing on getting up to speed with the songs and integrating into the band and the sound as seamlessly as possible. \" \"I have a 4-piece Mapex drumset. I am not really into having super expensive gear because it all gets thrown in the back of the van the same way no matter what. I cobbled together a collection of cymbals and hardware over the years. In Woven Bones I play a snare and floor tom standing up. The only modification I have ever made to my drums is staining them. I took the vinyl wrapper off the drums, sanded the wood, and stained them green. \" \"For all-male bands, I think that bringing a woman into a band can be a big deal. She is expected to bring something extra to the table. If a guy joins an all-male band, on the other hand, there is probably an assumed level of familiarity and comfort. There are more and more women starting and joining bands, but it is still feels outside the \"normal\" realm of rock n roll. I am constantly reminded of this when I tell people that I play drums. The most well-meaning people respond with, \"\"Wow, that's so cool! A girl drummer!\"\" I doubt that many male drummers hear, \"\"Whoa, a dude drummer. Awesome!\"\" I remember going to see bands in high school and college. Seeing women on the stage really made an impression on me. In school band, you don't have to be cool, and usually the uniforms make that impossible anyway. But in rock bands, your confidence (or lack thereof) can take center stage, even if you are nailing your musical parts. The women I saw were up there wailing on their instruments and making it look so easy and fun. Playing drums in school, I was always surrounded by male musicians. That was good preparation for playing rock n roll. Everyone was on board with me playing drums, but there was also this feeling of me (and other females) having to step up to the plate and show them my chops. Everyone else just got to play drums. \" \"That is an excellent question, and one that I don't feel totally qualified to answer. I have not spent a lot of time with women musicians who are from a different generation than me. I think older women musicians had a much harder row to hoe than I did. Rock n roll has always been a boys club. Something that happens fairly frequently is women who are older than me coming up to me after shows. They give me the best compliments and are super supportive. A lot of them say things like, \"\"wow, playing drums would be so fun!\"\" like it is something they never considered doing themselves. In each of my bands there have been a handful of times that people assumed I was the guitar player's girlfriend or whatever. But aside from that and a few comments about how I am a \"good girl drummer\" (as opposed to a \"good drummer\"), I feel very supported. I don't think women always had that feeling. I guess I have my parents to thank for never making a big deal out of me playing the drums. They always told me I did a good job, and it wasn't because I was a girl, but because I was first chair. \" \"This may sound like a no-brainer, but I really listened to people when they told me to \"go for it\" when opportunities have arisen. When the Pillow Queens first went on tour, we didn't know what we were doing but we just got out there and started contacting people and made it happen. When Woven Bones approached me to play with them, I was incredibly excited for them to ask me but I was nervous about what that would be like. Then a trusted female friend encouraged me to jump on this opportunity. It was different with my other bands because I was already friends with them when we started playing music together. As it turns out, joining Woven Bones has been a seamless process because I really like my bandmates and we all have a strong work ethic. I would tell a new woman musician that there is nothing to be scared of, and that if you realize that all these other bands are playing shows and making records all the time, you can certainly go make a name for yourself. Also, don't date your bandmates. The best advice I would give any new musician is to go out and get involved in your local music scene. Check out your local independent newspaper/music blog/record store and meet people who are doing what you'd like to do. They can be your best source of information and inspiration. I don't think that there are any post-feminist musical subcultures. Every woman musician will be forced to think about her identity in a musical context at some point. This sounds cheesy, but practice practice practice until you know your stuff is really good, and then get out there and play it for the world.\" \"When I was in 5th grade, the middle school band director came over and had the aspiring band students try out several different kinds of mouthpieces and instruments. When I told him that I played piano already, he had me pick up the drumsticks and tap out some rhythms. That was the start of me playing drums. I have stayed with it because it is really fun and I see playing drums as making a big contribution to whatever group I'm playing with. \" - Instruments: Sonny & Perley, Sonny & Perley's Jive Five, vocals vocals, co-arranger, co-director, percussion, Front person -i.e.: MC, narrator, spokesperson, research historian on composers, songs, etc., Set up and tear down of sound and light equipment.

Most obvious to me is the number of women musicians today compared with those before the 1970s or even 1980s. It seems there are more schooled vocalists with music degrees who also play an instrument than in earlier generations.\" \"Yes. Many years ago someone suggested setting up a website. To be my authentic self.\" \"I chose voice because I enjoyed singing and people encouraged me to pursue it professionally. I chose percussion because it seemed to come naturally and I love the way rhythm instruments, especially shakers, rain sticks, bells, wood blocks, etc enhance and color music.\" - Instruments: solo artist - Years playing: guitar, vocals, mandolin bass I am a solo artist, so it's up to me to delegate, relegate or take responsibility. I produced/ engineered and played all of the instruments on my last studio recording. Prior to that , I joined efforts with several co producers. The last 13 years I have recorded albums in my own studio. Business and marketing--I have a manager who communicates with the booking agents and record companies. We develop the marketing plans and strategies together. She then coordinates the efforts. I have 2 acoustic guitars built by Jim Olson, a 1946 Martin D-18, an 80's Fender Stratocaster, a Telsco 1970's electric Baritone guitar, various mandolins, keyboards, a P bass, a Harmony semi hollow electric. Main instrument is the Olson. I play through a Pendulum pre amp setup, (parametric EQ and pre amp). I use a 1960's or 70's Fender Princeton for the Strat. It's all a reflection of social norms. There is a glass ceiling for women musicians, but it is not set as low as it used to be. Women today are instrumentalists, engineers, arrangers, performers, singers, producers. When I first began, the expectation was that you were the girl singer, incapable of really playing an instrument well, there as window dressing for the serious business of music. see above I would tell them to write and record as much as possible, to get their own small studio setup and learn about tone and sound and some of the technology. Then I would tell them to go deeper. Then I would tell them to enjoy the moment. Its intimacy the visual quality of the fretboard, the ability to translate popular music to it. - Instruments: 3: Fanny, Cris Williamson, and the Slammin' Babes. - Years playing: guitar mostly \"As soon as my sister and I started a band in high school (Sacramento, 1964) I took on a leadership position, oftentimes learning songs off the radio or 45's and teaching them to my bandmates, of which my sister was always one. Many times she and I learned the songs together, by ear. When we got a record deal in Hollywood in '69 (Fanny, generally known as the first all-girl band to be signed, record, and achieve international success) I began writing in earnest, and have continued to do so since that time. I started playing in the genre of women's music in 1965, and got the opportunity to produce others' records beginning in 1977. By 1981 I had my own record label, and in 1986 co-founded the Institute for the Musical Arts, a non-profit 501[c]3 for all women in music, of which I am still the Artistic Director. (www.ima.org) So in the studio, as an artist I usually have a big role in the creative decision-making process, as many of the songs are mine; if hired as a guitarist, I contribute whatever is required, deferring to the artist and producer. As a producer, the role is greatly expanded. A producer is basically hired to organize, have the overview, and make decisions. As a label owner and Artistic Director of IMA, I've been called upon to make many business and marketing decisions over the past 28 years.\" \"many guitars: '57 Les Paul, old Stratcocaster, (electric); Taylor T-5 and C112 ce. Many others, but these I would say are my favorites. As for amps, I still stick mostly with Fenders, of which I have many - both vintage and new t(hey support IMA, incidentally). Finally, pedals - I might use an overdrive or a reverb effects pedal, but have gotten over being too fancy with all that. The thing I mostly look for is the overdrive \"\"lead\"\" sound, which many amps supply now anyway, with on/off footswitch.\" \"Uh, yes. First, in perception. Women are not expected to play as well, and in the '60s not play electric AT ALL, and had to carve out their own opportunities to do so. That involved hearing many slurs, being discounted, and picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and starting over again as a matter of course. Second, men have testosterone. Although women can certainly play as well and do, the sexual posturing associated with electric guitars in particular and rock and roll generally is something that many men do naturally and most willingly. Women have a different way of expressing sex appeal which is more nuanced (unless they are simply copying men, or in some cases may have more of a testosterone output themselves). I have seen this over and over again in my over 40 years of playing lead guitar and continue to experience it at IMA. This now-assumed posturing can lead to a bit of confusion. MANY moments made that clear to me, beginning in the mid-'60s. But as I did not posture (having moved through the male world in LA where I learned from the best, I realized that not only didn't I feel it, but simply didn't have to - the best players, by the way, were the most generous; and the mechanics of playing was always uppermost in our minds) I suppose a few moments when I realized we were playing to and reaching massive audiences would have made that acceptance clear. Some of those would be playing both the Fillmores East and West; on t.v. appearing on the first Sonny and Cher Show, Dick Cavett, the Tonight Show, and several Midnight Specials; going on national tours with Chicago / Jethro Tull and sharing stages with Chuck Berry, the Staple Singers, Dr John, Carly Simon, John Sebastian, et al... and finally, as a band, Fanny's backing Joan Streisand live on several cuts on her \"\"Barbra\"\" album.\" \"Yes. Although many girls are still shy to express themselves in general - only needing the invitation to do so - they at least know that the notion of playing in a band is generally accepted. Boys might sneer and compete with them, oftentimes, for example, drowning out a girl singer with their instruments, but society as a whole does not. Where girls really have a difficult time entering into careers in music concerns body image. That has not changed a bit, and is a continual problem. On the plus side, girls have no problem experimenting with different sounds and cutting-edge technology, for example playing electric/amplified cello or working with loops generated and performed with onstage.\" \"Valuable advice given to me: don't listen to what anyone else says about your music, especially in the studio. Don't turn while recording and ask people not directly involved, \"\"what do you think?\"\" You may as well stand on a street corner asking that, and do it forever. Follow your own instincts, make your own decisions. To that I would add, never stop. Don't give up, never give up while you are following and connecting with your passion. And find a few girlfriends to hang and confide with!\" the moment I heard someone play a guitar, in the Philippines at the convent we attended just before we moved to California, I instanly knew this was for me.

We even published our own songbooks, (which are in their 5th printing and enjoy international distribution.) \"I have a Mac Pro, with Logic I use East West soft synths, plus \"\"Ivory\"\" synth piano I have a Digi 002, plus a variety of plug ins that I use for recording. I record vocals at home often, but will also go out to a studio to complete projects.\" \"Well, it's hard to say. No one likes to ever come out and say that there's discrimination -- it makes you a complainer. However, I certainly know of the blind auditions that were put in place years ago for the symphonies because of preexisting notions about players and gender. I guess I would say that the feeling I get is that as a woman, I have to prove that I'm a good musician right off the bat, whereas for men, it is often assumed that there is already a level of achievement. Rather, that men have the \"\"benefit of the doubt.\"\" As far as musical theatre is concerned, I can think of only 4 or 5 women composers who have gotten up on Broadway. These are staggering numbers when one thinks about how many musicals have been produced. (There are more female lyricists, but it is just about as difficult for them as well.) \" I see more women composers out there. We are still a small group. Many go into pop music, which seems to welcome women more. There weren't many female composer role models growing up. If you ask me my musical influences, they are all men. \"Advice is tough. Most people advised me to get out of the business. :) I would say, \"\"Do what you love... and do it because you can't imagine doing anything else. You must be twice as good as any of your male counterparts. Don't explain. Don't complain. Do it backwards and in heels. And as one of Marcy's and my songs says, 'Sing Your Own Song.'\"\" I do believe that eventually there will be more equity, and that perhaps we won't have to give separate advice to young female musicians. But in the meanwhile, I think we do; so my best advice of all is, \"\"Don't let anyone tell you you can't be everything you want to be.\"\" Thank you so much for the opportunity to answer these important questions. Zina Goldrich\" I started music at 3, and piano at 5. My Dad was a trumpet player (as well as a doctor) and he and my mother felt that piano was self contained. I took to the piano immediately, so I didn't mind the choice. Coincidentally, I took drums in elementary school and junior high, but never felt the same affinity for it. - Instruments: so many, VIVIAN GIRLS< CRYSTAL STILTS and now DUM DUM GIRLS and of course my own band - Years playing: Guitar, Drums and I sing Well, In Dum Dum girls , I am a helper outer, DEE DEE is my pal , and I literally play the drums. She is go to gal. In my own band I do pretty much everything, from recording to decision making. I have a sometimes wonky 64 fender mustand guitar. I love it even though it notoriously wont stay in tune. I have a fender deluxe reverb reissue amp, I wish it was the real deal. Alas , maybe when i win the lotto. Yes i do. Here is an example, recently the New York Times did an article about me entitled \"a woman of many talents\" it was a very pointed article , a sort of half review of a show i did where Frankie Rose and Outs(me) and Dum dum girls(also me) played together.the review for some reason compared the two bands , basically arriving at the conclusion , that both bands play the same kind of music. This is not true. So often female bands or female fronted bands are compared to each other for no other reason than their gender. Its such an annoying double standard. One wouldn't compare The rolling stones to Duran Duran , just because they are all male. Is it because there are just so few of us playing music? I also find the term \" girl bad \" offensive. Considering I am a 31 year old woman. hmmm... I feel like its alot easier for young ladies to get into playing music. Now there are programs like \"rock camp for girls\" We did not have that when i was a kid. I think my mother still cant grasp that I play in a rock band for a living! I have no idea about \"the industry\" I do think that if you wanna start a band or make an album you should just do without judging yourself too harshly. None ever taught me to ply anything. In fact , I still don't know how to play. i mostly just pretend. it has seemed to work thus far. Well for a long time I didn't, I sort of landed on the drums , because there are very few drummers. I feel like being the drummer is a little like being the goalie if you play soccer. i'm much happier since ive been getting to play the guitar more. - Instruments: I have been writing music since college and have headlined a regular rock band and now a rock band for kids. - Years playing: I sing vocals and play guitar, piano, uke. I am learing mandolin and banjo! I run the show! I find my musicians, set up and pay for rehearsals and studio time all out of pocket. As of January of 2010, I started working with an amazing publicist and booking agent so this takes some of the weight off of me for sure. I still find myself at the post office all the time but a lot less than before. For 10 years I did this all on my own and I am getting used to trusting my team because they are truly amazing and do a wonderful job. I also run my own website, facebook, myspace and fan pages and do all the updates on my own. This is all incredibly time consuming but I haven't gotten to the point where I trust someone to do all that. I own have 4 mediocre guitars I use in schools but when performing at a live concert, I use my amazing acoustic Taylor Guitar (814 Grand Auditorium) which I have had for 10 years. It just got a nasty crack on the top of the wood but I am in denial about that. My first Taylor guitar was smashed on an airplane. That is quite the story and I haven't flown Airtran since. I usually work with the backline at the venue but for smaller gigs I use a Mackie 150 PA, a guitar bug and Shure wireless mic so I am wire free. A very good example of this is an experience I had this past weekend. I just attended a music convention and the showcase and public festival was very male heavy and while the artists were incredible and I don't want to take away from their amazing performances, there was about 1 girl to every 8 or nine boys performing on the stage and I would say there was a pretty even split of artists to choose from. I think it has something to do with the appeal of male rockers on stage. Men and women can rock out to a male led band but guys don't necessarily want to see women leading a group. I've been to my fair share of Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco concerts and the men are lacking in the audience. It has nothing to do with their talent as they are total pros and some of the best songwriters in the field, but I think it has everything to do with the way men perceive liking that type of music. I have heard plenty of people say they don't listen to \"chick music\" and I think that's a very unfair generalization. I definitely see differences between generations of women musicians. For one, dancing in a bra and panties would have never happened back in the day. I think about what my grandmother must be thinking when she sees a Lady Gaga performance on TV. I know that my generation is pretty desensitized to these sort of images nowadays but it's still shocking to see women dress like that. Sometimes I wonder if she wore jean and a tee shirt and sang with out all the smoke and whistles if any one would like her or her songs at all. I think the female artists from years past had to be really strong because it was more about the words, performance and the artists' presence. I don't mean to generalize either but it seems like today you can just throw on some weird outfit and hump the stage and get a record deal. Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong generation! A very smart manager I know once told me a few years ago that as an artists you have to do one good thing for your music every day, one great thing every week, and one AMAZING thing every month. The same goes for networking. Make one good contact every day and so on. As a woman, we have so much going on and it may be hard to stay focused but the reality is most of us are in charge of our own careers and destinies so if we want to succeed, we need to be proactive. I joined an amazing women's networking group called Urban Girl Squad. It's mostly women in their 20's 30's and 40's who attend events, not having anything to do with the music industry. I love going to meet people but also networking, taking yourself out of your routine and meeting new people is the best thing you could possibly do for your business and in return, you share music and that is life's biggest gift. I started Suzuki piano lessons at 2 years old andhad a very good ear. When they tried to switch me over to read music at 5 or 6 years old, I used to trick my piano teachers into thinking I could read the notes by asking them to play the piece first. I would play it perfectly just by listening. A very stubborn kid I was! I never learned to read music but in high school in order to become a Songleader in the NFTY organization (my high school youth group) I had to play guitar. I was determined to teach myself how to play so I took a few lessons and with the basics, I practiced on my own until I eventually won the position of songleader. I'm so glad I had the drive back then because I would never be what I am today if it weren't for that day I said \"I want to do that!\". - Instruments: Savoy Family Cajun Band, Magnolia Sisters, Ann Savoy and her Sleepless Knights, Savoy Doucet Cajun Band - Years playing: Cajun accordion, fiddle, guitar, banjo-mando,vocal Leader of some, equal partner in others Custom pearl inlaid Martin parlor guitar, 1953 Gretcsh acoustic/electric(black with sunburst finish), chrome body resonator guitar, Acadian Cajun accordion, rough fiddle for Cajun style, vintage banjo mando, boss tuner and eq I find often men start off not respecting the opinions and talents of women musicians..a woman has to hold firm and establish herself-she is not automatically brought into the fold...this is particularly clear in authentic roots scenes, where women are not well accepted...you have to prove you can \"keep up with the men\" In the past in Louisiana women were considered the lowest form of life if they played in dancehalls...today they are pretty well accepted Believe in your viewpoint and stick to your vision..your own instincts about the sound you are trying to create are your best path..and practice, practice...and listen to old recordings and new, see what is happened and compare it to the past... because I love rhythm and the instruments I play are mostly about groove - Instruments: My own Contamporary Ensemble at UW Madison 5 years. Orchestras during students years 7 - Years playing: Composer I am a composer, Professor, and Director of my School of music's Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. Piano, flute, Apple computer To be honest, I think men still dominate much of music administration in a way that can hamper the work of women composers and conductors. Not really, although many younger women don't know yet the obstacles which they will face in the business. My teachers were excellent at teaching me about the musical and technical aspects of composition but not so much the business end of things.

Often women aren't taken seriously at first when you say you are a songwriter or musician--somehow your work is expected to be under par. More often than not I encounter the classic venue owner/booker flirtation-hit on me scenario. It can be somewhat annoying. Believe it or not, I actually had a booker invite me to \"take a ride\" in his fancy car. (Puke--I wish I could have slapped him then and there, but then I wouldn't have been able to finish my second set). Let's face it. The majority of musicians are men. Thank God for good gal monsters like Bonnie Raitt, Odessa, Nina Simone, and many that really proved to the music industry (the most of which is men) that women are legit. \"No--we're all the same underneath. Maybe more than 50 years ago there was more social reservations. But since the 60's women have been liberated musically. You can't say younger girls musicians now are more radical or liberal cause look at girls like Patti Smith and Madonna (they came before us). If anything, like any musician regardless of sex, some younger musicians forget to focus on the music and focus more on the media/star/image factor.\" \"Focus on the song. Focus on the craft. Know your strengths and weaknesses. Let your strengths shine and surround yourself with fellow musicians on-stage that make your weaknesses strong. Be you. Don't worry about the press/attention/how to play that show/how to get on that tour/--just focus on the craft.\" \"I primarily play guitar. I chose it because the first live musician I heard in my hometown of Huntsville, Tx was playing a guitar. I also wanted to write songs and it seemed portable. You can't travel easily with a piano and keyboards never sound the same.\" - Instruments: Many choirs and choral groups through the years. In the last few years, one group. Free Range Chix - Years playing: Soprano voice; piano, organ, banjo \"Singer, composer, arranger. In the studio: singer. In the business: everything.\" Piano, organ, banjo, mics, amp, cd's. \"Absolutely. There has been and still is a clear difference in classical and popular performance opportunities. In classical, the majority of concerts still feature mostly men's compositions. More women are allowed to play in orchestras (except in Austria) these days but auditions take place behind a screen to hide the gender. Most conductors are still male, and women, as in every field, earn less. In popular field: most of the groups hired are male groups. If you look at line-up for county fairs, weekly summer evening series, folk concerts,seasonal celebrations...the majority hired are male groups. I think every aspect of the business of music is still controlled by men. Strides have been made, especially by independent musicians. \" \"There are more women bravely pursuing musical careers,as composers, conductors and recording artists, in part because of support organizations like the International Alliance For Women in Music, and, in spite of (unequal) domestic expectations. We only have to be brave because of discrimination and discouragement. I believe the most successful financially are the ones controlling their careers. \" \"The advice I got was not to go there because of my gender. My advice to women of any age and field: make your own opportunities. Thank you!!\" \"Natural singing voice, no choice. Mother chose piano, which I now appreciate. It led to organ. I chose banjo because it is a nice bright,fun instrument, and felt it would be easier than guitarfor my small hands. \" - Instruments: Just mine - Years playing: piano I am the act and different musicians play with me according to who's available or who is right for a certain project. I produce my own records. I have a manager, Bob Burton, who has been with me my whole career who helps me make all business and marketing decisions. I take a piano with me unless the venue has one (especially and acoustic), upright bass, trumpet, guitar, and usually violin or cello or both. I don't think there is any negative difference, in my experience, at least. I think that male musicians are always noticeably pleased that I am so clear on what I want from them in the studio (or on stage).... that they are surprised in a good way and treat me with even more respect. If I understand the question, I would say that older female musicians like Bonnie Raitt and those that came before her, who may have had to work very hard to achieve prominence in a more male dominated musical era, have helped me to understand the important place I hold as a member of a very fortunate group of women who have been able to carve out a living making music. Myself, more as a songwriter than a recording artist. But that all the possibilities have been available to me, I am very aware of and grateful for. I think that younger artists may take that for granted a little more, but that is just evident of how far we've really come! \"Too many people to name. My advice to women just starting out in the music biz, might be to NOT forget your love for music with or without success...if you become weary and disenchanted, then take a step back and try and remember again why you chose this path and start again. Just do good work. Love the process. Don't be lazy and don't underestimate yourself to justify a means to an end. Excel and you won't go unnoticed.\" It chose me. - Instruments: Always my own groups. - Years playing: Vocals All of the above. Neumann and Shure Beta condenser microphones, Mackie mixing board, QSC amp, graphic equalizer, Lexicon reverb, custom cabinets, power conditioner, direct boxes...much more...full sound system for smaller performances where no sound reinforcement is provided. Well, of course! There is a \"difference\" hiding behind every venue, booker, owner, producer and sideman. This would take years to explain. Let's just say we women have to use all of our instincts, all of the time. Only in that today's younger women can get away with substituting looks for talent, which may not have been the case in past generations. Once upon a time, you had to have looks AND talent. The best advice anyone ever gave me is that there is no substitution for the elapsing of time as you work to be better at your craft. Learn tunes. Understand that a rest is a musical note. Become a master of phrasing, intonation and inflection. Be a team player, but also an innovator. Don't let anyone bully you or put you down for having ideas. And don't let anyone discourage you. Becoming an accomplished musician is painful, not comfortable. Stick with it. I am a fourth generation singer and musician. We are equal partners. We run our business from top to bottom. It really is a full time job. We worked with Brian Hardgroove from Public Enemy on our last record. He produced the project. It was hard to let go of the control but an awesome learning experience as well. We are a hip hop soul act so we sometimes travel with a Dj but normally we just roll in with our imtrumental CD and rock it. Pretty simple set up. I was in a rock band for many years and it was a pain haha. Well it's especially hard in hip hop but I think if you approach your music with honesty and integrity people really respond to that. God-des is also openly gay so its a double whammy. It's hard for us because we are females who are not selling sex. We are selling inspiration and our sound is something that hasn't been done before. But we believe. So what can you do cept push forward right? Yes. Women used to be able to just be amazing musicians and not have to sell there bodies...since Brittney Spears and Beyonce all that has changed. You need the \"whole package\" to achieve mainstream sucess these days and its sad cause the music isn't about making people feel inspired it's about making people feel aroused. \"I would say we learned it all by trial and error haha. I would say ladies know your business. Be involved with it all. You are the ONLY one who really cares about it. I apologize for any spelling errors haha ..I can't spell for shit. our website is www.god-desandshe.com tell everyone about us haha!\" I could always sing ever since ever. I play guitar and write music on that as well and God-des(the MC) was a drummer for many years but she wanted a voice to express her frustration and have a voice for all marginalized people. - Instruments: Mother Banjo Band - Years playing: Vocals, Banjo My gear is simple--I simply mic my banjo and my voice. Because I've always loved the banjo--the percussive nature of it. Also, everyone I knew played the guitar, so when I was looking for a string instrument to accompany my songs, I knew I needed to do something different. - Instruments: 5, THe BAcksliders, Vibrolux, Eleven Hundred Springs, Lithium Xmas, Princess Tex - Years playing: vocals singer, songwriter, i work on everything with everyone tamborine, morroccas HA! i once asked a club bouncer in san antonio to remove a guy from the audience that hit me in the eye after i got off stage. my eye was clearly swelling up but the bouncer just muttered that he liked my skirt so i had to beat the crap out of the guy myself...i admit the skirt part... nope, not much really HELLLLLLLL no and my advice is DO SOMETHING ELSE! you'd have to be a MAS - O - CHIST to wanna be a lifer like ME!

Carolyn Wonderland Band is a trio and on the road we share the responsibilities of driving, merch, advancing shows and keeping up with the hand puppets. In the studio, we take it song by song. I have a hand in most of the business. I think you must in order to understand what goes into making a show happen not just on the music end, but on everyone's end. \"There's a video of some of my gear here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vMahR5O5fc My live set up is: Custom made ValveTech amplifier 2x10 switchable ohms (4 / 8 / 16) and switchable rectifier (AX7 / AY7)...did I mention it is Sparkle red tolex?

Guitars: Telecaster with the Joe Barden pickups (Tellie), Patty the Blueshawk, Leslie Pauline the Les Paul Goddess; Mandy the electric mandolin (hand made with Piezo pickups) and Lappy the Lap Steel (an early 40's Kalamazoo found in an East Texas pawn shop). I play a little trumpet, usually just off my vocal mic.\" I don't know what other people feel about this, but I have never had an instrument judge my ability to play and clam up because I happen to be a woman. Instruments are great like that. You touch them in the right way and they sing back to you. People may judge your abilities through glasses tinted by sex, color, weight, height, lifestyle... But I am pretty sure that would be the case if I felt a calling to work on cars, too. nothing that a little ripening won't change. \"I have been given both wonderful and horrible advice by people meaning well in this industry. The worst advice I am happy I did not take was to stop playing guitar, have plastic surgery and receive a large check. While I have never been offered that amount of money since, I am happy to report that I can sleep at night and play the music that moves me on whatever instrument I choose. The advice I would give is simple: Remember that the music IS the journey and the reward. Be realistic, live cheap, share. This business is brutal in order to weed out those who are not in it for life.\" Perhaps they choose us?

The moments generally were being made more self aware of the way I looked, or didn't look. \" I think today's female performer may tend to be more savvy in the outside world and certainly remain more in control of the work that they present. I sometimes wonder if there would be more and perhaps even better singing if there were other opportunities outside of the those that one creates. The advice that has stuck with me was to always keep at it. My advice would simply be to practice and to communicate ones needs in all aspects of music making. Making music is a personal journey. Sometimes I think of myself as a farmer. For music to remain authentic throughout a lifetime, one must be present at all times, keeping it protected from the elements with the intention of a rich harvest season.

I see a lot of men whose wives run the behind the scenes affairs for them (booking, distribution, raising the kids) while the men go out on the road. But, I'm fortunate, in that I have a stay at home husband who does all that WITH me, so I can go out and tour and know the kids are happy with one parent in the house, and that my partner supports my dream, helps me to handle the work load.\" Girls/women today are TONS more confident because of all the women who broke ground before them and showed them: YOU CAN DO THIS. Also, because of Girl Rock Camps, girls understanding they CAN DO ANYTHING, and not being brought up with the thought that only men played instruments and only women sang. Women today are engineering, producing, mixing, mastering, performing, multi-tasking, understanding the music industry---lawyers, publishers, etc. When I was growing up, I had to figure things out by myself. I was the only girl in my school who played guitar and wrote songs, until I got to high school----then there was FOUR of us....then, in college, I was the only one I knew who did what I was doing....When I moved to Dallas, I only had about three \"competitors\" from women musicians...there were far and few between us. Now, women are EVERYWHERE, sharing their own brand of femininity and ferocioucity! Go, ladies! \"Listen to advice. Take what works for yourself and grow on that. Network like crazy. Send thank you notes. Join The Recording Academy, local songwriter groups, go to conventions, ask questions, take notes, practice, listen to a variety of different styles of music, write everyday, try the things you are scared to do (whether as a songwriter, vocalist, producer, etc). Have mentors. Best advice I got was from Peter Himmelman, \"\"Keep doing what you're doing. You do it best!\"\" To a woman just starting out, keep discovering who you are and be yourself. Re-read what I wrote in first paragraph.\" It's my best friend (the guitar) - Instruments: My own project for 15 years. I also do a Carol Channing impersonation and get hired to play 'her' with random Variety shows a few times a year. - Years playing: vocals I am involved in all of it. I can't imagine missing a day in the studio and missing out on the magic. I am the band leader of my live band too and work very closely with each of the musicians. It's my favorite part - rehearsing. Recording and rehearsing is where all the chemistry is born. I treat the studio and rehearsal like a laboratory; the place where we can make messes and happy accidents. On the business side, I have spent many years as a DIY artist, so I have a major hand in everything on that end. Having a great manager has helped me a lot obviously because it's very hard to take 'everything' on and still balance it with out with being creative. I sing. My favorites microphone to record with is theTelefunken U47. Live shows: throat spray and water! \"Such a good question! I feel my answer changes as I get older. I use my femininity more wisely now. It is very easy to get pigeon-holed in one category or another these days as we are in an era where so many singers wear bikinis while performing! I don't know what that is all about. Is that so-called \"\"freedom\"\" or the act of being a \"\"slave\"\" to the music business to sell records? Do bikinis make people sing better? I think not. I do believe being a man or woman both has it's pressures. Especially as a solo artist. My mother raised me as women being equal to men because she raised my brother and I single-handedly and she did EVERYTHING herself in raising us. I also have worked with musicians (mostly male) from a very young age and felt I was almost always 'one of the guys'. That can also get you into trouble because as a woman, you are never really simply 'one of the guys'. I have felt that as I have gotten older, I have had to watch what I say and have had to draw some lines. Maybe I have even gotten a bit more conservative. I used to use my femininity/sexuality more and now I just wanna make great music and let it come out THROUGH the music instead of OUTSIDE of the music. I have always wondered it was like to have an all-female band!\" \"Back in the 60's, 70's and 80's, there were not a zillion artists and bands being flushed out every month. There was one Whitney Houston, one Madonna, one Go-Gos and they were everywhere. Nowadays, girl groups, singer songwriters and girl rock bands are a dime a dozen. There is less money at labels for artist development so they sign more acts and spend less money on an individual project. What is amazing to see over the last 40 years is how cyclical music is. There is the era of solo-poetress-singer-songwriters (Joni, Alanis, Feist) always comes back around. The pop girl group (Supremes, Banarama, Destiny's Child) always coming back around. But it never goes out of style but absolutely comes and goes in strong waves. I think women nowadays have to think of themselves as being their own business, not just a musician with a band. The music business has changed so much even in the past 10 years and women (and musicians in general) have to be way on top of their game across the board. I think back in the day, you relied on your manager, agent, label and lawyer to make all of your decisions. I think now, since an artist is more at risk for being lost in the shuffle, the she needs to know more, do more, be involved more. I feel I can answer this question in so many ways! \" \"Always make music because you love to do it. Never do it for any other reason. People can see right through that. Fans, friends and eventually you yourself will stop believing you. I think the power of collaboration is something every new musician starting out should plunge themselves into. You learn so much about working with people and understand who you are as an artist and what you can offer. I also advise doing music ALL the time, whenever you can. Jam sessions, writing with as many people as possible, songwriting circles and gigs. Just BEING a part of that energy will trigger so much creativity and spark. Funny advice I got once (sad, but true): \"\"don't think getting drunk with A&R guys will get you a record deal\"\"\" My mother was an opera singer and my father is a classical conductor/composer. My step-mom was also an opera singer. Surrounded by singers so I was verrry much born into the singing world. - Instruments: Many, among them (most recently) \"Music Go Him\", \"Harper Simon,\" - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, banjo, keyboards, percussion My sister Abigail and I trade off singing leads and we share the writing. We've worked with producers in the studio (Thom Monahan produced our first record, with Mike daley, and working with them, and an earlier producer, Michael Fitzpatrick, I was more inclined to take their direction). Our latest record Abigail and I co-produced, andwe were much more active and involved with the decision -making. I can be very obsessive in the studio and nitpicky, but I love the process of recording. We've always made our own business decisions, as a cooperative venture, we put things to a vote, discuss, its definitely a democracy. Recently we started working with a new manager, and he's helping us with the details as theings getbusier for us and more complicated! 5 year old Martin Guitar - in the repair shop at McCabe's in santa Monica right now because the airlines (jet blue) broke it in transit, but it should come back together nicely. I play my dad's old banjo (he has a newer one)... Soundchecks are always interesting. Especially when its just us girls up there. The sound guys often don't take us seriously, until they know us, and they can be patronizing, like, \"this is a monitor, that's where the sound will come out,\" Its crazy. But then after the show they're like, \"wow, you guys are really good. Can I buy your cd?\" Lots of the stereotypes are true. But for the most part, musicians, male and female, are like a club, and once you're part of it, you stop worrying so much about who's a girl and who's a guy. And sometimes the boys will carry stuff, and sometimes that's just fine with me. I have a lot of respect for the women from previous generations. I think a lot of the things they were dealing with are still true, but those women had to bring it every time. And the men too. The previous generations didn't have the technology available now, so the good singers and players floated to the top much more quickly than today. That's not to say that the new music revolution isn't great. Music is something for everyone to share. That being said, Nina Simone, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynne were great live first. Then, the next generation, Bonnie Raitt, Melissa Ethridge, Blondie, these girls had a lot to prove, and they all did prove it in different ways. Now its up to us to keep pushing the bar higher, and keep breaking through the old boys club. There has always been a place in music for women. Certain genres are easier for women than others. It would be harder for us if we were trying to play hard rock or metal. Our dad told us to own your own masters. And keep putting one foot in front of the other. don't remember. thought it was cool? I played viola and piano as a kid, picked up guitar later when I started writing songs I guess. - Instruments: John Mellencamp, Sean Lennon, Yuka Honda, Petra Hayden, The Wallflowers, United States Three, The Prom, Invisible Jet - Years playing: vocals, piano, xylophone, guitar, harmonium, drums, cello I sing most of the lead vocals and play various instruments. When we are in the studio I tend to deal a lot with arrangements and adding keyboard parts. As far as the business goes, I make a lot of decisions. I always tell my band partner what is going on and if he has any really strong feelings about anything, we do it his way. Other than that, I make most of them. I also deal directly with our team (mgmt, lawyer, booking agent) as well do our book keeping. We use a small customized drum kit (everything fits into itself which is needed since we our in a Toyota Prius), two acoustic guitars (both Gibson's from the 50's and 60's), two Princeton reverb amps from the 70s, a Dulcetina (which is similar to a home made tremelo pedal, and the most important which is a battery powered milk frother. \" Thats hard to say. I think male musicians always have groupie girls hanging around. Female musicians don't. I think a lot of times men are a little intimidated by us even if they find us attractive. I have noticed that promoters and booking agents tend to feel that if there is a female lead singer in the band, one of the other support acts should also be female. I don't get that it all. Lastly, maybe people assume with female musicians that the music will be softer and more sensitive. They think we can't rock, but then a great solo guitarist like Orianthi will show up and be as good if not better than any male musician.\" \"There seem to be many more female musicians now than there were in the past and criteria for stardom seems to have changed. Fifty years ago, female musicians weren't picked in the pop world based on looks and their willingness to be told what to do. Talent in their voice or their instrument was the most important. That importance is no longer relevant in the main stream of the music industry. We now have technology that allows for pitch correction, therefore you don't need to have a great singing voice for sound recordings. These days a lot of the mass public wants a \"\"show\"\" with dancing, costumes, and pyro which means the current female pop artist can sing to a pre recorded track or hire a background singer to sing the parts while she looks pretty and dances. It is a sad thing for sure, but I think at some point, the public will be tired of the fantasy or the \"\"show\"\" and require performances with more substance. The audience will want to leave with inspiration. \" You know, no one has really ever given me valuable advice. Everything I have learned so far has been through experience. The only advice that I could give is to stay involved in every part of your career. Don't ever assume that things are getting done for you on the business side. Stay in the loop and hold weekly meetings with management to make sure of what is getting accomplished. All musicians need to stay in control of their own careers. I always loved to sing. It was very natural to me. I sang all the time as a child so I never stopped. My mother started me on piano lessons at 3 years old. I enjoyed it and it was my first writing instrument. I used to just wrote the letters of the alphabet on notation paper in order to write songs until I was able to read standard notation. I chose to play the cello in 4th grade when orchestra was a option. I first picked the violin but didn't like how it felt, so I went with the cello. I still love the cello today. It is one of my favorite adds to our music. I am way out of practice, so I get others to play. Xylophones are used in our music because when I was a music teacher, we had many different kinds in the classroom. I loved their sound then and love what they add now. - Years playing: vocals, wurlitzer,rhodes, guitar \"I'm the band leader together with Theo Pas'cal, we've been working together for about ten years now, and we share a vision of music, he is the musical director and producer. In the studio I'm a composer as well with him, although he composes most of the songs, its almost like a joint partnership in composition, and I co produce. In business and marketing decisions there is a manager Patricia Pascal that handles all of that, I prefer to be focused only on music.\" Wurlitzer and Rhodes, and acoustic guitar Takamine (steel guitar) and nylon guitar from a portuguese luthier called Antonio Santos, and a Jazz guitar from an English luthier Westfield. I think that it has always been different, for instance for the music that I do which is cape verdean influenced if you count how many cape verdean man artists there are right now in the market and how many cape verdean women artists you will see a Big difference. And its not because there aren't any, its because of what people are choosing to see/hear. My opinion is people are not listening they are paying to have acess to a whole pack, which involves beauty, good music, aesthethics in a general way. So it is not 100% for the Arte or Talent. It makes a clear difference when you open the pages of very important magazines in the UK and throughout the world when you see the big importance given to music vs looks, when you see a review from an artist based on the way she looks rather than the music she makes, and then afterwards very small fotos of men artists, with reviews not so bad, but not as enthusiastic. \"Yes, of course there are big differences, I hear a lot of Billie Holiday, Nina Simone , Cesaria Evora,Ella Fitzgerald, and the times where they lived were completely different times from the ones we live now. I speak about NIna Simone that had to fight for so many causes mainly racial issues, we could hear that in her music and she was a vehicle through her music, fighting for freedom and equality. Billie Holiday didn't have the best of lucks in her life she didn't come from a rich and wealthy family and she didnt take the best of decisions for her life. But in the end thats what made these artists special, because they had real struggles, real complicated struggles in their lifes, and that was transported to their music. And we are just talking about women there are names like Charles Mingus, Horace Silver who lived in dificult times .Nowadays because we did have people who fought for all of that, the conditions of life are different, there are other resources that they didn't have, I think there is the generation of sitting in shadow of the work the other generations done in the past. Women instead of keeping the dignifying image, that has always been connected with women, there is now an issue that everybody speaks about which is Women power, I mean I have nothing against it, If people are Inteligent, Talented, either men or women why shouldn't they be given an opportunity, I'm just not happy with the way women have been using or reaching power, they use their bodies as a very important tool instead of Talent. \" \"I have amazing people that are with me from the beggining, and they were the ones to really show me what it is to be a musician I speak about Theo Pas'cal, who really was to blame for getting me into this. I grew musically and as a person due to his experience of 20 years being a professional musician and a fighter for life and for what is Right. The other person is my manager Patricia Pascal who is the person who reallly understands me an has potencialized my work through the right channels. The reason why I spoke of these two people is because they are probabaly the most important people in a womans career who is just taking of. To be surrounded by THE RIGHT PEOPLE is very Important. The world is full of Managers and Producers that in the end just want to get money and a lot of other things from you. And it is also very important to have a strong personality and a strong belief in what you are, what you are doing and where you want to go.\" \"I grew up singing, and because I grew up in church you get that taste for singing, The guitar I had the example of my dad who played the guitar, but it was only when I met Theo Pas'cal that really went deep into it, composing in it and discovering new sounds. The wurlitzer and rhodes are the ones I really enjoy and I really identify with them, because of the similarity to the piano, and because for example the wurlitzer has such a roots sound depending on the compromise between your fingers and the instrument. It really sounds like an african timbila or kalimba, the african thumb piano., because if you see the inside of a wurlitzer it is built almost like that. And that brings me closer to a more roots taste.\" - Instruments: (I'm a solo artist/songwriter) - Years playing: vocals, piano, guitar \"It's an independent operation. \"\"Independent\"\" in this case, also means I have an enormous amount of support here at home in East Nashville. My husband is also an artist/songwriter and we do some collaboration. I've worked with some great producers, writers, and talented Nashville friends...but in these last 15 years, with all the changes in the record business, at every crossroads it has always made the most sense for me to own my masters and publishing, to build a mailing list and a fan base, and to build my career slow and steady so I can keep it going for the long haul.\" We have a studio in the backyard, very simple set-up...a collection of guitars, a set of bells, Nord keyboard, an upright piano, a half a dozen good mics, and pro-tools. We are self-sustaining. It pays the bills and keeps us out of trouble. It's sort of our own version of a family farm. \"It sometimes feels like a man's world. It seems like there are more men on the touring circuit and on triple-A radio. But I don't think it's a conspiracy. I think women have the potential to cut right to the top if they have the ambition, just the same as men if not more so. And there are other significant pulls for a woman, like taking the time to have and raise children. It doesn't have to be either or, but I know some talented women that have neglected their desires in one sphere or the other. Balance is essential. So is paying attention to your instincts about why you do what you do every day.\" I think of Loretta Lynn, out on the farm with her kids, writing hit country songs and all the struggle it took for her to get to the Opry. I think of Shawn Colvin, a fierce talent with a powerhouse voice and the freedom to make her own career moves. Or EmmyLou Harris, who has continued to reinvent herself as an artist for 40 years. I don't have any profound connections to why these women have been able to make it work in spite of the cultural, financial and other obstacles. But all I know is, I am taking good notes. Find a good support system. A community or a couple friends to ground you and to give you perspective and strength. And find ways to make it sustainable. Dream big. And guard your heart from fake impressions of \"success.\" Things that look like failure on the surface can become your greatest strengths. I begged for a piano as a little girl...always wanted to sing and play. I think I was born that way. Nobody in my family played an instrument. My Dad has a great voice, but never took it to heart. I fell in love with the music my family always had spinning on the record player; Johnny Cash, Olivia Newton John, The Eagles, Elvis... - Instruments: N/A - Years playing: Percussion/Composition \"I compose and create my own scores, computer animation, and electronic music in my humble studio as my infant daughter crawls around my feet. I teach Music Synthesis and composition lessons at Murray State University, write articles for various websites and music journals, and pick up commissions and music projects. Right now I am working on an album with Easy Ear Training.com for possible use for an i-Phones app. Life is complicated and exciting and I wouldn't have it any other way. I manage my own business. And while I don't make much money, my music has been heard throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia and I am respected in my field of experimental electroacoustic music. Did I mention that I love what I do?\" \"Modest project studio for music production, graphic design, and animation. i-Mac Intel, Malletkat, Logic Express, Animation/Film Studio (Final Cut, Poser, Bryce, Photoshop), Yamaha and M-Audio keyboard MIDI controllers, video game controllers\" \"The fact that this survey has to label me as a \"\"Woman Musician\"\" as if the default is male already says something about society. I think the primary difference has been for teaching posts at the university level. I have been mistaken for a student several times and even been denied access to equipment because I don't \"\"look the part\"\" of a university professor. I dealt with a lot of sexism as a percussionist, but I don't see the purpose of dwelling on the past. Thankfully, most of my contacts are electronic and most of my opportunities are gained through my website and reputation. In other words, I don't need to worry about someone looking down on me because I am a proud young Latina who composes experimental classical music. Many times I contact using the gender-neutral \"\"S. Pe\u00f1a Young\"\", which frees up everyone from worrying about gender issues.\" I think Gen Xers and Ys are less likely to abandon balancing the family and making some concessions for having a life outside of music. In other words, having a family is no longer considered a weakness. Persevere. And remember that you can't just be good. You have to be the best. \"I chose the drums because I thought that drumming would be my life. Later in college I got involved with the experimental electronic music studios SYCOM at the University of South Florida and discovered that the insanity in my head could better be expressed by insane sounds. Got my masters in Music Technology at Florida International U. and went back to school for a little while to study video and film. I compose because I have to compose. There is too much music inside of me to keep bottled up.\" - Instruments: I predominantly perform with String Of Pealrs, I also sang with vocal quartet, Mad Romance for 5 years and vocal quintet Group 5 for 4 years - Years playing: vocalist and guitar player I am the co-founder and musical director of the group. In the studio I am either hired for various projects or I am the leader of my own recording. In business and marketing I both promote and network in order to book my group and create performing and recording opportunities. I rely on my partners to take on as discussed and explored other responsibilities that present themselves in this complex business. I always confer with them when major decisions are made. I have an Electrovoice microphone (also some old Shure 58's). I have a 400 watt sound system (Yorkville head, Bose speakers), GK 100 watt amp for small rooms that I also use as a monitor. I have a classical guitar, hollow-body jazz guitar (custom made) and a travel guitar. I believe being a woman musician matters until you've established your skill at which time you've earned the respect of the other musicians (male and female). Often in the past, many women have not held a leader position and seemed to have earned a lack of respect. Maybe they were in a partnership with a instrumentalists and simply took a back seat. The Mary Lou Williams of the jazz world not withstanding, women seem to have to prove themselves and I have found that male musicians have been surprised by my skills that I do not necessarily exhibit right away. I write my own charts so that always gets a nod of approval from my accompanists. I can't really say how it was when all the \"chirps\" were working in the 40's and 50's. I have found that the singers that I have come to know and who have become my peers, are very open, welcoming, and generous with their \"stuff\" meaning that they'll lay a tune on you if you ask for a copy, they'll share some valuable knowledge about something or someone if they think they can help, and they show their support for one another. The singers I've meet from older generations have also been very supportive and generous with their mentoring or they let you sit in. Every now and again you come up against someone who is not open or receptive but I think that's just a personality thing and indigenous to all professions. I believe we're all a team, the team of jazz. \"I have been given advice about recordings, business, networking, \"\"making nice\"\", but I think I learned some of the most valuable things from my father, who was a Juilliard graduate himself. He said, \"\"don't just be prepared, be better than prepared.\"\" In my own way I've taken that to heart to mean, have it all together, no holes allowed. I wish I can say that I've always lived up to that standard but there's not a day that goes by I don't try. I'd say to any musician, but especially to women who are singers, be independent. Don't depend on others to write your charts or decide how you'll sing a song. Educate and arm yourself with listening to the masters, and not just singers. Learn various styles of music and what distinguishes those styles from one another. Know how to talk to a drummer, a bass player, pianist and guitarist since you'll mostly be accompanied by that instrumentation. I don't think this is really \"\"women\"\" specific advice. It's for all musicians which I hope in the end has no real distinction in quality. \" I grew up in a musical family and although I studied bassoon for which I hold a bachelor of music degree, singing was the most accessible and I loved vocal groups. I took up guitar to accompany myself. - Years playing: composer -- acoustic/electronic I'm a one-woman operation. My home studio currently is PC-based, with quad Genelec monitors, outboard effects processing and lots of software of various types. Field recordings use a Marantz digital recorder for external Mics and a Zoom H2 when I need something small. Yes, if for no other reason than \"woman\" is a common modifier to musician whereas \"man\" is not. Even more so for composers. I really got this the time I was asked if the lack of a singular climax in a particular piece of mine might be explained by my gender. In a seminar discussion that was entirely male, excepting myself. In my area, woman are still far less common than men. But the younger women I meet in composition are much less prone to talk about themselves as \"women composers\". At least until they have a child -- being a mother and a composer is a whole different ball of wax. Keep going. Don't let the naysayers win. Composing sort of chose me. I was trying to learn to play jazz and ended up here instead. - Instruments: In high school, I was in an acoustic duo called Rising to the Bottom. Tom (the guitarist) & I started a cover band called Neon Baby, but we've only had 1 gig so far. David (the bass player) & I recently started a country band called Dill Dotson & The Chupacabra Kings. - Years playing: Vocals, keys, guitar (in the band) I'm one of two songwriters in the band, and I also sing \"lead\" - I put this in quotations, because while I'm sometimes considered the front person, I don't like being on any different of a level than any of my fellow band members. We're definitely a team and a complete working unit - we all have our roles, but we are a machine that would not work without every individual piece in place. The same goes for in the studio, and in business - this is our company, and we strive to create a \"product\" that while people might not need, while hopefully want in their lives. I'm active in every part of the puzzle, but don't consider myself any more important than any other member; we are all active decision-makers, and together make a fine-tuned democracy. I play a Les Paul Special through a simple 30w Fender amp, just a tone and volume knob. As far as pedals, I've got this great boost pedal made by Xotic with a nice mid-rangey saturated gain. I use an MXR Carbon Copy analog delay pedal, and a Holy Grail Nano for reverb. For my keys, I used to use a sweet analog Juno 106, but they're so fragile, I've switched to a digital Roland Juno-D, which is pretty versatile and has some pretty good preset patches. I use a volume and sustain pedal for the Juno. For my vocals, I tend to use a quick slap delay with only one repeat, as well as a nice small plate reverb, both usually coming from the sound board straight to the house to alleviate feedback. While I can't think of any specific moment it became clear to me, there is a definite apparent difference between the reaction to men and women musicians, even if as simple as people expecting you to be either fantastic or horrible - always to the extreme. I find that the business, especially the performance aspect, is more often than not male-dominated; I've learned that in order to survive, you've got to become \"one of the guys\", in personality but also in musicality. Going to Berklee (College of Music) definitely opened my eyes to the fact that there are amazing women players out there, on every instrument you can think of. But generally speaking, people tend to either put you on a pedestal or shove your face in the dirt - there is not really a happy medium. I find that people expect that because I'm a woman, I don't pull my own weight, that the guys in my band carry my gear, that I get coddled and pampered; in actuality, this is a complete misconception. I like to forget that I'm a woman and just focus on the fact that I'm a part of something greater than gender. I think that generally speaking, the path that popular women musicians have taken is not the best example of what women musicians like me are trying to achieve; the auto-tuned, sex-driven pop star icons shown in the media are a bad representation of what is actually sexy - being good at my instrument is the sexiest thing I can think to do on stage. It used to not always be about the things that surround the music - the image, the reaction - but, rather, the raw emotion and natural talent involved in making a classic song and performance. This is not to say there are not still women out there doing this effectively - they're just harder to find than the \"icons\" that are spoon-fed to us today. I think the best advice I've absorbed is to just hold on to your tenacity; to continue forth in the face of adversity, and to always strive for more, no matter your level of success. You can use your gender to an advantage, but only if you're good at what you do in the first place - it shouldn't be abused. The advice that I would give is to be gender-blind; it doesn't matter that you're a woman, because more importantly, you should try to be a good musician. I've been singing as far back as I can remember - it's the most natural instrument to man, ever. I guess I always tinkered around on keyboards, and in 4th grade started in the school band playing flute and piccolo, but quickly got antsy and moved to oboe, bassoon, glockenspiel, and by the time I got to middle school was deeply immersed in guitar. I have a pretty good collection of instruments by now, including accordian, autoharp, and a drumset, just to name a few, and plan to continue adding to my collection. I guess I never really chose any of the instruments, they kind of presented themselves to me at different points in my life, and I've never been able to resist at least trying to make any and all instruments make a pleasant sound. Just about anything you can touch can be an instrument in some way, I suppose. - Instruments: Janis Ian - Years playing: vocals, guitars, keyboards, some banjo, some psaltery I'm a solo artist.

For starts, we deal with breasts, which when big look really clumsy against a guitar. For seconds, if there's no bathroom available we can't just pee outside against a wall or tree. For thirds, men still hold most of the power, though I've been encouraged, these past 15+ years, to see more and more women taking over the tech roles in theatre. Still, there are next to no female sound engineers, even though physically we have better hearing. Still no female president of a major label or publishing house. It was clear to me the first time someone in TV asked if I really needed to play guitar on my song. I was 15 and it was 1966. Mmm... I'm on the cusp, straddling between the Ella/Sarah/Nina and Baez era and the Ani/Catie/Madonna era. Hard for me to say, knowing people from both so well. I do think the younger females take their right to be musicians more lightly than we did, but then again, that's what we fought for, isn't it?! \"Ellie Greenwich, 1967: \"Kid, this business is about hard work, and don't you ever forget it. It's about getting your period, having cramps that are killing you, then walking onstage to do the show anyhow - and never letting the crowd know it. If you don't have the guts for that, don't even start.\" Odetta, 1967: \"\"Never forget - they work for YOU. You do not work for them.\"\" Stella Adler, 1984: \"\"Trust your talent.\"\" The X-Files: \"\"Trust no one.\"\"\" \"Started on piano and moved to whatever I could get my hands on.

If anything, it's been more helpful because there's less women in bands, so it makes me take notice when there is a female fronted band. \"Yes, I think in the past women musicians (and to a certain extent, this is still the case in popular music) female musicians were saddled with fitting certain images and were hyper sexualized In the 90s the feminist movement seemed to changes a lot of this, but I think female artists still struggled to find their place in the music scene and a lot of music was consciously overly 'female' - dealing with female issues and trying to separate them from male artists. Now there's more and more female lead or fronted bands that seem to be held at face value, as music, and the fact that there's women in the band is less important. At least, that's been my experience. That said, there's still a minority of females in bands. The majority of musicians I know are males.\" Focus on the music, express yourself in a way that's comfortable to you, be yourself, and don't feel like you need to present a specific image to be taken seriously. \"Partman Parthorse: I'd never played bass before and thought it'd be fun Butts: I never sang before and wanted to try.

There is no difference in ability between men and women. The only difference is perception. Being a woman and a musician is still a novelty and a lot of people are still surprised when women are musicians. Once after a show, i heard some men talking about me and saying \"Wow. I'm surprised - girls can't usually do that.\" If more women were encouraged to get involved in the music industry then the perceived differences would disappear until a musician is just a musician - not a gender. In the past, there were real prejudices against women in music. I haven't experienced any prejudices today but people do still think of women as a commodity. My advice, would be to think of yourself as a musician. Don't let people label you as a \"female musician.\" Focus on your music so that you get recognized for that instead of your gender. It's fine if people recognize your gender - being a woman is great - but don't let them define you by it. Recieved a $100 costco guitar for Christmas from my parents. I started to teach myself from a DVD and i fell in love with it and started to take real lessons. - Instruments: numerous... i am a composer - Years playing: piano, conduct, electronic instruments I am a freelance composer & make all decisions \"Gear?

Or join a group and work your way up to be a leader in the group. Always pitch in and help, move the stands chairs, run the boards, just like the men. But do let the men be men! Be upbeat! Smile a lot. If orchestra music double check your instrumental parts!!!! Never whine & complain that you're a women. If you're good and your music excellent, you'll get somewhere. Most of us don't get as far as we like. It's a \"\"Have to\"\" field.\" \"I have been playing piano since I was 6 years old but don't perform. Love the electroacoustic music performance art thing, The Vivian. Why because it's fun.\" - Instruments: I have been in 4 actual bands: Radio Activity, Venus, Mellow Yellow and ReBelle - Years playing: vocals and guitar I am the songwriter, lead singer and guitarist of the band. One of the things I really like about my band, is that when we finish a song, it's really a product of all three of us. My band mates Janneke and Linda love to be part of the writing process, for instance they make their own arrangements on their instrument, and (co-)write (with) some of the lyrics. We are a very democratic band, so we make every decision together. Most of the time that goes easily, because we make most of our decisions based on our feelings about something and we think and feel the same way about a lot of stuff. That might also have to do with the fact that Janneke is my sister. It's probably also easier to decide on things when you only have three band members by the way. \"I have an american, dark green Fender Stratocaster, and I use .011 - .048 nickel wound strings by Ernie Ball. The effect pedals I use are: - an OCD ( - by Boss\" \"If a band with - for instance - a female drummer and for the rest only male musicians is performing, the girl will probably stand out a little more than the rest of the band. In general there are a lot more male than female instrumentalists, so people don't see it very often and that makes it special. I base that on what I've heard from many people standing in the audience while watching a band like that. Next to that, I think that guys are by nature more \"\"laid back\"\" than girls. Off course not all guys are relaxed in manner, and not all girls are \"\"tense\"\". But a lot of female instrumentalists I know like to rehearse in a structured way, and men often prefer to see what happens when they're rehearsing. This is my general opinion, it's not always like that. \" The only difference I can think of right now is that the current generation brings a lot more female musicians than the previous generation. Unless off course they were hiding in studios... ;-) But seriously, I think that there are more women who feel the urge to jump on stage nowadays, maybe also because it gets more and more accepted by society. It probably sounds a little cheesy, but my advise to a woman musician would be to always believe in herself as an artist/performer. There may always people who may think less of you as a musician just because you're a woman. Prove them wrong :-) I have been singing almost all my life, and I wanted to play an instrument so I could accompany myself when singing (my own) songs. I loved the sound and the look of the guitar. Besides that I was (and still am actually) really interested in Spanish classical music when I was younger. My mother introduced me to that kind kind of music, as she plays acoustic guitar as well. So I started playing Spanish guitar when I was 8 years old. Then at the age of 13/14 I also wanted to make pop/rock music, so I bought an electric guitar and started in my first band. - Instruments: Judi Silvano's Women's Work, Judi Silvano's Cleome, Joe Lovano groups, Kenny Werner group, Adam Kolker group, Stefan Bauer Voyage - Years playing: vocal and flute My role in my band is as an equal partner with the other instrumentalists, and flexible between being the lead line and being the accompanying color to another lead part. In the studio, the musical collaboration continues so that we can capture the spontaneous interrelationships that emerge, but I make the decisions as to repertoire, usually. Regarding business and marketing, since I am an independent artist with a small Indie Label, I make most of the decisions and am responsible for follow through of my ideas. Beyer mic and a healthy set of vocal cords Being a woman is of course different than being a man. While both men and women are musicians, sometimes the gender and emotional diffferences in communication make it more or less comfortable. There are many enlightened folks of both genders to whom the difference is minimal, yet there are still many prejudices and expectations that abound within the community. Sometimes it is the club owners and bookers that have the bigger problem in dealing respectfully with musicians, particularly women. But it is also audiences that seem to have higher expectations from women musicians, and are more open and accepting of male musicians and their expression. Yes, i do see differences. The level of support that women musicians give to each other has been much greater, as there are more and more young women coming into the field. In previous generations, there were much fewer women musicians that were able to overcome the roadblocks to being a professional player. Since there was a lack of support and agreement in society and in families that the women should or even could be professional musicians of a serious sort, most of the jobs available to womenrequired them to dress and act as show-girls, for instance. Or they had to play in an all-women novelty band. That is still true to some extent today, but it is starting to change in that you see many women playing in mixed male and female bands. Yay! I have gotten many pieces of encouragement from musicians. Mostly, I was encouraged to continue studying and focus on the music and improving my craft. The musicians that I played with in the jazz world early on, like Kenny Werner and Joe Lovano, told me not to worry about the public's or critics' responses and to just keep on working to get better at what I did. They appreciated my contributions to the music and were generous to me and accepting. My advice to any musician, male or female is to focus on the music and keep that love in your heart by continually studying and being open to growing in new ways. That way you find yourself and can express your own personal \"voice\" and while you may incorporate much of the work of generations before you, you will find a way to express your own way if you are courageous enough and persistant enough. Go for it. That's the real joy of being an artist. I chose my voice as my main instrument because I have the most variety of tone and textures and the most control technically and dynamically. - Instruments: Mary Louise Knutson Trio, JazzMN Big Band, Debbie Duncan, I freelance a lot so there are a lot of other groups I play with now and have played with in previous years. - Years playing: piano I'm the leader in my own band, I write the music, arrange it, look for gigs, get the gigs, write and send contracts and invoices, send copy and photos to presenters for programs, hire the other players, perform the lead part, talk to the audience between tunes, schmooze during intermission, sell CDs, pay the players, collect fans, send a monthly newsletter to fans, connect and communicate with fans daily through social networking websites, update my own website, design posters, post posters, design postcards, send postcards, assemble wardrobe, and the list goes on. I make all the decisions.Basically, most small businesses would have a staff of fifteen people to do all the jobs that I do! I own a Kawaii grand piano 5'10\". I use whatever piano a venue has, though I bring a Kurzweil PC 2X (88 weighted keys) keyboard if no piano is available. With that, I lug a Roland KC-350 amplifier, a keyboard stand, a music stand, a bench, and a bag of chords. \"Yes. Being a women in the field of jazz is very difficult as 99.9% of the musicians are men. What is difficult is finding your way into the clique. Guys like to hang with guys, so they'll invite each other over to have a beer and play and listen to music - to bond. Then these guys end up having a band together or they end up hiring each other for gigs because they're comfortable with each other. And they get lots of experience playing together at these bonding sessions, whereas a woman might get her experience by playing along with records at home. Also, I think sometimes men are uncomfortable hiring women as they're afraid of the sexual energy they may feel from playing music together. Or they may not want to deal with the jealousy their spouse may feel when they see him enjoying something with another woman. So, many don't invite women to connect musically or socially with them. \" I see that there are more women in the field of jazz today, though the numbers are still amazingly low. A few people warned me not to go into the business, but other than that I don't recall ever receiving any valuable advice about making my way in the music business. I always wished I had had a mentor. My advice for young women musicians would be to only go into the music business if you can't imagine living your life without the act of performing music. And only if you can still enjoy playing if no one is listening....since much of the time you will be playing for a room full of people talking to each other. Also, 90% of the biz is biz, not music. Can you imagine doing business all day, sometimes foregoing your art to get through the business? Do not go into the biz for money or fame. These are the wrong reasons. Also, when men (in the band and/or from the audience) want to get together with you for coffee, it's not about business or friendship. It's about their romantic interest in you. This took me forever to learn! I don't know. My family had a piano in the house when I was growing up and I just gravitated to it. - Instruments: Sunset Rubdown, Pony Up!, Secret melodica \"I'm the defacto manager of our band-- I usually act as the liaison between our booking agent, tour manager, van rental company, bank. I am in charge of all our finances. Basically, I'm the most organized person in the band so all these tasks naturally fell to me, and I do it because I'm good at it and it irks me to see things mismanaged. Studio-wise, I am usually involved in the whole process. I love recording. I like mixing and mastering, though I tend to have less strong opinions about choices made there than our band leader. I am not the songwriter, but I participate in the songwriting once the songwriter brings in the \"\"bones.\"\" That's how our band works.\" I play an old Yamaha keyboard that we found in the trash, a Suzuki Q~Chord (which is a digital autoharp), two cymbals (chinese & small splash), a glockenspiel, sometimes a melodica, and I also use a small vibrator for playing the cymbals and glock. I run the keyboard and the Q~Chord through a four-channel mixer to a bass amp. In general I think all the inequities between men and women are as present as ever in the music industry, if not more so at times. It's definitely a lot harder to be taken seriously as a musician if you're a woman, especially if you're in an all-girl band. No matter what your gender, the media is tends to latch on to an idea about you and will often distort it, but they really went for it with Pony Up! We were cute, silly girls in every article and it was a hard image to shake. Not that we tried very hard to do so, but it sort of ate away at me. I hate to say it, but I sort of find it easier to be in a band with all boys. I feel like we get taken more seriously. Not that I can always blend in-- once I got asked who I was dating in the band, as though that were the only reason I would be in the band. Well, I just finished reading 'Neon Angel' by Cherie Currie about her life with The Runaways, and I have to say that my experiences have been pretty G-rated in comparison. That band really paved the way for us. I would like to think that now women musicians are a lot better informed about their rights financially. I am really hoping that all-girl groups are becoming less gimmicky and can be taken more seriously and judged equally alongside all-male bands. Baby steps... \"I don't know if I ever got any memorable advice besides \"\"sing from your asshole\"\" (bandmate's mom), but I think I've learned a lot from my mistakes. Be extremely wary of the media-- know that they are happy to distort anything you might say in order to fit a pre-conceived notion they have about you. There's not a lot you can do about it but choose your words carefully. Be generous. Be kind to everyone working for you. Don't give up.\" Because I was no good at guitar... sort of. It was an organic process-- I started playing guitar in my first band but I never practice so just started singing and playing toys instead (a small glock and a child's accordion). I was introduced to the Q~Chord by a talented musician named Lara who was in a band we opened for on tour. I had never seen one before. It wasn't received well, but my next band loved it, and the frontman of that band also gave me my first keyboard and I started playing piano that way. - Instruments: I perform with 3 groups regularly - Years playing: voice, piano, frame drums, clarinet I'm the band leader and chief songwriter; in the studio I'm the assistant producer; there is no business unless I do it. Money determines everything. If there is money, then anything is possible. Otherwise, I am limited to what I can do when I'm not working at Columbia to publicize my music business, write songs, record, etc. Roland EP-9 keyboard, Carvin PA system & mic (like an SM-57), Remo Alessandra Belloni signature drums, Buffet Clarinet, mic stands, keyboard stand \"There are many differences. First is the music that people expect to hear from you. Then, how other musicians react to you. I find that with my band members I need to be extra sensitive about how I deliver criticism. I can't talk to them like a guy would--I need to talk to them like their wife or girlfriend would. They can't take straight talk from a woman. It hurts their feelings. I find that because now there are so many women making music, we get thrown into a category of \"\"girl singer-songwriters\"\" and it's hard to break out of that ghetto.\" I think we all have challenges to face. They may be different from our older sisters, but we've got challenges too. Approach your life holistically. Everything you do--day-job, music, family--is a reflection of you as an artist. You are an artist in your day job and you are an artist in the rehearsal studio. It's all connected. Do everything with love and joy, and the rest will follow. \"Piano: so I can accompanying my singing and write songs Clarinet: because I love to sing Frame drums: because I love to dance\" - Instruments: 2, \u00c5SA and Francis - Years playing: Vocal and piano We are a very democratic band and we do not have a \"leader\" or anything like that, and we always try to do everything together. But I write the lyrics and melodies of our songs. In the studio I just try to keep focused and try to focus on the feeling rather than the technique. Im not very into technical stuff. Im not in to the business either, but I try to be involved as much as I can, without getting to upset or bored. I have done some of our artwork and will keep doing that. I useally use an electric piano when we play live gigs beacause its easier, but recording I use a aucostic piano called RIPPEN. I use a shure beat 57a on my vocals on live gigs. It can be a very macho enviorment to be in and I am often the only woman on stage. It happens that people can talk down to you, especially when I was younger, and that has happend so many times I cant keep track when was the first time. I guess its harder in a way, and you have to make your own way in a very man dominated world. Everytime a woman or some women preforms the same evening as us I get a little happier. I think that women musicians can get more space nowadays and we can act more as we want to, rather than what people expect of a woman artist. An there are more role models for young girls now and that will create more women musicians. Someday as many as there are male musicians. I hope so anyway. \"I always been tought that if you want to do this you have to give it 110%. And I think thats true, you have to work as much as you can to get somewhere. If you want to make a living out of it, that is. Remember that the songs you write is yours and they are there for your sake. Thats the only thing that matter, that you enjoy playing your songs and that you do it with your heart.\" From the beggining it was just the very best thing I knew in the whole world. To sing and to play music. And as I evolved the meaning for me become even bigger. Its something that I need to do, and I dont have no chioce. - Instruments: Crash ensemble - Years playing: piano I like to be in control of situations. Though this is not necessarily possible when working in chamber groups. Absolutely. As in any field of endeavor, there is a societal structure in place that favors men over women. For example, when I was a student, the majority of piano students were women, and yet when it came to forging a career, it seems to be a majority of men who succeed. I have also experienced situations (e.g. music festivals) where I was either talked down to by younger male students or my views were dismissed or not taken seriously. Yes. The younger generation seems to be more confident. They also perhaps have a false sense of equality. In terms of performers, younger musicians who are women seem to have to market themselves in a more overtly sexual manner. Yes. Perseverance and dedication. It's also all about making the right connections. My first grade teacher used to play while we sang in class and I was fascinated by watching her fingers and the keys. I went home and told my parents I wanted to play. - Instruments: several local chamber groups - Years playing: piano, violin composer & performer, occasional producer Roland digital piano Yes. The key figures in the development of modern pianism are predominantly male, and composed music closer to their masculine inclination. Yes, the 'gap' is closing Let your Music and musicianship guide your career, not vice versa My Mom got me a toy piano when I was 4 - Instruments: Art Lillard's Heavenly Big Band; The Travelin Light Duo Series (vocal/guitar); my own group - Years playing: vocalist Vocalist in the Heavenly Band is a sideman position - I sing what's assigned and get paid by the leader, Art Lillard. When I'm singing as the leader, I make all business/marketing/studio decisions Shure Beta 58 microphone/Roland AC-60 amp Being a female singer in the jazz world can be a double whammy, as singers are often perceived of as the blonds of the music world - stupid bimbos who don't read music, which is not the case. My last recording was a tribute to the California composer/pianist Matt Dennis. I had many long chats with his widow, Virginia Maxey Dennis, who had been a big band singer with Tony Pastor and Mel Torme. It was amazing how little had changed as far as being a female singer. If you sing, make sure you also play an instrument. Do both very well. Also, learn to negotiate and read a contract. You will often be your best publicist. I have always been a singer, even as a child - Instruments: I've always done my own thing - Years playing: Guitar and Vocals Lead singer,writer for the band,in the studio the whole time to insert all my ideas and what i want. Im in on all final decisions and with coming up with ideas. \"Fender Tele,Acoustic Electric Taylor,Albert Lee HH,Fender Hot Rod amp, sennheiser wireless mic,in-ears,Silhouette Special White music man.\" I do think theres a difference. There's less of us..which i believe gives you more attention. But that being said theres a lot of great Male musicians out there so keeping up and proving yourself is key. Its something i've fought with ALL my life..it was tough trying to get the boys growing up to play with me,trying to put a band together,getting on all male tours etc. I've had to battle being a girl, always. It wasn't until i got a deal by myself when it became easier. Yes. I think originality and aw factor have decreased. Since women like Janis,Stevie,Ann and Nancy Wilson,Joan Jett,Pat Benatar,Sheryl Crow,Alanis,Jewel,Tori Amos, just to name a few..I feel copy-catting has increased and the general skill level to be a star these days is made up for in auto tune,theatrics,a poppy hit and how much money your label is willing to put behind you. \"Allison Hagendorf (the first A&R i had at Epic Records) told me..you gotta tour tour tour,earn your stripes,learn it and earn it the hard way, make it real and organic...then people will believe you. I would tell them, to be themselves,dont let people tell you its too hard or impossible. And that there's only one of 'them' on the planet, so they have something new to offer. I would also tell them to listen to the classics, The beatles,zeppelin,bowie,simon and garfunkel,bob dylan,jimi hendrex,rolling stones,billy joel, the list goes on!! Its like musicians Bible Study. You can't become a priest or a preacher, if you dont know who God is.\" because i wanted to Rock'n Roll haha..no really because most of my idols all played and i wanted to be able to play shows by myself and not have to depend on others to perform. - Instruments: Psalm One, Nacrobats - Years playing: Vocals, Drums I am a solo artist, so I handle 90% of the vocals during gigs. My girl Fluffy does the rest. In business and marketing decisions there is a collaborative effort to come to the most fruitful decisions, but I have the final say. My gear consists of Ableton and a MPD32. Very sleek and allows me to do some awesome stuff to an already cool rap show. I think great musicians come in Vagina, Penis, or whatever. I know in Hip-hop women have a particularly hard time, and misogyny rears its ugly face often. I believe though, as a woman, and as a strong individual you don't let any of those roadblocks, actual or imagined, deter you. There wasn't necessarily a moment where I knew everything was so so different because of my gender--I've always known I was different. There is a soulful talent that I feel is lacking with new artists, simply because music isn't always the first priority when it comes to music anymore. Not to say there aren't good female artists right now; that's ludicrous. But a Janis Joplin of today? Not so much. I've been given alot of good guidance, and also alot of room to make my own mistakes. I would tell a woman musician just starting out to have a hand in each and every decision that is going to affect your career, and be confident in yourself. My voice chose me; I wanted to play the saxophone forever. People told me I rapped before I ever took it seriously from just flowing in a couple of cyphers. I couldn't escape the very thing I'm doing right now--I wouldn't have it any other way. - Instruments: Miss Babs & The Kickin' Boogie Band, Wray Band, The Clare Cooper Band - Years playing: Keyboards, guitar, vocals In the Kickin' Boogie Band I'm the keyboard player and background vocalist, and the band performs several songs I've written. I have 2 CDs of original material that I co-produced as well as performed. I work mainly as a solo pianist/vocalist and am an independent contractor. Korg M50 keyboard, Ibanez guitar, Mac laptop You always have to prove yourself, and hear stupid comments about \"how unusual it is to see a woman playing an instrument\" or when you tell people you're a musician, be automatically asked, \"oh, are you a singer?\" Things have gotten a little better since I started in the 70's, but I'm still amazed at how deep the stereotypes are. Very much so - the older women have fought for everything they have, but the younger women don't think about it so much. They're much freer about what they're doing, like young women in most areas of life. I would say to learn as much as possible about the mechanics of making music and using equipment, and to be as good as they can be. Also to stay true to themselves and not let anyone discourage them. I learned piano as a child because my parents felt it was the basis for learning music. - Instruments: 3, Flying, Fertile Crescent, WOOM - Years playing: drums, vocals, percussion My band is a duo and we share all responsibilities, though at times the business side takes over, but that's just the nature of the beast. I have to beat it back to make time for the creative aspects of making music. I use a lot of different percussion instruments, mbira, claves, peruvian seed pods, etc, as well as a traditional drumset, but lately I've only been playing MPC (sampler/drum machine) and singing so I can move around and dance and interact with the audience more. \"YES. In so many ways, but most blatantly in that what you wear on stage is SO important- everyone notices it, but what men wear is nearly invisible. I was just talking to a female musician friend about this yesterday. Our looks will ALWAYS be a consideration, at least as much if not more than HOW we SOUND. This is something that just became very clear the more I performed. \" In some ways, yes and in some ways it just seems like the generations have endlessly repeated the same game...women don't form groups and bond as easily as men, so they're, in my opinion, more apt to ignore their \"foremothers\" and go their own way...sometimes only to fall in the same traps, etc. \"No. I never got any advice. I never knew any women musicians growing up! That's why I didn't get up the courage to play until I was 23!!! I had so many misconceptions about what good music was and how it should be made, and who made it and what they looked like. I guess my advice would be to follow your heart and your gut and make the music that you like listening to. Don't worry about what other people think. And keep an open mind as far as what techniques you use to make it- there's no wrong way to make something amazing! (Men/boys could easily take this advice as well!) \" Seemed like fun. - Instruments: just me. Simone White - Years playing: guitar, vocals I'm a solo artist. When I record with musicians I'm in charge but it's taken me a while to feel confident enough to tell them what to do. I'm an instinctive musician and a self-taught guitar player so working with professional Nashville musicians was intimidating at first. The producers I've worked with were working for me but it took a while for me to trust my own instincts and be confident in my choices. I don't have a manager so I get to fight with my label about marketing and business decisions, I don't think there's a difference there between men and women artists. The stereotype is that a label will try to exploit a woman's looks etc... but that's not been the case at all for me. I've actually had to lobby for photos of myself to be used in the artwork. I play a 1964 Guild M20 guitar with a Dearmond pickup \"I feel like women artists are categorized more. I get compared to a lot of different artists and usually the only thing that's similar is that we're both women, that gets pretty annoying. I don't think men have to deal with that as much. But definitely things have changed a lot since I was growing up. Girls today have so many women artists to look up to, and they learn guitar at a very young age. I never felt like it was a possibility for me, as pathetic as it sounds, I had to wait till I didn't have a musician boyfriend to start playing guitar.\" I think today's younger women musicians are starting out with more confidence but I could say that about young men as well. Everyone can be an artist now, it's more accessible, making a record, putting yourself out there, finding your audience. But with that there might also be the feeling of deserving success and feeling rotten if you don't get it. For me, and perhaps others of an older generation, I never thought it was possible to make a living as an artist so everything I've been given feels like a huge blessing, not a right. Now it seems like there is more of the possibility of instant overnight success on a much wider level and everything is so sped up. I think it used to be that you plugged away at it, mostly, because you loved doing it. I'd give the same advice to everybody, just keep doing what you love. I started writing songs vocally, was always trying to find musicians to help me play them. picked up the guitar so I could do it myself. - Instruments: Not counting camp bands I've been in 2: Rank + File, Charlie Belle - Years playing: vocals, guitar I'm the lead singer, the songwriter, and rhythm guitar. I decide what shows we will play, and I arrange the songs and vocals. I guess you could say it is my band. I picked the other members except for my brother. He's been in both of my bands from the beginning. I play a blue metallic Danelectro 2-PU when I'm plugged in, and a blue flowery Daisy Rock acoustic. Yes definitely. What encourages guys to keep playing are the groupies and the music, but for girls our drive has to be the music. We don't have groupies at all of our shows. We have to be in love with the music to keep playing. The moment I realized this was when we went to a Halloween festival and the band playing was this group of boys (I forget their name) who we had played at the same gig before. They are my age, and they are really good, but there were girls all in front of the entire stage just staring at them. They were all ages and were just dazed. We don't get groupies like that. I have Girls Rock, and my instructors have said that they didn't have a camp where they could meet other girls who liked to rock. It's just normal for me to know other girls who are rockers. At camp they are always giving us advice on things like how to book our first tour, and how to get gigs in your hometown. My advice would be to play in public all you can. Don't just wait for the big stuff to happen. Play open mic nights at cafes because anyone can be in the crowd. We play all we can. I was taking piano when I was 4, and when we moved to Wynnewood my parents didn't want to buy a piano so they asked me if I wanted to play drums or guitar so I picked guitar. My brother plays the drums. - Instruments: I've played with songwriters and other bands briefly, this is the group I've been with the longest. I've recently joined a new band named Bad Girlfriend. - Years playing: drums & vocals My band feels like a family at this point. I am the drummer, but I also sing on some of our songs, and contributed to lyric writing for our album Mad Things. When it comes to recording I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Our bassist is strictly business. He handles business and hustling. Ludwig kit. with 22 \" kick, in natural wood finish (very classy I think). I use zildjan custom A pros for cymbals, hi-hats, ride and crash. I have have a Tama snare that I recently broke, so I use a ludwig snare in the meantime. My set-up is pretty straightforward- I play heavy floor tom, snare, kick and ride primarily. I don't have an elaborate set-up because simple, straightforward, heavy drums complement the music I play. I think it can have its negatives and positives. When I play shows, people who haven't seen us are like \"woah,a girl drummer, I've never seen one before !\" but the truth is, there are a lot of girl drummers around, it's not that rare. People often expect that I will play drums badly because I am a woman, and are surprised that I can play and hit hard, which they are also not shy about telling me! I've had so many strangers come up to me and say \"Wow, I thought you were gonna suck but you can really hit those drums!\" then expect a thank you. I guess because people expect less from me, they are generally more impressed with my playing and that gets the band attention. My band-mates (who are all men) DO NOT treat me differently because I am a woman musician, they know I can play so they will tell me if I'm playing something that's crappy and won't sugarcoat it. I'd rather get chewed out but be respected than patted on the back because less is expected of me. No I wish they would so I could make a living off playing. My advice would be to play music you like and can get behind, but hustle. \" I chose the drums because they are really fun to play! You get to bang and make a lot of noise, and be heard which was really appealing for a small lady like myself. Your whole body is involved, because you are using different parts of it to play different things at the same time, so in that way your body becomes a part of the instrument. It's very physical, which I like. \" - Years playing: piano, flute IMac computer, Mackie 16-track mixer, metric halo, steinway grand piano \"There is lingering prejudice against female composers, despite the fact that it is slowly getting better. It's especially bad for older women. In general, very few orchestras or operas play music by women. It's somewhat better for chamber music and electronic music. When I first went to Tanglewood as a Composition Fellow, the first thing I was greeted with was \"\"oo, a lady composer.\"\" It was not meant as a welcoming remark!\" I think there are many more role models for younger women, and much more acceptance of women as musicians now. \"No! Advice - find mentors! \" Enjoyed the timbres of piano and flute. - Instruments: Nicole Mitchell & Black Earth Ensemble, The Truth, Painted Pictures, Ed Stone, Brian O'Neal, Musique Noire, Maggie Brown - Years playing: percussion I'm a songwriter for the band. I help the band leader with hard decisions when she calls. I'm sometimes musical director. Cajon, 13\" Sabian Neil and other auxiliary percussion \"Yes. But, not necessarily musical differences. Men conduct their rehearsals kinda of randomly. At a woman's rehearsal, food and drink is usually offered. Maybe even tea or coffee. Men, are a little more relaxed about conducting their business...... start late and end late. Personality-wise, women musician personalities are way more laid back than your typical woman.\" No, we all are pretty cool. I would give the same advice to a young man. Play hard and practice smart. If your sexuality gets you in the door without losing dignity, then oblige. For a long time, I was really hung up on men hiring me because they thought I was cute or pretty. I wanted them to hire me for my talent. After some time, I learned how to use my femininity to help my career....... without losing any dignity. Its fun.... I picked it up easy...... it was challenging - Instruments: 1 my solo project - Years playing: Piano, Vocals, Guitar, Ukulele \"In the band- I'm the boss. :) I'm the bandleader, songwriter, singer, girlfriend, best friend, and road mom. In the studio- I'm the artist. I'm the decision maker along with the producer, and I'm (hopefully) the visionary. I'm the one who's trying to articulate what's in my brain, and the one who's main purpose is to defend and communicate the essence of the songs. In business- I'm the product. I know that, and I hate that, but that's my reality. I've spent the better part of the last 4 years swallowing that very bitter pill. And honestly everything got easier once I stopped fighting it. \" Yamaha Piano at home, Yamaha Clavinova for touring, Shure Microphones, Martin acoustic Guitar and Ukulele, Epiphone Sheraton Electric Guitar, Fender Deluxe Guitar Amp, Fender Wurlizter. I love my gear. I love each piece like it's an actual extension of myself because essentially it is. I'm a songwriter and the instrument truly outlines where the writing goes. ABSOLUTELY. It's infuriating. I am still learning how to deal with that. It unfortunately is assumed in most places in the music industry, that girls need coddling, and that can come in all different forms. It's incredibly easy to find people to tell you what to do, what to wear, what to say, what to look like, who to sound like, blah blah blah. Girls are scrutinized in a physical way first, then people listen to their musical voice. Boys can be fat and bald and assholes, while girls are punished for that. Not always, of course, but it is all too often assumed that we don't have a vision, or direction, or perspective. I have learned that the hard way. I had to have success before anyone would listen to me. I see the young generation lacking a sense of direction that isn't image based. I want more Joni Mitchells, Tori Amoses, Joan Jetts, Janis Joplins. And I want to see more women feel empowered to be who they are at a younger age. There are a lot of fantastic examples of strong ladies out there but, like myself, I feel like we don't give ourselves permission until we are older. And it sucks that I just said older and I mean 30. I'm as lame as the rest of em. \"I would say to someone starting out two very important things: 1. speak your truth, and don't doubt that you have the instincts to lead you through this industry. We are encouraged to doubt ourselves and listen to a lot of opinions, but ultimately we are given the tools to guide ourselves. 2. Surround yourself with people you trust on a gut level. I'm not talking about getting a lawyer or a manager who's your best friend. But trust that they are honest, and they'll work hard for you. And do the same for them. If we have to listen to a lot opinions, they might as well be from someone we trust. \" It was accessible and my big sister played it growing up, so I think I started mostly as a copycat. But I fell in total and complete love with the piano. I never studied, but growing up, I spent every spare moment getting to know it. I'm still working on becoming a better player, but I play with passion and it is the perfect foundation for my first love, which is singing. I have been singing since I could talk, and it absolutely is one of my dearest friends. I feel like I know myself through music. It's like going to church. Except I don't go to church... so maybe it's a little bit different. - Instruments: usually 4/year. My regular groups are the Elgin Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Sinfonietta, Joffrey Ballet Orchestra and the Chicago Opera Theater - Years playing: bassoon I am merely a performer, I have no say, in any way, in the decision making process for the organizations that I work for. Benson Bell bassoon. Heckel bocal. When I first started working I experienced a greater difference. I don't think that my \"getting\" work suffered in any way for being a woman, but I did have to put up with what would be now called a lot of \"sexist\" behavior. Jokes mostly, some teasing. That was in my 20's and 30's. Now I don't think anyone would dream of behaving that way. It might be my age, it might be the times. I don't know. I'm glad it's gone,though. Not particularly. Young women that I work with don't act like I did when I was their age, they are more like I am now. They are very business-like, more mature. \"No one ever gave me advise in music that helped me. The best advice was from my dad. He said \"\"if you want something bad enough, you'll find a way\"\". He was a football coach. Advise for the newbies? Be really smart about your money.\" yes, most certainly. - Instruments: 3. Spdfgh,Godstar,Via Tania - Years playing: vocals, ukulele,guitar \"I have been a solo artist for a long time now, so the band leader by default. I definetly make the last calls and initiate the ideas but now I have a talented band it is opening up a bit more and I able to collaborate a little easier , I want to collaborate more actually, especially working with some trained musicians as I am not, it's kind of fascinating for me. I am surrounded by some great people that help me try and get more marketing savvy. The decisions end up coming down to me in that whatever I manage to get done gets used in some way or other.\" \"Less is more approach for me. One ukulele, one SG electric guitar, some pedals an Ampeg amp, various percussion instruments\" \"I've been told that I'm a 'real girl' sometimes, I think because I like to be comfortable, which touring is the opposite of... I think a lot of the circumstances around being a musician are what makes it hard for me but I don't know if that's because I'm a woman or because I'm an older more informed - i know what I like now - person. I am immensely influenced by my environment so dressing rooms that are underground bunkers that smell like old beer do affect me in a way I don't think they affect my male peers. But again, I don't know if that's me being pretty sensitive in general. Music wise no, I don't think it FEELS different whether you're a man or a woman playing music , though I've heard there might be different reasons as to why men and women join bands in the first place! \" \"When I was growing up playing music there was a woman, Lindy Morrison who played drums in the Go Betweens that used to help out other young female musicians including myself with advice and helping get good shows etc. Then there were other women I was influenced by (rarely men) that led me down this whole path in the first place. I got to know these women personally and I always wanted to be just like them. I 'd say the only difference are the time you are playing music, the decades are really the context. I have a pet peeve when media say it's fashionable to be a women right now in music I think gee, wow , between the two sexes you are going to make one come in and out of fashion?\" \"over time probably, but no one really hit the nail on the head. No one really knows, it's such a crap shoot. Ok I guess really the only one that matters is persistence, which is boring to hear even when you know it's the case and in times when you think : this doesn't make sense, on paper, or from any way I look at it, -I could be actually having a wildly successful extremely lucrative career in an actual job that exists- heh Except I like to make music and write songs and I'm choosing to do it for my own well being and I'd be pretty miserable without it.\" \"My older sister and I used to jam when we were kids and naturally I followed her around mimicking her, thank goodness she discovered the Ramones . When I joined a band with her at 16 we needed a bass player so I switched to bass for a good 7 years but continued to write on guitar. A few years ago I moved to Chicago without barely anything and I wanted to write really simply so i got a barritone ukulele it was a test to keep it simple and see if they songs could almost play themselves.\" - Instruments: 1 (my own) - Years playing: vocals, guitars, ukulele, drums \"I write the songs (music and lyrics). I help in arranging (though that \u00b4s mainly jan \u00b4s doing). I also record the basic skeleton of a song. Once we \u00b4re in the studio I \u00b4m trying to help and learn more technical stuff. Also I will co-produce and often try first mixes. Of course I get a lot of help from people who are way better so that helps. But I \u00b4m definitely not a girl who just sings her part and then walks away. I run my own label (it\u00b4s tiny) where I self release (in greenland). There \u00b4s quite some business decisions involved there - on a small scale but still it\u00b4s rather surprising how much effort goes into doing that. We also do our won tour managing and gig bookings.\" \"I have a bunch of live gear - and then studio gear (in greenland there \u00b4s not much see, so I did lots of stuff myself by trial and error - and soldering a lot) * live: 2nd hand nice taylor acoustic, little red ukulele with bottle cap PU, hagstrom I and silvertone U1, old beat up Kay jazz bass, oliver amp and dynacord jazzII amp. All through small mixer, boomerang II, and a bunch of stomp boxes * studio: my favorite guitar is my kay jazz II, and I also love to use my hagstrom Impala. For acoustics it\u00b4s the taylor still. I have some stuff from the streets that we restored - bunch of amps, a hohner pianet, eko bass pedals, an old pump organ. I share a small ludwig jazz drum kit. Have a bunch of cheap mics (rode N1, some SM57s, and a couple old AKGs I got from the local radio station). Slowly fixing an old broadcast telefunken 50s mixer - otherwise I use my apogee duet (2nd hand also - I have no newly owned stuff yet) with sometimes a super sweet preamp I got from a friend who stopped recording. I \u00b4m a not-so-technical musician I \u00b4m afraid so I use a lot of crap gear and instruments and just look for a specific sound. Use quite some effects -analog mostly- and I spend a lot of time figuring out what \u00b4s wrong with them hehe.\" where I come from there \u00b4s no difference in responsibilities between man and woman - getting food or starving to death you know (admittedly more so in the olden days, grin). but I find that it\u00b4s mostly in the US and canada that people put this big emphasis on differences (in chance, in possibilities, in position etc) - I seriously have no idea how it is to be a male musician but I think that there\u00b4s big differences also in being a folky singer songwritress and an aspiring pop diva. I definitely don\u00b4t feel awkward or \"less\" or out of place on a stage cause I \u00b4m a woman. I don\u00b4t really feel treated differently either (I mean I of course do but that \u00b4s not necessarily in the context of playing music -so not cause I \u00b4m a female musician- but cause I \u00b4m a woman, point). Hope you get what I mean...? sure. Simplified it seems to be more about being a (good looking) woman and less about what that woman has to say, these days - but then again the context is totally different, too. And on the other hand women are now way bigger stars than they were a few generations ago (or so it feels). There \u00b4s more women can do today, it seems (less divisional stylistic barriers, too). Funnily enough precisely because of that (ao) I listen and feel way stronger about very old female artists (the first dusty blues 78s with female singers and such). Oh well it\u00b4s more fun than you can imagine! I got my little red ukulele from by boyfriend while I was studying in canada - I was bored and he thought I should have a uke. Not sure why, hihi - I \u00b4d never played anything before, and he surely never heard me sing. But well I got this uke - and I started messing around with it and all of a sudden songs just came out! - Instruments: 2 beside my own, not counting high school bands (Jargon Society, and Hatestick) and now I play under my own name, but I have a band - Years playing: vocals, guitar, banjo, Rhodes, mandolin I'm the decision maker, producer, chief cook and bottle washer. Because the band is supporting my songs, and it's my vision, I do a lot of stuff that I might not if everyone were writing. I book all the shows, make all the calls/emails, do all the promotion. \"At the moment I'm switching between a parlor Larrivee acoustic guitar, and a '72 Fender Mustang electric. I've been using a vintage Fender Deluxe amp live, and I have a Gibson Minuteman amp for practice. I play a burgundy Kalamazoo lap steel from around 1940. I have a banjo made by a friend of mine, and another from around 1910. I play a lot of other stuff on my recordings (Fender Rhodes, mandolin, bells). \" \"At least locally, I think women musicians sometimes get lumped together on certain kinds of bills because people can't see past the gender. I kind of bristle when I'm put on a bill and then flyer says \"\"women who rock\"\". I wonder if in the future I'll just be called a guitarist and singer-songwriter, instead of being thought of as a woman guitarist or woman singer-songwriter. When the distinction ceases to be made, then I will know that bias is no longer an issue.\" I think younger women coming up right now probably have it a little bit different. They can take it a little bit more for granted. That's probably a good thing. Don't quit your day job. Be your own sugar mama. Do what you love. I think I was always meant to play guitar. Years of piano lessons didn't really stick, I was just waiting to pluck strings. The guitar makes a lot of sense to me, and it's far more portable than a piano. - Instruments: I am a solo artist who performs regularly, and I also do backup vocals for Comandante Zero. - Years playing: vocals, use computer to make music, also play flute and guitar Singer/songwriter/producer/performer/everything else. Mac, m-audio interface, midi controller keyboard, Reason, Garage Band. I think women have an easier time being hugely successful as solo pop artists. The only real exception in my opinion is Michael Jackson. Women today have to be more self sufficient if they're independent and they have the tools at their disposal to do so. Write constantly, collab with others, put your music first in your life, get collaborators to help where appropriate, do what you love to do. Wanted to make dance music so I learned how to do it on the computer. - Instruments: 3 Oh Those Pants/The Doncasters/Martha and the Muffins (aka M+M) - Years playing: vocals and some guitar and keyboards I am the lead singer, co-songwriter, instrumentalist (to a lesser degree), producer. The band is just myself and Mark Gane. He and I have Muffin Music Ltd. to handle the business end of things and Mystery Song is our own publishing entity. We make all the business and marketing decisions along with our manager. I share a home studio with Mark Gane. I have a Wurlitzer electric piano, Acetone organ and about 4 or 5 guitars. I got my first guitar when I was twelve. It is a small acoustic Hofner and I still have it. I also own a mandolin. I recently bought a 3/4 size bass at a thrift store and had it fixed up. I play it a lot right now. \"A lot of boys get into music and start bands to impress girls. Many girls get involved in music and bands to prove they can do it as well as the guys. Musician girls aren't the ones musician boys are after. Most men in a band have regular hard-working wives at home keeping life going with family etc. Women in a band most likely don't have such a luxury. I feel my partner Mark and I have had equal respect and attention throughout the years.\" \"Young female musicians I have met are perhaps a bit more independent. Generally speaking, I think not much has changed as the women who were the pioneers were as strong and determined as women in bands today. There are more manufactured female 'stars' now selling things such as brands and sex than in the 1960's to 1990's. \" \"It's very hard to have it all - a successful career as a musician, a healthy, happy relationship with a partner and children in a stable home. My advice would be - don't try to do everything at once. Make sure you enjoy all aspects of your life and don't burn out too soon. Be there! My mother gave me some good advice. She said there are a lot of drugs and alcohol close at hand most of the time in the life of a musician. She said I should be careful not to get drawn into that world. She was right as I have seen so many musicians both male and female destroy their lives with abuse of these addictive substances. Stay focused on the music and remember you will always have your ups and downs.\" \"Vocals are what I mostly do and it chose me back in the punk/New Wave era. I started playing very simple Acetone organ parts like 'Telstar' and gradually moved up to the mic where I have stayed all these years. In high school I got tired of watching my boyfriend playing in bands so I joined in. I was the only girl involved in a band that I knew of in my circle. Most girls wanted to be like Joni Mitchell. I liked Roxy Music and Motown.\" - Instruments: Just Girl In A Coma - Years playing: Drums Besides playing drums,I run all of our social networks,replay to fanmail and work with our manager on business with the band. I have a 4 piece teal Gretsch set, lead singer has a brent mason telecaster and fender deville amp,bass player plays on jack cassidy bass with ampeg amp. It is different...being in this band for 8 years now I find we get stereotyped alot. People assume we will sound a certain way or don't know how to work our gear. There is also more pressure to need to look a certain way as a woman in entertainment,such as weight etc. I see it a lot in press,from comments from the public and touring. There is difference. Musicians who are coming before this technology boom had to work a lot harder. There wasn't internet,email,myspace,twitter. They had to mail , get on radio and get press a different way. They were making records different too. There were not files to make and protools. I think the talent then is more real and raw. Now and days there are auto tuners for singers. Sad. We have to now find ways to be clever in marketintg because anyone can stream themselves live. I believe anyone can get attention which makes the music industry sometimes seem souless. Joan jett told us to always enjoy and live in the moment as things arte happening. I would tell any women musician to never give up no matter what is told to them. You don't have to look a certain way or come from a certain background. Work hard and just be. Was a guitar player and my bass player convinced me to play drums because I could keep a beat. My father drummed. - Instruments: Oh my gosh! Too many to list! Classical singers are freelance, so we cobble together a season with various symphonies, chorales, and opera companies. Contracts usually last from 3 days to 6 weeks. Some groups: Seattle Opera, Seattle Symphony, Sunriver Music Festival, Cincinnati Opera, Palm Beach Opera, MAP at Carnegie Hall, many others... - Years playing: Classical mezzo-soprano As a freelance opera singer, I need to establish and maintain contacts, line up lessons, coachings, auditions, update and maintain my website, keep my materials current (including recordings) to best reflect what I have to offer. It is frequently up to me to create my own opportunities, whether by recording a CD and marketing it at live performances, or offering my abilities to a new project, or just keeping my name in the minds of people doing the casting. I'm usually contracted as an independent contractor, which means I also need to keep track of my expenses and how much tax I'll owe. The vitals: water bottle, tiny child's toy keyboard, my laptop, pencil and paper, cell phone \"Oh yes! The opera world has ratios much like ballet. MANY more women than men, but the number of available roles for each is about equal, so it is much more competitive for the women. You frequently end up with situations where there may be 10 tenors going for a role, but 100 sopranos. With the scarcity of qualified men, there is often competition to hire the best singers. Because of this, men can often expect a higher fee for an equivalent role. This was clear to me when a male friend of mine received a fee that was five times what mine was, even though his part was about one tenth the size. (We were in different productions, but the same company.) He happened to be a very rare voice type, and could demand a higher fee, while there was a long line of women ready and willing to sing my part! Classical music is also still very much a male dominated field at the top. Male conductors still vastly outnumber female conductors. I had a friend who wanted to be a conductor, but she was repeatedly told \"\"Oh no, dear, you can't do that. You're a woman! You should be an organist.\"\" And so she was, for many years. I'm happy to say, she went back to school, finished her doctorate in conducting, and is now a well-regarded professional in the field!\" Yes and no. To succeed in the field, there are still some essential qualities that trancend generation. An adaptable personality and a willingness to work quickly and intimately with relative strangers, as well as the need to be someone who travels well, makes for certain commonalities. In the opera world, I'm fortunate to work with older established artists, as well as up and coming singers. I find I learn a great deal from both. Always approach the work humbly and with an open mind. The joy in this field is that you never know everything, and at any moment you may stumble upon a life-altering realization about your art. Also remember that live performance is at its heart a collaboration...First with yourself and the (usually dead) composer, then with the other musicians, and most importantly, with your audience. I think today, most audiences don't realize just how big a part they actually play in the performance they attend. There is a breath, a connection, an energy that only exists once you add an audience, and each audience is unique. Art is communication. Until there is an audience, the work is incomplete. Voice is the most personal and communicative instrument, and offers unique challenges. It also offers the most opportunity to incorporate a whole body performance, from facial expression, to costumes, to cartwheels on-stage! - Instruments: Oh god, 23yrs of orchestras, bands, string quartets.... too many names - Years playing: fiddle/violin Melody! Bossy. One old school violin. 1850s era German. That's it. If I'm busking I make a lot more money than my male counterparts. I'm less likely to be chosen as the leader of a group. Women must be cute, charming, drink with the boys, hang with the boys, make crude jokes, and are very competitive with each other. I was 3yrs old. I'm not sure how much thought went into that choice. - Instruments: Only Tortilla Factory - Years playing: Vocals \"In the band I am one of the lead vocalist. I share the learship with my brother Alfredo. I am taking over for my father Tony Guerreo. I have some pretty big shoes to fill lol. He's my hero in so many ways. His health is not good. He has diabetes and goes to dyalisis three times a week. He still manages to book the band and direct my foot steps. I am very honored. This is a family business since 1973. I share in the business Decisions. I help book the band , market it, and keep our music library. In the studio I sing lead and backup. \" I'm a vocalist so I am the gear lol I am fortunate that I have been treated as an equal. There are times that being a woman does have it's advantages, but I'm sure being male does too. I feel very fortunate to be surounded by talented individuals that treat me as an equal musician Perhaps in the clothes an hairstyles. We are each unique individuals that bring heart and soul in our own way. My father once told me to eat an breathe music . I live by it. An anyone starting out my advice would be to surround yourself with better musicians. There is always room for growth! An DONT EVER GIVE UP!! DARE TO DREAM!!! I really enjoy being able to project what I feel inside . And to be able to connect with others the music I sing is a great and wonderful experience . It's truly an honor for lack of better words - Instruments: Holly Hofmann Jazz Quartet - Years playing: Flute I am self managed and also write all of my own material. In the studio I work with a producers and its we work collaboratively with production but he does most of it. \"My honest view and from my own experience is it's completely common place for a man to say what he wants and how he wants things done. However as a female the minute you are assertive and say you want things done a certain way you are called a 'diva' which I feel is a derogatory term. I think to be successful in any career you need to be assertive and I sometimes wish that was embraced and not seen as a negative thing. And despite the 'diva' tag I will always continue to honestly speak my mind and be open about how I would like things done. \" I think woman as well as men have always made their mark in music whether this was 10 years ago or 50 years ago. One piece of simple advice I've always stuck to is to believe in yourself... and the rest will follow. I didn't really choose it, it chose me! - Instruments: I've done a lot of session work, but as far as bands...Mellowdrone (bass and synth player), Uh huh her(lead singer/producer), Kelly (synth player), Adam Lambert(synth player/vocals) - Years playing: Vocals, Piano, Guitar, Bass My role in my band is Lead Singer/Producer/player. At the moment I'm managing the band alongside my bandmate. It was daunting at first but we really wanted to take back some of the control we lost by having \"handlers\" all the time. I enjoy being able to talk directly with people as opposed to being represented by someone personally. I have a wide range of gear. On the production side I run Pro-tools and ableton live, with an O1V digital mixer. I use in ears by Ultimate Ears. As far as synths that I play, I have a Korg Triton Extreme Korg MS2000B, Korg Roland Juno G, and an M-Audio USB keyboard controller. I have a Fender Jaguar Bass, and 2 Fender Telecaster guitars. I use pedalboards by Line6 and Vox. Women have always had an interesting role in music, and for the most part it's been an uphill battle. I think you answer your own question just by the title of this article. I don't think I've ever seen an article titled, \"Being a man in music in 2010\". I'm not trying to invalidate the role of women in music, but the title says it all. It is a man's world. Speaking of which I just saw the runaways biopic, and it's so clear that it was a huge problem then. They paved the way for woman to play loud hard rock music \"like a man\", and with each step made it easier and more formidable to be in music as a woman. That being said, I look at it from a genderless position, I always have. I don't think \"I'm a woman, and I play woman music\". I just play music, and I happen to have breasts. I think this generation of women musicians have an entirely different experience for obvious reasons. The industry has changed so vastly I can barely keep up. It's a world now of pop superstars or indy artists. I feel like the gap is huge. Either you're an indie artist, or a megastar like Lady Gaga, and this can all happen in an instant. A blogger like Perez Hilton can give you a plug and then next thing you know, you're in the top 10 on the pop charts. It's the age of technology and sharing information. It's far different from the time when Alanis Morrisette was selling millions of records and touring grass roots style to get her name out there. It's just a different world, for better or worse. \"My college Professor at Berklee gave me some sound advice. He said,\"\" When you go to LA and embark into the music industry, be sure to bring some vaseline. It will make the ride much less painful\"\". As far as my advice to younger women starting out...\"\"These days being a musician encompasses so much more than just making music. You have to wear many hats. You have to be willing to be very creative in a climate where music is the least common denominator, and personas, hype, and twittering are valued more. I would also say that ownership in this day and age is of utmost importance. Owning rights to masters, publishing, merch, tours, etc. is the only way you'll make money as an artist. It is like the holy grail for people who want to do this for a living\"\". \" I saw Amadeus at age 6 and decided playing piano was what I wanted to do. I was fascinated that he could play backwards, and so I made it my goal to play backwards like him. I ended up becoming so passionate about piano that my parents never had to force me to play, I just wanted to. Years later I went to Berklee college of music to study full-time and have never really looked back since. - Instruments: The Ben Taylor Band, and Family of the Year - Years playing: vocals, guitar, bass Joe Keefe and I share lead vocals. On stage, I play guitar and sometimes bass. Our studio life is rather mad (in a good way...). We write predominantly as we record, so most of the time, Joe and I are engineering and producing while we all play, write, and record at once. Sometimes Joe and I bring things to the table that we have recorded independently, seeing as we both work well just being on our own in the studio. On the business side of things, Christina and I are very active on the internet/social networking front. It is a huge part of our band's philosophy to create personal relationships with our fans and stay up to date and available to everyone. She and I also hold down the merchandise duties for the band. I am currently armed with a fender telecaster, a vox AC15 amplifier, a catastrophe of cables, a sennheiser microphone, and I mooch off of my band mates for the use of a bass and some pedals. \"Absolutely. Some are good differences, some are sort of a drag... for instance, any time I have ever walked into a music store (maybe excluding the one in my home town where there are some very dear people!), even if I make it clear that I know what I want, the sales guys will almost always direct their sales pitch at my boyfriend, or if I am alone, will talk to me like a total amateur. And don't get me wrong, I don't know anything extraordinary, but sometimes its painfully obvious that they assume I a) don't really play seriously, or b) just have no idea what i'm doing. But that said, what the hell? Pick your battles. On the good side, there are ways that being a woman is really helpful, like in our band, we sort of figured out that it is more efficient after shows for the girls to go straight to the merch table to meet and talk with fans, while the guys load out the gear. It seems to be easier for people to approach a couple gals than a bunch of guys, and we're generally better at the pr side of the business. \" Yes and no... In this crazy time, when the industry has been turned upside down and put into a blender, I think that men and women have a very different sense of what they can do on their own than they did, say, 20 years ago. There's a lot of power in being able to write your own songs, retain all ownership of them in terms of publishing and masters, and for some people, being able to record yourself. I think its a big deal for women especially to feel like they can be a part of the musical beast without the help of a big authoritative man pulling all the strings. Though that definitely still happens. \"Make something you really believe in. Be honest. \" My uncle is a great guitar player/songwriter and started teaching me when I was a kid, so I guess the desire stemmed from watching him, and of course, the early obsession with Jimi Hendrix.. - Instruments: 6- Zookeeper's Wife, Feyerabend, Aromatic, Casper & the Cookies, supercluster, Let's Bolt - Years playing: Bass, vocals, guitar, keys, drums I have a very active role in the Cookies. I am one of the primary songwriters, and I do a lot of management/tour management. I deal with all financial aspects. My husband and I started this band together in 1999, and it is a true partnership for us. I have also helped produce and engineer all of our albums. 1982 Gibson Grabber bass, 1976 Fender Musicmaster bass with original contact paper artwork by Bill Doss, MicroKorg keyboard, Gretsch Corvette guitar, Ampeg 450 bass amp, SWR Megoliath 810 cabinet. I play on Sonor drums, but they belong to someone else. I also have a Harmony guitar my parents bought from the Sears catalog, and a Norma bass from the '60s. \"YES!!!! There are pros and cons to being a woman in music. There are so many sterotypes that I struggled with early on: women can't play as well as men, they don't understand YES!!!!People (men AND women) often assume I'm not in the band or that I'm the merch girl. Then, there's this stereotype that women can't play as well as men, and they don't know about gear or technical issues. It seems that you need to look and act a certain way, etc. Sometimes I've been belittled. As I've gotten to be a stronger musician over the years, I get more compliments. The compliments are nice, but I think there are many folks who are stll surprised to see competent female musicians. And there are a lot out there. If I was a man, I think It wouldn't come as such a surprise to see my stage antics and balls-to-the wall moments. I do think things are changing, but equality is a long way off. It just makes me want to do it even more!!! \" Yes, though I see many more similarities. I am fortunate enough to play in one band with a woman 15 years my elder, and another with a woman who is 15 years younger than me! The older female musicians I've known seem to be a little more laid back. They aren't as concerned if a man helps out with things. There's a different kind of confidence. Younger women often seem to be a little more aggresive, not necessarily musically, but to prove their worth as good musicians. I definitely fall somewhere in the middle. My age is a good one to be in rock and roll. \"I can't think of any specific advice I've been given in the past, though I'm sure there was some. My advice would be to not let your gender overly define you, but you also shouldnt try to squelch what is naturally there. There are a million obstac, but ultimately, the music is the reason for doing what you do. Be strong, be secure, have fun. Ps. Sorry for any typos. I'm writing this from the back of the tour van! \" Bass was my first instrument, and It was the one I could afford at the time. Also, my friend needed a bassist. I've picked up other instruments to vary my writing style and out if necessity. Everyone in the Cookies is a multiinstrumentalist. We switch up a lot. I write the songs, and sometimes play solo. In the studio I usually have a clear Idea of what Id like it to sound like, and make sure I am working with producers/recording engineers who I trust. Marketing decisions are hard, I get a lot of Help from my Label, and Booking Agent. I dont have much on my own, I usually travel with an acoustic guitar and use a DI at the club. I will sometimes use pre recorded beats to play along with, or play Piano. I definately think there is a difference. It takes a lot of focus, or denial to try and trancend it, or look past it. When I first started touring when I was living in Chicago, I had some run ins with some sound people, who happened to be men, who would roll their eyes and say \"let me guess, an acoustic giutar and a mic?\" And at imes it seems like being womenly Yes. It seems like instaed of sort of \"fititng in with the dudes\" women are becoming more comfortable with beong women, although there is still a strong stereotype there. Well, it sounds corny, but \"stay true to yourself\", was the best advice I ever got. Being a musician, touring, making records can suck you into this other dimention, this smaller world. Its important to stay well rounded. I wanted to be like Jimmie Rodgers. - Instruments: just Mountain Man! I have also sung in The Wailing Wall and with Trevor Wilson - Years playing: vocals \"Molly, Alexandra and I run the band as a group, though often I take the manager role, molly handles the money, and alex is excellent with making decisions about how the recordings sound. business and marketing decisions usually go through the person who reads the email first, and then we ask our other members. \" a guitar, and our three voices. We usually do not use mics. \"As a female musician, I often feel like I am going into an industry completely dominated by men. We have been assembling the team of people we are going to be working with (agents, PR, managers etc.) and nearly all of the humans who have contacted us are male. As a woman who is in an all female band, I believe we are able to touch on subjects that just are not experienced by men as often. Most of our songs are about the possiblities of mother hood, female sexual frustration and our own personal experiences of finding our feminism through experiences. This is not to say that our songs have a strictly feminist agenda, it is just that our music is a product of our lives. \" How could you not. On tour we usually listen to Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell, Vashti Bunyan and other female musicians who have influenced us. I feel these women paved the way for us. Not to say we only listen to women on the road. Foreigner played on a lot of late night drives. Most of the friends who have given us advice have been men, and they usually say, continue onward and protect yourself. My advice would be: listen to your intuition, actually. Do not back down from what you believe in and do not feel pressure. Women feel easily pressured, one of the gifts I have been given is to be in a band with women who stand in their ideals. And if things get bad, start getting loud. I was born with it, and it is what I understand the most. - Instruments: 5: Humblebums, Liquid Stereo Project, Mud Luscious & the Blood, The Coveters, & Suzanna Choffel - Years playing: voice/guitar I am the sole songwriter of the band, though I have had some help from my bassist with co-writing recently. I am the band leader, and have to direct everything in my business and with my band because basically it is \"Suzanna Choffel\", though my band members all contribute a lot to the creative process of the songs and how they morph and change on stage. I have a manager, but it really is up to me to drive the train. Creamy Yellow Epiphone Wildcat Electric Guitar, Tweed Peavey Classic 30 remod with vintage tubes, Carbon Copy delay pedal, Supa Trem tremolo pedal, EV ND/367 vocal microphone Of course there is a difference, just as there is a difference in any field of work. I think women approach music quite differently than men because we think and feel and process things quite differently from men. But that's just the creative process, which is a personal and unique experience for anybody. In the business-functioning part of music, I think women may get coddled a bit more than men. I think sometimes people notice your appearance first and then your music because as woman, we are constantly being physically scrutinized and judged. We have always been objects of beauty. But that happens every second of every day in any field of work. You just have to get past it and put your work out there for people to take in and know that if it's good enough people will notice that and not just your ass or your legs. One thing that strikes me lately as I get ready for a performance is just how much more time it takes for a female performer to get ready for a show than a male. Seriously, I know there are some male performers who do groom themselves a lot before a show, but they're few and far between, whereas most female performers I know put on the makeup, the whole nine yards of an outfit, fix their hair, and just look good! I think the pressure is different for women to look better or prettier or just more \"done up\" on stage than a man. (And some of it is just conditioned grooming-we just want to look good). This week's SXSW Fest was a perfect example- I saw so many dudes on stage in t-shirts and jeans and tennis shoes and so many hot chicks with awesome outfits/dresses/boots and hair, great makeup, etc. It's just funny that's all. It takes me 10 times as long to get ready for a show than most of my men musician friends. Honestly, I feel like I perform better when I feel sexy, beautiful and confident about how I look. Definitely. A lot of it has to do with the changing nature of the music business. I think there are differences between generations of men musicians too in this regard. I think women musicians these days have it a bit easier than women musicians from generations past simply because it isn't regarded as such a strange, taboo thing now for a woman to be a musician. Also it seems that there is more collaboration between female musicians these days whereas in the past I think woman were a bit more protective of their \"claim\" in the music industry, so maybe there was a bit more exclusivity in their worlds. I constantly have other female musicians reaching out to me and I reach out to others' to help each other, to advise, to collaborate. I think it's a bit more friendly now because it's one big open field where it used to be a bit more divided by degrees of success. Also there are just more female musicians now to reach out to, whereas in years past it was such a male-run thing, it seemed like maybe you were just surrounded by male musicians, businessmen, etc. I've received lots of love and advice and reassurance from many female musicians in my life. We have to keep nudging each other to keep our heads up. Women have shared their experiences with me on lots of different things inside this crazy business. I would basically say to any woman musician just starting out, don't let your male buddies have too much sway or control over you, because at the end of the day you are a different animal and need to do things your own way. Keep doing what you do the strongest and best way you know how and if you put your best foot forward and stay positive, good things will happen. \"I sang from an early age because it came naturally and I loved it. It was very innate. Guitar was something i gravitated to as a teenager in the 90s when the female singer-songwriter trend hit hard with Sheryl Crow, Sara McLaughlin, Jewel, etc etc. I already played piano and wrote many songs on my Casio keyboard, but I wanted to rock it standing up with a guitar strapped to me. Plus I got into Bob Marley and wanted to make those funky, percussive sounds that he and Peter Tosh played on the guitar. It was easy to sit in bed all day writing songs on guitar and learning others' songs, whereas with the keyboard/piano I usually had to be in a different room. I liked the intimacy the guitar offered me. And I just enjoy hitting strings.\" - Instruments: Asylum Street Spankers, Jubilettes, Speakeasies - vocals, guitar, tenor banjo, ukulele, musical saw \"I am one of two founding members still with the band. Our revolving cast of characters that characterized the early years has kind of stuck with us, and every year we usually see at least one member change. For the first few years I was in charge of everything; booking, coordinating everyone's calendar, all the administrative duties of a grassroots band without management. In 1998, we hired a manager; a man who would become my husband two years later. Since then we've also worked with several booking agents, so I'm no longer very involved in things like booking shows. Three years ago we hired a tour manager, rescuing me from those duties as well. For years I would walk off stage straight to our merch table to sell CDs and t-shirts, and then would have to settle up with the venue, check into the hotel, consult my itinerary for the next day's schedule, and then make sure everyone knew what time we were leaving the next day. These days I make most administrative decisions along with my co-founder and my husband/manager. I guess I could be considered the band's musical director, and I produced and mixed our last record. While my co-founder shares with me the title of bandleader, his approach is a little more hands-off, and the rest of the band would describe me as their \"\"boss\"\".\" all acoustic - 1960s Gibson six-string, Martin ukulele, Vega tenor banjo, Charlie Blacklock musical saw, 100 year old handmade tenor \"parlor\" guitar \"I guess it's the same with most careers; women bear children, are largely responsible for child-rearing, and have to find a way to make their careers coexist alongside having a family.I have three children, and have had to tour into my ninth month of pregnancy, as well as taking an infant on the road with me until he was weaned from the breast. Obviously, these are things a male musician would never have to worry about. Some people are truly shocked to discover that I have a job that takes me away from my children 150 days a year. I know male musicians with families, and I doubt they get the same reaction; people might assume they miss their children or their spouse when they're gone, but people tend to view a mother's separation from her children as unnatural. For me, it's a good trade off. I'm home more than I'm gone, and when I'm home I'm basically a stay at home mom. I do miss out on some things; first words, first steps, first day of school. But I probably get to spend more quality time with my kids than some women who work 8 to 5 and get to see their kids for an hour a day and on weekends. One thing that seems to happen consistently is the door person at a venue mistaking my \"\"I'm with the band.\"\" to mean that I'm someone's girlfriend, not someone actually IN the band. This usually just cracks me up. It's pretty apparent once we're on stage who's in charge.\" \"I think the women musicians who came before my generation probably encountered a lot more sexism than my lot, or the young ladies just starting out today as musicians. The music business is obviously still very male dominated, and it must have taken a lot of guts and a very strong demeanor to go into this business 50 or 60 years ago. I was born in 1970, the era of women's liberation, and never had any reason to feel inferior to men in any way. I've always been truly shocked by the (albeit rare) instances of sexism that I've encountered in life, not just in the music business, but I can't even imagine what it must have been like for some of my predecessors. I started doing this professionally when I was 24, and now 40 is just a few weeks away for me. So I've been in the business for a \"\"generation\"\", and it's funny because I encounter a lot of young women who are about the age I was when I started, who look to me now as something of a role model. For me, things haven't changed all that much since we started out. Last summer I volunteered at Girls Rock Camp, a summer program for young women with musical aspirations, and this next generation of female musicians don't seem at all deterred by the music business being a male-dominated industry. They just want to rock out! \" \"This career path basically fell into my lap. I didn't research it first to find out how I should make my way; I just figured it out as I went along. It's almost laughable to think about how green I was when I started doing this. I had natural talent, but no real skills yet; I didn't even know how to count off a song! I think the best advise for any musician starting out is to just get out there and play. Play as much as you can. Play with different musicians. Collaborate with musicians who might be coming from a different place, musically, than you are. I have learned so much from the very talented musicians I've been so blessed to have shared a stage with. There is a different set of muscles you use when you play with other people, as opposed to playing solo. You can, and should, practice alone in your living room as much as time will allow you, but playing in front of an audience is invaluable experience, so even if you don't have any gigs yet, go to an open mic to get used to performing, as opposed to simply playing. I think that it's probably best to just think of yourself as a musician, rather than a woman musician. In my mind there's really no need to make a big deal about the distinction. \" \"When the Asylum Street Spankers first formed, I didn't play any instruments. I picked up ukulele and guitar at about the same time, as I needed a way to teach our songs to a revolving door cast of substitute bass players and guitarists. As the Spankers were a side project for many of our members in those early years, we constantly had members bailing on our shows for more lucrative ones, and for some reason it fell to me, the person with the least musical skills, to find substitutes and teach them our repertoire. The guitar gave me a means to at least strum chords so that I could show the chord progressions, stops, tempo changes, etc. to new or temporary members. The ukulele was something no one else in the band played at the time; a difficult feat considering our earlier inceptions were sometimes 10 or 11 members strong. I picked up the tenor banjo and tenor guitar later to add to the rotation of rhythm instruments I could play. While I used the guitar to write songs and as a means to teach our songs to others, I didn't start playing it in the band until about halfway through our history; now I play guitar more than any other instrument. I picked up the saw about 4 years into our history. We'd had a couple of guitar players who had picked it up and played it occasionally, but they both quit the band about the same time. I spent about a year really missing it on certain tunes, until I took a stab at it and realized it was something I was actually good at. \" - Instruments: R\u00e4uberh\u00f6hle, Minipli 550, Minipli 225, Boulevard of broken dreams, deadlines 2000, Sundance, Goldstift, Prinzessin Prolo and more... - Years playing: keyboard, electronic, vocals, toys... i am the boss of the band, the studio, the production and even in my business! well, the most important thing for the live shows is a puppet theater. since i play all instruments in my songs by myself, but being not even able to play keyboard while i sing (genes!!!), i decided it's pretty clever to do a instrumental playback and dance like a crazy horse to it. and sing like a loopy stork. in the puppet theater the bear and krawallm\u00e4dchen (me) explain, how to become a popstar! so it's more of a workshop and everybody will learn something. maybe. yes, i think girls have more problems to make a monkey out of themselves. if you learn since your childhood that you have to be pretty and nice, you must be a freak to go crazy on stage... getting red and sweaty and your make up is going liquid... not very ladylike. it took me years learning that it's more fun not thinking about this crap and just have fun for myself. hm, i just hope girls got inspired by something like the riot grrrls movement (i was) and start their own riot. \"no, i never had big plans and was surprised when i found out that (some) people even liked it. so it went on and on. my advice is: just DO IT! don't wait for big record companies, booking agencies or whatever. nowadays it's so easy to put out your stuff and book shows for yourself. just use the internet and spread the word. be courageous and adventurous and you will win! play play play!!! <3\" because no one ever played the stuff i wanted... also i think girls should start learning to take over the instruments!

Yes, because people ask me if i am gay at shows because i play drums, or they assume i sing in the band. I never really thought it would be different, but it really is. Also people always assume Kitten Disaster is all women because of the name, i guess people think dudes don't like kittens or something? personally, no. I am not in the music industry and i have no intention of getting into it. music is a hobby for me, so my advice would be to stay out of the music industry unless you don't want to make any money.

My gear being my voice, is powerful one. One that speaks out how I feel when I peforme and one that gets the point across In skill wise there is no difference, however in attitude there is always a struggle. Inthe hardcore scene there is very few women picking up instruments. Girls would always be behind the scene by documenting it, setting safe spaces, feeding the bands and what have you, but when a girl starts a band is always a struggle. Guys put extra scrutiny on what you do. The worst part about that is that when they realize you're good the always seem surprised. Yes and no. A lot of phenomenal women musicians have paved the way for younger generations to be more assertive, more bold. But the spirit stays the same No and I personally wouldn't I've hat advice because I do not desire it, however I would tell them that they better be sure that music is what drive them be ause if not it is really a waste of time.

Go out play!!\" \"I've been playing the piano since I was a child, but for my 18th birthday I got a guitar and started writing songs to learn how to play it.\" - Instruments: I can't count the groups I have performed with regularly throughout my career, because there would too many. The most notable groups being: Montclair State University Symphony Orchestra, University of Rhode Island Orchestra, rock group Verbana Darvell, and my current group, Those Mockingbirds. I have also performed with Grammy winning Native American artist Joanne Shenandoah, played guest violin on Hot Rod Circuits album \"The Underground is a Dying Breed,\" and recorded with Producer/Engineer Tom Beajour founder and former editor in chief of Revolver Magazine. - Years playing: Voice, Violin, Piano I play a huge role in the band both creatively and within the management. I write my own parts to each song and co-produce the music that we record. As far as management goes, my band realized the impact of the internet on the music industry, so we created our own label for management and signed a distribution deal to Sidecho Records. This means that we essentially do all of the managerial duties ourselves, of which I am a very active in the work. My acoustic violin for recording, quartets, and symphony orchestras is a Chinese Yang and Zu copy of Guarnerius del Gesu with a Brazilian D. Chagas Bow. My stage violin is an acoustic electric Barcus Berry with a red sunburst finish. I use a cheaper synthetic fiber bow for this violin because tour instruments usually succumb to damage. For both violins I use a Kun shoulder rest, and Pirastro Vision strings. I also play a Korg Dw8000 keyboard like many of the pianists in the rock word. When playing a live show I plug both instruments in direct. I don't have a preference of microphone or amp. \"There will always be differences between a male and a female musicians simply because men and women can react to emotional situations differently, and for me music is fueled by emotion and passion. Although there is a difference in emotion between the two sexes I believe there should never be a difference in respect and influence, because men and women have equal capabilities to display intelligence and positive work ethics. I am fortunate to work with a band that considers me an equal and treats me with respect, so I am able to contribute creatively and communicate without any hinderance during practices and meetings. As much as I like to deny there is an unfairness between the sexes I have experienced it. Prior to playing with Those Mockingbirds I was surrounded by two different worlds. I performed in several symphony orchestras at the universities I attended and was treated as an equal, but I also played in several rock groups where there was a clear distinction made between the other male members of the band and I, despite the fact I was the only college trained musician. In creative situations I was considered second opinion, and in all business decisions I was simply excluded or my ideas were stolen by other members, so I left the band. After I quit they did not have the same success as when I played with them, so they were forced to all quit the music industry work construction jobs. I had decided after this experience that I did not want to surround myself with people who did not respect me simply because of my sex and found better musicians who respected talent. From this situation I realized that men who have stigmas about women hinder their goals about as much as they hinder a female's goals, because they exclude 47.5% of the workforce and statistically make it impossible to surround themselves with the most competent people for the job. Although I do feel as if it is easier to prove yourself as an equal in a musical setting because talent and skill is very obviously heard through a performance, as opposed to most other fields. For this reason I feel there is less of an inequality in the field of music between musicians. How the public foresees musicians is very different from how musicians foresee each other. I experience a difference in treatment almost every night from audience members. My first time performing at a venue I usually have some difficulty with the bouncer at the door as being admitted in as a band member, and am first greeted by the audience as if I was a groupie or girlfriend of one of my band mates. Generally I am coyly greeted after a performance by the same people apologizing for the assumption and telling me I did a fine job. I realize I should take offense to this but I do not, all that matters to me is the respect I have between my fellow musicians. Whether someone believes I am a musician or not does not change the fact that I will be playing on the stage later that night. In the end I am just glad I don't feel like I live in a world of Kabuki theatre.\" I am sure there are many differences between generations of women musicians but I was not exposed to them. I was raised in a environment that supported equality but was not exposed to the harshness of gender discrimination. I used to go to my mothers opera auditions where all the roles were gender specific so she was competing against other females for a job, and I listened to music based on talent not gender. My mother gave me the best advice I could have heard, and that is to never forget why your doing what your doing, because sometimes you may get lost in the process of making a career and forget the simple pleasures of a few notes. Advice I would give specifically to a female musician would be to never allow anyone to judge you on sex but only on talent and attitude. \"Growing up I was strongly influenced by the singers in my family, my mother was an Interlochen Arts Academy trained opera singer, and my godfather Michael Sylvester used to sing the lead tenor roles at the Metropolitan Opera House, because of them I fell in love with music, but I didn't feel comfortable singing so I went to and instrument I could sing through. I choose the violin and I demanded I get a one at the age of 3, it was about the size of a shoe box and sounded like nails on a chalk board. A few years later I decided to play the piano as well but only recently began to develop on it as a player. As I got older I began to feel more comfortable singing but this is the first band I have sung in.\" - Instruments: Several. Most notably is Celticana. - Years playing: I'm a producer. I play several instruments. In my studio, I produce film scores and still record and produce original Celtic. I make all of the decisions. I have global distribution and am an internationally recognized Celtic artist. I have a full production studio with an arsenal of equipment for both live performance and recording. Stigma and physical ability. No. Absolutely. Learn as much as you can, do as much as you can for yourself, wear as many hats as you can, keep your backstage ego in check, and learn how to produce. Be responsible to your art and be the best person you can be. Remember, you are a servant of the music and you are there for the audience. I started out on voice and guitar. I now use virtual instruments because of their production power. - Instruments: Just my own. - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Kalimba, Piano, Percussion I am lead singer and write the songs. In the studio I sing and play guitar and produce sometimes if a small project, or get a producer if there is alot of instrumentation. I make most business and marketing decisions. I have a label so I'm used to that. 1950 Gibson Accoustic guitar with Cutaway There is a difference of course because there is a difference between being a man or being a women in general. On the positive side, I think there is a connection to the audience and songwriting experience that comes quite naturally to me that has a very feminine kind of sensuality to it, so in that way there is a strong feminine side to the music I write and how I perform it. On the negative side, I have had to learn to assert myself to learn to be a good leader, which was not an obvious thing for me early on. It seemed to go against my grain, but as I got the knack of it, I found that the musicians, whether male or female enjoyed a leader who was strong and knew what I wanted. Early on, I used to experience a some male musicians who wouldn't' takievme seriously which was frustrating. That was in part because I was a woman and they were a to chauvinism, but also because I was less experienced than they were. I had low self esteem so that fed into the equation. These days, I never think about the fact that I'm a woman blocking me at all. In some ways it makes it easier to work with male musicians because there isn't a competition factor that I think male leaders sometimes run into. I guess the moment that it was made clear to me that being a woman was causing a difference in how musicians were relating to me was in a studio in Australia (which is a fairly male chauvinist oriented country) when my ideas, even though I was paying for the studio and also the songwriter, were being discarded without even any reasonable consideration. I was less experienced than the musicians so that was part of it, but I don't think they would have been as dismissing if I'd been a man. Absolutely. Young women these days have a much higher sense of entitlement to express themselves freely than they did in my generation. What comes to mind was a drummer friend telling me about how to lead a band. Because I was inexperienced and was hiring much more experienced players, I had a tendency to look to the band for support and leadership on stage which resulted in an unfocused stage presence. He pointed out that leading is like being the front horse of a charriot... you need to feel the power of the team behind you, but don't look back, and don't hesitate or ask for anything from that position because that can interrupt the whole engery flow. That's true of in life in general. Need to lead from where you stand with confidence. I started on Piano as a 5 year old, and at 13 started on guitar and never stopped mainly because it was portable and I could accompany myself singing at events, and it was fun to play. - Instruments: I am mostly a solo musician but I also sing vocals for the band Artificial Sea. In my life, I've also sung for 2 other bands: Emma La Reina and Dead Radar. - Years playing: vocals, guitar, autoharp As a solo musician, I write all my songs, provide artistic direction for the band and make all business and marketing decisions myself. One Danelectro guitar that looks like it was made from a recycled formica countertop. A non-name brand classical guitar (that I play like a regular acoustic). A strumstick with a pick-up attached.

I have no idea whether being a male musician is \"\"different\"\" but I will say that there is a lot more of them and it is hard sometimes, when touring and playing, say, ten shows in a row on rosters of three bands per night where every single member is male, not to wonder why. I try not to dwell on it, but sometimes the numbers alone DO make a difference to me. The low percentage of female fronted bands or solo artists on year-end best-of lists, or on magazine covers, sometimes makes me at least wonder WHY the gender imbalance is so skewed. As I grow older, and am planning to have kids, I started to notice how few successful female singers have families and wonder if making these kinds of sacrifices in part play a roll in reducing the number of women able to pursue music to the fullest extent that their talent and ambition could take them. In terms of moments when a difference became clear to me, I can provide this anecdote: I was recently included in a top ten list of favorite singers by the music blogger David Gutowski (Largehearted Boy). Of the nine other female singers on the list, only one had a child. Two of the singers were younger than me (I am 35) but seven were older. The one singer with a child, Kimya Dawson, is also married to a musician and they are able to tour together as a family. For me it was really an eye-opening moment. And I did wonder to myself: Do male musicians also face this same kind of choice, or are their wives at home, taking care of their kids while they're on tour...?\" The best piece of advice I ever got was from my high school friend Amanda Palmer, who is now a successful solo musician and 1/2 of the duo The Dresden Dolls. The night before I was scheduled to talk on the phone with a label that was interested in releasing my first EP, I called her to ask what I should say. And Amanda told me, unabashedly, that you really really really have to WANT it. If you aren't 100% invested in your music, then audiences and labels and industry people. etc, will sense it and, in turn, invest their faith and their resources in you. She convinced me that a half-hearted effort would only end up giving itself away, and that if I wanted to make music my life, I had to fully commit to it. I don't believe you choose the instruments you play; they choose you. That said, I do favor lighter instruments and acoustic instruments, especially when touring abroad since lugging amps gets pretty grueling and limits you in terms of travel and being able to do shows that require minimum set-up. - Instruments: Asylum Street Spankers, Jubilettes, Speakeasies - Years vocals, guitar, tenor banjo, ukulele, musical saw - Instruments: Many through the times - Years playing: upright bass I am the bandleader, mostly; I am in charge of all musical and business moves/decisions. Apart from when we are playing of course! 5/8 size Austrian upright bass from around 1870. Being a musician is a long journey, so don't give up and keep working on it through periods where you might be less active musically. And don't pay too much attention to you being a woman playing jazz, vs a male jazz musician. I started out on the piano when I was little and later on transferred to the bass. It just felt right. Like coming home. - Years playing: vocals/guitar \"I am the the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. I write my own music with the band and record all of my own music in the studio. The band works together to produce and arrange our own songs. We make decisions about the groups business/marketing collectively.\" \"Gibson SG Gibson Les Paul Marshall JCM800 50watt head Marshall Silver Jubilee 4x12 cabinet Rocktron, Boss, Dunlop effects pedals\" Yes. It's still very difficult to be taken seriously. Most people assume that your just not that good, and you have to work twice as hard to prove them wrong. People also have a hard time believing that you actually do what you say you do. I've been loading my gear out of a venue and have people assume that I'm helping my boyfriend. i see more similarities then differences... we're still more of anomaly then we should be at this point. \"I could have used some good advice. I haven't been given much. But I have learned this. Be aware of the stereo types and the preconceived notions others will carry... but don't feed into them. Celebrate yourself and your own sense of sexuality (if that's part of who you are)... but don't ever play a part in your own self exploitation. Pursue what you love even when it's hard. Extraordinary lives rarely come easily.\" \"I've always been a fan of guitar. At first I wanted to play an instrument that I could sing and play at the same time. I later became a big fan of metal and started taking my guitar playing to another level. \" - Instruments: 4: Still Life, Heidi Burger, Kiss Kiss, This Ambitious Orchestra - Years playing: Violin, vocals If I could put \"Rockstar Band Mom\" on resumes, I totally would. My job, first and foremost, is to perform. I love being on stage, and I love entertaining people. It's such a rush, and so humbling when fans know our songs and sing along at shows. Me and my bandmates try to divide up our work for the band according to people's strengths. I like to help out organzing tour itineraries and doing tour promotion. I also help sell and keep track of our merchandise, although on our last few tours we've been fortunate to have talented tour managers/merchandise sales-ladies with us, who have been a blessing in relieving some of the stress before and after shows. When we're on the road, I take my responsibilities as a bandmate and performer seriously. I do my equal share of loading in and out of venues, driving our tour vehicle (which is a full-size school bus!) and navigating. I find myself waking up my bandmates in the morning so we can get on the road on time, and I generally have to mediate disagreements when tour tempers are high. I help out with busines matters at venues as well, although Jared, our drummer, takes the lead in that area. During the writing process, Josh, the lead vocalist, and I will generally sit down and work on violin parts together. I like writing as a band, but i find that I am more productive working one-on-one. In the studio I'm like the icing on the cake. All other tracks get laid down before the violin, save for vocals and any last minute effects. We make business decisions as a unit. We may not all agree, but everyone's opinion is heard. We are all terrible business people to be honest, and if we could do nothing but play music and perform we would be the happiest kids in the world. With Kiss Kiss, I use an acoustic violin which I set up with an LR Baggs pickup. I send my signal through an LR Baggs Para Acoustic DI, and the pedals I use include a Line 6 Delay Modeler and Loop Sampler, a Holy Grail Reverb, a Boss Mega Distortion, an ARTcessories Personal Monitor, and a Peterson Strobo Stomp Tuner. I prefer to go direct to the PA for Kiss Kiss, but for other gigs I own a Fender Hot Rod Deville Combo Amp, and I have a 5-string electric Bridge violin. My professional acoustic instrument is an 1888 German violin made by Oswald Mockel. It's my baby, and is probably more valuable than my own life! \"There are marked differences between being a woman and being a man in the music industry. For the sake of brevity, I'm just going to take a look at the role I chose in the music industry, that of a woman in a touring rock band. You can't deny that there is a double standard of sorts in an industry in which an all-female band is still something of a novelty. There's no novelty to all-male bands, right? So where does this double standard stem from? In past decades it was much more difficult for women to be recognized and respected as contributing members of the musical community. In the 70's, 80's, and 90's to some degree, while the stereotype of a \"\"rockstar\"\" was a sexually charged, drug consuming, guitar-slinging Adonis with throngs of interchangeable female groupies, female musicians fought tooth and nail, working twice as hard to get their voices heard. Women like Mama Cass, Janis Joplin, Debbie Harry, Pat Benetar, and Joan Jett paved the way for female musicians today. I am happy to admit that there are many more girls in bands today than there ever have been before. Especially when you take a look at the \"\"underground,\"\" indie music scene, you frequenty see bands with at least one female member. It is still a male-dominated industry, but from my experiences, most of the tangible oppression has been overcome or left in the past. The worst I ever experience is being confused for a \"\"merch girl\"\" or girlfriend of the band during load-in, which I generally laugh off, unless I'm in a particularly combative mood. Very rarely I'll have to deal with some light harrassment from a drunk bar patron, but I don't view this as relevant to being a female musician. Drunk idiots are everywhere. To be honest, I feel that the double standard mainly resides in the minds of women. I play so many shows where girls come up to me afterwards and tell me that they wish they played an instrument. I want to shake them and yell \"\"Well, why don't you?!\"\" but I generally try to phase that sentiment in a more positive way, and inspire them through my life and my music. It's just disheartening when I see so many young girls content with being groupies to their boyfriend's bands rather than picking up an instrument, any instrument, and being rockstars themselves. There's no better time than right now to be a woman in a band, and personally there is nothing I would rather be doing with my life than making music with my band.\" I touched on this briefy in the last question, noting some trailblazing women of past generations who made it possible for the current climate of possibility to exist for me and my fellow female musicians today. Instead, I'd rather note the similarities between the generations of female musicians. No matter what, touring and promoting your own music is hard work. It takes an incredibly strong woman to survive life on the road and thrive on little more than the belief that what you're creating is valid and relevant and worthy of recognition. I don't say this to laud my own strengths, rather I feel it is worthy of mentioning because every single woman I've met who does what I do has had a huge amount of inner strength and beauty. These are powerful, ballsy women, of whom I consider myself lucky to be among the ranks. The best advice I have ever received, and what I have learned since joining Kiss Kiss, is that no one will ever care about your music and your band as much as you do. As a young band, the dream is to get on a record label, get management and a booking agent, and then you're set! Nope. You need to have your hand in everything, you need to be promoting yourself and creating opportunities for yourself, otherwise you'll get lost in the shuffle of the 40 other bands your label or manager or agent work for. If you're just starting out, get yourself out there. It's so easy to promote yourself online, if you're not sure where to begin, you probably have 5 tech-savvy friends who can help you. And most importantly, be proud of what you create. Work hard, never settle for mediocre, push yourself to be awesome, and be passionate about your work. It may be cheesy, but if you are honestly striving to be the best you can be, you will find fulfillment and success. Ladies, you've just gotta have balls! \" You would think that my parents had predestined me to be a violinist, considering how young I started playing the instrument. On the contrary, it was my little 3-year-old, hair-brained idea to pick up a violin. I was watching television when a PBS program featured violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman. I promptly informed my parents: \"\"I wanna do that too!\"\". My mother found Pat Chandler, a Suzuki violin teacher who lived within walking distance of my house, and I started violin at 4 years old. Incidentally, I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Perlman a year later, backstage after a performance. I don't remember what he played, but I do remember informing him that I was also a violinist and that someday I was going to be just as good as him. I was a precocious child. My mother almost died. I studied the Suzuki Method with Mrs. Chandler and with Linda Fiore, who is one of the premiere Suzuki instructors in the country, and had the opportunity to tour Austria, Germany, and Bermuda with Mrs. Fiore's performance group, The Dacore Performing Strings. My final teacher before college was Lee Snyder, and I consider my education with him the most formative years of my musical life, as a classical violinist anyway. I went to Manhattan School of Music, and although my degree program was a classical performance degree, these were the years that I started exploring and finding my niche in the worlds of jazz, experimental, rock and pop music. I joined my first band during my senior year, joined Kiss Kiss a few months later, and while my roots will always be in classical music, my heart has been stolen by my band and the music we create.\" - Years playing: vocals; guitar I am the singer/songwriter- leader, of the band. Marketing decisions are made by myself along with Tamara Miller (manager) and Steven at Big Hassle... along with the crew at MRI. \"Martin Guitar Fishman Loudbox amp John Pearse Strings\" \"Oh yes- in soooo many ways. From going into a music store with a friend of mine that happens to be a man and the salesperson ignores me and speak with him.... to being on stage and having the sound man treat me with a little more care and maybe a little less respect. It shows in small ways everywhere.... not to say I'm put off by it, it's just something you have to deal with as a woman. We know no other way....\" \"Yes- I find the older women are much stronger, in some ways harder. They have had to be. They have developed a tough skin because they had to break in to the scene through a very thick wall of brotherhood.\" Stick to your guns- they fire just like a mans! Always loved the acoustic guitar--- was a fan of country when I was a kid - Instruments: Abilene Philharmonic, Nashville Double Reed Ensemble, San Angelo Symphony - Years playing: oboe, English horn I am a composer. I use my project studio primarily for sequencing and manipulating digital audio. The term \"band\" really doesn't apply to what I do. It seems to presuppose a particular musical style or genre. \"I have a small project studio. computers: Mac G5 & Mac G4 & rackmount PC 2 MOTU firewire audio interfaces and 1604 mixer Mackie Controller six Glyph drives Roland D series speakers I use primarily Digital Performer, but also have Pro Tools, Logic, Waves plug-ins and a number of orchestral libraries, including the Vienna Symphonic Library. I use Finale for music notation of scores and parts.\" \"I suppose it is different. I know things are getting easier, but when I began there was an assumption out there that women don't composer. I had a teacher in graduate school who explained that if women could be great composers we would know them, but the fact there are none proved his case, according to him. I know that there are social, economic and societal issues that have prevented women from excelling in composition in the past, and that when women do achieve, history often fails to document and perpetuate the knowledge of that achievement. I remember one poignant story - composer Nancy Van de Vate had submitted a score and it had been chosen for performance by an orchestra. On the score she listed her name as \"\"N. Van de Vate.\"\" When she arrived at the hall for rehearsal she introduced herself to the conductor, who said he was pleased to meet her, but where was her husband? This was in the 1970s. The assumptions may be changing, but much of the old ways of thinking and doing still remain. \" I think younger women musicians, including composers, do not fully understand the history and so do not appreciate how different things are now than from when I was a young musician. Those were the days when a woman's only choices were limited to becoming a teacher, a nurse or a secretary. There are still orchestras that exclude women performers (for all practical purposes) and women conductors often still receive more press about what they wear than about their music. This survey seems to be very weighted toward pop music and live performance. I have tried to fit my information into your categories although they seem very narrow in their focus. I switched from alto saxophone to oboe in high school. Although I continue to perform, my instrument has very little to do with how I spend my days as a composer of music for chamber venues and historical documentaries. - Instruments: Mean Creek, Chris & Aurore, Age Rings - Years playing: guitar, vocals, harmonica My \"role\" in the band is to sing harmonies, play lead guitars, and contribute to songwriting (just like everyone else in the band). The same goes for the studio. We all have equal say as far as what decisions we make for the band. I do take a semi-lead role in managing the band/booking show, but we all contribute to these things. Fender Telecaster, Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amp, Boss + Electro-Harmonix pedals, and Hohner Blues Harps. \"I don't think there is any difference between male and female musicians. Is that a universal sentiment? Haha, I wish. There were definitely some moments where people made it very clear to me that women either don't belong in this industry, or perhaps, they havent accepted/are used to it yet. E.I.- I've walked into many clubs on tour where the club promoter/door guy/sound guy have told me where to set up the merchandise (they automatically think im the \"\"merch girl\"\"). They've also asked me whether I was \"\"with the band\"\" or \"\"in the band\"\" and when I reply \"\"IN the band\"\" they feel the need to explain what it means to be \"\"IN the band\"\"... \"\"as in, you play an instrument on the stage??\"\" I've also had an audience member come up to me and say \"\"Hey, you're a really great guitar player. I'm surprised, I didn't think you would be.\"\" Not sure if thats a male/female issue, he may just have been drunk. Anyway, I find it hard to believe that these questions/comments would've been addressed if I were male. Either way, it can be discouraging at times.. not the fact that I'm a female in the music industry and don't feel like I belong, but that people can be morons.\" I do and I dont. I like to think we've always had strong female musicians/singers, such as Joan Biaz, Janis Joplin, Kim Deal, etc. The only thing that seems to be different, is the growing number of females in current music. I think its wonderful. \"No. Rock out with your vagina out. \" \"Since I was a child, I've always had interest in music, both playing and listening. I grew up playing piano, but the music I was listening to in my room (Nirvana, The Beatles, R.E.M., etc) were all guitar-driven. So, I bought a guitar and taught myself some rock songs.\" - Years playing: banjitar, guitar, vocals, harmonica, mandolin I am one of 2 singer/songwriters in the band. We all set up shows when given the opportunity and we all promote the shows and music. My band has a full sound-board and large amps. Our drumkit is homemade. My instrument is a banjitar(6 string banjo) which I play into a microphone. Yes. People act like theyve just witnessed a fish on a bicycle when they see that I can actually play guitar pretty well. A lot of guys have tried to get me into their band because they think it will be a positive marketing gimmick to have a \"chick in the band\" I already play guitar, so it was an easy transition (the banjitar is tuned like a guitar). All my other musician friends played guitar so I thought I'd bring something unique to the table. - Years playing: I am a composer, pianist, music technologist, conductor I am the director of the Electric Monster Laptop Ensemble, from Montana State University. I am a music professor teaching a variety of courses. computer and MBox The older generation are more aware of the difficulties women faced in the male-dominated classical music field. The younger generation are less aware of the difficulties, possibly because situation is indeed getting better. But if you look at the number of active female composers, there is still a large gap between male and female numbers. My previous professors always encouraged me to be a better musician, and be myself. They did not particularly bring up the gender issue. I learned the instruments when I was a child. It was not a personal choice. - Instruments: MEN, The Ballet, Boys of Now - Years playing: guitar, vocals We are a three person collaboration and so we share responsibilities but also have individual roles. I am the art department which means I design and make the merch (screenprinting tees and letterpressing cd covers) and I also initiate performance collaborations with other artists. I play an insane flying-V esque Silvertone KISS signature guitar that Chicks on Speed's Melissa Logan picked out with Tina Weymouth! I play through a Fender Ultra Chorus and sometimes a digital Marshall stack. I use a bunch a pedals--an octave shifter for playing bass lines in some songs live, an analog delay pedal and a RAT! \"Totally. Name one female producer. One! Because of the inherent sexism and huge gender gap in the music industry we hire and collaborate with female musicians whenever we can\" \"The work that the wimmin's movement and feminism have accomplished have propelled us through to the radical activist work of riot grrrl. Now some younger women can dream and be. We love intergenerational collaboration!\" \"I learn so much from my bandmate JD Samson on a daily basis. Her experiences in Le Tigre have given us an incredible base to work from. Advice to young women: Follow your intuition and play how you want to play. \" I first started off on violin, moved to bass guitar to express myself and write songs, and then onto guitar, inspired by more strings and possibilities of tone and texture. - Instruments: Collaborations with El Grupo, Elizabeth Mitchell, Martha Siegel - Years playing: guitar, vocals, charango and light percussion, I am the leader in all I do except when I contribute or collaborate with others. Then depending on the situation the Sound Engineer (at times my son) is the one that makes final decisions. For business decisions I rely on my rep. and my distributor \"I did it already My new Takamine Guitar with its own amp etc. is being repaired broken by Delta Airlines in my last trip to Detroit \" Many times. Man are usually the ones that have hired me or make the business offers and held the power. Today, women are more forward, know how to hold their own ground and know how to make decisions and push when necessary. I received a good advice: remember that you are the one that has the microphone and can speak and sing through it. That means LOTS OF POWER. Sing/speak about what you want and what you don't like and praise anyone that deserves it. I learned it from my father and then from folk musicians in Argentina - Instruments: I perfrom with a different company every month. Metropolitan Opera, Royal Opera House Covent Garden, Chicago Lyric Opera, San Francisco Opera, Theatre Des Champs Elysees, Teato Real de Madrid, Glyndebourne, Theater an der Wien, Netherlands Opera - Years playing: voice I have the most active role in music-making in the stuio and the artistic expression of who I am in any role, performance, or recording that I do, but also in basically everything I do that involves business decisions with my career. My gear is my own body- probably the highest maintenance gear in the business! no repair shop for my gear! I was never aware of any difference. I have always gone forth in life giving my all in the name of music, and no one has ever told me that I can't do what I love because I'm a girl. I do understand that there can be instances where being a female is relatively new ground, but I haven't experienced this in my career at all. I think we are as strong as ever! :) girl power! I would say to any woman who asked me for advice regarding \"being a woman\" in the business, \"don't \"be a woman\"- just be the artist that you are, and give your all always.\" There's no point starting out your career with hang-ups about having to fight harder because you're a woman, and focusing on it could distract you. No one ever said you have to be a man to order to dare to dream, so be daring and dream big! I felt that of all the ways to express myself, my voice was the most truthful and powerful direct path to my artistic expression. I just fell in love with singing and the affair continues... - Instruments: I am solo. worked w/ 5+ groups over the years - Years playing: Vocals - I rap I am a solo recording artist. I lead my live band. I lead my studio sessions but DO take direction from the producers and engineers I work with, to a certain extent. (there has to be equality and mutual respect there in the first place). I make 75% (at least, used to be a larger percentage) of my biz and marketing decisions. I am an independent artist but was recently signed this year to my first worldwide recording contract. Its been interesting. I retain a lot of creative control. Because of this, I also wear many hats and don't get to just be 'the artist' I don't make music, I am more of a songwriter / vocalist. I do own an mbox 2 Mini at home with a rhode mic and Mac to record on but I prefer to record at other studios rather than my own bedroom - I'm oldschool I guess. Most definitely. I think one of the areas I feel my 'gender' impacts things the most is feedback to technical sound issues (ie. the mixing and mastering process of my album, or the sound / tech needs at a show). But when I ask my assistant - my intern - who happens to be male and has WAY less music/technical experience than I do - to be my mouthpiece and voice MY concerns to sound techs/ engineers/ producers about sound issues... THEY LISTEN TO HIM. to me thats a perfect example of how just having a penis sometimes helps w/ being respected and heard. It feels like my 20 years of sound experience (on stage and in the studio) means nothing in those settings. esp w/ sound / tech guys. I see more similarities than differences. We all wear multiple hats, and have to take on a lot of different professional roles ourselves - more than the avg male musician I think. When I tour, I'll be the ONLY woman on the tour, rolling solo, performing solo, no hype man or DJ or bandmates backing me often. Whereas the male acts on the same tour will be rolling like 4 deep, all supporting and helping each other. I find most female musicians I meet - in my field at least, Hip Hop - have to do it all themselves. So you can see why sometimes their biz or music may suffer as a result. Yes. Have a Thick-Skin (don't take everything so personal.... actually NOTHING is EVER personal). LET GO and LET GOD (i am not married to the result, but I do my due diligence w/ the process) :-D I didn't choose to rap - it chose me. I was 8-yrs-old when my brother brought home NWA, 2 Live Crew, PE, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, etc... I've been rapping ever since. It never once occured to me that white chicks from Canada don't normally become emcees. - Instruments: Too many to list - Years playing: vocals Leader in all categories with a good team of people I hire. GK vocal amp, amped JBL speaker, Roland vocal cube, several mics. There's an old prejudice on the part of male jazz players against female vocalists for vocalists being disorganized, under-informed and under-skilled musically and performance-wise; too much attention on the part of bookers is sometimes payed to looks/sexuality/personality which can work in the favor of and against some female vocalists, depending on who's booking. Both are a long-time part of my experience. There is often more influence on jazz vocal styles of R&B, gospel and pop in various singers which is often generational. There is more imitation the younger the vocalist is, due to the vocalist being farther from the point of the original creativity, whereas I was listening on the radio as a teenager to the new records of singers I still most admire all these years later. No. Making your way in the music industry is rife with unknown factors. (I have had great advice about evolving my own creativity, a completely different question.) It chose me and has chosen me the numerous times I tried to quit over the years, the most recent being 4 years ago. - Instruments: I've had long-term contracts with the Seattle Opera Young Artists Program, Utah Festival Opera, Opera Colorado, and have worked on a number of occasions with several other organizations. - Years playing: Classical soprano I am the CPO of my company. I handle all marketing and business decisions. Make-up and hair. Occasionally wigs. Costumes ranging from very simple to very elaborate. Performance gowns and clothing for less formal affairs. Being a soprano, there are at least twice as many of us as any other voice type. There are not nearly as many mezzo-sopranos, and very few truly high-quality male singers (by comparison with the number of sopranos). This makes the business exceedingly more competitive. The most successful female opera singers look like Hollywood stars. Even a video I watched recently of a mid-90s Pavarotti and Friends concert featured a rather unattractive woman in the role of Musetta in La Boheme. Today, that role is only sung by the most beautiful of sopranos. The advice I've been given is to give 'em what they want. Be thin, be a great actress, and sing as well as you can, (possibly in that order) because that's the only way you're going to stand out in the crowd. I was encouraged to take voice lessons when I was in middle school. - Instruments: just my own projects long term... but I have sat in with many friends - Years playing: vocals, piano, ukulele, accordion \"In my main project, simply called by my name, Datri Bean, I am the songwriter, band leader, and arranger. I co-produced my most recent album, Ruby (due out August 2010). I handle all business and marketing decisions, booking and promotion. In my other project- Minor Mishap Marching Band - a 25 piece renegade marching band - I am the bandleader, composer, arranger, conductor and play melodica and accordion. In this project I also handle all business aspects of the band including booking, promotion and graphic design.\" An upright piano I bought when I was twenty. A soprano Lanakai ukulele, and a small light weight Titan accordion. For gigs where no piano is available I bring a full size, weighted key, Yamaha keyboard. \"Absolutely. One of the most common comments I hear from the Minor Mishap Marching Band audience is that they are inspired to see a woman in such a powerful role. I am conducting a leading a 25 piece band of mostly men. I am composing for the group; I am making most business decisions. People love to see a woman in charge of such an ambitious musical project, mostly because it is so rare to see women in the roles of conductor, leader, and composer. (By the way, our entire low brass section is also composed of all women!)\" \"Yes. A lot of the female musicians we know from past generations, were vocalists- not instrumentalists, not writers, certainly not band leaders. Even if they could do these things, they were relegated to the role of vocalist with a pretty face, and not allowed to show their other musical abilities. For example, Charo was a really good classical guitarist- but the industry quickly took her out from behind the guitar and had her dancing instead. Very few people know her as anything but a flashy performer and pretty face. As time passes women are integrating themselves into more roles. Many more of my peers are staying behind the guitar, drum kit, bass and making their own business and creative decisions.\" Life is not a dress rehearsal. You aren't preparing for some big change or event to happen- your life and your music are not in the future. Whatever you are doing right now is what you are doing. With that in mind, do it for yourself. Try to do it in a balanced, healthy way. \"Our neighbors across the street were moving to Saudi Arabia (he was a medical doctor interested in working with underprivileged populations abroad) and they gave us their piano. I started playing on it immediately; I was 5. I remember trying to write at that age as well, though it took me quite a few more years to learn to write songs. My piano teacher taught me classical music, but I was obsessed with an old Scott Joplin record my mother had and would listen to it all the time. I feel like my music now is a quirky fusion of classical technique and a love for the earthier, sassier sounds and rhythms of early jazz. In my adult life, I picked up the ukulele, mostly due to its prevalence in the popular music of the 1920's. I find writing with the ukulele and its sweet delicate sound inspires some of my most vulnerable work. I also leads me to whistle in public. I taught myself to play the accordion within the last few years. I love Klezmer music and French chanson, and accordion is a good entrance into both genres.\" - Instruments: 100's: The Washington Chorus,Cypress Quartet, Borremeo Quartet, CIncinatti Symphony, Boston Modern Orchestra Project, etc - Years playing: composer/pianist I produce my records in conjunction with performing organizations like the Washington Chorus, or the Cypress Quartet, sometimes I manage all the fund raising and production myself, sometimes I work with groups. We receive government funds (like NEA) and private fundation funds, including university funding. I have recorded in large concert halls and sometimes Skywalker studio. I don't play in a \"band\", professional musicians play what I write. Boston Baby grand piano, pencil, paper. mac. Yes. It is much harder to be recognized, but women are actually better musicians. Seriously. Also, classical music is unique in that orchestras hold \"blind\" auditions, where the players play behind a screen. Since that was instituted about 30 years ago, American professional orchestras have reached incredible integration, both in gender and race. In fact, businesses use the classical orchestral music world as an example for a better model for hiring decisions. Unfortunately, conductors and composers (who are like management in some ways) are far less likely to be women. Yes. Fewer young women are going into classical composing, and are instead going into popular music. Those women who go into classical music and are younger than I am are more confident and less afraid of being seen as pushy. Women older than I am who are in the business have a tendency to be rewarded more for their administrative abilities than their musicianship. Practice. Practice. Practice. Wait to deal with the business until you are really good. Then get better. Make friends with other musicians who like your music. Be prepared for rejection. The jobs you don't get don't matter, only the ones you do. My parents had a piano and they both played. - Instruments: Just one - Years playing: piano/vocals Lead singer, co-producer/arranger, business-decision making inferior Helpenstill Piano(portable hell of a piano, VERY heavy) I think being a woman and having a boss-like role can be particularly challenging, luckily I'm surrounded by some very nice dudes. I'm not sure that I do, no. But I'm sure there is, and will think on it. Keep trusting your own instincts, without them you have nothing. started very young playing the greats(chopsticks/heart and soul) - Instruments: Marionettes Chorale, Strings Song & Steel, Mannes College of Music, Manhattan School of Music, Martina Arroyo Program - Years playing: Operatic Voice, Coloratura Soprano Right now, its all self marketing ~ hopefully at some point I'll attract an agent to take over that job ;) In this art form, it is definitely an advantage to be a man, just by virtue of there being less competition for men's roles. I think that the classical arts in general are wrongly perceived to be an effeminate pursuit for a man, and so less young boys & men have the courage to pursue it. Far more girls are encouraged to sing and dance as children, so far more go on to study those fields, and there is more competition for jobs. Voice type also plays a role, as higher voices are more proliferate. Generally speaking, mezzo sopranos (lower female voices) have less competition for jobs and performance opportunities than high sopranos. The one thing that is definitely changing in the opera world, especially (but not exclusively) for women, is that directors and agents cast women based on their looks and figures far more than they ever did before. They are demanding that their female leads be skinnier and prettier than ever before, in many cases, to the detriment of vocal performance. The fat lady with the horns will never be hired. In her place will be a svelte bombshell, whether or not she can sing the part. A career as a classical singer is more or less a string of temp jobs with different opera companies. If you're looking for a life of ease and instant fame and fortune, look elsewhere. Its a lot of hard work and takes many years of training to perfect. You need to master not only your vocal production through rigorous training, but the diction of the languages that you will be singing and you will need to develop an understanding of music theory. The process is very rewarding as you watch your personal progress, but it can be very stressful and seem quite hopeless at times. But overnight success stories do come after decades of quiet hard work and the payout can be huge. One great advantage that classical singers have over other singers is that as your reputation builds over time, and your career can stretch well into your 50's and 60's, and even when you've retired from the stage your career can shift to teaching and masterclasses for the next generation. I didn't choose opera, so much as my voice did. I always loved to sing, but pushing my voice in the pop, r&b or broadway belting style hurt my throat, but when I started working with a voice teacher and she showed me the operatic technique which allowed me sing the way I wanted to. Before I knew it I was winning competitions singing opera, and so I learned more about it, and grew to understand and love the art form over time. - Instruments: none-composing is solitary - Years playing: composer I run my own publishing-am president of my company, therefore I do the licensing. computer (Mac), Xerox printer, Finale Software I don't know...I'm asked this often. As a composer, I've had real success, more so than some of my colleagues who are male, so I'm not sure I can say one way or the other. yes...I think it has been affected by the generation that raised each group. I've never encountered a family member who ever said I couldn't be a freelance composer. Keep as many of your rights as you can (copyright, master recordings). Never let anyone tell you that you can't do it, whatever your art form. Always work to make the very best art and performance that you can. I started on flute, which was sitting unused in our household; then became interested in composition - Instruments: tracy bonham, wayfaring strangers - Years playing: vocals, violin, guitar, piano Boss lady violin with electric pick up. Epiphone Coronet guitar with Fender Princeton amplifier. Guild acoustic guitar, and Martin D-15 acoustic guitar. The only difference, i believe, is that women are asked to think about whether there is a difference. There are differences in generations of musicians always, for women and men. The difference with men and women artists of this generation is that there are that many more generations before them to draw influences from. I was given advice that turned into something valuable. A family member told me \"be prepared to starve\" when I said I wanted to be a singer / musician. That ended up being very good advice, and a way to breathe some rebellion into everything I did after that, rebelling against that statement. because my sister didn't want to - Instruments: 2. Meklit Hadero (solo project) and nefasha ayer (collaborative project) - Years playing: vocals and guitar. i have just started learning the kerar, a traditional ethiopian instrument. i dream of piano too. \"in my solo project, which is the main music i am working on, i set the musical tone and give the musicians the feel to work from. sometimes i write parts, other times, i play with musicians whose sensibility i feel the music needs. in the studio, i made many of my decisions in tandem with my producer eric moffat. we are a good pair. our ears hum together. in business, i work with my label to make decisions. in terms of marketing, i have been able to set the tone of the story, and the publicists are on the implementation tip. i feel lucky to have real partnership in these areas. there has been no feeling of loosing control of my image, or anything like that that many women in music might experience. perhaps that is just because i am still relatively unknown! we'll see, right?\" \"when i go to shows, i bring quite a lot of things with me. of course i take my guitar and my guitar stand. i set them up first. i have always loved the look of my guitar in its stand. it is a character on the stage. i also love the feeling of walking into a theater with a guitar. that sense of arrival, you know. i take a quarter inch cable, an extra microphone, paper to write out setlists, a clip board for the email list (with many sheets of \"\"please print clearly\"\" written out), cds to sell, a capo, a tuner, an outfit to change into in the last moments before the show begins (that transformation moment), and high heel shoes that i will almost certainly take off after the first song. \" \"i think where it becomes super clear is in the realm of instrumentalists. it's one thing to be a singer and acoustic guitar player. the world is used to seeing women like that. i find it must be much harder for the women upright bass players, drummers, trumpet players, and the like. i would love to find more women to be in my band, but it is challenging. i'm on the search for it now. women instrumentalists and improvisors - where are you? call me, ladies!!!! \" \"I cant say that i ever got particularly valuable advice about making it in the industry. but when women musicians ask what they should do when just starting out, i say two things. 1. embed yourself in a community. much will come of that. do not go the route of trying to make it alone. it's not really the point of music anyway, and you'll end up feeling the struggle of it more. 2. organize. bring people together, and you become invaluable within your community. when you dedicate yourself to a group, it can be enormously hard work, but it helps the mind to stay in the big picture. and you'll always get more than you gave. everything that has come to me in music has come from these two points! it works!\" \"i'm afraid this is not a very romantic answer. i chose the guitar because i wanted to play something quickly.... i wanted a language that i could learn right away. and i was right! i wrote my first song on the guitar only a month after my very first group class. those first few months i played three hours a day, every day. immersion. and i also grew to love the physicality of the guitar. the sensation of cradling an object made of wood. that came from a tree. but was now pressed against my body, resonating tones. i loved the sensation of fine motor control.... moving my fingers just slightly to make huge shifts in sound. the way that fingering shapes repeat along the neck of the instrument. and how the instrument gets used to you, after a while. my first guitar was an old gibson from the early 60s. a friend of mine sold it to me for $300. he bought it in a music store in the middle of nowhere america on a road trip. her name was little sister. i'm learning the kerar because of a recent trip i took to ethiopia. i was there this past december with a group of ethiopian diaspora artists of many disciplines called the arba minch collective. we traveled through the south of the country, learning about the incredible diveristy of cultures there. it is an enormously culturally rich land, you know. while in the south, we saw a master kerar player, playing by fireside in the mountaintop village of dorzey. i was nearly in tears from how beautiful it was. and in ethiopia, there is also strong tradition of great women players. women who were poets as well as accomplished musicians. women like mary armedey and asenakesh worku. and these women are not your typical conservative ladies. they are rule changers, and i like that. i aspire to that. \" - Instruments: My Band, Slingshot Dakota and with my best friend, Donna and Carly - Years playing: Keyboard, piano and vocals \"My band is just me and my boyfriend. We both make the decisions together. We write the music together and we both write lyrics. I handle the budgeting aspects; he handles booking tour. I fund the release of our records and recording costs, but in terms of music making, it is fully cooperative. For my solo music, I am in charge of everything right now! I have a music lawyer who helps me out with licensing contracts and Deep Elm helped me to digitally release my music. But I compose, record and release my own music. \" \"I am obsessed with Yamaha keyboard. I own a Yamaha p80, but I broke the keys off of it too regularly from playing it really hard on tour. For Slingshot Dakota, I play a Yamaha CP 33 Keyboard through an Ibinez Tubescreamer, a Boss Bass overdrive pedal and a delay pedal. I run these to a Morely AB switch, which goes to 3 amps. The distorted keyboard sounds come out of 3 Roland amps: 2 KC550 amps and a Roland Subwoofer. My instrumental music is recorded on the Yamaha P80 that I can no longer tour with and a Yamaha MM8 Synthesizer.\" Absolutely! This moment is made clear to me EVERY time I go on tour. It is still shocking to be one of the few women playing music when I travel, and It is always shocking to hear sexist comments of concert goers, etc, when I travel, ESPECIALLY in a punk scene. It's a little hard to notice now because I tour so much, so we know a lot of people everywhere we go, but when we do go to a new state, I notice that people will talk to Tom first. And if I say I play keyboard in the band, the usual reaction is \"great, another girl keyboard player in the band,\" until they actually see us perform and realize I have a pretty huge contribution to the band. People have also ridiculed Tom (the drummer) for making his girlfriend help him load his gear, to which he always has to yell back \"she's IN the band\". Not sure if I can explain the difference of generations of women musicians, but I can say that all of the women I meet are very strong and we have a lot of the same experiences. We are always shocked at the things some people say, and at the same time, we're always pumped to meet other female musicians. \"No one ever gave me advice, but my own advice is to do what I love and follow my heart. Once my heart tells me to quit music, I'll do it. But that will probably happen the day I die. For other women, I say, there are some ignorant people out there. It is important to have a thick skin and to do what you love. In doing what you love, you can show other women that they can play music in a band, or maybe inspire them to do something different. I grew up in a very male dominated scene, and me and my best friend Donna realized that we could play music at shows when we actually tried it out. Some people need to see other women being strong to realize they are capable of doing the same things. I guess, in all, just believe in yourself, even when it's hard. You are your own inspiration, and in working really hard and following your heart, it's inevitable that someone will see it and be affected in a positive way.\" I love the piano. I was classically trained, but I had more fun writing my own melodies. When our original guitarist for Slingshot Dakota quit, I realized I could make the piano sound like a guitar and I taught myself how to make really cool sounds come out of my keyboard. I think it is really fascinating to take an instrument that has a \"classical\" element associated with it and turn it into a punk-sounding guitar. - Instruments: my compositions have been performed at opera companies (NYC opera, American Chamber Opera Co., Lake George Opera Festival), dance companies (Dance Alloy of Pittsburgh, Arangham Dancer Theatre of India) and chamber ensembles (NeoLit Ensemble, Azure Ensemble) and have been commissioned by musicians including violinist Airi Yoshioka and trombonist Monique Buzzart\u00e9. - Years playing: classical composer/classicalsinger I am a classical composer and writer. I write the words and music to my operas, dance dramas and other works. Steinway \"L\" piano, IMAC, ProTools, Finale and other software, Genelec speakers, several externals hard drives. In classical music there is enormous discrimination against women classical composers. Even in New York City, many professional concerts will not have a single woman composer's work on their program. And, since I am one of the first women in the field of electronic music, it has been glaringly obvious to me that men across the board tend to ignore women composers as if women cannot master whatever technical knowledge is needed to use machines to make music -- even when, as in my case, I have been the instructor of these same men. The result of the discrimination against women classical composers is that few women are in tenured positions in music departments or in positions of power in the field of classical music composition generally. In classical music composition it is almost impossible to make a living as a composer; one must teach in order to live. Most importantly for the future of European classical music, I see the same thing happening to younger women as to younger men in the field of classical composition: the decreasing knowledge and attainment of classical techniques. Younger women gain untenured academic teaching jobs more easily than in the past. \"No. Although I have a doctorate in composition from Columbia University, no one ever advised me how to create a career in classical music. My advice to a women just starting out in classical composition is first of all to study the great music of the past in depth, as a performer. Secondly, to choose as a composition teacher someone whose music she likes a lot. Thirdly, to create a network of performers who like playing her music, and be in touch with them often to offer them new pieces. \" From the age of 5 I studied the piano, because my parent had one. I loved playing Bach and Beethoven on the piano, and when I entered college was practicing the piano 40 hours a week, intending to be a professional pianist. In college while studying classical composition I took singing lessons because I wanted to write better of the voice. I found that the voice was my true instrument, and quickly became, as a perfomer, a professional opera singer, singing solo roles with opera companies in the U.S., and Italy. - Instruments: Only God-Des & She - Years playing: I am a rapper & drummer I am co-founder of God-Des & She and G & S Records. SHE and I share in all major business decisions and also share in creating and marketing our music. Because we are different in so many ways, we have had to create our own path and make something out of nothing. The major labels have been scared of us even when they love our music. We are female's, white, queer, and don't look like mainstream pop/rap females. And, our sound crosses genre's and can't be put into a box. But we have made it work and continue to grow and flourish. Our last record was produced by Brian Hargroove of Public Enemy and charted on the CMJ hip-hop charts. We have made a living solely from our music for the past four years and continue to play around 80 to 100 gigs a year. We also make much of our income from our merchandise. We created Happy Deals which give our fans a discount on our merch. We sell 2 CD's & a Shirt for $35, 2 Cd's $ 2 Shirts for $50 and so on. It saves our fans money by buying multiple items and gets more product out of the door. We also always stay after our shows and sign and take pictures with every single person that wants one whether they buy something or not. There have been times we have had to stay for 3 and 4 hours after a show to take pictures with everyone and give them their moment to connect with us. Ha-ha, our gear is REALLY simple. We bring a CD and the venue's provide our microphone's, monitors, and a PA system I think the experience is totally different but so is living life as a woman. We have to prove ourselves more and are expected to look a certain way. Male rappers especially are not always the most attractive or fit people. But the females are expected to be extremely sexy and use their bodies to sell their music. I remember living in Chicago in 1996 and I went to a record store to buy some vinyl. I was talking with a male DJ in the store and I told him I was a rapper. He looked at me and laughed and said \"Rap music is a man's game and unless you look like Lil Kim sweetie, you will never make it.\" I laughed back at him and said \"you'll see.\" Of course I felt a little frustrated but that fueled me even more to prove that I could be successful staying true to who I was. I see a difference more in the mainstream. Years ago, women musicians were still expected to be pretty like the Supremes, but now talent is a far second to image. The Supremes were great musicians and happened to be pretty. But many of our current female pop stars are not great or even good singers. The industry turns them into a product and sells who they are much more then how their music is. Anyone can sing with auto-tune and have a famous writer write their songs. If you are TOTALLY nuts, stubborn, and know music is the only thing in the world you can do, then this business is for you. If are not, then this business is not for you. Sadly it is no longer about just creating great music, it is called the music business for a reason. This is a business! And if you can't sell, then you won't be put on the shelves. I love rhythm. I thought playing the drums as a little girl was super cool. I was one of the few female percussionists in my school. I was the section leader as a sophomore in our drum line for marching band. And eventually I started playing drums with a couple different punk bands in high school. I loved playing but I hated being the girl in the back with all male fronted bands. I really wanted to have more of a voice and verbally express my story. I always loved hip-hop but was scared to try to be a rapper. I thought everyone would make fun of me for being a tomboy and trying to do something that was hyper masculine. I was also worried about appropriating black culture. However, hip-hop at it's core, is about having a voice and telling a story that needs to be told. Even though I am not African American, I am an openly gay female and knew that my community needed a major voice. We were invisible in so many ways and I wanted to change that. I wanted to be the first openly gay rapper that \"made it\" in the mainstream. - Instruments: Either solo acoustic or with a backing band under the name \"Cynthia G. Mason\" - Years playing: voice and acoustic guitar \"I've mostly been the primary songwriter for lyrics, vocals, and my guitar part. My musical collaborators would come up with the rest of the instrumentation. On my self-titled album, the producer had other musicians come into the studio to improvise on my voice/guitar part. On \"\"Quitter's Claim,\"\" my musical partner Larry Brown came up with his guitar part, to play along with my vocals/guitar. We recorded most of that one live into a four-track. I made the business/marketing decisions on my earlier recordings and Dan from the High Two label made the business/marketing decisions for \"\"Quitter's Claim.\"\" \" Martin acoustic guitar with Sunrise pick-up. I think it is so much better for women now. Young girls are forming bands and being introduced to the mechanics of making pop music at a younger age. When I was in high school, I was one of the only girls playing in a band, and I didn't know anyone else who played electric guitar. I liked being \"one of the guys,\" but it was sometimes lonely. There was also more pressure for the women in bands to be attractive, to be the lead vocalist, to be the token whatever. In the nineties, it seemed like every indie rock band wanted a girl to play the bass, even if she sucked. These days, it seems that there are more women who are in bands who can play their instruments, and if they can't play all that well, they are not afraid to be punk rock about it and take risks onstage. However, I still think there is more pressure for women musicians to be attractive and flaunt their sexuality as part of their act. \"See above. \" I got a lot of encouragement along the way from friends and the local music community. I wish I had gotten more advice, though. The music business is brutal. Showcasing for labels is brutal. Schmoozing is brutal, and I'm not good at it. My advice is that it takes a lot of determination as well as a whole lot of luck to do well. So, practice, play shows, \"network\", etc. I think networking is probably the most important thing if you want to make your way through the music industry. Most of us have to keep our day jobs along the way, so try to find a day job you like so you're not completely miserable. Unless being miserable fuels your creativity. : ) My uncle would come in from Santa Cruz to visit the family. He would walk around the house in the morning, with his acoustic guitar, improvising the most wonderful finger-style tunes. I would wake up to his music. I couldn't take my eyes off of the guitar. My parents bought me my first classical guitar when I was seven. - Instruments: 3, The Brian Jonestown Massacre (briefly) Black Dove, White Noise Generation - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards, harmonica Singer, songwriter, performer, visionary, producer, string arranger, band leader, manager, tour manager, accountant, designer, stylist...At this point in time I make all the business and marketing decisions, and handle my online presence and social media. I am in the process of expanding my team so I can delegate more. Handling everything myself up until this point has been out of necessity...and I have to admit, choice. I play a black Gibson Elvis Presley custom shop acoustic guitar, a custom finish black ES-335 1965 hollowbody guitar, and a Keith Richards style black Telecaster guitar. My keyboard is a Kurzweil midi piano, and I use an Oberheim OB-3 Hammond organ module with it. I also play a plethora of assorted harmonicas in different keys. :-) In my opinion, one of the biggest differences between male musicians and female musicians revolves around being a parent. Quite simply, guys don't have to get pregnant, carry a child to term, then nurse an infant around a recording, touring, and promotional schedule. I think this is an enormous pressure put on female musicians, and because of this pressure, a proportionally larger amount of successful women in this business either do not have kids or choose to wait. If they do have children, they certainly don't have five or six like some male rock stars have! I see there not bring as much of a difference between the 60's and 70's generation of female musicians - I think there was much more of a divide between the 50's women singers and the ones of today. In the post World War II era, many women musicians were still playing second fiddle to the male counterparts, but after the 60's liberation movement, all that changed. Women of the 60's and 70's were just as bad-ass as their male peers, the first female rock stars were born, but they still faced the same issues around child rearing that have been a reality for every woman in the modern music business. As mentioned earlier, there is this touring and promotional schedule that can be in conflict with being domestic raising a family. Theoretically, you could release albums and not tour, but many labels up until this point wanted you to tour as that was one way for them to sell records. Now that the focus isn't as much on selling albums, all that is changing, so it becomes, \"Don't go out unless there is a huge demand for what you are doing.\" Even then, is it really necessary to tour on every record? We could save a lot of greenhouse gas emissions and have a lot more babies in the process! The only reason to do anything is if you enjoy it - having children, performing or otherwise. No one is making anyone do anything anymore from where I stand, and music has gotten a lot more free, independent, and creative without the business micro managing everything. The result of more creative freedom is amazing - it's as though we're in the middle of a musical renaissance! Speaking of gender in relation to their creativity, women no longer need to prove that they are equal to men, they already are (in the western world at least). With feminism no longer being an issue, it's venture becomes simply about making great art. We have the generations before us to thank for that. I have received so much advice, but some of the best advice had to do with learning to do what was right for me. It's important to know somethings about the business so you can make educated decisions, but even then, you will have to be in touch with yourself to know when a situation feels right, when someone has your best interest at heart, or when an opportunity feels exciting or just the opposite. Very rarely do you feel good about things that turn out bad. I have felt cautious about things that ended up turning out great, but I've never felt bad about something that turned out good, does that make sense? To express subtext and mystery, and deep emotions associated with life's experience. - Instruments: Emily Rodgers Band - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, viola I make all business and marketing decisions for the band. The band works together to produce the albums. I play a telecaster with a Fender Blues Jr. amplifier Yes. I think that when listeners hear my name (rather than a non gender specific band name or pseudonym) they have a pre-conceived notion of how I will sound. Many people hear that I am a female singer-songwriter they expect a sort of caricature of a woman songwriter and are often surprised by what they hear when they actually listen to a recording or attend a show. Yes. Many women have abandoned using their real names and go with pseudonyms, whereas in the past I think that more women used their names and didn't disguise the fact that they are women and that their music is based around their lyrics and voices--a la Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, even Joan Jett. I've been told to be more confident and to not read my reviews, to write a new song every time I'm tempted to read a review (good or bad). Guitar makes the most sense for me in writing music with lyrics. - Instruments: Just me (sometimes with backing musicians) - Years playing: vocals and guitar when playing solo I mostly play solo, although sometimes I have a backing musician. I write all my own songs. In the studio (where I go in two weeks to start recording my 2nd CD) I have a producer/engineer who I chose because I trust his vision and skills and work well with him. In business or marketing decisions it's all me. \"The guitar I most frequently play is a Martin 00-18 (sunburst) that was the first instrument I saved up all my money (at the time) to buy used. I also sometimes play a Martin OM-18V or a Louden LSE II. I mostly use whatever sound gear is at the venue, but have my own not especially notable sound system (and Shure SM58 vocal microphones) for when I need to provide my own sound.\" \"There are several open mikes I occasionally play at in the Boston area in which the vast majority of the performers are men. It's primarily in those instances that I notice my gender. I do also notice that it's a lot easier to be male and in your 40s (or later) as an up-and-coming musician. Women -- even in folk -- are expected to be young, unless they're already venerable.\" Not really. I have several wonderful women who are full-time folk musicians who are my mentors; they have helped with everything from song-critique to tracking suggestions for my CD, to booking ideas -- or, in the best cases -- invited me up on stage in front of (their) big audiences to introduce my music to others. Without them I would never have had the confidence to do what I'm doing, and would be doing it much less well. My dad bought a guitar at a charity auction when I was young; it came with a \"Mel Bay Teach Yourself to Play Guitar\" book, so I did. And I was a huge folk fan at an early age, so it was an obvious instrument. (I also play about 8 other stringed instruments at this point in my life, but when I perform my own music guitar is what I play.) - Instruments: just this one - Years playing: sing and play bass Luis and I started the band together 10 years ago and have pretty much run it like a partnership. The songwriting is almost always a collaborative effort between the two of us and the rest of it is kind of tag team style. My main responsibilities revolve around the music, fan interaction, finances, merchandising, and maintaining business contacts. We have a management team, booking agent and Blackheart all working with us so a lot of what I do is make sure everyone is working together! \"I play a Gibson Thunderbird bass through a Mesa Boogie 400 head and 2x15 cabinet that I bought 8 years ago when I switched from guitar to bass. I also use a MXR Bass DI that really boosts my tone and has a nice distortion option too. My favorite live mic is a Shure Beta 58. That's pretty much it. I play rock n roll so... it's not too complicated. Although some people find a way to do it!\" \"I think there is definitely something different about playing rock music as a woman. In other genres like pop, country, or even indie rock I think people more readily accept or even desire a female front person. But rock and roll is different. It's inherently sexual and about power in a way that makes some people a little uncomfortable when it's delivered by a woman. That said, there are women who have done it before me: Joan Jett, Kathleen Hannah, Courtney Love, and Janis Joplin just to name a few. But that's the thing... there are only a few and you can't deny that. I could easily list 100 successful make rock front dudes but that's not the case for women. I've never done things the easy way and I can't help but want to rock. Sometimes I'll wear a dress and sometimes I'll wear pants but I'll always do what I want and maybe people will like it. I'm almost happy now when I walk into a venue and get stopped by the door guy asking for my credentials. It's just great when he says, \"\"Hey, no girlfriends allowed in until after soundcheck.\"\" I just smile and think, \"\"Oh, he'll see. He'll see.\"\"\" I absolutely think it's different for women of my generation. We've had some amazing women pave the way for us. I can't imagine being in this band in the 70's or even the 80's. At least I can say, \"Well she did it. I can try!\" \"When I first met Joan Jett, before we were signed to her label, I asked her about being a woman and doing this and she said to just focus on my craft and be myself. I think that's really all there is to it. It's just like anything else you want to do in life, you have do decide you're going to do it, work really hard and then go. To any young women just getting started I would impart the same advice, and remind them that it really doesn't matter what other people think if you're doing what you really believe in, as hard as that can be sometimes.\" \"Well I started off on acoustic guitar when I was going through my hippie phase in high school. I took a few lessons and tried to learn 'Scarborough Fair,' and felt pretty overwhelmed. I decided to ask Luis (Luis Cabezas, our guitar player) to help me lean some easier songs... that's when I learned about Hole, The Ramones, Nirvana, Bikini Kill, The Vaselines etc etc. After high school and my new appreciation for music Luis and I went to a weird liberal arts college (New College) and started a joke band. It wasn't long before the bass player quit I had to pick up bass and singing. I had only played rhythm guitar and sung back-up at that point. That joke band became our real band and we moved to Los Angeles to live the dream. And now I'm performing at SXSW for the fifth time!\" - Instruments: marianne dissard - Years playing: vocals I write my own lyrics. I didn't produce my first album, Joey Burns of Calexico did, but for my second, I am now the producer, and well surrounded. I do all my business and marketing decisions and manage myself. I even booked many a tour and act as my own label for North America and the rest of the world besides Europe. Now, I mostly coordinate between my different distributors and licensed labels, booking agents in Europe... i sing, i have toured in any number of combination of musicians, from solo shows with backup tracks from my laptop to a full 15 piece band. Most common setup, though, on my latest tours, have been a 5 piece: guitar/backup vocals + bass + violin + drums/piano/accordeon. \"I played a festival in New Zealand a couple of months ago where I was the only woman, aside from the better half of band Handsome Family. Things like that are not uncommon. My musicians are all men. I balk at being asked to play 'Women Festivals\"\" and other such things. I don't want to be playing in what I feel are patronizing attempts to rectify the balance between the exposure men and women get. But I am acutely aware of the disparity in chances and exposure. Before I took on the spotlight and did my own music, I was excellent at being the helper, the support to men doing music. I was content helping them achieve their goals, helping them shine. It's ingrained in me. I was raised that way. Once I learned to recognize that and moved beyond the fear of being exposed and vulnerable, I became very happy and found my strength. But, as a woman, I was raised and taught to remain in a support role. Now, I can be supportive of my musicians and collaborators but they in turn have to be fully supportive of me. \" No. It's not getting any easier. I used to direct films. It's the same there. I could say it's even worse in France, where I come from. Italy seems maddeningly worse too. Unless you're cute, young, blonde and smile a lot, you will not get any media exposure in Italy. I've seen the differences across countries, many not so between generations. Don't date at the office. I'm fairly new to singing.I had been writing lyrics for other singers for many years when a friend of mine, Joey Burns, from the band Calexico, asked if I wanted to do an album with him. I said, hell yeah! I had not sung before, but when someone like that asks you to do it, you have to go ahead and trust that he knows something about you that you yourself don't. I don't regret it. - Instruments: Solo piano, Trio, Hiromi's Sonicbloom, Stanley Clarke Trio with Lenny White, Stanley Clarke Band - Years playing: Piano I do make decisions as a leader. \"Yamaha Concert Grand Piano CFIIIS. Nord Lead 2. Nord Electro 2. Microkorg\" There are less female musicians than male musicians (all the festival artist T-shirts are Men's size). Don't think too much and just play. Man, woman, we are all human, doesn't matter. Important thing is, when you close your eyes and listen to the artist, gender, color,does not matter, only important thing is if you like what you are hearing to, if you feel something special for what you are given, so play the music you feel that you need to express, then you will be fine. My mom took me to the piano lesson and I instantly fell in love with it. - Instruments: Dayenu, The Shucks, Kitchen Couch, Krimp - Years playing: Saxophone, Bass,Guitar, Piano, Vocals, Uke, anything you put in front of me I usually play guitar and sax in my band. I am self-producing & publishing an album of solo material. I am also a sound engineer, and I work for a music licensing company called Pump Audio. I have a Cannonball Tenor Sax, Yamaha Alto Sax, Cort Custom Fretless Bass, Fender Strat, Yamaha Acoustic, HiLo Ukulele, harmonica, various keyboards. I run logic 9 on a MacBook pro with an Alesis io26 firewire 8-in interface It's most evident when shopping for equipment. The people working at music stores don't understand that a woman could possibly know more about the gear they are selling than them. If you want something done right, DO IT YOURSELF and if you don't know how, LEARN! I don't discriminate, it's what you do with it not the instrument that's important - Instruments: Just the one - Years playing: Upright bass and vocals I am primarily the bass player. I do not right songs for the band (not my strong suit) but I do help with arranging and writing the music. I write my vocal harmonies. I also do a lot of the business. I have a good head for numbers and organization so I organize tour stuff and tax info. We were an independent band for so long that we have all learned to where many hats at once. Now that we have a label and a booking agent we are still very hands on in the running of our business. I play a sunrise san clemente 1/2 size bass with a K&K Bassmax pickup through a ampeg svt 450 solid state head and an aguilar 2 12 cab. Its not the most acoustic sound you can get but it is consistent and is less prone to feedback issues than other set ups I've tried. There is a difference for sure. Not in my band but in the greater world. I find that people often suppose that I am the tour manager or merch person rather than a member of the band. Either that or they assume I sing I know there are no a lot of female upright players. Sometimes you get people talking down to you when shopping for gear and that's annoying. I think I've known that would be the case from the get go but I also think that its not as bad as it has been and people are getting used to women being in bands. I guess the only difference I've seen from personal experience is that younger women are less defensive. As I said above, you still get treated differently some times, but its not that bad. The women who came before us paved the way so that we can breeze through and so we aren't expecting people to give us a hard time. The generations before really had a lot to prove and that can show in there attitudes if not in they're playing or song writing. The only advice given to us that really made an impression is to take the worst third of the gigs you play and get rid of them. It really works. You may make less money at first but you will be less burnt out and it will extend your career. Besides that, I tell musicians just starting out to stay humble and stay determined. Don't bite off more than you can chew, i.e. don't do a national tour as your first tour. Try with just a week around your region and see how you do. Really, if you want to be successful, go to Danny Barnes website. He has spelled out the most comprehensive, smart, DIY guide to being a musician that I have seen. A girl in my high school played upright and I thought she was so cool. So, a few years later, when some friends gave me the opportunity to learn upright and join the band they were starting I jumped at the opportunity. I haven't looked back since! - Instruments: bratmobile, frumpies, lois, peechees, love or perish - Years playing: drums yes to all. various ludwig 4 piece drum sets Yes. When I started, there were fewer musicians so it was more of a freak show. Through my career as both a player and a manager of women musicians I've experienced any number of situations that simply don't come up for men. Issues of appearance, perceived competency either as players or producers etc.. I'm not quite sure. Various people have but when I started playing there was less access to example or information than there is today. My advice to women is the same as to men: work on your craft, have a point to what you are trying to say, have fun and don't take yourself too seriously. we needed a drummer so I learned. - Instruments: Ruckus - Years playing: composer I am a composer. Also a college music professor. Macbook Pro, Protools Yes, being a woman has some major differences, mostly in the attitudes of young male musicians who are very connection oriented, sometimes more than they are music oriented. In general, I think women believe in their 20's that there is no problem with sexism in music. As they get older, and particularly if they have children, they begin to see lots of sexism. Don't quit. And find out who you can work with. I chose to be a composer as it was the most creative involvement in music and felt like the right fit for me. - Instruments: 4 bands - Years playing: vocals \"I am a vocalist and a solo artist. In the studio I usually collaborate on lyrics and melodies with my two male producers. In marketing decisions I am usually involved in choosing photographer, stylists and generally decide on how I am presented as an artist.\" \"Computer,amp,speaker,monitor,mixer,microphone. Bass,synthesizer,guitar, glockenspiel, percussions, melodica.\" Yes there is a real difference between being a man a women in the music industry. All one has to do is look at the top 10 selling albums of all time and realize that there is a disproportionate amount of women artists on that list and Im not exactly sure why. Having only lived in America for seven years, I am only now finding an opportunity to explore other generations of womens music. \"My parents give me the best advice, which is to strive to do what I love and not what I have to. It's good to be where music is. Cities like New York, London, LA are musical capitals of the world and living there and being surrounded by musicians creates more opportunity,inspiration and drive. Always practicing and always playing music.\" I've been singing since I was a little girl and it is the only thing I've ever wanted to do.I moved to NYC from Ukraine to be a vocalist and a musician.I left my country seven years ago and haven't been back since,all in an effort to follow my dreams. - Instruments: 2, Circuit des Yeux and Cro Magnon - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, bass, drums, bass, tape, etc. It is a solo project, myself only. I write and compose and play all songs as well as record. I have my own mixing board, 2 amplifiers, vocals, guitar, pedals, 4 track when playing live. I also use violin, bass, drums, and other instruments for sampling when recording. I believe being a woman is much harder than being a man in music. I went on tour for a month by myself this past summer. During that time and anytime with my music, I have to be very careful about preying men. I have been sexually harassed more when in a music environment as Circuit des Yeux then any other time in my life. It is hard to decipher when opportunities in music are given to me for the sake of my music, or for alliterative motives. Both my gender and age have made making music a dangerous hobby at times, and I feel that the music business is still one facet of the world in which men and women are not treated as equal. I do not see many differences between generations of women musicians Keep your music honest, and even though there will be obstacles when pursuing music as a women, it is worth fighting for equality. I was classically trained in voice since the age of 12. In my final year of high school I fell into depression. Instead of going to school, I picked up the guitar and taught myself to play. All instruments are self taught except voice. - Instruments: The Young Heart Attack, The Prospectors Union, The Troubadour Links, Christina Martin (Current) - Years playing: Guitar, Vocals I write all the songs and am a solo-artist. I co-produced my most recent album, and in the past have worked with other producers (Darwin Smith- Austin TX, Dale Murray- Halifax NS). I am self-managed at the moment, but I work with a mentor that is funded through the goverment of Candada. As well, I hire people to help project manage, write grants, and do some administrative work. 70% of my time is spent doing administrative work for my music career at the moment. I have a booking agent (Paquinentertainment.com) however I still book 95% of Guitar- Martin 000S15 12-Fret Electric Amp Vox Pathfinder 15R Amp\" \"I believe that there are advantages and sometimes disadvantages. I think there is still an obsession with youth that can be a disadvantage to women, more so than men in the business. Depending on the record label or industry professional, there seems to be more interest in female artists that are in their early 20's and writing great songs. If you say you are 22 and people like your songs, they are even more impressed! If you say you are 30, and writing great songs, well its expected that you've at least had some life experience to contribute to the tunes. The idea being that if you catch them early, then there is a better chance you can make more money from them for longer. I don't want to bitch about it, because I have found a lot of support in the industry in Eastern Canada form both men and women, however, the question usually comes up at conferences or in label meeting rooms 'how old are you?'. That question makes me a bit irritated. Even in my early 20's I did not pursue music full-time as a career because I thought I was too old! So I kept it as a hobby. Eventually, I was too depressed and miserable to care anymore, I just had to get out and take it all on! I was inspired by great women in the business like Patti Griffin, EmmyLou Harris, Shaun Colvin, Lucinda Williams... these women are older and quite successful.... not only that they are incredible singer-songwriters who have built long-term careers for themselves. The older I get, the more I understand the importance of doing what you love, despite financial or cultural circumstances. Its challenging, but I feel lucky to be in a place in the world where I can do this. \" \" I know many great singer-songwriter musicians that are of my generation, that remind me of some of the older generations of women musicians. Perhaps there is a yearning for and therefore a return to 'the way it was'. Many of my favorite singer songwriters listen to a lot of music from the 50-70's. I can't speak for women of older generations, but I know women musicians today are working very hard to learn the business side of music, as well as the artistic side, and are succeeding in both areas. They work very hard! \" I've received lots of valuable advice. Probably the best advice that I would pass along is: Figure out WHAT YOU WANT and then MAKE A PLAN to start taking the steps to achieve it. Ajust the plan every day, work every day, and find a balance between Business and Art that works for you! I had to learn something so I could independently play my own songs. Piano seemed a bit expensive and heavy to lug around to gigs. Guitar was the obvious solution 10 years ago. - Instruments: Zion Epsicopal Church; the Maria Antonia Project (my own company); various opera workshops - Years playing: voice--mezzo-soprano I am an un-managed classical vocalist, so I make all my business decisions (send out press materials, follow up, plan concerts, write for grants, etc). My company--the Maria Antonia Project--is a sole-proprietorship. I bring in other musicians to collaborate on concerts. African-American woman, boyish build & youthful appearance (perfect for playing young men and boys on stage, which I do frequently); also have a MacBook Pro, Finale and a Roland Digital Piano for transcribing music [a research specialty of mine is operas composed by women, so I am in the process of making vocal/keyboard transcriptions of arias from some 18th-century composers] \"Growing up listening to rock and roll, I was keenly aware of the lack of role models. Most female musicians were singers, but not instrumentalists. Many traded on a very specific sort of (hetero)sexuality. When I became interested in opera, I also noticed how few roles on the stage gave women a chance to be anything other than victims of some male's shenanigans. Luckily for me, as a mezzo interested in \"\"early music\"\", I get to play men and boys (who definitely have more fun). I've also noticed that the classical world is very conservative: female singers are still called \"\"Miss\"\", not \"\"Ms\"\", for example. It may be fine to use music to advance progressive social change in folk music or rock, but that seems to be anathema to classical music. \" I am not sure. I do think that society had much more of an interest in classical music and so there were more opportunities for singers to get heard and grow over time. Certainly there was more music education in the schools 40+ years ago. I have received valuable advice from my voice teacher, from vocal coaches and others. The important thing is to keep asking questions and to keep developing one's style/voice. I've been singing since at least age 4. - Instruments: too many to name - Years playing: french horn mostly I'm just a sideman - I do some contrcting just the horns - 4 yes - I was always one of the\"first\" - started my career playing in Vegas in the 70's. There were no women in the wind section. No particular moment. Yes - the younger women who play my instrument are freer to BE women. And the younger men in the business are accustomed to seeing women in the workplace. \"Oh, yes. My advice would be to be professional always - these men are so valuable as allies that it is silly to get involved with them romantically, unless it is VERY special.\" I was so young - just liked the sound of the horn - Instruments: Salaam, Safaafir, Craig Brenner and the Crawdads, Krista Detor, West Group - Years playing: violin, viola, joza and 'oud I am the band leader for Salaam, I create all of the music. I share studio and business/marketing decisions. Most of my gear is my instruments, though I do bring a condenser mic with me, and I own a PA. My house is crammed full of musical instruments from all over the world; Hammond M3 organ, 3 drum sets (my husbands) a harp, and lots of Hand drums. I never felt different playing music and being a woman. However, many men (and some women) make a big deal out of it. When I was a classical player, I never experienced any sexism, but now that I am a freelancer and play in bands, I miss the company of other women performers, as I am often the only woman on stage. Not really. Music performance gives women confidence. If I look back through the years, I can think of many confident, competent women who were making music as a profession, both in this country and in the Middle East. I wish! I feel like I have learned everything the hard way. As a music major, all the instruction I received was for refining my performance, never about how to survive in the business of music. Luckily, I have been helped through by many musical comrades; we all learned the ropes together. My advice to a woman musician just starting out is to give it her best, practice alot, and be undeniably good; don't sell herself short, and PLEASE don't undercut the market by playing for cheap to free all the time!!! I couldn't stop talking and thinking about the violin as a kid. Lucky for me, I had the opportunity to learn starting in 2nd grade. - Instruments: \"Just Blessure Graves\" - Years playing: vocals, synth, guitar I write a majority of the lyrics and then Toby works from what I've given him to come up with the music. We collabrorate together to acheive a song that we both love. In the studio I give my opinions on how I would like my parts to sound. In terms of the business or marketing decisions both Toby and I play a role in making the decisions. We need to agree 100% before we move forward. \" Yamaha DX-17 Synth Fender Jazzmaster Guitar, its our guitarists but it took a while to get used to, because I'm small and its a bit bigger.\" Never being in a band I just figure I can do as I please and I never set limits for myself nor would I let anyone set any for me. Since Toby (my bf and bandmate) has so much experience in bands, he really sets the pole high and really urges me to strive further and further. To me if I'm going to do something I want to do it to the best of my ability so I can be proud of my work. Yes, I think women earlier paved the way for someone like me in their late 20's to be able to say to myself, \"Heck ya I can do this!\", it didn't matter if I hadn't ever sung or picked up an instrument in years, I felt comfortable stepping into this new role. Toby has given me the best advice. He has told me he believes in me. From that advice it really positioned me to belive that I am capable of anything. I've taken that and really applied it this new part of my life.. My advice to other women would be, to go for it, try everything and anything, practice, and find a way to allow what's inside you to come out through this art. \"I chose to play the synth because I like how it sounds and it is also something that I was to pick up fairly quickly. Slowly as my confidence grew my vocal abilities grew as well. I'm still learning guitar, I have little fingers and have to practice a lot but I like guitar because I think it could be helpful in performing other songs live that require an additional guitar.\" - Instruments: too embarrasing to mention - Years playing: bass - Instruments: 3: My own stuff, Voices on the Verge, and Randy Weeks' band - Years playing: vocals, guitar \"In my band I sing and play...in the studio I sing and play and make the final decisions on what other people are singing and playing. I am much more interested in making business and marketing decisions than I was when I was younger. I've learned a lot by seeing things done wrong and I know now that even if I don't know or want to know how to do everything in terms of marketing, what I do know is how I want to be presented, and represented, and whom I want to work with. It's important to find a team of people who are motivated, and hopefully by something other than money. I want to work with people who are as inspired by their jobs as I am by mine. I've noticed working with people who are fired up makes the whole train roll a lot faster.\" Gibson J200, vocal mic and D.I. \"I do think there are differences and I've noticed different differences at different times. For example, my guitar player (a man) was saying how he'd love to just hit the road alone (like I do at times) and how he would just find people's couches to sleep on. But I can't do that, because I'm a woman - I can't just take my chances on where I'll be sleeping because it might not be safe. I have to consider my physical safety on the road more than I think most men would have too. Another example is, the dynamic of several guys in a van is much different than the dynamic of several women in a van, or, as I've travelled many times, one woman and several men in a van - like any workplace, the gender ratio affects things. I have to pee more often than most men! In other ways, I've probably gotten opportunities because I am a woman. I know certain people have a real thing for women's voices, or women songwriters' lyrics - so although I'd like to think everyone who's ever bought one of my albums did so because of my unique gifts, I've probably sold some albums just because I'm a woman. Or just because my picture looks good.\" I've coached a few younger women on stage performance stuff and been totally blown away by their confidence and their willingness to put themselves out there. I think it's taken me a long time to really own what I do as a performer. So it's good to see young gals stepping up and not being afraid. \"When I first started out, I was living in Boston, and a fellow their named Geoff Bartley told me it's really important to stay connected to your friends and your community no matter how successful you get, because those people will nourish you and inspire you. When you get disconnected and isolated, your work will go downhill. I've learned that too - I didn't really have a musical community when I lived in New York, and I suffered psychologically for it. Once I realized I didn't want to write songs about my own suffering anymore if I could help it, I decided to move. Now I live in Austin and it's very community-oriented and all I have to do is roll into any local venue and see my friends play and I feel inspired. It's made a huge difference in my energy and my work. I believe in that whole if you build it they will come thing. I think because I moved somewhere where I could open my heart and feel supported, I've begun to have more success business wise too. I would tell young women just starting out to trust your gut instincts - in terms of your art and in terms of who you surround yourself with. Don't let anyone who makes you feel bad get too close. There will always be a lot of people around you with opinions. Take them into consideration if they are from people you trust, but in the end, go with your gut. Those people can only guide you, or keep you company, or point things out along the way. You're the one making the music. \" Because I could accompany myself singing with it. When I was a kid I played classical and jazz music on the clarinet, but then I got interested in singing and in writing my own lyrics. My dad had an old classical yamaha gathering dust in his attic, so he leant it to me so I could figure out how to get these songs out of my head and into the world. - Instruments: 5: Knightmare, AKA, Cheryl Hill, Zach Robbins & Rollin' Thunder, One World (R)evolution - Years playing: vocals, guitar I am the band leader, main songwriter, front person, it is basically my band from the ground up. I hire the backing musicians and basically do all the work. In the studio, I let the pro's do their job - producer produces, engineer engineers, etc. I may put some input in for the final mix as I know what I desire to hear in the final outcome and went to Full Sail University so I am very familiar with the studio environment. Plus I've recorded and self-released 6 albums. In business / marketing, so far it has been me doing this as well, but it is not my strong point. Last year I signed with a manager and I also now have a marketing person on my team as well. Taylor acoustic guitar, Jackson custom Soloist electric guitar, Daisy Rock Elite Special electric guitar, Charvel Model 2 electric guitar, MacBook for recording, several microphones, Guitar Research amplifier, Schecter electric guitar, Alesis QS8 keyboard, bongos Yes, absolutely! It's still a man's world. It's getting better for woman in music, but woman are still expected to be young and pretty and exploiting their sexuality whereas a man can get by on his talents no matter what he looks like, with the exception of perhaps pop music where it's also based on looks and not necessarily talent. The biggest moment that made this difference clear to me was when some guy (I think he was a booking agent or something) told me I needed to drop 10 pounds and dress more sexy. It's also evident if you just look at the current music industry and what the men look like verses the women, and their ages as well. It is ok for men in the industry to be over 21, but if you're a women and you're over 21, you're a has-been unless you made it before you hit 21. Yes. I think the younger women feel they have to exploit themselves sexually instead of just being kick ass at their craft. Older women are more confident in their own abilities and are secure enough in themselves to let their talents carry them. I think this is more of a cultural thing though and can be seen in all women, not just musicians. The media programs girls at a young age that their looks are the only thing that matter and will get them success. It's quite sad actually. LOL- I've received all kinds of advice, and depending on my mood, the valuable advice to take is - \"get out now and get a \"real\" job\" or \"keep plugging at it, the cream eventually rises to the top\". Unfortunately, despite coming from a pretty musical family, I was never encouraged to pursue music as a real profession. My Dad would always tell me I had a better chance of winning the lottery than I do of making it in music. So there has always been an internal battle going on inside me which totally hinders my success at times. It takes years to get over that kind of programming. The advice I will give to a woman musician starting out is: be true to yourself at all times and in all things. Keep perfecting your craft everyday, take people's advice and opinions for what they are but always remain true to yourself. There is no need to sell yourself sexually so just be yourself and let your talent shine the light. Success is a state of mind, so be the success you choose to be. It came naturally to me. I started playing music as young as 4 years old. My Mom plays piano so we always had a piano in the house and I'd bang around on it and play by ear. In grade school I played trumpet, snare drum, and alto saxophone. In 1981 I saw The Go-Go's on MTV and decided I wanted to be a rock star. I began playing drums and a year or so later joined my first band. In high school I started messing around on a friend's guitar and it felt really natural for me so I switched to guitar. My Grandmother likes to tell me I've been singing since I was in nursery school. I just really love to sing and write great songs. Music is my outlet and my little piece to be the change I wish to see in the world. - Instruments: Three. Eskimo & Sons, The Old Believers, Typhoon - Years playing: Vocals It is currently in transition... A microphone! Pro Tools for recording. Yes, I do think that there is a difference. I remember a certain moment when I was the main vocalist in my band, and we had just finished playing our set at a show. The venue staff came up to us afterwards and started discussing business such as payment and equipment. I remember so well how they blatantly ignored me and only spoke to the males in my band, as if I could not understand the concepts that they were speaking of. I feel like it takes much more to be taken seriously as a female musician than being a male musician. It's what I am most comfortable with. I've been singing since I was in grade school. Back in those days it was mostly Disney jams. - Years playing: drums/ vocals The same as everyone elses in the band, to make music we want to listen to, to practice, to inspire, create, etc. The band is a true democracy so everyone puts in equal time and energy in both the studio and in marketing the band in a DIY fashion. cheap Of course it is like everything else in life. The club owners usually think you're a groupie when you show up early to load in or go backstage to chill, people tell you after the shows \"I thought that was gonna suck bc your a girl but it didnt!\" (gee thanks), and critics describe what you were wearing at the show as opposed to what you sounded like... However it is beneficial in the fact that you get noticed immediately, well usually beneficial... Yes and no. I would like to say i work just as hard as Janis or Diana but I'm sure the barriers back then were even higher and more vast. However when the going gets tough it helps to think of the Patti Smiths and the Kathleen Hannas who helped pave the way for women artists today. \"NO! However the best advice my mother ever gave me about anything was to never quit! If it isn't difficult it usually isn't worth doing... Much love! \" for fun! - Instruments: 2: My Compass Spins (no longer) and Betty Iron Thumbs - Years playing: vocals, guitar, bass, viola, violin, piano and attempting the floppy saw As a band, we try to make decisions together, but I am typically the decision maker/co-decision maker. Same for in the studio or in business/marketing. Fender Strat electric, Taylor Acoustic/Electric It doesn't make a difference to me or my band. There are some folks out there who ask silly questions like, \"Is your boyfriend OK with you being in a band with all boys?\" (Yes, he is, and regardless I didn't need his permission.) Or \"So they write the songs and you sing them?\" (No, I am a songwriter.) Or \"I guess when you get married and start a family you will have to quit the band.\" (Not planning on it.) Or the assumption that I am sleeping with someone in the band (hell no.) A little. It seems like there are very few older women in the industry, although there are still a lot of older men. Courtney Love, Ani DiFranco, and Bjork were my idols, and they were all really gutsy women who put their whole hearts out there. The younger set of women (younger than me...late teens early 20s) seem to be shying away from that. It almost seems like music from women is getting more timid and hokey. For awhile, it seemed like we were playing on the same team as the boys, now it seems like women think need to be wearing pink chiffon with perfect hair. No one ever gave me any outright advice that was worth anything - and much of it I ignored (the whole, you should quit rock n roll and go back to classical thing.) But there are tidbits I have picked up along the way. I would tell a woman musician starting out to focus on her craft and focus less on the image. Piano: my mom made me (good thing.) Violin: my sister played it so I wanted to, too. Viola: I am 6 ft tall and Viola is easier for us lanky girls to play than violin. Guitar: I wanted boys to like me. Bass: thought it sounded cool. Vocals: Had no idea I could sing until someone asked me to sing for them a song I had written. - Instruments: three: Metropolitan Klezmer & (all-women's sextet) Isle of Klezbos, of Cybele - Years playing: drums I'm the bandleader, the producer, co-arranger, and run the business doing most of our publicity and booking, including regional and international tours for an octet and an all-women's sextet. sparkle vintage four-piece kit (two mounted toms, one floor tom, 20\"\" bass drum). One Sabian crash, one splash cymbal, one early '80s Paiste ride, Zildjian hi-hats, woodblock, cowbell. Dumbeq (hand drum) ceramic with faux parchment head Daire (frame drum) with parchment head and internal jingle rings\" \"Yes. I had talent and interest as a child and a teenager, but certain hostile adolescent boys and one lecherous male teacher almost alienated me from music. Playing a 'non-traditional' instrument for women/girls, I had to look for places to feel welcome. It made a big difference when after a full year of asking for a drumset, I opened the door the week before my bat mitzvah and saw my dad carry in a set of Ludwig drums from Manny's Music shop. My mom did not encourage me to continue drumming when I went away to college, but I was determined to bring my drumset up. Also, once I listened to a rehearsal tape for an R&B group I was playing with, and at the end the guys forgot the mic was on and all talked about me. They liked my music but seemed perplexed about how to relate to me; I never told them I heard this recording. \" I hope things are getting less boys-club. Can't really tell. I hear stories that go both ways. I run my own projects so that's not so much of an issue for me the last decade or so. Of course, chemistry is not merely a simple gender issue. I have had good and bad experiences in all-women's projects too. Mutual respect ultimately matters most. The guys and the other women in my current bands (formed in 1994 and 1998 respectively) have given me lots of great advice. One important thing is to be diligent but not let the publicity chores overtake one's musical creative practice. I'm one of the most self-taught members of my bands -- which include women who graduated Eastman, Juilliard, and Manhattan Schools of Music, as well as several men from various world & 'downtown' music backgrounds. I like to stay away from big attitudes. My education at Harvard included only one course in the music department; but I played in bands and musical theater shows every semester. So my experience is in playing and learning and keeping my ears open. I wish I had found more compatible teachers earlier in life, but my bandmates are all amazing people whom I learn from. I also compose and arrange, and am fortunate to be able to bring my creative efforts to be played and recorded by these amazing ensembles. I am grateful that we play a combination of public performance and private events, it keeps things fresh. And we have had our music licensed numerous times simply by having people in production find our recordings. Often it seems the best thing is to follow my intuition and passion, as cliche as that may sound. I was eight years old in summer camp. The choices were drums or ukulele. The drums came naturally to me. I had also studied piano & grew up with a very musical father. - Instruments: Cowbelles, Harmony Grits, Luke & the Drifters, Bill & Audrey, Audrey Auld, Crocodile Banshee - Years playing: vocal, acoustic guitar, djembe I am my own manager, booking agent, record label, publicist, graphic artist sometimes. I am in control of my career and hire people to work with me as needed. Beta 58 Sure mic, DI, Taylor guitar, Q lighting personal light system. It's only recently I am clearly understanding chauvinism in society and specifically in the music industry. I don't think it's a conscious thing on the male's part. It seems they just don't consider the female to be equal, viable or even similar to the male. It's evidenced by them not considering females in line-up selections, top ten lists, etc. Then when reminded of valid female artists they blink and think \"Oh yeah, I forgot about her/them\". I am not gay, but do prefer working with women as their energy is gentler, less competitive, less condescending, less belittling, less judgemental and more encouraging and enabling. No. \"Advice I've been given: It's who you know. When you think you've arrived, you haven't. Keep your feet on the ground. Advice I'd give: Keep faith in your music to carry you through hard times. Trust in your art when no one else is believing in you. Work hard and don't wait for anyone else to come along and do it all for you.\" I sing because I write songs and I play guitar because I wanted to be able to play my own songs, and the freedom to play solo. - Instruments: Thrust/The Peacenicks - Years playing: Guitar/bass/vox/keys acoustic electric fender squier bass\" \"Women get their ass pinched but not kissed we're not expected to really be able to play.\" 1st generation rockers had to pave the way \"Patti Smith told me to keep on truckin. I'd tell any young woman the same\" I had a toy guitar and a piano in the house - Instruments: Currently, I perform with Walking Sleep and my own project under my own name. Before that, I had a project that went by the name Calamity Magnet, I was in The Rentals, and I led the pop/punk group Lucy Loves Schroeder for 8 years. - Years playing: In Walking Sleep, I sing and play guitar. In my solo project, I sing and play guitars, piano, and keyboards. \"Walking Sleep: I sing and play guitar, and have contributed to a little writing here and there. In the studio, I sing and play acoustic guitar. On the business side, we're a partnership, so we each have equal say in what business decision the band makes. In my solo project: I get to be the control freak. :) I make all of the business decisions, do all of the writing, produce the records, play most of the instruments and do all of the singing.\" My baby is my Martin OM28 acoustic guitar, followed by my Rhodes electric keyboard. I play a few different electric guitars, including a Schecter and a Danelectro. I play through a Fender re-issue DeVille amp. I have some other random guitars and effects I use, but the ones mentioned are the ones I mainly use. I feel like there used to be a difference, but fortunately, I've seen that difference diminish more and more over the 14 years I've been playing in bands. I remember many times when my band would be loading in our gear for a show at a club. The person at the door would immediately mark my male band mates as band members, and then ask me which band I was a guest of. It was assumed that because I am a woman, I wasn't in the band. It happened so often, and it was disappointing that a lot of the time, it would be another woman making this assumption. These days, women have so much more of a presence in the music scene, that I don't think those same assumptions exist today. It's so great to be able to open up the weekly paper, look at the advertisements for upcoming shows, and seeing so many women. In the past, I think women weren't taken as seriously, because of stereotypes like the \"token hot female bass player\". These days, women are everywhere in rock music, and it's so great to see that happening! The main thing I think about is the fact that women starting out today won't have to deal with as many struggles to be taken as seriously as their male counterparts. That's an awesome thing to realize. The advice I would give to a woman musician just starting out i the same I would give to any musician just starting out, regardless of gender - stick with it. I know that sounds so simple, but it's a competitive industry that can wear you down if you let it. As long as you stay focused and true to your vision, and are enthusiastic about it, that enthusiasm will be contagious. The more you do this, the more you learn from experience. The most valuable thing I've come to learn through my experience has been to be supportive of other musicians. When you create a solid community of peers, great things can happen! My grandparents paid for piano lessons as a kid, so that's how I learned music theory and the basic piano I've retained over the years. My parents are folk musicians, and my mom taught guitar lessons to her third grade students who wanted to learn the instrument. After watching my brother sing and play guitar in his high school punk rock band, I wanted to do that, too. I stumbled upon one of the chord charts my mom used to teach her students, and taught myself basic chords. My brother saw me trying to teach myself, and showed me how to play a barre chord. With that under my belt, I could play any Ramones or Nirvana song I liked, and I was unstoppable. :) - Instruments: Mostly, I have performed in various incarnations of my own solo work, which I do under my name, Anna Rose. Usually, with myself as the frontwoman and anywhere from 2 to 4 other players in my band. I also do work as a vocalist for other composers. - Years playing: Vocals, Guitars, Piano I am a songwriter and also a performer, so within my band I wear a few different hats. My band always works on song arrangements with me, so in rehearsals it feels very collaborative, which I enjoy because my bandmates are so talented. At the same time, we are performing songs I have written, so I do find myself in a leadership position, both onstage and off. In the studio, I am usually the co-producer, so I take the lead there, as well, but am less familiar with engineering and the technicalities of recording music. It's something I would love to study more. In business and marketing, I am vocal about how I want to be portrayed as an artist, but I rely very much on the opinions of my associates for any decisions that need to be made. I am less familiar with the business side of the music industry and I think with time I will become more experienced in that arena. Basically, my setup is very simple, I primarily play my acoustic Taylor guitar and plug in through a DI box. I don't carry my own mic around, but I probably should! In the future I plan to be using more of my other guitars in my live shows, which include a National Steel, various hollow-body and solid-body electrics and other acoustics. Absolutely. Being a woman who performs live on stage, I often find that people are less concerned with my ability to play my instruments and more focused on what I choose to wear or how I do my hair and makeup. Often times, after I play a show, I get just as much commentary on my appearance as I do my songwriting and performing abilities. It's something that I see much less often with male performers. In terms of playing the guitar, I've seen it viewed as a man's instrument in most instances, so I find that being a decent guitarist gives me a certain level of respect that I wouldn't otherwise receive. I see subtle differences, but I find more similarities actually! I find female musicians to be incredibly brave and strong, in every generation. I'm very proud to be a woman, especially a woman songwriter, in this industry. \"A wonderful teacher once told me that there can never be too much good music in the world. That has always stuck with me. I don't think I necessarily have enough experience to offer advice, but I would say that patience is very important. In my own path, I have found that there's never been a \"\"big break.\"\" It's always been these seemingly small steps that end up making the most forward motion for my career. Lastly, to be a bit cliche, follow your dreams. They are what keep you alive. \" I fell in love with the guitar when I was 5 years old. I used to sleep with it in my bed. The piano is more of a recent development and I simply love to sing. I don't feel like I chose those instruments, I just feel like they are very much a part of who I am. - Years playing: vocals and percussion I pretty much do it all. I am the lead singer/songwriter. I co-produced my first album. I book shows, coordinate rehearsals and payment of the band. I create the graphics for posters, websites. My husband helps as much as he can, but his job doesn't allow as much flexibility. Myself, tambourine, guiro, shaker. Unfortunately yes and unfortunately there are many moments. A recent example is when my husband and I were in NY. He was buying a guitar. The sales clerk immediately assumed that it was his band and he was the musician and I was just the wife paying for it. He didn't really address me or take me seriously until we talked about my album and the heavy hitters on it and that I had actually written songs that he started addressing me. I bounced this off my husband as I often do to make sure I wasn't being paranoid and his response was that yes, he got the same vibe. My husband acknowledges when it happens which is why we often tag team contacts. When we see that whoever we are talking to is more receptive to a male - then he takes over the negotiations, etc. Also, I've noticed in local line-ups for festivals and such that unless it's a specific woman's concert there is always way more males listed and usually a token female. Guys also collaborate more freely with men than women. They are more willing to mentor each other. My husband says he never realized it until he met me. To be honest I haven't even thought about it. But now that you've made me think about it... I do know that the strong successful women in this town are older and work together quite a bit. I think with the younger generations you don't see it as much. Even though the internet has made it easier for people to get their music out there, it has in a sense made it more difficult to break through the masses. It's a different world in radio as well. It's harder. \"The best thing that could have happened to me was joining the Women In Music Professional Society here in Austin. A group of great woman that network from all aspects of the music business. Nancy Coplin and Rose Reyes realized the challenges for women in music and put this wonderful networking opportunity together. Through it I have booked gigs, found support, and learned so much. Whenever I've had a question or needed support Nancy and Rose have been there to help. I strongly encourage any woman to find that kind of support whether through an already existing group or through creating one of your own. After all there is strength in numbers. Get yourself educated on the music business and learn how to approach the people you need to get where you want to be. Whether it's finding venues to play or joining bands, or getting a manager. Practice! Take your self seriously and others will too.\" I've always sang since I was a little girl in musicals, open mics, for my family. I didn't decide to put my own band together until 2005. - Instruments: I've composed for Entertainment Tonight, Extra, TMZ, Ellen DeGeneres, all the \"judge\" shows, ABC College football, America's Most Wanted and countless other television shows - Years playing: Keyboards I have my own studio, make my own hours (when deadlines allow any free time), compose, orchestrate and master my own music, and make all marketing decisions. Mac and many soft synths, digital board I'm selling, some outboard gear (synths) and Kurzweil 6400 \"TOTALLY! No matter how great a player you are, and even if you're respected as such - and male musicians do respect great playing - you're always somewhat of an outsider. There's a sexual perspective that you will never be a part of, and you notice it if you're outnumbered. The best way to deal with this is to be the one in control: the one who books the gigs, or who gets them. Then they will listen to you(!). The moment I had success as a composer, was hiring other musicians and seen as capable of finding work - for them and for my business - I was held in awe. Which is not the same as acceptance, but is an improvement.\" From what I observe, female musicians are better trained than they used to be and much more a part of the fabric of the musical world. I think they are better integrated. \"HA! I WISH! I've done it all on my own, and I've been successful, but I have had the support of a terrifically talented friend. Be strategic. Ally yourself with a mentor (male or female) who can really help bring you along.\" It was in the house where I grew up. - Instruments: solo artist- my first band was called Ruby James and then i kept the name - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano \"well since i am a solo artist, i supposed i am the band leader although i don't think i'm great at it but i try.. i'm a good band leader on stage but in rehearsals and trying to get it together i'm kind of a goof.. my studio experiences have been different.. my first album, desert rose, i was quite involved with my opinions and the direction.. my new album that has just come out this month was produced by charlie sexton and he is like a mad genius and functioning in a whole other world when it comes to music.. so on this album i feel more like a part of it.. it was a magical experience working in the studio with charlie and his brother will and an incredible piano player named mike thompson.. that sort of evolved very organically over three days of us playing together and sounding amazing just after laying down the basic tracks.. but then charlie really worked his magic on it so that was an entirely different process but one that i feel very blessed to have been a part of... the business stuff is really difficult for me as i am not a natural business woman but i've had to work hard to try and learn to be .. it's a long process that still feels really challenging at times but i'm doing the best that i can with what i have to work with.. social networking used to make me very depressed.. trying to add friends and self-promote, but now i've accepted that as an independent artist, it's just what you have to do to get the word out about your art!\" my favorite guitar i have is a blonde thinline tele and i play it through a blues jr. i also have a cool martin 00 series acoustic that sounds amazing w/ slotted headstock. i have a beautiful two -toned green gretsch hollow body that's pretty sweet and very cool unique, custom made Aquila guitar that's made out of purple heart wood.. that guitar is really beautiful and sounds amazing.. i have some other toys as well but those are the main things.. and a Vox AC 30 but that doesn't get played much! well there are certainly a lot more men playing instruments than there are women.. i'm not sure why that is... i guess maybe boys want to rock at an earlier age and it's cool to think about being in a band and whatnot.. i'm not really sure on this one.. i love when you see a great woman drummer or bass player.. that's the coolest 'cause you don't see it as often as men. maybe young girls are encouraged to play lovely things like piano or violin or something... we need to get more little girls rocking out! to be fearless... you have to be wildly passionate and determined in this business otherwise good luck.. and i always say that you really have to ask yourself where your heart is at.. is this a hobby or is this your life? either is ok but it's important to be clear.. there are no real easy roads but there are many to chose from.. i think it's always important to dream and to follow your dreams.. that's the only advice i could give to anyone.. male or female.. but to a young girl especially, i would tell her .. what do they say? shoot for the moon and land on the stars? i like that.. anything is possible, if you can dream it, you can be it! i grew up playing piano but i was classicly trained and i hated playing it.. i instictively new that i needed to learn to play guitar because there would be a lot of songs waiting for me once i learned the instrument.. i started writing my first song on the guitar in my first lesson that i ever took.. that motivated me to practice about 4 hours a day until i couldn't stand the pain any longer.. i was so determined to write and start playing live right away.. my first club gig was about 6 months after i took my first guitar lesson - Years playing: vocals, keyboard, guitar My role in the band is songwriter, organiser and general manager. I take care of most of the business and marketing decisions, althought I consult the others on major decisions. I play a Hagstrom Futura 1965ish guitar and a Harmony Rocket (1957ish) and a Yamaha DJ-X Keyboard. I sing through whatever mic is available but prefer just a straight ahead sm57. I sometimes use a TC Helicon Harmony GXT vocal processor for certain effects. \"Yes. I realised very early on that as soon as people saw a girl with an acoustic guitar they didn't listen as much. That is the main reason I decided to play electric guitar and form a band. I can now enjoy playing solo, but it was a struggle to feel like I was on equal playing fields as my male peers. Now I feel like there are enough women that are breaking through and super talented to make what I do feel legitimate and feel like I am properly respected for the work I put into things. That said, there are occasions where I do still feel that I am treated as less apt at my music etc because I'm a girl. I can carry my own amp dammit! hah.\" I feel like now there are a lot of girls playing music so people understand that we can do it, and that we don't always play emo-folky stuff. Some girls can rock so hard and bring it, y'know? I feel like for people in the past it was even harder to get the credit and respect of their male counterparts. Just keep playing shows, writing songs and realising your own career! I chose guitar because when I was a kid it seemed like all the cool kids were playing it. I studied piano briefly when I was a child but didn't return to it til I was 20, the same time I started playing guitar and writing songs. - Instruments: Grant Street String Band, Phantoms of the Opry, God Ol' Persons, Blue Rose, Laurie Lewis and Grant Street, Laurie Lewis and Her Bluegrass Pals, Dick Oxtot's Golden Age Jazz Band, Laurie Lewis and the Right Hands - Years playing: vocals, fiddle, guitar, bass I am the band leader. I produce most of the recordings in the studio. I make my own business and marketing decisions, while consulting with band members and other people. fiddles, guitars, string bass. All instruments are acoustic., so I own some good mics as well. Over my long career, there have been too many moments to recount here, in many different arenas. Yes, there is a difference in the way one is perceived as a woman/musician. But it can be a very good marketing tool, as well as a drawback. In the end, it probably evens out, at least somewhat. Certainly. When my aunt was in an all-girl dance band in the 1930's and '40's, it was very difficult to be seen as anything but an gimmick. These days, women musicians are much more accepted on artistic terms. That being said, sex still does sell. Play music you love because you love to play. That way, if you never get the big break, it doesn't matter, since you are doing what you love. because I like them - Instruments: Two: Jan bell and the cheap dates. The Maybelles. - Years playing: guitar Band Leader. Principle Singer/Songwriter. Booker/Manager etc. Martin acoustic D0018 mahogany top guitar. \"During the Pro Choice Rally's in NYC in the mid 90's I grew tired of hearing women define themselves as a 'woman' artist etc. I stopped prefixing musician by 'woman/female' just because the artists are women. No one says ' And next an All male band! ' I try and keep a sense of humor about it all - sometimes I joke about producing a 'Man's Music Fest! All male bands on stage all day!\"\" Also, as a part time sound engineer the world does not automatically assume I don't know what I'm doing anymore - the way it did twenty years ago.\" Yes. The younger women seem more fearless than ever. There are so many more examples of instrumental soloists than there used to be. It used to be hard to find a woman who could play upright bass, had her own truck and wrote her own songs. Now I know quite a few women like that. A lot more women hit the road on their own without having to rely on their boyfriend, or be the only girl/ 'chick singer' . But at the same time, it seems like they are not so concerned with politics or realize how much they are reaping the benefits of women who took to the streets in the 70's, 80's 90's....perhaps we have evolved past being didactic, or having to label ourselves politically/sexually. Maybe just getting out there and doing it, and believing in yourself is what we were fighting for all along? \"Singing takes courage, and does not always come easy. Someone once told me 'Sing with your own voice'. That helped me find the way. Also - its never too late to learn was a sentiment I felt in the folk music community. I started playing guitar at 29. People often assume I learned as a kid. I think just as many American girls get guitars for their 13th birthday now, as boys do. My advice to a woman starting out, is team up with other artists, work together to support one another in actual real life. Show up to each others shows, produce events together - go beyond face book and support the small business/venues and DIY bookers who present live music.\" As a writer/songwriter made sense. Was living on the road at the time, so piano would not have made sense as primary song writing tool. - Instruments: Jonas Sees In Color is the first band I've been in. - Years playing: Piano and vocals. \"My role is to be the voice of reason among the 5 insane boys in my band. We function as a collective; I have as much of a say in our song-writing as I do in our contracts. \" I play a Nord Stage 88-key piano. It's bright red and beautiful. I think that there is often a difference in the way that women and men approach writing music. I approach songs from a viewpoint that none of my male band-mates have, and I think that's a very valuable thing. I feel the biggest social difference when we're on tour. I don't get the same immediate respect as my band-mates, often being asked by venues or promoters if I'm \"just somebody's girlfriend.\" I think a lot of other bands treat me differently as well; they see the way I interact with my band and assume that they can have the same relationship with me. They see the amount of respect I have for my band and expect the same respect without understanding that they have to earn it. It seems like there are less and less women in the spotlight who are real artists; so many popular female performers are seen as simple eye-candy that play songs written and produced by men, instead of as women who can create and think for themselves. There is more attention paid to superficial characteristics than to the real signs of talent and hard work I saw in the women that made me want to play music. The talented, real women are still out there now; they just need to be heard. Fads pass, but the authentic art will be what lasts. \"My piano teacher at home always tells me, \"\"You know what you have to do, so get it done.\"\" If a women decides to become a working musician, she has to be 100% driven and willing to fight to make it. You'll need patience and thick skin...it's hard...it's up and down, emotional highs and emotional lows. Friends, family, and your band can help support you, but in the end it's really up to you and your instrument. If you love it, do it.\" It's the instrument I relate to the most; I feel the most connected with the piano. It brings the most out of me. - Instruments: I worked under the name \"astroPuppees\" and now I go by my name: Kelley Ryan - Years playing: Vocals and Guitar and anything that I can make a nice noise with. I sort of orchestrate it all. Starting from \"the necessity to do it myself\" and graduating to \"the pleasure of doing it myself\". I may not sound exactly like what's fashionable, but I've actually come to believe that that is a GOOD thing. Luck is the residue of design I say. I have every guitar I've ever owned still with me. (12 of them). Two basses, two electric guitars, a Danelectro, an acoustic/electric Songbird, and 6 acoustic guitars. Oh, and a strum stick if that counts. I have various loop boxes and whistles and shakers and drums and little key boards and effects etc. A 24 track HD recorder in both Ireland and California so I can write and record all year long. \"You know, I'm not sure how to answer this question, because I have no idea HOW a man would go about \"\"being a musician\"\"....or for that matter...how another WOMAN would go about \"\"being a musician\"\". It's all up to THE INDIVIDUAL. But this IS a very interesting question, since my most recent CD, \"\"Twist\"\", is all about women and girls that I've known and been inspired by. I went at it from a decidedly female point of view. (I was quoted in reviews as \"\"not doing it the rock and roll boy way\"\" and I've been explaining that one for months). I didn't approach this record with any production 'rules' be they feminine OR masculine. I didn't intentionally avoid anything. It just came out with a more moody, mellow, acoustic, feminine sound which is especially appropriate for \"\"Twist\"\". The \"\"rock and roll boy way\"\" that I'm referring to is the typical...\"\"let's jam and get a groove going with the bass and drums and then we'll overdub some screaming electric guitars and THEN we'll get the vocals.\"\" My voice is not what you'd call strong. So even an acoustic guitar can drown it out if I'm not careful. I just can't belt it out over the band. So what has ended up happening, especially on \"\"Twist\"\", is that I record a simple loop or acoustic guitar and do the vocal FIRST. Then I build all the rest of the stuff around that. To me it's all about the words and the vocal. Everything else is just there to support that. So I kind of make records in-reverse of the usual method. That's not to say that I don't LIKE the \"\"rock and roll boy\"\" method. It just isn't something I usually use. I think (hope) it makes my records sound different in a good way. Of course, on this one, I co-produced it with Dixon and he always added just enough muscle and sonic juice to keep me from wallowing in a pathetic land of girlie-girl. He is a most awesome Producer and Musician be it man, woman or child style. He knows what I do, and he did everything to support the twisted path I went down with each song as the record fell into place. Iron fist...velvet glove. I can't tell you how much I respect him and admire what he does. Same goes for Marti Jones. They are over the top. And it must be said, that the two songs that Van Dyke Parks did string arrangements for are literally bookends to the \"\"Twist\"\" story. His musical, string arrangement magic definitely helped define the mood and feeling of the whole record. Guess I should have said, \"\"the rock and roll boy OR girl way\"\". I was talking much more about volume and intensity than actual GENDER.\" I'm sure women today have more freedom (and, just as importantly, more confidence) to do and say what is in their hearts and on their minds. So, yes, I think women have a better time of expressing themselves now than in the past. This is a very good road to be on. You have to DO IT FOR THE LOVE. That's really the key to fulfillment, if not success, as well. Money and fame are mostly exotic looking distractions. Although they can represent a certain amount of validation as an artist, they are also both a Pandora's Box of trouble. The best thing you can do is never lose the LOVE for what you do. Just keep feeding the muse. Head down. Get lost in your art, whatever it may be. Honestly, I like the way it feels in my arms. All instruments I use primarily as a showcase for the SONGS. I consider my self a songwriter, first and foremost, I sing and play and record only as a means to get the SONG out. The end result is I've spent most of my life making music and have totally come to LOVE THE PROCESS as much as the end result. In fact, 'loving the process', I believe makes the end result better. - Years playing: Violin, Back-up Vocals My role in the band is solely violinist and back-up vocals. It's funny because I went to school and have a degree in Music Business. I wanted to manage bands. After being on the other side of things (the performing side) I would not want to have it any other way. Luckily my degree has helped me find other jobs involving music when I'm not touring with the band. I have a Realist pick-up on my violin and I use the LR Baggs preamp. These give my violin a really warm tone. A lot of times venues don't have the greatest equipment and has made my instrument sound really tinny, so this has been a great combo. \"I think it's definitely more unique to be a woman playing a band. You just don't run across it as much. I'd say the only major difference is it's harder to load the heavy gear in and out of venues. It became clear to me on my first big tour with Cloud Cult. I remember one gig where Craig and Scott (he is one of the band's visual artists) were carrying a super heavy speaker and I was just carrying some really light merch. They looked at me like I was insane. I try to lift the heavier stuff. It's a great way to stay in shape on the road!!\" I think nowadays you see women in bands who can play a wider variety of instruments, in other words do more than just sing. For instance Ra Ra Riot, who also has two string players or local band Roma di Luna. Channy Moon Casselle is lead vocalist and plays the violin as well. Both groups are a great representation of what a talented woman can add to a band..... \"My parents played huge roles. There was a time when I stopped playing the violin for awhile and they were still so supportive of what I wanted to do with my life. They were never pushy or forced me to practice....it was never a chore. I'd tell any woman musician starting out in the music industry that patience is important. It might take awhile to get to where you want to be but it will happen. Also, that they are capable of doing anything they set their mind to. Even lifting heavy gear!! : )\" I remember the day when my elementary school brought in all of the different instruments that the kids could choose to play. Someone demonstrated the violin and it really stood out to me. The tone was so beautiful. I almost picked the flute, I think if I did I never would have had the opportunity to play in bands. I most likely would have stayed in the realm of classical music. - Instruments: 3 bands: Monterey Pop, Zambezi, Katie Gosnell duo/trio - Years playing: voice, guitar I am the band. I am the creative, business, and marketing of my music. I work full time and so most days it seems I don't get very far. I am tired. I use a Mac laptop, have Pro Tools, use Garage Band and an Edirol MP3 recorder to record. I have my own PA. I don't know much about gear actually. My brother is a guitar player and knows tons about gear, collects it... I just focus on the music. Yes. Although I'm not sure I can articulate it very well today and this is probably an important part of your survey. Sorry! I'm 33, and most of my friends who are not in music are settling down and starting families. I have an agenda with my music, and I work full-time as an office manager, trying to support myself. I don't really want to settle and do the expected things a woman does (bear children, be a wife) yet. Not sure if I want children at all. Though at the same time, I think people in my life (good people) are worried about the path I take. Will I be penniless and alone and barren? I think being a woman in music is especially tough, because there are expectations on you. I do want a man in my life. I don't want to wimp out and have him support me, but I do know that (outside of music, at least) he'll get paid more for whatever he does than what I will. Sorry, I'm off on tangents here. I see some older women musicians I know who seem scared and alone and wondering how to support themselves if their career is not doing well. They're also incredibly smart, have a confidence about them, and just as talented and beautiful as ever. I've had a lot of great mentors, many of them women. I can't think of any single one advice that did it. What I notice is that being around other women, sharing stories, validating each others' feelings of the struggles of the business, offering support and encouragement, has made the biggest difference to me. I'm not sure if men do that, the way we do. \"Voice: I began to sing as a child, when there's no such thing as logic, it just felt good to do. I forgot about it along the way. I came back to it at 23, wondering if maybe I could make music with my voice? I wanted to impress my musician (now ex-) boyfriend at the time. We broke up before I could impress him. Guitar: The original reason was probably to win the affection of the musician ex-boyfriend, with the added benefit of proving to my brother that I could play guitar too. The relationship with the guitar was on again, off again. At some point I got tired of asking guitar players to learn songs and play with me, so I decided to commit to learning. The reason I keep playing is that it gives my songs a bed to sleep on. And somewhere along the way I surmounted the first, long, painful learning curve, and have gotten to the part where I like it, it's fun, it's still very hard, and I even crave playing it sometimes. \" - Instruments: a few - Years playing: voice singing and dancing and making people happy been signing since church - Instruments: I am mainly a solo artist, but I have led the Naad-Avaaz Ensemble, the University of Alberta Indian Music Ensemble, have played in the band The Gypsies, and currently lead Amie & Sangeet Millennium aka Sangeet Millennium Ensemble - Years playing: sitar and some vocal Leader and collaborator. I (sitar, tanpura, harmonium, esraj, tabla, electronic tanpura and tabla), have condenser mic, a dat recorder, and a video camera. Yes! It's often hard to make your voice heard. Women's communication styles often differ from men's. I realized that as an instrumentalist I was usually in the company of men, often competing with them. I think the gender gap is/was greater for women of my generation (baby boomers) than for women today. It's easier for women today to navigate in traditionally male arenas. A publicist woman friend of mine told me: don't be afraid to get your work out there. This was valuable because I was always reticent about self-promotion. I had gotten too much discouraging feedback from men in the past. My advice to starting women musicians: understand what you want, mastermind your goal, and go after it. Be strong, work hard, and believe in yourself, but don't be afraid to be flexible. It cast a spell over me! - Instruments: ICE, Syracuse Symphony Orchestra, Boston Modern Orchestra Project (BMOP), American Repertory Theater, Radius Ensemble, Callithumpian Consort, Portland Symphony Orchestra - Years playing: viola It depends on the particular group. In ICE, I'm part of a players' committee that helps make artistic decisions. In the Syracuse Symphony, I'm simply a member of a section, without a non-musical role. viola (have owned since I was 16), 3 bows, various accessories, sheet music. carry in one case. No. I think it's hard for me to know, being relatively young and usually working with people close to my own age. Perhaps I've been really lucky, but I don't think it's particularly helpful to primarily define oneself as a capital-W \"Woman\" in this industry. Just play well, be nice, and get there on time, and it doesn't matter what gender you are. I started on violin and switched to viola when I was 10 because I was getting really tall--at the time, there was a greater demand for violists, and it seemed like I would be able to handle the slightly bigger and heavier instrument. As it turns out, I ended up being 5'10\", but it's also better-suited to me personally...a little lower, mellower, not as on-edge a violin violinists!!). - Instruments: 4-5/ Wench/ Nightfall/ Evolution \"Lead Guitarist\" \"Schecter strat/ Handmade Les Paul/ BC Rich Strat Randall half stack\" \"YES... there is an expectation that women can't play heavy music and/or that they have to dress in a way that might distract from whether or not they can play... it's always an image issue. I have often heard statements like \"\"wow you play like a guy\"\" There is also the tendency to look at female musicians as a novelty, this is really insulting.\" Yes... at first it appeared that women had to be singer/songwriters or folk players (in \"popular\" music). As the music became more aggressive so did the female musicians but with much less acceptance because of the aggressive nature of the music and the tendency to believe that women must be submissive/quiet/nurturing. I think that the differences between generations of women musicians could directly correlate to the growth of women and the womens movement. No one ever really gave me advice, however my mother supported me in my musical endeavors. The advice I would give to a woman starting out would be -do what you love and never think that you have to compromise. You can have a family and still play, you can have a career outside of music and still play... it doesn't have to be an \"either/or\" decision. Most of all play because it makes you HAPPY. Joan Jett - Instruments: Shift, Hole, Motley Crue, Peaches, Eagles Of Death Metal, Billy Ray Cyrus - Years playing: drums (dabble in keys, bass, guitar and vocals) \"Lately, besides being the drummer, I am usually music director, making sure the band is playing the proper parts of the songs when playing in a band. When I am in the studio, I am producer, engineer , songwriter , and sometimes singer of my own music. I score for film and tv as well. I have made it my business to know the business. I had my first record deal when I was 16, so I have seen many contracts and have seen this music businees change dramatically. 500 grand is the new million. Actually 100 grand is the new million.\" Sonor Drums, Zildian Cymbals, Roland VDRUMS, Roland Keyboards, Apple Computer, Digital Performer. \"Yes it is different because we are looked upon as second rate musicians most of the time, except for vocalists. The day I went to Sam Ash in Queens when I was 15 years old to buy drumsticks and the clerk asked me if I was buying them for my boyfriend was the day I knew it was going to be a challenge to prove myself. \" \"I do not see many up and coming female musicians these days. There are few role women role models for young girls these days. The only girls they see are usually singers, half of who are lip syncing and more concerned about dancing than singing. At least Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga can play an instrument. But female drummers as role models are few and far between. \" Just play because you love it. Not because you want to make money or become a rockstar. If you are good enough, and driven enough, surround yourself with better musicians than yourself, and have a little luck on your side to boot, then you will have a chance in this crazy business! Because I saw a Motley Crue video called \"Wildside\" Headbangers Ball on MTV back in the late 80's. I saw Tommy Lee rolling around in a drum cage playing on tour and thought.. \"That's the job for me!\" - Instruments: I have been in a bunch of bands, but my two current ones are listed above (TM and the DD Ensemble) - Years playing: I play the drums! In the ensemble, Dan makes all the administrative decisions. However, in TM all the marketing, business, and booking stuff is done primarily by Andrew and myself. The two of us literally do everything you could think of. When I play a kit it's a marroon sparkely Gretch Kit, circa 1970's. However, in TM and the Ensemble, I play a mitigated kit made of: A high hat, cymbol, floor tom, roto toms, and sometimes some other things. Being a woman who has toured internationally with exclusivly dudes--several dudes at a time, I might add--has given me an interesting perspective on what it's like to be a female musician today. It is perhaps impulse \u2014 my impulse, even \u2014 to think that the difference in sex (I say sex here instead of gender because I believe there to be a distinction between the two) between my band mates and I should not matter when touring. Every night we are on the road or play a show, we are all working towards a common goal; to be on time, set up quickly, to sound check and then to play with out messing up horribly. Easy enough, except with a band the size of the Ensemble \u2014 and traveling on a school bus which runs on vegetable oil scavenged almost exclusively from highway rest-stops \u2014 things generally take several hours longer then anyone would ever expect them to. There is a lot of teamwork involved in this process. I have come to think of us as a teepee: if you imagine the ensemble as a teepee, we are all planks supporting each other, and if one person is not on time, or not pulling their weight the whole structure collapses. And believe me, in the beginning especially, there were times when this teepee was not suitable for inhabitants. However, it is not in the process of setting up the show that I feel least at home as a woman. Truly, I cannot lift the amps that the other guys can lift. I say this not because I am someone who believes that women cannot be physically strong \u2014 on the contrary, I believe that after playing two long sets every night for months at a time that I have have gained muscle endurance which permits me to play for much longer then other male drummers I know \u2014 but because it is simply a reality of the situation. Here these boys are dragging equipment which must weigh almost as much as I do (I also happen to be fairly tiny), and I know I can scarcely contribute to this part of the ordeal. Of course, I load and unload all my own gear, but there was a time when we were designating jobs to everyone, and I was relegated to cleaning the bus. I didn't mind this, so much. I always knew where my own things were on our vehicle which became very cluttered very quickly. Honestly, there were really two main times when I feel the most different and distant. One occurs sometimes when we are playing. I can relate this feeling to a song written by the band Bikini Kill, entitled Tony Randell, where Kathleen Hannah sings, \"I see a punk club, he sees a strip bar.\" Its this feeling when you are are playing and you look up for a moment, and see these guys eyes on you from the audience, and you are not sure exactly why they are looking at you \u2014 if it is because they are enjoying the music you are making, or if it is because they are looking at you for another reason: because you are a woman on a stage who is doing something physical. This is especially true when I play with the ensemble. There are so many musicians on the stage, why catch my eye? In no way am I the best musician in the band, nor would I consider myself the most interesting to watch on a technical level. Here's a concrete example of this phenomenon: over the summer we played at Lollapalooza. While we had played Primevera Music Festival in Spain and other large festivals in Europe, Lolla was probably one of the biggest crowds we had played to. There must have been thousands of people there. It was summer in Chicago and it was incredibly hot out. It may even have been of the hottest days all summer, and the fact that there was so many people around made the place seem several degrees hotter. Of course, Denny and Greg, the other drummers, played shirtless that day. It would have been stupid, dangerous even, for them not to. The body heat created when playing a set like Dan's is unparalleled to anything I have ever experienced. Because of this, I decided I would also go shirtless. Of course, I had a bra on and, lets be clear, it was not in any way a sexual undergarment. It was a thick black thing which just as easily could have been a bathing-suit top. However, as we started playing, I noticed that one of the guys in the film crew seemed to be paying especially close attention to me. It started with him filming in my general direction from across the stage, but, seriously, by the time a quarter of the set had elapsed the man was right next to me, squatting on the floor and filming upwards. It didn't take long for me to figure out exactly what was going on, and I resolved to tell him to stop. However, every time a song ended, or was about to end, the filmer would move to a different part of the stage and act like he was filming someone else, or would be doing nothing \u2014 then when the next song would start he would be right next to me again. Part of me thought I was going crazy. Like, I was possibly making something out of nothing, however when I brought the incident up with the other drummers they both admitted that they had noticed what this man was doing as well. This was uncomfortable for a number of reasons: obviously, knowing that there's some guy out there with tape of my chest is kind of disconcerting, but I also couldn't keep myself from wondering whether he would have taken as much of an interest in my if my shirt was on. I try to consider myself a drummer fist, and a woman drummer second. I am very adamant about this. It is for this reason that I never followed up with an offer to do an interview for an online magazine devoted exclusively to female drummers. I know that sounds completely insane. People have told me this many times, however I do not endeavor to distinguish my self from the boys more than I already have. It might be true, as some people will argue, that any publicity is good publicity, but I can't help taking a moral \u2014 almost political \u2014 stance on the matter. I want to be praised not because I am a woman, but because I am good at what I do by a general standard, and if I haven't made it there yet then I haven't made it there yet, but I refuse to accept anything less. The other times when I feel \u2014 lets face it \u2014 a little bit out of the loop is when we are in transit, or hanging out after the shows. It is during these periods of down-time that the conversation has its way of turning towards girls, and bodies. It is times like after we have broken down all our equipment and we are all sitting out side, drenched in sweat and sharing cigarettes, that I learn who was checking out which girl in the audience, and whether the ladies out that night were a generally attractive crowed or not. Of course, I can engage them in some of this conversation. I can say things like \"which girl in the neon green shirt with the big glasses?\" and \"yea, she was looking right at you all throughout \"Woof Woof\". At first it seemed apparent that my role in these scenarios would be obvious: that as a woman I could just simply dole out womanly advice. This could range anywhere from how to maintain their currently long distance relationships with their girlfriends back in Baltimore or New York City \u2014 a feat which rarely occurred without incident \u2014 to what lady they should hook up with at a party. Honestly, this game was rather amusing to me. I knew pretty much what was going on with everyone for a good while. Not like you don't always know what's going on with everyone all the time when you are seventeen people traveling together 24/7 for weeks at a time, but I really knew the details of the situations. However, a problem occurred as we got deeper and deeper into the tour: as everyone got to know each other better, I felt like I became less of a woman to these boys and more like another dude. Which was cool, except that I'm not a dude. The phrase, \"Hey Kate, can I ask you this thing about my girlfriend,\" suddenly turned into \"Kate, your like the closest thing to a girl within several hundred miles because we are driving through the desert somewhere, so can I ask you this question...\" At first I was actually pretty excited about this. \"Great,\" I figured, \"the boys consider me on the same page.\" However, there were still elements of their conversations that I couldn't really contribute to. \"Oh yeah,\" I found myself saying sarcastically on way to many occasions, \"I hate it when I get road boners to. It really just ruins my day.\" So, its like I have basically come to feel like I am stuck in a weird limbo zone where I can't accurately fulfill some kind of heteronormative female role in the group because they don't really consider me a chick, but I can't really contribute to conversations about \"guy stuff\" either, because it simply doesn't apply to me. Honestly, check this out: So, it seams like every time a new genre starts woman are initially exculded from it and then slowly but surely creep their way into it. This can be seen clearly with punk and rap, and now it is happening more and more with noise and electronic music. I would like to think that currently woman are becoming more fearless with playing music--that is to say have less aprehension when playing rowdyier--dude like--music. Woman are playing more instruments these days while as in the past were relegated to vocals and the occasional guitar. However, this is not to say that we are equally accepted. I think women still have to be either super good or really really sexy to be accepted in any scene, where as there are a lot of dude bands which basically are terrible and get recognized. When I first started playing the drums, I was listening to a lot of Riot Grrrl bands. Specifically, I was super into Bikini Kill, and Sleater Kinney--bands who activly promote female musical empowerment. I think this was a very good place to start. Listening to these bands was of particular importance to me becuase I was very into the New York punk scene when I was a kid, I hung out at places like ABC No Rio, and that genre is very male dominated, with an obvious male hierarchy. While the Riot Girl scene developed out of Olympia, and I was living in NY, having female role models who came out of the punk scene was really helpful to me becasue it made me feel like, \"hell yea, we can do this too!\" The first couple of bands I was in when I was a kid were \"riot grrrl\" bands. I guess I would suggest that any woman who was feeling kind of self contious about this stuff pick up one of those cds and do a bit of research into that scene. Having female role models I think is really good for any female musician to have positive female role models. Also, having your first band be with other women can be empowering. There is a strong bond you make with the people you play with, and it is simply different when you are playing with dudes. I can't really explain it further then that. It's intangable and ineffible. I guess for the most part I have found that the people I play with have become my best friends, and having a female best friend is different then have one whose a dude. I'm not close with many of my girl friends from high school, for example, but of those i remain close with the majority are people i played music with at one time or another. Ultimatly though, the advice I would give to a woman musician just starting out would be just to play the music you want to play, and play at the bars you want to play at, and don't give a shit about what anyone tells you, especially if what they say is discourging. Unfortunatly, though, thats easier said than done. A NOTE: I think it is really really awesome that you guys are doing this. Check this out: on december 9th i sent a very similar show idea to This American Life. However, I sent it by e-mail and figured no one would ever read it. If you guys did, that is sick. But if you came up with this idea with out reading that e-mail that's even cooler becuase it means more people are just realizing this is a relevent topic. Thanks NPR!!! Honestly, I guess I started to play the drums becuase I had a ton of energy when I was a kid (still do) and felt like it would be a good way for me to use that energy. Then I realized I never wanted to stop. I also have always been really in to listening to music, since I was a little kid and hence playing music seemed like a natural choice. - Instruments: Jennings, Rachel Epp, Sarah's Redemption, Dominic Sinesio - Years playing: Piano, vocals They are mostly my studio and live show band. My manager and I make the business decisions. When I am just playing solo I perform with an 88 weighted key keyboard and a Boss loop station. But I also have a drummer, bassist, backup singer and synth player. Well, I think there are different expectations of men and women. There are different standards of looks and age to be in the industry. But overall, I think it is our job as women to push those expectations aside. We need to show the industry that we can succeed at any age, with any appearance strictly because we are talented. Oh definitely! I think with each generation it gets easier to be yourself when you are a woman. I think certain expectations of appearance will always be there, but it is our responsibility to break through those expectations. It may sound cliched but I was told to be the best me I can. Don't try to follow trends because you will always be a step behind. Just do what you do and eventually the trend will catch up to you. There was always a piano out in my house for me to sit down and play. - Instruments: Weird Habit (solo project), Work, Forked, Limosine, 16 Bitch Pile Up (2002-8), Murder Murder - Years playing: vocals, guitar, electronics \"in Work, i write the lyrics, sing and play guitar. my bandmate and i make all decisions equally for the most part. in Limosine, i played guitar and handled our recordings/mixing/mastering, which i did in the sound program Logic. i often take on the role of recording, and like to play a large part in album packaging. my bands have frequently made our own releases, from cassette tapes to vinyl.\" \"in Work, i sing vocals and play a white Fender guitar which i run through a Big Muff distortion and Boss EQ. similar set up for Limosine, but no vocals. i play trumpet through FX in Murder Murder. Forked and Weird Habit are experimental noise projects, as was 16 Bitch Pile Up. i use the things i've already mentioned above, and also a 404 sampler, various pieces of metal, contact mics, various FX pedals, keyboards. songs and shows depending.\" \"this was the number one question that 16 bitch pile up (all girl group) was ever asked. i used to respond by saying that there is no difference - i don't think about the fact that i'm a woman when i'm making the sound, i'm thinking about the sound. however, since that time i've worked a lot more with both men and women, and i guess i realize there are differences - mainly in how people view a woman on stage, but i do find that men are often more confident about performing, and less likely to waffle about in indecision. as far as creative processes go, it's very much differs from person to person and doesn't seem to have much to do with gender. however, most of the men i work with are highly sensitive artistic types, so maybe i'm not getting the full force testosterone blast that might exist in some male dominated projects.\" i think women making music 40 years ago are probably pretty similar to women making music today. you see a few strong female personalities that are able to distinguish themselves in the midst of a mostly male dominated industry (Laurie Anderson, Kim Gordon, Lydia Lunch, Cosi Fanni Tutti), then you have your puppetshow female pop star types who are arguably being put on display by some male mastermind and/or the record industry (the Shaggs, Phil Spector's girl groups, Lady Gaga). it's a tough call on who's who though, as it's pretty much impossible to be an artist or do anything at all without involving both genders figuring in somewhere in the equation. \"different things work for different people. i've heard just about all the advice there is, but i keep just doing what works for me. i'd like to be making more music, but college loans are a real bitch. my advice to anyone who has a dream they want to follow is just figure out a way to do it. i started out with nothing but a four track recorder and some instructions on how to build a contact mic. before that there was a piano somewhere in my life. just gather what you know, start experimenting, and keep a practice regimen. eventually you might really surprise yourself with what you're able to pull off. oh, and don't be afraid to work with other people! \" it's all about what i can get my hands on - Instruments: 4 or 5 - Years playing: flute Leader, except in my drummer's big band.. only two CDs so not much time in the studio. Always ran my own business. Sankyo flute, Roland amp I've always felt a bit outside of the mainstream and had to make my own way. Most of the time it was the employers and not so much the musicians who made me aware of the discrepancies. Yes, I think there are many more opportunities with each generation. I studied with two great masters and so I would say find a great teacher and never give up, find your own road and enjoy the journey~ my mom suggested it when i started 7th grade because it's \"easy to carry\" and I could always switch - Instruments: Smegma, The Tenses, The Rodney Forest - Years playing: Turntable, vocals, percussion My role in the band is often to accentuate the feeling of the piece, for instance if it's a rip roarinf hot rod rock tune I often play records of drag racing and cars. If it's a spooky haunting piece I play some french poetry (Baudelaire with echo effects) and Halloween records. I'm often the point person for tours and such and I have been known to make mistakes. In the Sudio I can do a bit such as mic placement but there is a lot to learn there. Old equipment from learning institutions, such as a Rheem Califone turntable ( I have four) or a Newmark portable (for overseas travel), A Boss Digital delay pedal, A volume pedal, assorted amplifiers, assorted percussion such as bells, whistles, flutes, music boxes. Yes, but only because there is a natural difference. sometimes you are differed to and sometimes you are ignored but rarely are you \"one of the boys\". Yes, with influence and equipment. I have to say for the most part they are stimulating differences though. Not in the industry per se. As a player though just to be confident and daring! I have always played records well. - Instruments: 5 main ones: Abiku, Morgaine, Total Fucking Destruction, Plain Jane, Mother Courage - Years playing: Keyboards (well, keytar) and vocals I am involved in all of it: writing music, writing lyrics, designing and creating costumes, booking tours, making the website, working with the label, etc. \"I have tons of gear! In Abiku, I play a Moog Liberation through an Ampeg V4B and an 8X10. We also use a 3200 watt PA for our drum machine (2X15 subs, and 2X15 mains with horns). In Morgaine I play a Roland Juno 60, a Sequential Circuits Prelude, and a Realistic (Moog designed) MG-1. I'm a serious keyboard collector. I also have a Jackson Rhoads guitar, various beloved 90's Peavey amps (really beloved, one of them will be my next tattoo) a few Kustom Tuck n' Roll cabs and heads, an Arp Explorer, and well, a lot more. A collector, like I said.\" \"Absolutely. People expect less of you as a woman, in general. Many make a beeline to my male bandmate for questions about sound, our setup, etc. It became clear to me as many men would want to talk to me about my equipment in a way that seemed to be only to prove that they knew more about my gear than I did. However, I have also run into many men who are supportive of me, who seem to speak to me no differently than they speak to male musicians, and even who seem to have more respect for me because they know I have to be really on top of my game, as a woman, to be taken seriously. This is especially true in places where many women make music, such as Portland, Oregon.\" I think in the scene I am involved in, many women are involved in the creation of music and putting on shows. I think it is different to work in a post riot grrrl world. The women who came before me and demanded respect have certainly made a difference and opened minds in the scene; most people I deal with expect women to produce music rather than to simply be consumers. \"The most important thing is to involve yourself in every aspect of your music. Know how to book shows if you want to play shows. Know your gear. Learn your history. Men get away with a lot more, and have to know a lot less. Most people who are worth dealing with you will respect your knowledge. On the flipside, it's not important to have a ton of technical skill and knowledge at playing music, especially starting out. Most teen boys who start bands don't know how to play, and it doesn't stop them. You have to learn by doing. Its easy to figure out what sounds good to you, and that will sound good to other people too, and they'll like it whether or not you have mad chops.\" I love vintage synthesizers because you have to spend time creating sounds, you work within a confined palette to find what expresses the feeling you're going for in a song. I also like that it's a feminine instrument, and I make this harsh aggressive music from a female perspective. I love guitar too though, I love taking what is seen as a masculine instrument and being able to play that role. There is still something transgressive about a girl with a guitar. It's like cross-dressing. - Instruments: 3.Elmhursy Symphony, Fulcrum Point Project, Music of Baroque - Years playing: violin differs from job to job the dress code for women often has a different standard than for men. It looks like due to the short history of women in the scene (as oppose to centuries of men playing classical music) have not noticed. start with the understanding that gender does not play any roll (negative or positive) as long as you are a good musician. there was a violin in my house when I was a little girl. - Instruments: 2. Beat the Devil and Shilpa Ray and Her Happy Hookers - Years playing: Vocals, Harmonium, Keys Songwriter, Front Person. It's my band so it's like a democracy under a dictatorship. Harmonium, lavalier wireless mic through a Galleon Kruger bass amp. I use a beta 57 for my vocal mic. Not so much anymore. Everyone has to work and bring it to every show. We all have our roles and chores we have to do as a touring band. My band mates are all male, they're my bros and they're the best. Yes and No. I think Feminism in America went through a huge backlash during the W. Bush years. We are now going through a cool Renaisance. There are tons of amazing female musicians and artists on the scene with something to contribute and it's not cheesy, kitchy, or female centric. It's universal. Now if we can get a woman into the presidency without it being a media circus... Sure, tons of people, both men and women. The hardship of being an artist in this country is gender neutral. Own yourself, what you do, how you live and don't worry about the end results. By default. I was forced to sing and play the harmonium as a child. - Instruments: Rose Polenzani, Edie Carey, Anne Heaton, Meg Hutchinson - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano CEO, boss woman, head cook and bottle washer, head honcho \"Martin Guitar Yamaha Piano Flatiron Mandola\" There could be a difference but its never been a topic for thought...i love playing and singing with men and women... \"- don't sign anything too fast - work hard at getting better at your craft...writing, playing, singing -carve time out for the creative and be responsible in the financial, but some risk is necessary\" picked up piano by ear as a kid , fell in love with guitar in university and fell in love with mandola when i played one in boston 3 years ago - Instruments: Lots of local bands growing up, none professionally until Those Darlins, but I'd say about 7. - Years playing: Guitar, bass, vocals I play with two other women, Jessi & Nikki Darlin, and we all swap instruments and share vocal leads and harmonies. In the studio we all share our ideas and make collaborative decisions. In business an marketing we all have an opinion and work in a collaborative way toward decisions with our manager, John Turner. I play an Epiphone Casino, Fender Telecaster 72 Reissue, Fender Hot Rod Deluxe Amp, Ampeg Rocket Bass Amp, and a Gretsch bass Yes, I think mostly when you are a pre-teen or teen and gender differences are becoming so much more apparent and important in your social circles that being a girl who plays music can be awkward and even discouraged by your peers. Mostly I think it's because more boys play and that it has a lot to do with sheer numbers and the awkwardness of gender interactions as a teen in general. In the professional world though, I think people are very open-minded and receptive to women musicians, especially as artists. I worked in live sound and production before doing Those Darlins full time and that world is still very hierarchial and non-receptive to women, I think mostly because of the physical labor involved and a general macho roadie mentality. Because the gender discrimination happens so early, I think it's important for girls to be encouraged at a young age to pursue music. I think all of the girls rock camps are making huge progress in this area. In fact, I helped start the Southern Girls Rock & Roll Camp and all three Darlins volunteer at it each summer. Yes, even between the riot grrrl movement of the 90s to today. It has been a much more politicized position to be a woman musician in the past, whereas today I think women approach with a much more \"so what\" sense of entitlement and ownership. While that may seem unappreciative of previous women's efforts or somehow that modern women aren't political or are complacent, I think it's just the opposite and speaks to the progress that women before us have made. The ultimate goal of just about any movement in my opinion is to make it to where people in the future won't have to use their energy to fight the same battle. Practice. Ha I originally wanted to play drums but my parents said noway because they're so loud, so I asked for a guitar instead. I was 12 and got a small folk guitar for Christmas. Once I started learning around the age of 14 I knew I wanted an electric and wanted to be louder so I got a summer job and bought my first electric guitar, a Fender Squire, then started my first band with some older guy friends around that time. - Instruments: 3 - Wish (96-99), Saving Face (00-04), Gardening, Not Architecture (08-present) - Years playing: Bass, vocals, guitar, piano I write the music and lyrics, co-produce the recordings in the studio, run the business, book and manage the project, tour by myself, perform solo, market myself, handmake the merchandise, design the merchandise, run the email list, etc. I have a lawyer and am in talks with a small indie label about signing a licensing deal through them and releasing a limited edition run of CDs and vinyl versions of my current self-released \"First LP.\" I perform live playing bass and singing through two different mics, one running through a distortion pedal, with a MacBook running backing tracks through Logic, as well as controlling a hand-made LED light wall that is programmed with a series lighting cues for each song. Definitely. No matter how hard women try, there are certain levels and areas in the industry where we will never be accepted into the \"boys' club\" as I like to call it. I was a musician for years before working on the industry side for 6 years, and now being back on the music side, I see it more than ever. If you are a pretty girl, you will get help from guys just because of that, and not necessarily because of anything else. You have to fight extra hard to be taken seriously, and even then you will still always be viewed first as female, second as a musician. Yes, I think the increase in the number of independent women in the industry has helped blur the lines between guys/girls in bands, and has gotten people used to the idea of girls being in bands. When I first started, when I was 16, there were no girls in unsigned bands in my genre. Now, 15 years later, there are tons of young girls in bands. But I don't see as many musically talented female players as the days of Joni Mitchell, Stevie Nicks, etc. It's a fashion statement most of the time, and mostly \"singers\" who don't play or write the music. I run a website offering advice to unsigned and independent musicians (http://earnityourself.com) and have always been asked about advice for girls in bands - I always tell them to forget about the fact that they are a girl. If you focus on your gender over your art as being the main thing that defines you, so will everyone else. I started out playing piano and violin when I was three, but when I got into rock n' roll at age 14, my mom taught me to play bass (I later taught myself to play guitar), and bass was my favorite instrument to play live. - Instruments: 2- the cherry valence, and birds of avalon - Years playing: guitar \"ours is a fairly democratic band in our songwriting (to a degree) and general approach. but when it comes to dealing with the \"\"business\"\", i'm usually the one making the decisions and handling the communication. i definitely am the person in the studio the whole time, mixing, at the mastering sessions and setting up mics. i even recorded one of our albums in our house! \" i currently mostly play a late 70's guild guitar (S-300D) through a klipp amp, marshall cabinet and also a fender deluxe... i use lots of effects- Electro Harmonix Memory Man, very early ibanez digital delay/ mutieffects unit. i also own and use a les paul guitar, a fender telecaster deluxe, among others. \"well this is tricky to say since i've never been a man and a musician! but i do feel like the differences are as amplified (pardon the pun) as you want them to be. sometimes people have a more personal agenda as part of their musical identity, and that's fine- it's tied in to the kind of music they make. i guess i've always thought of myself as an equal in all things to men so i do my best to not focus on that or make music \"\"as a woman\"\". BUT, i do feel like women have maybe a finer sense of intuition (we might be famous for that!) and that does show itself in making music. i never quite realized this until i started recording more often and a lot of decisions/ direction was really obvious to me while my bandmates weren't quite as tuned in, perhaps? i don't know if that's a gender difference, but it did occur to me that i was different than \"\"the guys\"\".\" most definitely! i think there is a freedom among women making music today that just wasn't there before. you see a lot more female guitar players- actual players- not just strummers! women just seem more comfortable in their roles in bands and seem like they aren't confined to being the \"hot chick\" in the band, or the tough girl in the band. it just seems more natural for bands to be multi-gender these days. \"the only valuable advice i was ever given is true for most things: don't worry about the things you can't control... i would certainly pass this along to anyone trying to do anything, starting out or otherwise. as far as musician-specific advice to the new musician: practice a lot, think about the music you like and why you like it and figure out what makes it sound the way it does. load your own gear, learn how to fix as much as you can, buy a tuner, buy records, listen to a lot of music, don't limit yourself and never be obedient to anybody but your own gut.\" i always was drawn to guitars and what they were doing in a song. i learned how to play by playing bass early on, but i found myself wanting to play guitar lines on the bass- so i just went for it! i think the guitar is a very versatile and expressive instrument and can be made to sound like almost anything. - Instruments: Panda, Looker, SAADI - Years playing: bass/vox/keyboard/guitar I am in charge of everything. I write, play, produce, record, and create everything. I was recently fortunate enough to start working with some amazing people in the industry/business side of things, which has been remarkable helpful after doing it myself for so long. In the studio I know what I want, although I am open when collaborating with people. I programmed beats in Garageband which I play live through Logic. I play bass and keyboards and sing while the beats are playing. Sometimes I have a guitarist too. I use a beautiful Apogee Duet for my interface, I play a P Bass (Road Worn) through Logic, and I use an M Audio midi controller. ABSOLUTELY. There are no 18 year old boy groupies waiting for me after a show. Not that I want any-- I'm just sayin'. People make more assumptions about what you sound like, and take you less seriously. And men in the industry will pretend to want to help you because they want something from you sexually. It's frustrating, but I am proud to be in the minority and working hard. I don't know if I do. I think women have more resources now, we don't need all the people the women of yesteryear needed in order to get heard. The days of a producer, engineer, label (again almost always men) are not gone but they are definitely dwindling. I can conceive of a song, record it, and put it in the world with nobody's help. That's power, man. Follow your own vision, trust your instinct, and don't let men (and women,but mostly men) in the industry try and mold you or shape you into their idea of what you're supposed to be. Also, DON'T EVER STOP WORKING ON IT if you're really serious. Otherwise you'll become another jaded musician. Out of necessity, honestly. I played lead guitar in my old band, and when I need a bassist for my new project, I just started playing. I wrote and recorded the parts anyway, and the bass is my favorite instrument to play. - Instruments: many chamber ensembles and solo recitals over the years - Years playing: piano Composer, arranger, promoter, performer sometimes--small operation. I am primarily a composer of religious and classical music for choir, solo voice, or 5-10 instrument ensembles, and also perform as a pianist sometimes when my music is performed. Absolutely. The difference is in having to prove to venues and sponsors that this is good to sponsor--that we'll draw good crowds, be popular. Sponsors don't have confidence in women musicians from the get-go. Love the young adults nowadays. We older folks seem to them to have been \"the pioneers.\" Maybe we are. As a college professor, I influence women musicians just starting out all the time. I encourage them not to lose their dreams in the discouraging world of music. I could take lessons from someone my sister studied with. - Instruments: i am a solo artist - Years playing: vocalist as a recording artist, i focus on all things creative in terms of writing songs, putting together my shows, and working with producers. In addition, I work along with my business team on all things commerce. I own a monitor rig and all of my mic's There is definitly a big difference when it comes to radio. 80% of the playlist on Christian radio is made up of men. For live performances, the fees paid to men are much higher for men than women. - Instruments: Portland Chamber Music Festival, Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, many many others. - Years playing: violin There has been a huge change in orchestral settings -- MANY more women than there used to be, particularly violinists. In fact, probably more women than men violinists in orchestras today. My own initiative in first grade after hearing some kids play violin in my calss - Instruments: Dyad, The Crooked Jades, The Abramson Singers, Octoberman - Years playing: Vox and guitar Lead songwriter, lead everything. I give up a bit of control in the studio and in label stuff, but like to be a part of all decisions. Hollow-bodied electric guitar (JMS/old framus) and Fender blue junior amp. Sometimes I sing through a line-6 delay pedal, sometimes I use an overdrive pedal with my guitar. \"Absolutely. There's just way less interest, and you don't get taken as seriously, even if your music is ten times better... unless you're cute. It bothers me that looks are important, even in the indie world. I suppose the same goes for men, to a certain extent, but if you look at Bonnie Prince Billy, he can be sexy in a different way, because he's weird and good, not because he's hot. I guess that double standard exists in society at large, and it appears in the music world in microcosm. There are moments all the time where I feel like I need to prove myself. At many shows. It's frustrating to feel like you're automatically dismissed.\" Yes. The riot grrl movement changed a lot. Women can rock, that way has been cleared. It's not assumed that you can't play your instrument. But there's still that element of \"prove yourself.\" There's more women out there playing now, which is comforting. I have a lot of women musician friends who are amazing, and we support each other. Be prepared to hustle. That's something that I'm starting to lose steam on. I wish you didn't have to sell yourself (or find someone to do it for you), but it seems inevitable. Get comfortable with that, or you'll never be comfortable in the business. I've never been comfortable with that, so I'm comfortable in obscurity. Because I rebelled and quit piano lessons, but I loved the idea of playing guitar because it was \"cooler\" than piano. I was just drawn to it from day one, and practiced my heart out after my dad borrowed one from the school he worked at. - Instruments: Saskatoon Symphony, Kitchener Symphony, Lima Symphony - Years playing: Violin Leader Violins and bows. . pianos Not at the level I work in - it is based on how well you play. Yes, the young women move around even more freely than my generation did. Practice - all the time. It was available - Instruments: \"Miles own band, \"\"Spider\"\" I am the songwriter, producer, singer, guitar player. For others I have been a touring guitarist, bassist, and back-up vocalist. In the studio, I leave a lot of the \"\"getting of sounds\"\" up to the engineer. That is a science unto itself that I know little about. \" \"1960 Les Paul Jr, electric guitar (Mahogony) 1958 Les Paul Jr. amp (beige) Martin acoustic guitar Parlour guitar of unknown origin. Given to me by an ex-boyfriend. May be as old as 1930s. 1980's Harmony bass - got it for 100$ - added Fender pickups - now it's awesome 1990 Fender sidekick amp - 15th birthday present from dad when I first started playing. \" I didn't perform in a band until my late 20s. Guys used to come up to me after the show and say, \"wow, you can play!\" That never would have happened to a guy. I think people expect something of you musically at this point. I think this has even changed in the past few years since I started performing. I don't think that the bar is lower, but I think people aren't as surprised if you are good if you are a woman. But, there are still lots of bands that get away with a lot because they are girls. \"Be honest. Don't compromise your integrity and what you are trying to say. A don't assume there is no way to make money. \" I picked the guitar so that I could have something to sing along too. When I first started to play, I would sing Joni Mitchell and the 10,000 Maniacs. It wasn't until my late 20's that it even occurred to me that I was a guitar player. - Instruments: just Public Radio and Mark Mathis (my husband) - Years playing: keys & vocals My role in the band is to play my instrument and sing my heart out. When on tour in the past my husband (the main singer/songwriter of Public Radio) has joked for me to take my wedding rings off when I sit at the merch table, but he's only half joking. I'd like to think a lot of the other things I offer the band are important, but the guys would probably disagree. Like I'm really good with directions, I try and keep the van clean and the merch organized, I have cooked a ridiculous amount of meals for the band over the past 4 years, and I'd say I'm the peace-maker of the group. In the studio we have an amazing producer who works primarily with Mark (the main songwriter). They get things done and call us in when they need our skills. As far as business and marketing go, I may start taking more of a managerial role here in the next few months. I am expecting our second baby in August and will need a few months off to keep up with her. But while I do that, I am going to dabble in managing Public Radio, which is exciting to me. I play a Nord Electro 3 and an Alesis Micron Haha! Yea, I do think there's a difference, but it's not really a big deal to me. I think there's an assumption that ALL women are high-maintenance, and therefore don't make the best band-mate or road tripper. Which I must disagree with completely. We have had several different MALE fill-in band members over the past few years and they were way more maintenance than I ever am! I have a lot of respect for women musicians, actually. Especially ones that can also juggle having a family. One of my heros is Kori Gardner of the band Mates of State. She has 2 kids, an amazing band with her husband, goes on tour a lot and keeps making hit records! I am so impressed and inspired. I think being a woman in any kind of constantly changing career - like music - is harder and more different than being a man. When I found out I was pregnant with our second child (BIG surprise), the rest of the guys in the band automatically assumed I was out. I'm sure in their minds they were thinking \"There's no way she can come to practice and play shows let alone go on tour with 2 young kids!\". It feels a lot like discrimination, to be honest. It felt like just because I'm the baby-carrier (being pregnant) it suddenly exiles me from playing my instrument and being on stage. My husband will have 2 kids as well but no one thinks of kicking him out of the band. If there's ever a babysitter problem (like we can't find one), I'm naturally the one who has to find a fill-in for a show. I get tired of it, but I'm an overcomer and I'll find a way to be a good Mom and maintain my position in a band that I love and believe in with all my heart. I have done a lot of shows pregnant and even traveled across the country very close to my due date. When I play a show pregnant, I get pumped by watching a video of the artist M.I.A. who performed at the Grammy's while 9 months pregnant. Now that's an unstoppable woman. In some ways I do, like there are definitely way more women in the music industry than there were several generations ago. I also know for a lot of women to \"make it\" they are given some pretty strict rules from their labels or managers so they can \"sell the artist\" better. For instance the industry wants thin, attractive, single women. I guess this applies to men as well, but I feel like the talent of a woman can get overlooked by trying to make her look like a pop star - to sell her as a sex image. I don't necessarily feel like women had to jump through these kinds of hoops to have success in the 60's and 70's. No, no one has personally ever given me any advice about making my own way. Although, I'd have to say I am inspired by the women artists who are going after it and doing a fine job like Regina Spektor, Kori Gardner, Chan Marshall, Karin Bergquist, and so many more of my heros. My advice is to not be \"the angry girl\", and try not to use your body to sell your music. Let the music sell itself. I took some lessons playing bass a few years ago, but the band already had a bass player so I warmed up my piano fingers and gave it a shot. I'm definitely not the most talented musician in the band, but I love playing keys and singing. - Instruments: As a solo artist, Blake Hazard and in my band The Submarines - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar We are a duo. John and I both write and sing the songs, and John does more of the production work while I do a bit more of the singing and lyric writing. I do a bit more on the business end, and John has a separate career as a composer for film and tv. We make our big decisions together with our manager and good friend, Darius, and often defer to our label on marketing matters. We have a good relationship with them and have been fortunate to work with a good team there. I have a vintage Kapa Continental guitar, basically a hundred dollar guitar--though they are becoming more popular. I bought it when it came through the guitar shop where I worked in Cambridge, MA, for a few years. It was love at first sight--and I could actually afford it at the time. I've played other guitars, but I always come back to this one. One of these days I'd like to buy a Creston Electric, made by a friend in Vermont. I also play a flower-strewn glockenspiel and a melodica. \"Until men can start having babies, there's always going to be a real difference--the ticking of the biological clock, parenthood and lifestyle demands.... And professionally, until we have a Madame President and pay equality there will be a difference between men and women in every industry. Having said that, I haven't felt any particular discrimination or special treatment around being a woman in music--it's a world made up of individuals and some strong characters, and some are more evolved than others. I ignore most of the commentary from random guys at clubs and some of the more blatantly sexist behavior I've encountered as best I can. It takes a lot of energy to take that on--sometimes I get into it and call those people out, but mostly I'd rather get on with my job. Ultimately, the work is the most important thing, and there are biases in every profession that women are still having to overcome.\" \"My generation is the first to be able to take a lot of the progress made by the feminist movement for granted. We expect to be able to achieve everything a man can achieve, and with that expectation comes a lot of freedom. But, we've also had some confusion surrounding just what is possible once motherhood comes into the equation. It can put the brakes on that equal-achievement trajectory, at least for a while. I've seen a number of women artists handle motherhood and playing in a band beautifully, and I find them really inspiring. I think the previous generation of women musicians had a lot to prove to people about being able to stand up in music, and I'm deeply grateful to those women. I see Emmylou Harris, Patti Smith and Chrissie Hynde doing great work today and appreciate that the trail is being blazed farther out into the future.\" \"I've had some good advice along the way, though most of it really wasn't specifically about being a woman. One of my favorites is: vague relationships yield vague results. That's a big one in music! But, most of the women I've been lucky to know in this industry are self-assured and very talented people, and I don't think that they've been as focused on their womanhood as they've been on their musicianship. I don't mean to suggest that we should ignore our womanhood--on the contrary, I think it should be celebrated at all times! But I would never want to go back to the era of \"\"Women in Rock,\"\" which seemed to create a fad or a ghetto out of a population that's been in music all along -- the ladies!! I think I'd give the same advice to a girl starting out in music that I'd give to a boy, which is to keep learning and never assume you've got it figured out. Some people dig in to notions about what you can and can't do in the business and then wonder how they suddenly became irrelevant.The business changes so much that all you can do is keep making music you love and stay honest with yourself.\" My father plays guitar and taught me Bossa Nova and country songs when I was about twelve years old. I had played piano before that, but the guitar felt really comfortable -- and I could secret it away in my room and write songs in a way I couldn't with the piano. - Instruments: My Band: Megan Burtt & The Cure Awosika, J.E Borgen - Years playing: Guitar/Vocals/Piano I'm the front woman. I write and sing the songs. It's my brainchild, so I pretty wear all the hats -booking, marketing, managing, promotions... I play an OM 28V Martin Guitar with a K&K pick up. Sing through a Newman KMS 105. I often play a '94 reissue of a 60's Strat (Fiesta Red!) through a custom made amp design after a Fender Deluxe (2, 12s)..it's really heavy, or a Fender Blues Jr (much easier to carry). Oh my goodness, yes! There are a lot of expectations on females, especially for those of us who are independent artists. Not only do we have to play the role of the business person, we also have to keep the creative juices flowing, manage a band, and then show up looking good and perform well....and do it all in a men's world. There are WAY more men in the music biz than women. I also know a lot of female friends and have been in situations myself where to get through the gates certain inappropriate expectations are set before us. I also think there aren't as many women in the business that are acknowledged for having incredible talent, so there is a bit of pressure to rise up and show the world we are every bit as capable as men. Don't get me wrong, it's all a labor of love! Sure, it's just evolution, trends, fads. I think that great music and performers stands through the test of time - Patsy Cline, Joni Mitchell, Shawn Colvin, Gillian Welch, Brandi Carlisle, who will be next?? Lots of it! Stick with it, because eventually most everyone else will give up. Be someone people can fall in love with. Write happy songs :) (working on that one!) I was inspired by other female singer/songwriters that play guitar. My dad has an old classical guitar in his office. Just before I turned 16 I decided I wanted to learn to play it. So, we took it to the folklore center, got the cracks fixed, and I'm on my forth guitar. - Instruments: I used to perform with mum, Slowblow, Storsveit NIx Noltes and Hudson Wayne. Now I perform mostly my own music but I also play with Skuli Sverrisson. - Years playing: voice, guitar, charango, violin and various string instruments I collect I write my own music, I sing and play at the same time in the studio, using whole live takes as much as possible. My collaborators bring a lot too, both through good ideas but also and more importantly by patiently supporting me in finding ways to bring my ideas to life, exactly the way I want them to come out. Of course I put a lot of trust in my manager, my agents and the people who work at the label, but I am very aware that it is my responsibility to have the last word in all decisions. I'm very lucky that the business people I'm working with are very open and artist friendly and kindly help me head in the direction that works best for my music and my personality. When playing alone I have one nylon string guitar, one small parlor steal string guitar, one charango. When my friend David Thor Jonsson joins me at the stage he adds a bigger steal string guitar, kalimba and piano (preferably grand piano) to the equation. If he's around I like to play my violin-viola too. I have a feeling that women in many ways experience music differently than men. It has something to do with time, and how you can stretch it, or sometimes you can't. My experience is that men are more focused on the form and the lineal thinking in the music, where as women fall in love with specific moments in the compositions and the emotional information that they carry. Sometimes when watching bands of mixed gender, on the outside it looks like the girls are just there for the sake of having a girl on board, like the icing on the cake, but very often, when I watch closer I find that the girls are actually the architects of the feel that's being presented. Both these elements are beautiful and equally important and even not so tied to being a girl or a boy, it's more of a female/male kind of thing. This is such a huge concept, that I think it would deserve nothing less than a thesis written on it, which we obviously don't have space for here. Maby there are even several that exists, if not, I hope someone is working on it. My singing teacher, Ruth Little Magnusson, tought me the importance of seeing and understanding every word you sing. Keeping that in mind has had a very strong impact on my singing and my performance. The violin I chose as a kid. I just decided, don't know why. Sometimes I wish I hadn't, it's such a brutal beginners instrument. Later I switched from the violin to vocal lessons because I didn't have the humor back then to tolerate myself playing flat notes and knew I could trust my voice better. I started teaching myself guitar in my teens because I needed to have one instrument that I could approach my own way, untouched, only by ear. Lately I've started learning what the chords are called on the guitar, for practical reasons. - Instruments: Carol Heffler Trio: St. Andrews Choir, Brasilia - Years playing: vocals; piano/keyboard \"I am the leader. I choose the songs, make the arrangement, write the charts (music) by hand, set the schedule, get the gigs, do the publicity, arrange for the poster to be made, distribute the poster.\" Korg digital piano, Peavey amp, keyboard stand, mike stand, EV N/D367s microphone, stand for Peavey amp, Steinway grand piano in home studio. Absolutely. As a woman I have had to prove myself more to be taken seriously. The other difference may be because I'm mainly a singer and not an instrumentalist. Though instrumentalists strive to get a voice-like tone in their instruments, singers are often considered not \"real\" musicians. I can't think of a particular moment that made this clear. I have always been aware of it. I don't know enough younger musicians to say. One piece of advice I got was to do it (music) because you love it, not because you think you'll make a lot of money or be famous. Do it because you HAVE to do it to feel like a complete person. I would pass that long to a young musician. My parents bought a piano and I started lessons when I was 6 years old. I like the piano so much I never wanted to change. - Instruments: The New Earth Ensemble - Years playing: Gu Zheng (Chinese Zither) \"I am a soloist, I am also the leader of my group the New Earth Ensemble I am in corporation with my business partner in terms of marketing and business decisions. \" \"- 6 Gu Zheng (Chinese Zither) -Pro-Tools/ Digidesign 003 Studio Monitor ) -Midi-Keyboard -AKG studio monitor headphones -Abeton Live 7 software -Finale Notepad\" no difference, at least at this stage where I don't have children. not sure \"I went to music business program in college and one of the most important thing they taught me was Networking in this business. The advise I can give to woman musician are: - Stick to your passion -Have an unreasonal dream, dare to think about it -Be patient , success may take longer that you hope for -Practice, be great at what you do, keep expanding and exploring yourself as a musician and human being -Networking, online and offline, let people know what you can offer -Don't play free shows unless there are other valuable things (not just for fun) you can get out of it (such as promotion/publicity, etc.) Many musicians don't get enough pay for their hardwork, and partly is due to the musicians who play free shows or very cheaply paid shows are messing up the market for the rest of musicians who are trying to make a living by doing music. -Know your market/audience (there isn't really good or bad music, only the one receives it enjoys it or not) -Get a partner or form a team to support you \" I saw a friend of mine playing when I was 7 and I felt in love with the sound and the look of the instrument. - Years playing: voice/piano/composer I have no band or studio. My business and marketing decisions are usually my own with some input from my husband. Computer with XP. Sibelius software and Finale software I have never really felt discriminated against for being a woman musician, but I have heard stories from others. I believe things have generally improved in recent years. Not sure. \"The best book I ever read was \"\"The Savvy Musician.\"\" It had more practical helps than I have ever seen anywhere else. Advice: Be the best you can be; develop your talent and your musical skills, but also develop your business and marketing skills. Don't ever quit trying.\" I started studying piano at age 5 with a relative and studied through high school. I began singing a youth choir as a teenager. In college I majored in piano performance, but also continued voice lessons. My graduate degree was in church music with a major in voice. Although I \"dabbled\" in composing throughout my life, I only became really serious in the late 80's and early 90's. The last three years have been the best in terms of works performed and commissions received. I have received the ASCAP Plus Award annually since 1996. - Instruments: lots! and many different styles from most to at least 3 times: DBR & The Mission, B'nai Jeshuran Musician in Residence, Djinn, 2VC, The Naming, Mike Errico, Kanye West, Adele. - Years playing: cello I often contract groups for artists big and small, so I guess that would make me the leader and often decisionmaker. \"cellos (3) - 200 year old French cello, modern amplified cello and baroque cello peavy amp, although I usually go direct into the system if amplified, and if so often: baggs DI, boss DD3 delay, fatal tube distortion, T-Rex roommate reverb...\" Definitely, but this is true in any field. Sometimes it's an advantage, as there is a certain \"look\" someone is going for, although I usually pick my fellow performers by their ability rather than their sex. Some situations I play with almost all men, whereas others are mostly women. Some, not all. Younger women seem to be more 'hip' or into the idea that they don't need to pigeon hole themselves in one area. (ie orchestra job) \"Yes! Dr. Kaufman at Mannes in Intro to Undergrad studies.

When we toured to support our third album in 1976/77, the Village Voice wrote of me: \"\"She held the guitar like a falice...\"\" The music business is about: who sound like (you even asked the same question here), how can we pigeon-hole you? There were no role models -- ZERO -- for us coming up in the late 60s and 70s...we found out about other female players by word of mouth. We had horns so we were likened to Chicago...but our songs were nothing like them. In my opinion, being a girl with an electric guitar wasn;t sexy -- that is, until Prince came along. He and Bo Diddley are the two men who dared to defy the mold and consistently through their careers, had women playing instruments in their bands.\" \"Yes...the women playing today have no idea who helped pave the way for them...and that makes me very sad. Take a woman's right to vote: in my opinion, young girls and women today do not have no clue about -- and therefore take for granted -- the huge sacrifice the women of the Suffrage Movement made to ensure the generations of women who followed would have a place at the table. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'VE BEEN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING\" \"I am more on the business side of things these days and am partner in a talent management company (we manage the Estate of Bo Diddley), so I get asked for advice all the time. The advice today is the same as it was 35 years ago: always be true to yourself. play what you believe in and believe in what you play. Hopefully, then, your regrets will be few...\" \"My sisters (twins) had a folk group in the 60s and bought themselves a beautiful acoustic classical guitar (Gibson). I always wanted to be like my sisters... Then when my professional career as a vocalist came to fruition, I was encouraged by other female musicians to play guitar on stage. The thought of playing electric guitar in a band wasn't even on my radar 'cause there were no role models to emulate.\" - Instruments: Just Bowerbirds - Years playing: Vocals, accordion, keys I write most of my parts. Phil, my partner, is really the sonwriter. I help some with lyrics, but not much. I do most of the marketing, business side of things, visual aesthetic of the band, blogging, answering emails, creating the online store, designing tee shirts, posters, look of the merchandising and merch table, etc. I was already a visual artist and designer when I joined the band. Phil and I make almost all our decisions together, by consensus. We recently hired a new drummer and tour manager/ mandolin player. In terms of the sound of any song, live or recorded, I usually defer the final say to Phil, because he has been writing music for ten years, but for our other decisions, we each have equal say. Vintage Italian accordion with electric microphone pickup, Nord Electro keyboard, microKorg keyboard. People are probably affected by prescribed gender roles in our society, in terms of what kind of ways they feel comfortable expressing themselves. So in terms of how it feels to be a female musician, I probably feel more comfortable expressing things like delicacy, sensuality, and sensitivity than the average guy might feel. But at the same time, I know that's what's expected of me as a woman, so I almost have to fight the urge to rebel against that. I actually think I am pretty consciously trying to express my gender honestly in my performing, and I think of myself as strongly identified as a woman, although my concept of womanness is different than our larger cultures normal definitions of femininity. I don't want to be up there acting macho, but I also don't want to act demure or anything. But the fact that I have thought this stuff through is probably testament to the fact that I am hyper aware of what it means to be a woman performing on stage. On tour, I don't encounter many women in bands or as sound engineers or promoters, compared to the millions of guys, so I can't help but be reminded of my sex all the time. I've been on probably 16 months of tours, and on only one of those was there another woman playing in a band we toured with. That can be very exhausting. I love guys, but I also love women, and I miss the conversations women have together, the different ways we deal with stress, how we communicate and look out for one another. I just miss female friendship when I'm on the road. Also, people in venues often mistake me for a groupie or some guy's girlfriend, and I've been condescended to several times by sound guys. Also, I've noticed on online blogs and other websites that women get a lot more criticism of their personal physical appearance than men do. That's just residue from the patriarchal culture at large, but it really pisses me off. It makes it a lot harder for a plain looking woman to make it in the music industry than it does for a plain looking guy. This focus on appearance also makes people post in the comments section on a blog post about the relative value of a man's musical abilities and about the relative hotness of a woman. I think that has dual effects on women who play music. Some put extra effort into their looks on stage, compared to guys in the band, and some purposely try to look androgynous or tough. Others just say fuck it, I'm going to do what I want and ignore what people think. It's hard though, to not ever think about those things, because you know people are judging you differently because you are a woman. And they are probably going to assume you are a bad musician if they find you attractive. The old idea that pretty women can't also be smart. But I don't know if the music world is as sexist as the corporate world is. Because artists tend to be less sexist than people who choose a more conventional career path. \"It's a hell of a lot easier now to be a female musician in the rock world than it must have been 30, 20 or even ten years ago. I feel really lucky that all those women paved the way for me, and that all the other feminists through the years have worked to change the way people see women in general. Women have more power now, and more of us have grown up with mothers and other female role models who were creative and who didn't allow themselves to be dominated by the men in their lives. \" \"I didn't really get any female-oriented advice. I just watched what the women did who I admired, and tried to learn from them. I'm lucky there are so many female musicians playing in the triangle area, mskbg some of the best music coming out here. Come to think of it, there is a woman in every one of my favorite local bands who also tour, save maybe two. \" I picked up an accordion belonging to a member of my boyfriend's band, while they were out on tour and had left some instruments in my apartment. I just started fooling around on it and was blown away by how beautiful it sounded, and how right it felt in my arms. I had always dated guys in bands, probably because I just love music so much, but sort of felt like I had missed my chance to be in a band. I was 29 years old, so I thought it was late to start playing guitar or something. But then the accordion wasn't as overdone in bands, so I figured I could just decide how I wanted to play it, and that there wouldn't be as much of an expected level to achieve before starting to play live. There aren't many accordion players around here who could tell how bad I sucked at first. - Years playing: vocals, guitar I write the songs and I'm the lead singer. In the studio, we all have input, but I care more about the vocal levels and tone. In business and marketing decisions, we all have equal say, but I seem to care the most. Yamaha solid-state amp. Fender Stratocaster ('62 reissue) sunburst guitar. Any microphone will do. \"It's changed over the years. It used to be quite rare to see women in bands, and I often felt intimidated. These days, in Vancouver at least, most bands have a girl or two in them. It's become the norm. It's very nice. However, I just had my first child. Within two weeks of telling them that I was pregnant my record label informed us that \"\"there wasn't any money in the budget\"\" for us to record our next record. A year and a half later, we're still waiting. Also, now that I can't tour, it's hard to imagine how I will ever be able to participate in the \"\"music industry\"\" as it is now configured.\" See above! Anyone younger than 30 would not have experienced what I went through in the mid-90's. I don't recall receiving much advice. It's too bad, really. I feel like I've been looking for advice my whole life. But it's so competitive out there. People can come across as jerks, that's for sure. I've always admired rock and rollers. I've always wanted to be in a band. I've always wanted to write songs. - Instruments: 1, The Lost Pines - Years playing: guitar, vocals I am in charge of my band. I do all the booking, promotion and management, write some of the songs and make all the logistical decisions. I am also the front-person. Collings d2h guitar, sm58 mic, red eye pre-amp \"When I realized that the band (5 guys and me) wouldn't get anywhere unless I took charge. \" \"Don't give up your guitar to an arrogant guy in a song circle...they might just not give it back! It gets boring seeing only guys on stage. People love to see talented women up there, so and having a woman in a band in a sure way to stand out. Don't be intimidated by guys who have been playing a lot longer than you have. Learn from them. Chances are, if you are excited about learning and actually work at it, you will find many people willing to teach you/jam with you. Also, host jam sessions with players who are better than you are but whom you feel comfortable playing in front of. This way, you can feel comfortable in your own space and can learn a lot more than you might showing up at a jam where you might feel intimidated.\" it's easy to pick up and take a guitar with you wherever you go, especially the porch, and I wanted to be able to accompany myself when I sing - Years playing: sing, guitar, accordion, banjo I am the lead singer and write the majority of the songs. Monko and I make all of our decisions in the studio together...we trust each others musical instincts, which helps greatly. In terms of the business, we make every decision together. We are truly equal in this business. \"I currently am performing with a '66 parlor-style guitar made by Framus (in the heart of Bovaria : ) My brother, Morgan Daniel is making me a custom guitar right now that I am really excited about and hope to be playing soon! My partner, Monko performs with a variety of instruments including a The Kentucky Mandolin, Taylor GA8 guitar and a Gretch Hollow body electric through a Fender Blues Jr.\" \"It is a tricky subject, because I am cautious not to sound as though I am complaining....Even though there are so many professional female musicians, it is still such a male dominated industry. I feel as though sometimes it is more of a challenge for me to gain respect for my craft, than some other male musicians I know. It also seems like some folks find it easier to approach me after a show, as opposed to male band mates, to give me \"\"advice\"\" or \"\"constructive criticism\"\". I have even been told by a fan that he would have really enjoyed the show better if I had danced a little. I told him \"\" I am a musician, not a dancer\"\". My male band mates got a real kick out of this! I also feel that I get a lot of positive attention because I am a woman...some of which I enjoy, and some of which is a little overwhelming : )\" Yes! I see a HUGE difference in the freedom of expression that woman have now...but that goes for men as well. There is such a wide variety of tastes in music now, and audiences are so much more open minded now than they used to be. In the genre of music that I play, which is country, or Americana, I see huge differences in the role of the female performer... Women like Loretta Lynn and Emmy Lou Harris have been so instrumental in this. What I am learning, is not to dwell on the bumps in the road, or set backs too much. I don't want to complain or dwell on the injustices that woman in the music world experience, because complaining or focusing on it is what will keep us down....that's how it works! The only way to change it is to learn from it, rise above it, move on and kick ass! I play live with a guitar mainly for ease of traveling...I would love to add the accordion and banjo to the live show eventually, but for now, I stick to guitar... - Instruments: just Neal & Leandra - Years playing: vocals, guitar equal on leads, harmonies, production decisions and all business/marketing decisions Fischmann blenders plugged into a 6 channel amp, shure SM 58s for vocals, Klipsch speakers - I play a Gibson J-45 and Neal plays a Taylor 710. Yes. In the studio, it's hard to get mostly male engineers/producers to take you seriously. At venues, sound people tend to spend less time on the woman's sound. Mostly it's the matter of being assertive - with men, they're 'consummate musicians', with women, you always run a higher risk of being considered 'a demanding diva.' Frustrating, but workable, usually. Yes. Younger women are often too willing to act like little girls to get what they want. Well, someone early on told us to keep a mailing list of fans. That has been critical - otherwise you can't reach people who enjoy your music. I'd tell a woman musician just starting out to decide what she really wants out of her music career and then keep working at it daily. And to try and keep whole. It's a tough business, so are most! it's portable - Instruments: Very few - Years playing: vocal It's a trio, so we're pretty democratic. Mike, amp, tall chair Since i was just a singer and came up at a time when big band \"standards\" gave way to electric rock and roll, I simply stopped singing in public for a very long time. I didn't have musicians to back me up, and that's essential of course for a vocalist. But also, I was busy with college and simply left music behind. A pushy manager or band might have made a difference, but the timing couldn't have been worse. I'm not at all sorry I stopped performing when I did, but I must say that coming back to weekly gigs now (for the last 10 years or so) has been an unexpected delight. I'm somewhat out of the local \"scene,\" but I know a few female vocalists my age and also much younger, and I notice that the older ones who have been working all their lives have developed very good administrative skills and use agents to great advantage. The younger singers are all about writing their own music, which is a great development, it seems to me. But I must say, covering the old tunes is like throwing good pots--they're always lovely and always interesting, but sometimes they turn out to be truly exceptional. To be able to interpret composers like Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Johnny Mercer, and others is a delight and a privilege. And I'm constantly surprised that my voice is still really good--I thought it would have left me by now. I really didn't ever make a living in the music industry, so I don't know how valuable my advice would be, but I'd suggest to newcomers that they keep track of what's going on in their field, who's who, who's writing what, who's reliable. It's like any other field--try to learn as much about it as possible. I've just been a singer all my life--since I was 2. - Instruments: None, composer primarily - Years playing: piano I am the composer, producer, and president of Palladian Music Inc. Piano Yes, It is more difficult to be taken seriously as a woman composer, I think, than Men are, however, fortunately, in the end the music speaks for itself. \"Not sure, although I think that one must be perseverant in our goals if we want to accomplish them.\" Don't worry about what others are doing, do your music because you love it, and continue on, do not let negative thoughts impede you from pursuing your dreams. I love it since I first started playing at age ten - Instruments: fanshaw and the choir practice - Years playing: vocals, guitar fanshaw is essentially a solo project... I write the songs and all creative and business decisions are up to me. There are two consistent players (shane turner and johnny payne) who have contributed a lot to the sound but 'fanshaw' is whatever comes out of me... I have creative license to choose different musicians for different songs. \"All of my gear is always broken so it is constantly changing depending on which friends are willing to lend me their stuff. I always play a fender guitar..I prefer telecasters but lately i've been borrowing a fender jag because my tele is all messed up. \" \"Older folks usually assume that I am 'just the singer' if they haven't seen me play, or that I am the 'front woman' but don't write the songs. People my age are more used to women being in the industry.. I haven't been treated too differently..except that sometimes sound guys will ask me if I need my guitar tuned for me . Also I think I am forgiven for not being a particularly technical guitar player.\" \"I'm not sure... I guess I'm supposed to say that women were more accepted as pop stars or folk singers before..but I think since the late 70s and 80s women have really been as accepted as creative leaders. Maybe not in mainstream music but I think about people like Nina Hagen, Kate Bush (who was mainstream!) , Laurie Anderson etc etc these woman were really respected for pushing boundaries Ultimately, I'm not sure I see too much of a difference now. Mainstream pop/rock music doesn't expect men to wear their sexuality on their sleeve as much as women.... and even the most succesful 'tough girls' don't take it all the way. Avril Lavigne dances in front of pink skulls, wears tu tus and so on. So I mean, probably there are differences but I'm not sure how much that has permeated the mainstream. The mainstream is always more conservative (in terms of change). And there are a lot female artists, particularly from the 70s and 80s onward outside of the mainstream that I still look up to without taking their time and place into consideration. Kate Bush is still a fucking art star.\" I think that I fit the mold of what a woman is expected to be in music so it hasn't been that hard for me. I make pop music, my voice is pretty etc. So I don't feel like I've had any hurdles that I've had to jump over. If some guy wants to tune my guitar for me then the jokes on him! I used to play classical piano but I didn't write any music until I picked up a guitar. I had no idea how to play it, and didn't really bother with tabs so I became really inspired by the learning curve. The guitar was just sort of ..there. I don't know why I picked it up, I just became obsessed with it out of the blue. - Instruments: I am a solo artist! - Years playing: Vocal and Piano I am a solo artist and I record all of my lead and background vocals. That is very important to me and I never hire someone to sing my backgrounds for me. I am involved in all of the business decisions, though I trust my incredible manager, Gary Salzman of BIG Management, with the final say. I currently am rehearsing for shows this summer! I also use a cordless mic and my own TV tracks for live performance. I always have my male dancers with me, usually atleast two, and we perform anywhere from one to three songs! \"Yes, I do feel that there are distinct differences between being a female musician and a male musician. In my experience, women have to work harder to prove themselves whereas men often feel that they will automatically get a gig. When I was younger and participated in classical piano competitions, I always felt that my male counterparts were taken more seriously, even if they had fewer years under their belt. \" Yes I do see differences between generations of women musicians. When I think back on the pieces I studied while taking classical piano, I cannot remember studying one female musician's work. Now, I am pleasantly surprised when I go to concerts and see all female orchestras, songwriters, bands, and conductors. My vocal teacher always tells me to respect myself and my values. She always reminds me that this industry is very challenging and I cannot lose myself or my goals while climbing my way to the top. I give every female musician the same advice whenever I have the opportunity. Every woman is so unique and deserves to have an equal chance in this record business! I always envisioned myself becoming the first female artist to own my own record label, make my own decisions, and create my own side businesses. I am so lucky to say that I am living my dream! I am so thankful for my incredible team and my supportive family. I would love to speak to NPR even further about being a woman musician in 2010. Please feel free to contact me at any time and I thank you for inviting female artists to reflect on this business. The piano is so expressive. It allows me to accompany myself in live performances. It is also a great instrument for me as a songwriter. - Years playing: sing+ machines I'm the leader/ manager/ singer/Video editor ... and I chose the crew of designers& Producers to work with \"on stage: MPC 2 mics one Pad) Kaoscilator @ home: 2 comps + Logic & After FX Neuman Mic Old microphones Neve channel External Reverb Ohmforce plugs & more...\" \"It is different just because it's rare, especially technic stuff, men are amazed/scared/ of you, but it will soon change, because more and more women take over computers.

I would advise any woman starting out in this industry to be confident in their chops, and to dare to be different (i.e. creative). I was never given that advice but find that those female musicians I encounter who are most fulfilled in their craft are those who adhere to those ideals. didn't. signed up for clarinet in 3rd grade, but school ran out of clarinets and had plenty of violins, so that's what I eneded up with. - Instruments: Antoinette Montague Quintet, Jimmy Heath and the Queens Jazz Orchestra, Mike Longo and the New York State Of the Arts Orchestra - Years playing: Vocals I am the leader.

Interpretation is important to our idiom. - Instruments: Seattle Pro Musica - Years playing: conductor Artistic director and conductor. Conducting baton Women conductors are still bumping up against a \"glass ceiling\". Nothing in the world is more fun than conducting! - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, keyboards I am the song-writer and director of the creative aspects in the studio and on stage. I work with equally talented and creative musicians and studio producers who share my creative vision. I rely on my own research and the experience of my management and record label, both of which are parts of Autumn Tone Records. I play a Gibson Melody Maker Reissue through a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe Amplifier I think that women are often pinned down to either an organic sounding singer song writer or a sex symbol. It's similar to the Madonna/Whore dichotemy. But, bands like The Kills, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sleater Kinney, and Rilo Kiley have made my journey easier because they refuse to be simplified down into one cliched expected emotion of a female human being. Fans and press treat them like artists, not female artists. All artists want, male and female, is to be perceived as artists, not cartoons. I would tell a woman artist the same thing I would tell a male artist, which is to work tirelessly on your art, the rest will take care of itself. \"I began playing the guitar because I looked up to guitar players like Neil Young.\" - Instruments: Steeleye Span, Maddy Prior and the Carnival Band, The Maddy Prior Band, and a few others. - Years playing: vocals Steeleye is a democratic band, which means decisions are never made, just arrived at. In the Carnival Band there is an MD (Andy Watts) but I am always referred to in the overall direction. Whatever PA we are using. I use in-ears sometimes too. Otherwise I avoid gear! I have always felt that we share the same human problems of being away from home and working in a small group. Other than that individual personalities count more. Of course I've only ever been in a band with a woman in it and I suspect all male bands have a different ambience. Certainly all female bands(which I have only recently worked in) are very different. Much ruder. My daughter, Rose Kemp, is much more focussed and dedicated than I remember being. She works hard at her skills and is aware of the business aspects. But it's a much harder road for them now. When I began it was a much derided 'why don't you get a proper job' type career, therefore not heavy on competition, but now it is seen, mostly mistakenly, along with sport, as the way to riches. I'm sure many people did, but I don't remember at this moment. Someone said (my Dad, I think) that you should try to do it for the work and not look to the reward. I think music needs to be something you HAVE to do in this climate or leave it alone. It can break your heart. I worked a week in a Wimpy Bar for \u00a310 and did a gig on my own with a banjo for \u00a38 so I figured I'd try it for a while. That week was the only work I've ever done. - Instruments: The Great Danger - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Accordian etc We are quite democratic although I am often the organiser. We all make decisions together in the studio and about business stuff. We have an influence over marketing decisions but our manager and record labels have most control - we are signed to indie labels that we trust to make good choices though. A cheap black electro-acoustic guitar and a Fender telecaster thinline \"I think the fact that we are a 3 piece with 2 girls has softened the blow of a strongly male dominated industry but we still often find ourselves stupidly outnumbered. When females are doing well in music it is often seen as a trend or referred to in that way which means that it is passing and that what is popular will soon return back to males as though that is the equilibrium. Although a lot of journalism is lazy, I think female musicians bear the brunt of that to a greater extent - we have been compared to most current successful female musicians at some point or another and the fact that it is even possible to do that is worrying. \" I think that with our generation there is less of an element of rebellion in being a female musician, it is seen less as woman breaking into a mans world - although the balance is still woefully off. There is a level of support amongst our female peers that is noticable but I don't know whether that existed in previous generations, probably it did in certain circles. Don't be overwhelmed by all the boys, use it to your advantage. Have a list of influences to throw back at a journalist who compares you to a musician just because she is a woman it will be intensley satisfying. Singing because I was good at it. Guitar probably because I think its cool. Everything else I play - the accordian, ukulele, percussion - is usually because there is one lying around or because its needed in a song. - Instruments: Colossus, Azeem ,dj Bella , eyezon, kiki (bpitch records) - Years playing: Vocalist/emcee/engineer/producer I am the Jill of all trades. I front the band, I mix and arrange music and vocals, I do most of the pr and marketing and booking for my shows. I design most of my press material. And I write for several other artist. \"Full band drums guitar keys synth bass two vocalist\" I think the terrain is difficult for anyone that makes the choice to persue music As a career and much like anyother profession there are overtones of misogyny, however the opportunity for women to sustain a successful career in music exsist. I keep hearing people say things like there aren't that many female emcees out there and I would bef to differ I toured with 45 all female act through out europe all of which could compete with the likes of your top 40 male emcees. I hear people say you must sell sex then we see folks like janelle monae, they say you must be beyonce then you see people like nneka. I believe that as with any thing artist having access to resources and media can change the perception It's insane how vastly Different and how much the same the generations are. We Imulate but duplication is impossible, certian emotion is born of communal struggle of time and world events. I think we are lacking human connection and real musicianship. Now a days people get a beat sing a song make a YouTube video and viola! Instant fame not much artist development involved anymore. Be good at what you do. Or don't bother . And it's 10% talent and 90% the relationships you make. So that bridge you burn could be one you have to cross, don't make Any enemies they will show up with out any prompting. And don't do anything you can't live with in the pursuit of fame. I was born into a family of musical artsy folks it was very natural that I sing. I began emceeing at 15. Becoming a producer was more out of necessity and desire to be more hands on with my projects. - Instruments: 4 or so. I started playing viola and bass in a band called the Hissyfits while also performing with a music collective called Anti-Social Music. In 2005 I formed Demander and also did a little touring and playing with World/Inferno Friendship Society. Demander has been my full-time band for about 5 years. - Years playing: bass and vocals (and sometimes viola) I'm the songwriter but I develop the songs with my longtime drummer/partner. I keep the songs focused and heading where I think they should go but I love collaboration and seeing something evolve with other musicians. In the studio I'm pretty hands-on but I've worked hard to allow for criticism and change while recording. Business is split between me and my partner - nobody should have to take that on alone! My viola is as old as the hills - it was my sister's before me and I've had it 20 years. My bass is a Music Man copy that one of my old band mates customized for me years ago. I play through a Gallien-Kreuger speaker and head. It's always going to be different for women because any woman is going to go in the \"woman\" pile for journalists, labels and even the audience. Especially if the vocalist is a woman. And I think you can choose to embrace that or ignore it. I've always thought of myself as a musician and not a \"woman musician\" specifically but you only have so much control over things and you'll sometimes end up in the \"woman\" pile whether you want to or not. I think it's best not to think about it at all unless you really want to be considered a \"woman musician\" and play that up. One thing you can't ignore, though, is that women wanting children have to look at a music career differently than men. That's a bit of a game-changer. Not so much. I think it's easier and more accepted for women to be musicians now, but I think the courage and skill that it takes to succeed are the same. I've gotten the best advice from friends and there are some quotes that I return to for inspiration. Most of them aren't even music-specific, they're just ideas that resonate. I think whether you're an artist, architect, novelist, musician, inventor, philosopher or what-have-you there are things you have to work through to keep yourself committed to creating things. It takes a lot of bravery and, sometimes, delusional positivity. I played viola because of my older sister. I chose bass because I really love to create strong musical foundations and work in the darker, fuller registers of that instrument. Singing was a natural extension of playing since it allowed me to create entire songs alone. - Instruments: (self) - Years playing: guitar, vocals CEO. Front-woman, producer, tour-manager, publicist, agent, assistant, bus driver, et al. Greenfield Guitars - acoustic (preamps, cables, pedals), Microphone (cables, eq) There must be a difference. Although, never having been a man I don't have a very clear picture of what that is. I do know, from speaking with my male peers, however, that some of my female peers (and myself included) have had more difficulties dealing with male music business \"professionals\" in negotiating performance contracts. Is it possible that women musicians and women in the music business are taken less seriously than men? Perhaps. There are HUGE differences in generations of musicians. Primarily in the number of us doing this crazy thing. In a way it was easier for former generations in that, if you were ambitious and were very talented, you could get a lot of support (labels, publishing, etc.) only because there were far fewer players to compete with than there are now. In a way it's easier now, because of the accessibility of resources (venues, agents, djs, publishers, etc.) despite our numbers. Constantly! The best bit of advice I can give is: Keep doing this. ... if you LOVE it. Don't ever stop because you're afraid you might not 'make it'. Don't ever stop because you feel pressure from others to 'make a living'. Keep going, if you LOVE it. Keep going, if there's nothing else you could ever do to be happy and fulfilled and satisfied. If living your fullest self means living your music, than DO IT! Ambiguous, I know, right? It chose me. Before my ninth birthday when I received my first acoustic guitar, I would stand on the vacuum cleaner using the handle as a microphone, and a tennis racket as a guitar. All my stuffed animals were in bands and played gigs with each other... It seems like I was meant to sing and play the guitar from the get-go. - Years playing: guitar, keys, vocals I manage a local band called Buttercup, and they own their own imprint called Bedlamb Records. I help make a lot of executive marketing and promotional decisions, but also micromanage down to making sure merch gets sold at shows, and all the mics make it back in the van when all is said and done. Takamine 530cs, Taylor 114ce, Studio Les Paul, Gibson Epiphone... Ibanez TA35, \"I think everyone is more critical of you musically speaking when you are a woman... I've always felt like if I wasn't gifted enough to play my instrument, it wouldn't matter if I could sing. \" I don't. \"If your music doesn't impact you, it won't impact anyone. The way you present yourself is how people see you, and if you're presenting yourself as someone you aren't then that's what people will see. Don't fake it, commit to it. It's a hard lifestyle. \" I didn't take the guitar seriously till I was about 12... when I was gifted a nice guitar, and I decided I loved nothing more than to sing and play. - Instruments: Susan and the SurfTones - Years playing: Guitar, Bass, Drums Leader, front person, business manager, songwriter, producer. The buck truly stops here. \"Fender Stratocaster Hofner bass (Beatle bass) \"\"No name\"\" drum kit\" \"Yes. I have to work very hard to constantly prove myself as a guitarist even though I've enjoyed worldwide acclaim in my small subgenre (instrumental surf music). I do not sing. I do not dress in any manner to gain male approval. I am an electric guitarist. I play without effects. I play \"\"old school\"\". In almost every crowd I've played to I've heard some male voice say \"\"a girl playing surf guitar...this I've got to see.\"\" No male player faces comments of that nature. This was clear to me from the very beginning. It made me a better player.\" I see differences in generations of musicians. Younger players don't want to put in the work it takes to master an instrument. This is a general statement. There are exceptions, I'm sure. With today's technology, it's different for younger players. My first guitar teacher encouraged me way back in 1965 when girls just didn't play Stratocasters. Without him I don't know if I would have developed that early confidence so many female players lack. My advice to younger female players....get tough and stick with it. It belongs to those who stay in it. I saw The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 and my life was changed. Really. - Instruments: I am a solo artist - Years playing: Vocals \"Band: I am co music director and lead singer Studio: co-writer and principal performer Business/Marketing: I work with a manager and have a very firm say in all business and marketing decisions. If I am not interested in the venture, it doesn't happen. I call the shots for my career, but do have 3rd party insight/guidance with regards to all decisions. I think it is very important to have a few perspectives in all decisions before you make the final call. We as artists can be too emotionally involved in something to make an accurate judgment on of our own accord.\" \"Live gear is a Sure SM57 I co-own my own studio and we have the following gear: Mixing/Mastering gear: Monitors: Volume Controllers: * Crane Song Avocet * Dangerous Music Monitor Controller * SPL Phonitor * Dangerous Music AKG K701 * Sennheiser HD 800 Dynamics: * Manley Stereo Variable-Mu * Crane Song STC-8 * API 2500 Stereo Buss Compressor * Chandler Limited Equalizers: * Cranesong * API Dual Equalizer * Avalon Design AS-2055 * Millennia NSEQ-2 * Inward Connections DEQ-1 Software: * Weiss SARACON\" \"Absolutely. This is still a sexist and ageist business. How many 50+ year old women do you still see getting the same chances or opportunities as men of the same age? VERY few and far between. Either that or women get so sick of being judged by age and looks alone that they give up. I am sure it is not the same for all genres, but for commercial sounding music age and looks is almost first concern when doing business deals. I also feel that we women get 'told' a lot more by fans and industry people alike what we should be doing and how to do it. They don't ride men as hard. They are more free to just be themselves as artists. We are constantly told to conform to something. Another thing I find is that it is much easier for a guy to tour, especially if he is a solo instrumentalist. Being a woman, you have to be so careful on tour and it can be unsafe at times. It is also more costly as as a woman you are much less likely to sleep in your broken down van on the road... it's just not safe.\" I can't answer this as I don't know a while lot of older female artists. \"One of the most valuable pieces of advice was about retaining and exploiting my own publishing. I've made my living from placements of my music in film/TV/commercials and if I had not learned about publishing, I think I would have had to take a day job that was not music related to feed myself. As for advice for women just starting out: 1.) Don't sell sex as your main appeal. You will age and in this business older than 25 is OLD! So be sure to sell your musicianship instead of your booty and breasts. You may have short term gain, but your career will not last long if you 'sell sex'. 2.) If you can write or co-write your own songs, do it! Learn about publishing and how to exploit your songs to earn income for yourself. 3.) Be careful of pretty much any man who approaches you to 'make you a star'. They generally want to bed you and will discard you once they get what they want. There is no instant stardom. 4.) Get to know the BUSINESS. Don't put your career into the hands of anyone else but you. Yes, get a good team around you, but make sure that you end up with the final say. 5.) Listen to your gut instinct, it's usually right!\" It was the one that I had been naturally gifted with and quite honestly in my family there was never money for lessons so I did what was free to study, which was voice. Eventually I ended up moving to California and got a scholarship to study Speech Level Singing method with Dave Stroud and Seth Riggs. I also studied voice at college. It's just what I was drawn to the most and had the most passion to practice! - Instruments: Chop Chop, Pagoda Red, Larkspur, Ounces of Bounces - Years playing: guitar, vocals, but mostly the computer I am my band! haha. I think I should actually be called gigantic art/music project coordinator. I engineer my records and record who ever comes by - I have a few people who are pretty regular - my friend Christy Cheng mostly. And then I get the album mixed and mastered by other people. I have people whom I discuss business and marketing decisions with and I'm following music marketing and business leaders - Ian C. Rogers and Mike King on twitter, for instance. And I've hired publicity companies to help with record releases in the past. I work in Protools 8 with Reason on an Imac. I play a Gibson SG - I also have an array of drum machines and musical toys I've gleaned from craiglist and ebay. \"Oh dear. That's a huge question. I would like to say there isn't, but yes there is. I do think I have been passed over a few times with certain bands I've wanted to join, only once overtly. Pretty annoying, but I have so much work to do on my own, I don't need to waste time dwelling on that. I've pretty much come to the conclusion that there are no barriers to really getting the work done once I put my mind to it. The female artist I truly look up to is Kathryn Bigelow, who went out of the movie industry's typical funding system to get her work done, followed her passion and didn't let obstructions to her path stop her. And worked hard for YEARS. But this is a process that can be applied to both female and male artists, a point she has made very clear in her interviews. In music, women are among the leaders in the evolution of publicity and marketing - especially on the internet. Zoe Keating, Melissa Auf Der Maur, Amanda Palmer are real innovators and push me to really take advantage of the new level playing field that is the internet. \" \"My close friend Jussi - aka Liz Enthusiasm from Freezepop gave me great advice the last time I saw her - she told me I need to just keep on working. She is also a great example of an artist who really holds onto and appreciates her fans. And my brother has always told me to jump on opportunities when they present themselves. I would tell her not to be intimidated by fancy talk or impressive titles - and to focus on her vision and her work. And save your money, because records are still expensive things to do right. \" Honestly, I was just singing in bands, but my brother - who has had a bit of success in the music industry, told me I would never get any respect as a musician if I didn't really focus on an instrument. I enjoyed guitar and the challenge of learning. Keys I've always played a little, but guitar became my focus. Somehow this has evolved into self-producing my own records. - Instruments: Clock Work Army, Indian Moon, The Muslims, Calico Horse - Years playing: vocals, piano, guitar In Calico Horse, I write, record guitar, keys, vocals, some percussion. When playing live, I sing and play guitar. \"Live: -Fender Telecaster -La Patrie Motif parlor nylon string -Boss DD-6 Digital Delay Pedal -Boss SD-1 Super Track (haha) -Garageband (haha)\" I definitely think being a woman musician is different from being a man. I think it gets you noticed quicker but it definitely has its pros and cons. First, people are quick to lump bands with women in them together. While on tour, we were paired up with several local acts who had women in the band--regardless of what the music sounded like. I wouldn't care if our bands worked well together, but it was almost as if no one cared. I want to avoid becoming some sort of spectacle. I'd rather people walk away from a show saying \"That band was good\" rather than, \"That girl band was good\". I feel like I have to prove myself more as a woman because I think people tend to assume that the only reason I'm in bands is because I'm a woman. Hopefully, when they actually listen to the music, they'll realize that I play music because I'm passionate about it. Yes. But I don't think that it pertains to just female musicians. Women today are expected to be both radio and video friendly. People care more about being seen than being heard. It's not their fault, it's just the way our society is today. On the other hand, I think that the independent music scene has done wonders for women. Because there are more and more independent bands and musicians, there are more and more women in music. We are becoming leaders of bands and being accepted within those bands as equals as our male band mates. \"I haven't had any heart to hearts about being a woman in the music industry, but I have learned a lot from some well-seasoned musicians. While recording the Calico Horse album \"\"Mirror\"\", I had some really cool talks with Pall Jenkins. He's done so much and been so many places and played with so many amazing musicians, but he's the most humble guy I've ever met. If you're ever at a bar with Pall, you can tell that people know who he is, but he's cool with just sitting with you and drinking a beer. I also had the pleasure of helping my buddy Joey Barro (The Traditionist) record his album at Tim Bluhm's studio in San Francisco. Tim's also one of the most humble and down to earth musicians I've ever met. He wakes up ever morning, goes surfing, then records bands. He's in love with his wife and takes people on nature hikes every summer. If you didn't know that he was in the Mother Hips, you'd just think he was a regular guy. I once asked him, \"\"Who are your music heros?\"\". He answered, \"\"Neil Young and, Barbara Streisand\"\" So rad.\" I started playing piano when I was 6 years old. I learned to read and write music which then helped me to learn other instruments. I moved down to San Diego in late 2001 to go to college. The typical thing to do in the dorms is to learn the guitar and play it on a blanket in the courtyard of your dorm building, so naturally, I did that. I had never sung in front of people until college, so I'm cool with living out that stereotype. I am only a free-lance composer=President of Connecticut Composers, Inc. emerita don't understand this.. Yes..but I need a whole lot more time to tell you about this. I'm always writing music! Yes, gloriously so! I started public school piano lessons at age 7-I play the piano (organ) - Instruments: countless, best known: Alvin Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys - Years playing: guitar, bass, keys, vocals, drums \"I own Natural Ear Music School, est. 1991; it was the first 'school of rock' in the world, and established the template for all the ones to follow, including Paul Green's, Rock Camp USA. www.naturalearmusic.com\" \"I have 5 PA systems, ranging from enormous to tiny. 5 sets of drums, high end. 12 guitar amps, 5 bass amps, a baby grand piano, a Clavinova, several cheap keyboards, 15 guitars, 5 bass guitars, one upright bass, a nice cello, some vintage stuff.\" \"I was never allowed to front a band on a weekend night; I was told by bar owners that 'women don't draw' and was discriminated against routinely. I had great backup, good material and great press. It's just Texas. Even in my school, I have to deal with men looking down their nose at me, however, I have learned to ignore them and simply do my job. They can't help it, apparently, and I no longer take it personally.\" No. \"Think like a man. Don't take anything personally. Don't be afraid to step up and declare yourself a contender. Copyright everything, don't believe the 'pie in the sky' promises or indulge in satisfying your childish fantasies. It's a business.

Fire anyone who talks to you like you are stupid. Don't sleep your way up, it's the quickest way to hell and victimization. Pay your taxes, stay straight with the IRS. Stay in shape and pay attention to your grooming. People are watching you; everything is a test.\" \"I play what I need to play. There are only 12 notes, it's not that hard. I started on classical piano, ended making most of my money in a country band, if you don't count teaching. \" - Instruments: Lots, but they include The B-3s, World's Greatest Sinners, Valhalla Kittens, BrownBoot, Jordan Valentine & the Sunday Saints - Years playing: Vocals I'm in charge, and I like it that way; it took me a long time to own that. I do the booking, I manage the money, I handle the PR. Which is not to say that I'm not blessed to be surrounded by amazing players from whom I learn something every single day. The guys I work with are incredible performers and have played with people I idolize, folks like Roy Orbison and Eddie Floyd... my guys are better writers than me, better arrangers, better engineers; they do this for a living. I like that I have to keep up with them; it makes me a better frontwoman and a better businesswoman. It also means that whatever decisions I make, I better be doing it right. And the fact that they stick it out with me while I steer the ship makes me feel incredibly lucky. Since I'm a singer, I don't have gear per se, but I'm also the bandleader for an 8-piece big band so I get to worry about everybody else's gear. (Especially the drummer, since he's been my partner for the past 5 years. While I love his drumming, sometimes during a 3am loadout I find myself wishing he took up the trumpet.) Its definitely different, in both good and bad ways. As a female musician you're much more likely to get attention for the way you look, good or bad, than a male musician; not that male musicians don't get judged on looks (we're all performers, after all) but the range of acceptability is much much narrower for women and I think we tend to internalize it and potentially let that hold us back. I think Sharon Jones said she held back early in her career because she was constantly told she was too fat, too dark, and too short, and she believed it. I think this is the trap a lot of us fall into. Its also challenging being a female bandleader; I don't think many of us were raised to realize that its okay to demand things a certain way, its okay to be the boss, and yeah, sometimes you've gotta raise your voice. Sometimes I think that male musicians just get to be \"musicians\", where female musicians are always going to be \"female musicians\" and have that qualifier attached. On the plus side, that attitude has made me work twice as hard, so maybe its a blessing in disguise. This might be a small thing, but I've especially seen that women my age and younger have really embraced the 'nerd' aspect of being a musician, which I think is a huge benefit to any musician's self-confidence and self-sufficiency, not to mention their development. When I was younger, there was a tacit sense that the 'girl' in the band shouldn't bother with the technical stuff--the gear, the sound design, the repairs, the geeking out on tubes and tone and everything else. To get someone to show you how to fix something or do something was a lot harder 15 years ago I think. A few months ago I was on Facebook and noticed a rash of my female friends all over the country all discussing how excited they were to learn how to solder. I know a lot of women who make their own electronic instruments, who run live sound, who repair amps, who've built theremins from a kit, who can bore you to tears with a discussion of the merits of flat-wound bass strings just as well as their male counterparts. I think this is indicative of the rise of 'nerd culture' and DIY culture in general, but particularly in the case of female musicians, I think it helps level the playing field. Plus, its damn fun. One of my mom's favorite expressions has always been, \"don't let the bastards get you down.\" I use that a lot. If somebody asked for my advice (god help'm), I'd say the most important thing is to never ever let anybody else tell you what you're supposed to be. And bring a pillowcase full of peanut butter crackers with you on tour. Just trust me on that one. Little Kerri Brown. I was in 3rd grade and we were putting on An American Musical, and all I wanted to do was sing Chatanooga Choo-Choo. I got up and thought I aced the audition, til Kerri got up there with her pigtails and saddle shoes and five years of tap lessons and whupped my little butt.

Over the years I could see that other players who were about the same level as me, had more offers and invitations to play with various groups. This is a long story, I can't elaborate too much here. But I believe there is still a big disparity and many more men than women are still getting the gigs, getting their music played, and this has been shown to be true in the classical world of composition as well. I'm not sure if anyone ever gave me GOOD advice. I would advise a young woman (or man) starting out, to believe in what they are doing, and to internalize only the advice of a trusted teacher or mentor, and let all the rest go. I would explain that not everyone who gives you advice actually has your best interests at heart. Beware especially of those who say \"I'm only telling you this for your own good!\" Chose flute because in 1960 it seemed like an instrument a woman could play.

I do the accounting. cello yes. It's hard to combine a career and raising children. When I was pregnant with my first child.... where I teach, the older women musicians all stayed single and devoted themselves exclusively to music. Younger women seem to want to combine a more rich private life and a life in music. can't think of any valuable advice, sorry....

Girls go out to hear guys in bands and it becomes a boy-girl attraction thing, and often has nothing to do with the music.

It's a lot more accpetable now for a woman to be more than just a singer in the band. However - some things never change.

He wanted me to play an instrument from an early age and I was fascinated with radio and siging along to it. I also liked to perform. He signed me up for accordion lessons at age 7. At age 13 I finally got an acoustic guitar -- it was a lot easier to sing along to than accordion. - Instruments: Evie Ladin Band, Stairwell Sisters, Crosspulse, Rhythm In Shoes, and lots of pick-up bands and one-offs for gigs - Years playing: banjo, guitar, vocals, feet, body percussion I lead a few bands, and follow in others. I have been the business manager, agent, primary mover and shaker, etc. for many projects, and find that the only way to stay busy and financially successful, is to do it yourself. Unless you're very lucky. Banjo, guitar, tap shoes, square dance calling cards, stomp box, cords, sometimes the whole PA system, dance board, merchandise, instrument stand. I think being a professional musician is difficult no matter who you are. I play in one all-gal band and think that facet is intriguing to people, and has a definite appeal. People are surprised we can actually play our instruments, which is frankly insulting! I'm not sure why competent women musicians seem so unusual. The music I play is not quite mainstream, though it is a big subculture, and I feel great being successful as a woman in this field. If anything, women seem more supportive of each other (surprise, surprise) in this environment. I will see women have a tendency to talk more in rehearsal, and men noodle around more...But I'm not sure if there's a big difference once you are working professionally. It depends on what kind of venues you play. I also moreso see differences between people who are professional, and not. I do - I see older women wrestling with the age appeal - I think women \"age-out\" much faster, and it's harder to stay vital and appealing to broader audiences. Men can be physically unappealing and still have successful music careers - this is definitely harder for women to do. As I turned 40 and see the next generation of women coming up behind me, I know I will never be the next young thing to come onto the scene. But the experience I have is so valuable, and translates on stage. Our society is very focused on the young, especially in this business I think it's very hard to age, but I certainly admire the women I know who are working through that. Also I think only in the last generation or so has it been an option for women to pursue this professionally AND have a family - now it is acceptable for a man to assist his partner in pursuing her dreams too, while everyone raises the family. I'm not sure I got specific advice about making my way - I've always jumped in and made it up as I go along. Only recently has music become a career choice supported by the greater society - especially as the technology to make it a DIY career has changed. The one piece of advice I would offer is to be as versatile as you can, and tireless in making contacts. The only way to get work is to go looking for it. Play as much as you can, because that's the fun part. I started lessons when I was a kid and it stuck. I came back to it as an adult, added guitar, and have always been dancing - so I bring the percussive elements into the music. I grew up in a social scene where music & dance is a part of social communication, and this has remained important to me. - Instruments: Ginger Leigh Band (current), The Ginger & Sarah Band (1998-2002), Ginger Leigh & the Front Porch Swing (1996-1999), the Gospel Gang (when I was 9 to 13 years old). - Years playing: vocals, guitar I conduct my career as a solo artist under my name, Ginger Leigh, whether I am on stage by myself or with 5 other musicians. I spend my day time hours (and often evening hours) working on my career as a full time job. I handle all the marketing (multiple hours handling graphic design of promo materials, online social networking - facebook, emails, blogs, etc). I work with one or two other non-exclusive booking agents, yet otherwise handle all of my scheduling. I create and edit videos for my music. I raise funds for recordings. I market my new CDs and handle all the logistics of the release. I manage all of my touring (national and international). \"I'm not much of a gear geek. Ironically this should be one of the questions. I recently listed my Gibson SG electric guitar on ebay. A man who was interested asked me a few technical questions about it, but I was out of town and away from the guitar. I told him all I could and that it was a standard American-made SG. I later received a raging note from him about how as a GIRL I shouldn't quit my day job and try to be a musician, because obviously GIRLS don't know anything about gear! Ha ha. I thought it was hilarious because music is my \"\"day job\"\" and I just so happened to be far away from the guitar at the moment. It doesn't matter at all, but it struck me that there might be some serious resentment from a handful of males out there when women succeed at being musicians. Maybe it is a female characteristic, but I had a lot of emotions attached to the instrument so after my response, he apologized and offered to purchase the guitar. I, of course, refused his offer. The last person I would want owning my guitar is a guy with a phobia of female musicians! That being said, I play a Martin D-16 Rosewood acoustic and a Schecter electric and a Fender Strat electric. My electric guitars are played through a Peavey Tube amp. I use a handful of guitar effects petals made by Boss and I also run my vocals through two effects boxes (one is a Digitech harmonizer and the other a Boss Delay). My feet end up tap dancing through most of my songs as they control all of the effects. Lately, I have played more of my acoustic guitars, but when I have the right venue for it, I love to bring out the electric guitars as well.\" I can't blanket answer this one. There are many men and women who do the same things in the business, but from my experience I see most of my female counterparts managing and juggling all aspects, whereas the majority of my male counterparts have management and agents who handle most things for them. Maybe that's the case of women being able to multi-task better than men? Maybe it's because we are care-givers and men are typically used to being cared for? I am not a black and white person, so it's difficult to say that there is ABSOLUTELY a difference, but I do see this happen more often than not. Another example is that often when I go to play a venue for the first time, the person setting up the stage almost always expects that I will want to sit during my set. Is is that they expect female musicians to be girly and gentle? Do they expect guys to \"\"rock out\"\" and females to sit ladylike? I am not sure, but I certainly like to rock out! A very evident moment was back in the mid-to-late 90's when the Lilith Fair craze was happening. I was very excited one evening when a representative from a major record label was coming to see me perform. Afterward she expressed how much she LOVED my music, but that the label wasn't signing anymore \"female musicians\"....The market, I assume, was over-saturated with female music. What strikes me as interesting is that there is rock, pop, country, hip-hop....and then \"female music.\" So \"male music\" is just simply music at large, while \"female music\" is its own category. Or at least is was at that time. I have to admit that sometimes it can be an advantage, such that there might be a special female music hour on a radio show, highlighting those of us who happen to be female. On the other hand, if you are, for example, on tour and requesting an interview on that same station on, say, Thursday, you can sometimes get the response \"Oh, sorry, our 'female' radio show is on Wednesday.\" This isn't always the case, but it does happen! Though many things have changed, it's still a \"man's\" industry, so if you're a female wanting to be successful in music, you have more pressure to look much better and much younger than the men. You MUST be the entire package; pretty enough, sound good, dress right, show your flat belly! ha ha... I was raised by very independent, hard-working female musicians, which is where I get my drive and work-ethic, so I don't see a huge difference between my mother's generation and mine, however the obvious answer would be that women who have been in music (for decades and decades) were likely more exposed to things kept from women in more conservative times. Women in music spend a lot more time with men in music, more time on the road, more time in bars, so we're often more exposed to those things than say...a stay-at-home mother, but who's to say she hasn't seen those things as well? I know for sure that my own grandmother back in the 30's and 40's spent a lot of time back stage \"with the boys\" as she calls it and she was much more exposed to a party-lifestyle than most women of her generation, but her parents made sure she was safe and home at a decent hour. Today, it isn't as tough on women, who are allowed to be much more independent and much more learned. My mother always told me to \"be myself and to be expressive.\" She also taught me to go get what I want and to never let anything get in my way. I am very independent, but at a certain point I have discovered that my boldness can also be to a fault. I'm not sure how to put this, since I am a strong feminist, but ladies, let the guys help you carry your stuff. Make room for those who want to help move your career along, while staying very true to who you are and what you believe in. No need to be a damsel in distress, but find your strength and also your flexibility. Like any business, we will always fight this gender fight. You just have to choose which part of your female power to use without selling yourself short. Be strong, be yourself, but be open to advise and then go forward without stopping. Since I was a child I was a vocalist just like my mother, two aunts, and grandmother. I took piano lessons, like many kids. I'm thankful for that because I believe piano is a very strong basis for understanding music and other instruments. I began picking up my aunt's guitar when I was a senior in high school. I think I wanted to be able to take the instrument to my room. I couldn't really drag the piano down the hall. So I borrowed the guitar and began teaching myself the chords, and soon after writing my own songs. I received my first acoustic guitar as a high school graduation gift from a friend and her mother. I still have it! - Instruments: Regularly, just one - Ellery - Years playing: vocals, piano \"I'm the songwriter and lead vocalist for Ellery. I also do most of the business and marketing for the band: I book all of our shows (with the exception of college events); I also handle any correspondence with other artists' mgmt and agents, advance our shows with venues, send out press materials to local media, contact radio stations, and cover housing and budgets. Thankfully, in the studio, I have a much more laid-back role... Justin is simply built for arrangement and production. He has a fine ear, and his ideas are almost always perfect. So in the studio, I bask in a bit of Recording Ignorance while he leads the way and makes magic happen.\" \"I generally write songs on the ancient, out-of-tune upright that presides over the hardwood floors of our Northern KY living room. On tour, I play a Yamaha P120 - It was built for home-use, but it has a great piano sound. It's also light, and it has built-in speakers - A definite plus for in-studio performances at small radio stations! My husband and music partner, Justin Golden, has been on a years-long quest to find the best travel-able microphone for my voice. After a Shure Beta 87, a Neumann, and a few others, we've landed with a Heil PR35, which feels like a solid fit. (Thanks, Heil!)\" \"Being one half of a man/woman duo, I've had the opportunity to see how people respond to Ellery differently, depending on which of us is the \"\"face\"\" of the band in a given moment. On the business side, I often feel as if the music world is easier for me than it would be for Justin (my partner). A lot of male venue owners, booking contacts, and promoters can be rather brusque with male artists, as if they need to make sure they establish the pecking order. For instance, some folks have spoken to Justin defensively, harshly, assuming he's going to treat them poorly... I'm guessing these guys DO often get treated poorly by artists, so we can't blame them. But then those same people, not realizing I'm connected with Justin, will be kinder, receptive. So as a woman, perhaps I present less of a threat. I find that folks can be a bit more accommodating for me, more open to my ideas, and more lenient if something goes wrong. I'm sure that part of this is based on the idea that I'm a \"\"weaker sex,\"\" but if it makes my job easier, I don't mind. :) But the \"\"who's got it easier\"\" thing can definitely get reversed. If there's conflict or a misunderstanding about contracts, sound needs, etc, sometimes I'm treated as if my requirements/needs as an artist don't matter, and I'm not taken seriously. In these instances, I get the feeling the person is waiting to speak with the \"\"REAL artist contact\"\" (read: any male one). It's frustrating, but thankfully it happens VERY rarely. Which is good to note: We've had truly positive experiences with venues, media, fellow artists, etc 95% of the time. :) The musician community, at least along the scope of our genre, is a kind & welcoming place.\" \"I think women artists in their 20's/early 30's now are more involved in the business aspect of what they do, allowing their creativity to seep into marketing, graphic design, social networking, etc. Of course, this is largely because MOST artists are getting more involved in their business, what with the possibilities of the internet and the decline of the music industry and its ghosts of labels past. But I also think the music industry reflects the overall cultural trend toward a more powerful female professional. An independent streak, perhaps. I love when we connect with other female artists of our genre who are around our same age. There's so much we tend to hash out other than music: We talk about funding, licensing, promotion, pitching songs, merchandise, marketing, anything you can imagine. And so many of these artists are brimming with fabulous ideas! When I speak with older women, I get a sense of their wisdom, their earned ease with their profession and with their audiences, and of course brilliant, brilliant songwriting. I wouldn't trade those interactions for anything. But I do think they're often less involved with the particulars of the career, and this difference is fascinating.\" \"Two things have been vastly important to me/us: 1. On the practical side - Someone told us in the beginning, \"\"Don't go into debt.\"\" So our mantra has been, \"\"If we need it, we'll have the money for it.\"\" In other words, if you're at a place in your music career where you need a fab tour vehicle, great sound equipment, or amazing merch, you'll be at a place in your career where you can afford it. If you can't afford it, you either don't *really* need it, or you're not being smart enough about how to get it. (Borrow, barter, pare down, recycle!) There *have* been times when we've had to front money for business purchases, but it's always with a trepidation; debt should never feel easy. :) And we've always had a plan to make it back - For instance, if we're buying CDs, we're also planning their publicity, and a tour on which to sell them. 2. One of the most important things we've heard for our music (and our lives) is from our dear friend, photographer Michael Wilson. He said, in his quiet, hesitant way, \"\"You just have to go out there and say, 'This is who I am; this is what I do.'\"\" I don't remember what he was referring to; I seriously doubt he was speaking in that instance about Ellery. But the words have certainly stayed with us.\" \"My dad was a pastor, and he had four daughters (no sons, poor guy), each of whom he insisted take piano lessons \"\"at least until you can play the hymns.\"\" It was strategic (when would he ever suffer the absence of a church pianist?), but I have to give him credit - It roped us in. I also confess to idolizing my oldest sister, who was (and still is) a fabulous pianist and made it seem thoroughly glamorous. I think in the beginning, I practiced piano so I could be like her.\" - Instruments: I've been a recording artist for 21 years under my own name on major and indie labels. - Years playing: Guitar, vocals I just finished producing an album of nine women. I love to produce, and have been doing that since 1989. As a label owner, I'm in charge of writing, creating, producing, arranging, getting rehearsals structured and back up bands together; I'm in charge of art direction for not only my cds, my other packaging I help art direct through Stingray, a design company I co-founded with four other designers/photographers. I set up mastering, replication, and distribution, whether digital or hard product. I also teach songwriting/creativity classes at festivals and am signed with International Speakers Bureau for public speaking engagements. I oversee contracts, whether I'm licensing (to Martha Stewart, film/tv, American Idol) and I am involved in writing/singing on regional/national commercials, from Wal-Mart, Daisy Sour Cream (I sang on their commercials for 8 years) to Southwest Airlines, etc. I also have served on the board of The Recording Academy and helped with talking about industry related issues in schools, at SXSW and through creative consultanting for other musicians with questions about how the industry works, from copyrighting to publishing to lawyers and management. I have a Takamine endorsement, so I have about six acoustics. I also have a turquoise Wildcat (electric hollow body) from my Gibson endorsement. I just got a new pedal made by Mark McQuilken that I've yet to try----he's getting different artists to try them and give feedback. I have a 1960's blonde Guild hollow body that I've had about 25 years, and I utilize a Martin, the limited edition 150 year celebration model signed by C.F. Martin, in the studio. \"Yes. I mostly work with men, and I have to speak clearly, directly about what I want. I've learned to be bold and not care what someone thinks because I have a ton of experience and I deserve the right to be heard and respected. I'm fortunate in that I've worked with the best of the best, so I've learned how to speak up, but, in the beginning, it was maddening. Becoming a mother made my job more difficult only in that I am the breadwinner, and I do my best to be a creative mini-mogul AND carve out quality time with my children/husband/family and friends. I think I've managed to do a pretty amazing job. I think I have the respect of my peers because of the body of my work, and the ability to produce quality work. I think the biggest moment for me, as a woman, was one day in the studio, about 16 years ago, I was reaching for a fader to change the level of a single track, and the engineer reached over and slapped my hand. I was aghast, and it showed me that, sometimes, no matter the experience or the aptitude, some men are still going to see you as inferior. I've had to deal with men on the phone that were narcissistic and completely rude. I've had to deal with people trying to fondle me and I have been attacke on occassion---after a show, after a rehearsal. I've learned to be aware of my surroundings, to ask for help loading/unloading gear, and I don't let the actions of a few men measure the value of all men. I can say that there are a lot of women out there who are just as maddening, but that's a different story. I do know I am grateful that my husband is a stay at home dad, and that he has come to help me run this business, whether answering the phone, helping to set up interviews, set up rehearsals, overseeing our stock and mailing out product to Amazon, etc. It seems more men have their wives helping them then women have husbands helping them, but that will, and is, changing. \" \"Yes. When I started, it was me, a manager, a high falutin' attorney and the major label. I actually started my first record as an indie and licensed to Elektra, which was a big deal at the time (thus, I still owe the master). If you weren't on a label in the early 90's, no one wanted your product in their stores because it was all about distribution/sales/numbers. I fought to produce on my first major release, especially when the producer was in Hawaii working on another album simultaneously, and I was left in L.A. putting the record together. I questioned why he was getting paid the big bucks (and getting points) when the engineer and I were actually arranging/doing the work. As a result, I ended up with credit and the ability to produce, fully, the last three songs on that album. I feel like young women today are more savvy about how the industry works, they are starting younger, getting in bands or doing their own solo thing, much more involved in the business aspects. They've watched and learned from us, whether they are aware of it or not, and it's cool to see them be musicians, not \"\"women\"\" musicians. I think that is all we've been asking all along...just label me a musician, who happens to be a woman. Lastly, I enjoy singing about issues that are important to me, as a woman, that a man may or may not understand, and I think younger women are hip and confident to sing about those issues, too. The level of talent is astounding and flourishing at an unheard of rate. Women help one another, we network, we are a large sisterhood. That's been a big sigh of welcome relief for me, cuz like I said, in the beginning, I was one of a few women working/making it in the industry, and we were all doing our best to have singles/be on VH-1, The Tonight Show, do radio tours, whatever it took to stay at the top of a male oriented game.\" \"Peter Himmelman once said to me, \"\"Just be yourself. Don't let others talk you any to anything. The way you are creating is amazing.\"\" And Lucinda Williams brought me on stage when I was stiffed by a club owner to perform before the bar had even opened...she heard what had happened, and at the end of her performance, while the club was packed to the nines, she introduced me as her FRIEND (we'd just met) and had me come up and sing to an awesome, enthusiastic crowd. She shared the moment with me so graciously; I've never forgotten the awe I felt from her unselfishness and caring. I would say to a woman musician starting out: surround yourself with women you admire, even if only in recordings, and network wherever you can---festivals, conferences...and be yourself....be bold in sharing your work....send thank you notes...ask LOADS of questions...imagine yourself where it is you want to be, and everytime you are on stage, make it your best performance possible. Take constructive criticsm, mull it over, and take what is true that can help you grow. Listen to a variety of music and practice, practice, practice. Keep a journal. Ask to open for women you admire. Don't ever, ever,ever give up----even when club owners say you're fat or an audience doesn't respond or a label turns you down or someone doesn't like your song---all that just makes you stronger. Play music with people better than you. Listen to what people are saying around you at conferences, you'll learn a lot. Take notes. Expand your horizons and never be afraid to try something new with your voice/lyrics/sound/music. There is room enough for everyone, don't let anyone tell you different. And, lastly, you don't have to be a household name to make a career/living on what you love to do. Do what you love. Be happy. Enjoy the moments. Make your songs an extension of who you are....you're the only you that will ever be and YOU MATTER. Thanks, Sara Hickman, Official State Musician of Texas for May 2010-May 2011\" \"The guitar became my best friend at age seven. I could mimic what I heard on the radio, and I started with a strict jazz instructor who taught me voicings, tablature and to think in a broad, musical spectrum. I credit him with teaching me picking variations. I've traveled the world with my guitar(s), and they help me through good times and bad. I always turn to my guitar to express myself. We're pretty married, I'd say :)\" - Instruments: 5! But only two seriously... \"The Story\" and my solo band (Jonatha Brooke.) - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, bass I'm pretty much the boss. My husband is my partner in the label. So all business decisions are joint. but anything artistic has my print on it. I'm the songwriter, arranger for the most part, producer, (at least for the last ten years.) two olson acoustic guitars. two guild acoustic guitars. vintage 60's student model wurlitzer. yamaha motif. fender fretless and regular basses. baritone Jerry Jones guitar. custom baritone acoustic guitar. custom mandolin. first guitar, martin HD28. various guitars people have sent over the years...... When a deejay in seattle asked for the bra i was wearing on the cover of an album in exchange for adding my single to the playlist, it was pretty clear what the difference can be. On the other hand, I have always maintained creative control over my work, even in the early days, I had enough good people around me advising me not to give up my publishing, and I had enough of a sense of myself not to pursue some imaginary brass ring at all costs.I am lucky to have the respect of my peers, so no one looks sideways in the studio when I'm coming up with parts or running a session....it's my own demons i have to keep in check! I do see a lot more women really taking technical charge of things. recording, engineering. That is the best. What's a little disenchanting is the way the visual part of marketing women artists, at least main stream pop artists has become so sexualized, - we don't even blink at really violent disturbing images any more. takes so much to grab the diminishing attention span these days. Keep your publishing. Keep your pants on. Go to college. There's a lot of crap out there, so if you don't HAVE to do it to breathe, to survive in your soul... then find a real job. It's really hard to make a living now that music is for all intents and purposes, free. I was infatuated with my camp counselor Mindy Jostyn when I was ten, - she played and sang so beautifully. So I begged my dad for a guitar until i got one for christmas when I was 13. - Instruments: 3 - sleepy still, The Stennis Way, Night Driving in Small Towns - Years playing: Keyboards, Vocals Currently, I am the band manager, booking agent, lead singer, butcher, baker, and candlestick maker. In the studio, I take a backseat to my co-writer, Colby Wright, who is the recording guru, but we are co-pilots in the writing aspect. I am the chief person responsible for business and marketing decisions. I discuss these decisions beforehand with the band, and with my (female!) publicist, Marcela Gonzalez, and my (also female!) label manager, Kerry Gibson. I play a mini KORG onstage but also have several keyboards. \"It is very, very different. If you are a strong, independent woman in the music scene, you are often labeled as a \"\"b****\"\" or a \"\"diva,\"\" whereas a man displaying the exact same characteristics is often labeled as a \"\"go-getter.\"\" I am very much a go-getter, and I seriously dislike the labels I've often been given as a result of being a strong female. Additionally, there is almost always the pressure of being \"\"presentable\"\" when playing live or meeting prospective business connections. I am often dressed to the nines while the men in my band look like they just woke up from a long winter's nap. Lastly, I often find myself in conversations with people who assume I'll \"\"just give up\"\" when I'm \"\"ready to have a normal life\"\" or family. I find this viewpoint not only sad but misguided. This is my normal life, and my family and friends are the people I surround myself with now. I'm a very stable, hard-working person with advanced degrees (a Master of Arts in English), so I don't appreciate the \"\"unstable\"\" preconceptions that come along with telling people \"\"I'm a musician.\"\" There have been many moments that have made the difference between being a woman and being a man in the music industry clear to me, but one in particular sticks out. I had a conversation with someone (who will remain nameless) who encouraged me to stay single so that I would still \"\"appeal\"\" to male audiences. I am in a stable relationship with my boyfriend of over five years, who is also a musician, and I have the same expectations and hopes as every person in a stable relationship. It truly hurt me to think that I would not be \"\"appealing\"\" to male audiences because I had a ring on my finger, whether my music was enjoyable or not.\" Yes. I feel that a lot of women in my generation and the generation directly preceding mine come off a lot harsher because they struggle so much to be successful while still retaining the characteristics that make them distinctly female. It is very difficult to retain your femininity in a way that, say, Connie Francis did. Instead, we have flashy, oversexed, photoshopped versions of what women are supposed to be; and on the other side of the scale, we have hyper-masculine, overly made-up, trans-gendered versions of women. Some may say this is a result of women breaking out of the patriarchal machine, testing the limits of sexuality and gender roles. But it may very well be just another female survival mechanism inherent in the music industry. \"I have been offered handfuls of advice from males and females alike. My mother is one of the strongest people I know, and she gave me the best advice ever when I was just a little girl: \"\"Do your best. That is all you can do, and that is good enough.\"\" If I had to offer advice to a woman just starting out in the music industry, it would be this: Work your ass off. Ignore the stereotypes. Never give up and never give in. Work with people who respect you and appreciate your time and talents. Get out there and do it and don't ever regret working to achieve your dreams.\" We had a piano in my house growing up. My mom played piano while she was pregnant with me, so the joke is that she instilled it in me before birth. I remember clunking away as a kid (there are pictures of me sitting on her lap around age 2, clunking on the keys). I started \"really\" playing around age 7 or 8. I remember the first song I learned, which was \"Sandman's Lullabye\" (not to be confused with \"Enter Sandman\"). - Instruments: FM Belfast, Hairdoctor - Years playing: vocals I sing. I write lyrics and melodies along with the others. I take care of the bookkeeping and I take care of merchandize ordered on our website. We all take equal part in marketing and business decisions so I would say my vote counts as 1/3. Microphone I think it\u00b4s different because most of the people you will meet in the industry are men or boys. Making music isn\u00b4t that different between genders but I think men are usually less critical about their work. ... Can\u00b4t think of anything. Don\u00b4t sign anything you haven\u00b4t read. If you don\u00b4t understand it, get a lawyer. Be yourself and try to ignore that you are in a male dominant industry. There is usually a woman around the corner that you can talk to and most of the time they are happy to talk to you. Because it seemed right. - Instruments: A dozen. Christian! Teenage runaway. Fight bite. Dirty diamond. Neon Indian. - Years playing: Synthesizer I am tour mom. I make sure no one dies at gigs. I make sure we leave on time and that all my boys have beer on stage. On stage I hop around like a fool. In The studio I am writer but admit I know nothing about gear. That's my biggest failing. I own multiple guitars but my toy keyboard collection is my real pride and joy. I own tons of casios. My best piece though is not a toy but a Juno 6 synth. eBay. Everday. I am often asked if I am traveling with the band or the bands manager or someones wife. The oddest was being mistaken for the bands makeup artist...? Like I have the job of making three 20 year old boys look like they haven't slept or showered in three months??! I wish I had some older women to discuss this with. To stereotype I guess women have busted out of the lead vocalist role. More of us are bassists and lead guitarists than ever I would assume. You must proove you're a superhero to be taken as an equal (to your male counterparts). Put all of your energy into what you love. be kind to all. Play every note with authority and conviction. If people still think Youre pretty good for a girl or you're eye candy or that you must be dating someone in the band you've probably made it. Keyboards are the most avaiable and the funnest and most versitile. - Instruments: it depends on the year; Lisa Lorenzino Trio; Vortex Jazz Flute Summit; various concert choirs; concert bands, pit orchestras, etc. - Years playing: flutist My participation as a female jazz musician is my secondary job. My role in any band that I play in is organizer of all events, as not a lot of people call on jazz flute players: you as the flutist have to find your own audience. I make all business and marketing decisions myself. The same goes for the studio. My gear! As a jazz flute and sometimes classical player, my gear is myself, my Sankyo flute, that I have had for 30 years, and that is about it. My addition gear includes a great bass player, and a wonderful piano player. This is something that I really want to look into in my research here at McGill University. In fact, I have applied for research money from the Canadian government to get started on pursuing this task further. I think that being a woman is very different in the music business. But I really rather enjoy it. I have learned to navigate the male dominated world of jazz at a relatively later age in life. I personally would have found it very difficult to do this as a young girl. I therefore want to be involved in research and programs that encourage girls to be involved in jazz. Specifically, I want to assist music teachers so that they can learn to encourage the girls. So many factors in society, in families, amongst peers, are working against women. In my role, as a teacher of music teachers, I hopefully can make a difference in helping to break down gender barriers for women in music. \"Yes and no. I saw Marian McPartland (spelling?) talk about being a woman in jazz at a semi-professional jazz camp on the West Coast one year. It was a panel discussion about women in jazz. Frankly, I found the entire thing to be very very interesting. She said something profound, that really affected me positively. The day that we don't need forums for women in jazz is the day that we have achieved equality. Also, she said that the music speaks for itself. I agree with this. That said, I have not felt discriminated against in the field. I have spent 15 years of my life also as a high school band conductor, often considered to be a male oriented profession. The men I worked with were wonderful. I think however that the previous generation of female musicians set the groundwork for me regarding this zone of comfort however and I thank them for this. Each generation, it gets easier; that said gender biases I believe still do exist. I am thrilled however to see more orchestra conductors on the podium who are female. This is excellent. The young girls today are so much stronger and sure of themselves. I find the gender issues getting smaller each year. I am proud of the female jazz musicians at our school and the women working in our community. That said, I find the men, in general as well, excellent to work with. As a teacher, I love educating other and anything that I can do to educate about gender equality and music, be it through my classes or through my writing, I feel is important. \" \"This is exactly what I want to look at with my research as well. Valuable advice however can be either positive or negative. I think one of the best pieces of advice I was ever given, and this is not just about the music industry, but about life in general, was just to go out and do what you love; because you love it,you will do it well. This is my general life philosophy and I have been fortunate enough to be able to do so. My advice to women just starting out in the music field is the same- just do it. It won't be easy, and neither is it easy for the men in the field. Find supportive people, find wonderful role models, play with the best musicians, practice, play what you love to play, look to all things in life for inspiration and just keep on doing it. PS I would love to know more information at to what prompted this survey as it is an area that I am very very interested in. Please also inform me when this information will be broadcast, Lisa\" Honestly and truthfully: because I thought it was the neatest band instrument because of the way it looked. It was shiny and you got to hold it sideways. That was very appealing to me. It had nothing to do with the sound, the size, the repertoire or anything like that. All visuals. - Instruments: see above, but formerly in Galaxie 500 (1988-91) and since 1992 in Damon & Naomi - Years playing: electric bass, vocals, keyboard Now I play in a duo with my husband. We are equal partners musically, both doing songwriting and singing and playing of instruments. In the studio he does the recording and engineering and in business he deals with the distributors and the labels. I do all the graphic design, web design and upkeep and selling of merchandise online and at gigs. I guess we are a real cottage industry. \"Bass: 1968 cherry red EB-2 Gibson bass. Amps: Ampeg B-12, B-18 fliptops and Phil Jones Suitcase amp. Keyboard: Nord Electro 3\" Starting out playing in rock clubs in the late 80's there were some women musicians but many fewer than now. And I ran into much more sexism, but I think that was just true in the world in general. A sound engineer at a club once asked me sarcastically if he had to show me how to plug in my amp. But I think in the 90's so many women started bands and played in bands and the times just changed. Now often we go to a club and the sound engineer IS a woman. I really think any differences are very parallel to social differences in the generations in general. My mother-in-law is a jazz singer, and she talks about the men jazz musicians treating her just like \"the girl singer\" and not a real musician at all. And I see the younger generations of women just taking it for granted that they should be treated exactly as men. But probably for my generation, we were very aware that we had the right to be treated equally but it was not always the case that we were at the time. I really don't think, at this point that I would give a woman any different advice than I would give a man. . .It's a lot of work, a lot of fun, and a lot of disappointments too. You have to do it for yourself because the financial and emotional rewards are not things you can ever count on. I started out on electric bass -- and I thought that playing basslines was like singing -- it was like another voice in the band. The band was a classic trio line-up: guitar, drums, and bass -- and they needed a bass player! - Instruments: Just me solo and the Ettes, really - Years playing: Lead vocals, songwriter, guitar I'm the boss. They call me hoss. I play a knockoff Tele made by a company called Jay Turser, who repeatedly ignore my requests for a sponsorship, considering their guitars aren't made well and mine is so busted, it's on its last legs. But I like it, it's light and fits my tiny, tiny hands. They should totally give me a sponsorship, I'm the only person I know who plays their crappy ripoff guitars! I run that guitar through my baby, a vintage Sears Silvertone 1484. I don't like pedals, so that amp gives me everything I need, via tremelo and reverb, as well as cracking good gain. I'll be buried with that amp. I always knew it wouldn't be easy. I'm a girl, I'm also tiny small, short and small and I can't lift very heavy things. And I knew I'd be treated differently, less-than. So I went in with that knowledge and just ignored it. I said, okay, if people need me to work harder for them to appreciate me as an artist, an individual, then I will work harder. They called me \"pistol\" growing up. If you want to live and extraordinary life, you have to work extraordinarily hard; it's only fair. You can quote me on that. I don't! The old guard, if they can see it in your eyes, how hard you work, how well you do your job, that you're not expecting anything to be easy, they warm up immediately. We recognize our own, regardless of age. My mom warned me that I was going to have to work for people that were stupider than me, and they would make more money than me, but that I could get my job done by saying, \"I don't care who gets the credit, only that it gets done.\" Find me a woman who doesn't think that's a good strategy to get what you want from men. Make 'em think it's their idea, oldest trick in the book. Because singing without something in front of you is scary, and I need a weapon. A weapon that makes sounds?? Awesome! - Instruments: too many to count - Years playing: electric bass guitar I'm a self-employed musician with a long career. I've had long associations with various groups, house bands, etc., some of whom have had management making decisions. In many cases I get hired free lance for gigs or sessions as a bass player, and people know what I can offer a project. I have to manage my career as a whole on my own. I currently tour and record with Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women, and play and record in Austin with several bands. \"I own 6 bass guitars, 3 of which are vintage, also a vintage Telecaster guitar and a new acoustic guitar. I have an old Kay string bass (upright acoustic bass) I just bought a high end Genz Benz bass combo (amp and 2 speaker cabs). I have a computer software system for making song demos.\" \"Big question! There weren't many female bass players when I started out, so people tended to remember me, which is a bonus. That's still the case, but there are many more women on bass now, which is a great trend. Early on I decided that I had to have enough musical ability to leave no doubt that I was serious. I wanted to dispense with the \"\"isn't that cute\"\" response from the downbeat, using good musicianship to eclipse patronizing attitudes I knew I'd encounter. Still, one has to develop a sense of humor to deal with ignorant remarks. \"\"Was there a moment that made a difference clear to you?\"\" Plenty of them, such as not getting hired for tours because wives or girl friends of the band members felt threatened, or because bringing me on tour would cost more if I got a single hotel room instead of rooming with a guy. Or club owners claiming that they can't hire acts fronted by women because they won't draw a crowd - and then seeing that in some markets this may be true. On the plus side - a big plus - women who see me play, especially when there are other women on stage or an all-women band, make a point of telling me they feel inspired by what I do.\" I think the punk scene changed things for women, in that \"oddness\" was encouraged. People accept women \"rocking out\" now more than they used to. It's seems that music has benefited too from the general shift in attitudes towards women. I can't recall a particular mentor or any specific advice. Here's mine to others, corny as it is; believe in yourself and do the work to back up your belief. I was drawn to the bass. I heard it, felt it, and understood it's role at about 13, when I started listening to the radio with concentration. I played the cello in junior high and high school. - Instruments: many, chamber music, rock and jazz - Years playing: flute and sax I play soprano sax in my jazz band, but tho most important activity in my musical life is composition maybe because I liked the sound - Instruments: The Rosebuds - Years playing: guitar, keys, vocals, drums \"I am half of a two-person song-writing team. I write music and lyrics and collaborate on the same with my partner. In the studio I find that I act as director and producer more than I would have thought years ago. I'm endlessly creative, and naturally bossy, so I've found a niche for myself with this business. We both have our own areas of strength in the business to which we've naturally gravitated. My strength is communication so, on the business side, I do most of the behind-the-scenes work of interacting with the manager, booking agent, record label, licensing team, publicist, merchandizers, et cetera. We have built a really great team but it takes constant contact and coordination so I'm the girl for that job.\" \"I play multiple instruments both live and in the studio. My gear ranges from a glittery gold accordion, to an Alesis keyboard, to a pink Barbie piano and beyond. Creativity is the focus and that takes a lot of weird instruments.\" \"No. My experience may not be typical, but I have surrounded myself with a team of really talented men (mostly men) who view me as an equal and who are open to my creativity. My creativity, though I do not see it as necessarily feminine, must be informed by my femininity in some ways, but the main story isn't man/woman in our creative life, it is nurture/nurture. We've been able to create a nest within which our business can thrive and it is more about caring for the project by pushing one another's ideas forward to their logical (or weird) conclusions. In the business world, I've never, in all of my meetings or interactions, felt my being a woman created an obstacle, though I don't think that's your question. In reality, I think those in my world respond to ideas and I'm bright/intelligent enough so men (music business is a man's world) appreciate and admire that in me to a degree that maybe neutralizes our obvious sex differences. Having said all that, I occasionally find myself dressing for the show in front of men, sharing hotel rooms with men, brushing my teeth with a couple of men hanging around brushing their teeth. My femininity is apparent, as is their masculinity, but we all acknowledge the situation for what it is--probably not a conventional lifestyle but it works for us.\" We played a show with Ronnie Spector. We played a show with Superchunk. In both cases, the women are perceived as respectable and powerful, because they present themselves as powerful. However, the divide between generations couldn't have been more apparent in those two situations. Ronnie Spector was \"handled\" and treated as precious, fragile while off stage. She was very protected and maybe she's developed a need for that protection from her experiences (being married to Phil Spector couldn't have been easy!) whereas Laura Ballance from Superchunk... I don't know how to put this... she carries herself. I remember telling her when we first played shows together that I thought she was a positive role model for me because, though she is friendly and kind, she is firm, strong, and very direct. It was clear to me that these would be the tools of survival. \"I've always studied women (and men) that I respect and I try to identify what it is that makes them successful. It is usually ethics and their approach to business that I notice first. I do want my band to be wildly successful, but it has to be our own way. To be respectable in business is more important to me (than bling or whatever) and so I aspire to those goals. My advice is to be active and present in all aspects of the creative and business life of the band. If you are making truly valuable contributions, you will remain happy. And your gender should not become an issue so long as you do not make it (or use it) as one. It is easier to be a successful woman in this business than outsiders might think because, at least in my band, we are all working together so feverishly for better, more intense creative expression in our project that we forget to see our differences. Or we burn them for fuel.\" Instead of a honeymoon, my husband and I started this band just for fun the week we got married. We were just hanging out at the house and he started playing the guitar so I grabbed a keyboard, which was the first instrument I had on hand. - Instruments: Anthony Braxton Quartet- 10 years, Reggie Workman Ensemble 10 years, Barry Guy BGNO (10-piece ensemble in Europe)- several years; many other performances with musicians in Europe, Canada, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand - Years playing: piano In my band, I'm the leader in the sense of choosing the music, the order of pieces to be played, etc., etc.- in most other situations, whoever gets the gigs and composes the music is the leader, although in ALL these situations, the musicians are equal in terms of importance, pay, etc. No gear- I play acoustic piano, and at home I have a Yamaha electronic touch-sensitive piano I can play with headphones since I live in an apartment underneath another tenant. I don't know since I'm a woman, and not a man. I would guess it depends on the personality of the individual- I think any women who have made their way out there in the jazz/improvised music realm have been talented and confident, and more or less committed to what they were doing- I do think that it's more common today to see women performers, particularly on instruments other than voice or piano- also, there seem to be a lot of wonderful women composers on the scene today in all the realms of music. The best advice I ever heard was to follow my heart and not give up, not be discouraged by setbacks or failures, and that's the advice I would give to anyone starting out today. My parents decided to start giving me piano lessons at age 7- there was already a piano in the house. Band leader. Also, I'm co-producer, chief cook and bottle washer. Shure SM58 microphone In Jazz, women have traditionally been more accepted as vocalists. Women instrumentalists seem to have a few more challenges, but I believe that the best in the business judge a person on their contributions to the music and not on gender. The generation of women before us, paved a smoother road, making this career choice easier than they had it. I'd let them know that while this career can be extremely satisfying, it is not without sacrifices, often personal ones like marraige, family. It's probably not impossible to \"have it all', but it's certainly improbable. Vocals are the best way to express myself. The use of lyrics and improvisation give me the best of all worlds. - Instruments: one band regularly and constantly - jucifer - Years playing: guitar, vocals i'm in a married duo and we have a very equal relationship as far as decisions. our writing is very balanced too, even though at times one or the other of us takes the lead. i'm the driver, tour manager, band manager, and financial director wall of amplification!! over the years has manifested as anywhere from 10 to 20 cabinets... currently 14 cabinets, mostly bass gear although i play a guitar. lots of ampeg cabs and some other oddities... lots of gallien kreuger and peavey heads along with an ampeg 5-pro and a marshall monoblock. it is different because our status or equality is still questioned both in the world of music and the world at large. there have been many moments where i knew that my gender was a hindrance or threw my ability into question. i have done innovative things as a musician that were overlooked when i did them but then credited to men who later did something similar. i have been singled out for my appearance more often than for my music. in 17 years i've seen some improvement, but the double standards are still in place. younger women seem somewhat less conscious of gender inequalities, because things have improved. this can be good or bad... sometimes both at the same time. i read an interview with madonna in the eighties where she said that you shouldn't pursue a music career unless it meant so much to you that you'd die if you didn't. i think that's excellent advice. to women specifically, i'd say: don't judge yourself or shape yourself to male standards. often we feel pressure to live up to something - consciously or subconsciously we know we're criticized more because of our gender. i'd advise women to play for themselves and not try to emulate anyone else. the creative act of making music should remain individual and free. it shouldn't become an exercise for the sake of gaining equal treatment - which doesn't work, anyway. i loved the sound of strings and distortion...still do! writing and making awesome sounds was always my first goal. singing was an afterthought, but i've learned to enjoy the range of texture and emotion that my voice can add to the songs. - Instruments: Shanna Carlson Quartet, Hugo Wainzinger Ensemble - Years playing: Vocals/Piano Depending on the project, if its my band, I'm the leader, handle most of the business and/or marketing decisions. In the studio I'm usually a co-leader. \"Prefer acoustic pianos to play, have a Yamaha P120...88 weighted keys Shure Dynamic Mic AXS2\" I think years ago there was a much different atmosphere, but now as far as I can tell, if a woman knows her music, is prepared, there generally is a mutual respect and cooperation. Perhaps the women of the younger generations are a bit more \"at home\" with their music and gender. Of course, I think of women like Mary Lou Williams, for instance, who was writing and playing for and with \"the boys\" YEARS ago, had a long and wonderful career. I think the best advice is to know what you want and hear inside, practice till you can communicate that to other musicians, don't back down from YOU...be yourself. But, if you don't fit where you are, start your own music...solo, or group. Be convinced in your own heart that you are presenting what comes from deep inside. Started out in church and piano player was needed. Everyone sang, some, like me, were able to sing solo, duet, etc. without shaking like a leaf...it seemed natural. - Instruments: francis dunnery,ron sexsmith - Years playing: piano,guitar,vocals \"I have no band, unfortunately. It surely would make life a little easier in terms of having someone other then myself to bounce things off of.... In regards to business and marketing of my first album- when it came to the album cover design, t-shirts, etc I had free reign. When it came to money being spent, WHERE and HOW it would be spent- it was up to everyone else, as they are the kingmakers. Or not, as it were.\" \" Epiphone acoustic and spanish/classical guitars, Yamaha and ( a -not a for my ex-husband)\" \"As Andy Williams once sang, \"\"Where do I begin? to tell a story that is older then the sea?\"\" Heres' the poop. I /We are not allowed to grow old, you see. A man, doing the same kind of music as me, the same age as me, with the same 'units sold' as me- will be allowed to be pock-marked, balding, chubby, beard-y,sporting coke-bottle specs and paying no mind to his receding, graying hairline or increasing flubby waist-line. He will NOT be asked his age in music magazines, because it is not even a question. He's a man. All these supposed above listed 'flaws' - and let me be clear, personally, I DONT find them flaws- the press and the media will celebrate these things in men with descriptives like, 'he /they' are 'moody, charismatic, brooding, cerebral'. Not so if a woman. In fact , of the above 'physical flaws' ( the only current- day exception this argument being Beth Ditto) if female artist had the above physical characteristics they would be 'refused entry', end of story. Not to be bitchy, but let me proffer examples- From Badly Drawn Boy, to the The Hold Steady, Bon Iver, Elbow, Doves, Fleet Foxes, etc., and that is just the 'newer' bands in town. Dont start me on SHane McGowen and the over-50's... Show me the female, middle-age equivilent of The Hold Steady? Doesn't exist, could'nt exist. They wouldn't get through the front door. My ex publisher said something telling to me once when we were discussing an artist whose work was similar to mine in vibe, potential and 'units sold' even - a male artist who was the same age and being given some breaks I was struggling to get- he said 'listen, He's a man. He's allowed to grow old. Nobody wants an artist who's a 'grown woman' looking back at them. It reminds them of their mother.Thats just the way the music business is.\"\" And when you think about it, he's right. The 'industry' wants the Laura Marlings ( who i love, btw) and Amy Winehouse and Duffy, et al, to be the ones preaching songs of 'experience' and 'worldly wisdom'. AT 19 and 20 years of age!! Its simply absurd, but that is the preferable package. But men! - they can be young, they can be old, they can be grizzled, fat and drug-addled( RIP Eliot Smith and Mark Linkous and Kurt Cobain) - it ALL adds to the allure. Dont get me wrong- the 'exceptions to the rule', ie, Beth Ditto, Adele, etc DO give me hope. But they are young. And that will always prove the winning hand. Middle-Aged female artists- ( and by that, in this business I mean over 30)- unless you are in country or opera- you are generally farmed out and more often then not wind up simply drifting away- either from record company disinterest and funding, or the music business simply lets them know, eventually, and in no uncertain terms, they have outlived their 'sell-by' date. That said, if your very lucky you just might wind up at 46 like Sheryl Crow or Courtney Love. You might have lost youf relevance, but your as is front row at Dolce and Gabbana during Fashion Week.

Sing and write parts on the Wooden Birds record(s) and hope to participate on future Matt Pond PA records. Involved in music video production for both bands as a director/editor & head up merch for both bands. Also working on a solo record I hope to record this year, playing all the instrumentation myself. Fender Tele Thinline guitar, Fender Blues Jr amp, assortment of Boss pedals including Tremelo, Delay/Reverb, Overdrive, EQ Absolutely, at least in rock and roll, which to me, has been a male dominated field since its inception and still is. Guys seem to become attracted to rock music at a younger age and thus start learning rock instruments, such as guitar, early on, which gives them a head start on their skill level. Ever since I picked up a guitar, I knew I had to keep up with the boys from the start which motivated me to practice constantly. I've been told I play guitar better than many guys, which is a compliment. I play a lot of lead guitar now in my bands and it's amazing how the response has been geared towards the fact that I'm a chick doing dude's work. Touring constantly the past year has opened my eyes to how much of a boys club music really is. I'm okay with that, but I feel like there's a little extra effort for me to prove that I can fill those shoes and not just be in a band because I'm a trophy girl, but because I'm a good musician. \"Yes, thanks to the growth of music accessability via the internet and the increase of females in music playing primary roles rather than something ornamental like a cute token chick bass player, I think more and more girls are starting off at a younger age getting into music and learning instruments. There also seems to be a flux of classical instruments in bands lately, such as cello and violin, instruments that girls typically begin playing at a young age.\" The best advice I've gotten: be yourself and be true to yourself. Advice I'd give: make as many friends in music as possible (sincerely, not 'networky'), don't burn bridges, don't sleep with your bandmates (unles you were sleeping with them first), and warn your bandmates when you're hormonal. Guitar and voice are my current primary instruments. My dad, Joan Jett, The Go Go's, Heart, & The Bangles played guitar, so I wanted to. I began playing piano as a little kid, then flute in school, then cello, then guitar. My dad didn't originally want me to play guitar nor be in a band because he thought guys in bands would try to get in my pants. He had a change of heart when he heard me sing and now he's my biggest fan. - Instruments: Ruby Falls, Retsin, The Naysayer, Cynthia Nelson band - Years playing: guitar, bass, vocals, drums, piano, flute I am a reluctant band leader because I write songs and sing them but work better in groups of creative people. In the studio have ideas about arrangement and production but mostly through experience, had little idea or interest in what was involved technically in the beginning. For business and marketing I tend to shy away from it, do things DIY or go with the flow and stay away from corporations. 1980's Gibson SG guitar, 1990's Martin acoustic guitar, G&L bass, Fender amps (Vibrochamp, Hotrod), Ampeg bass amp, 1960's Slingerland drum kit, thrift store piano, student flute, pen and paper, cassette recorder, partner w/many nice mics and preamps and digital recording gear/know-how. \"I am not sure it would be different if there weren't sexism, but since there is... I felt a need to prove myself as being able to play an instrument and write songs rather than just sing words over someone else's music (which I would have been easily able to do, being a writer with a decent voice), but this has probably been good for me to challenge myself to be able to play many instruments and arrange them in songs. It was clear to me that the stress of being the only woman in a band (the guys were kinda mean to me as a newcomer to an instrument, whereas women can be more supportive, although not always) was not conducive to creativity and that making music creatively was my main goal. So I set out to play with all women and be the songwriter. It might be just me but I found it harder as a woman to be interested in the technological side or the details of sound involved in nuances of tone, etc, that is probably just something I wasn't as easily able to teach myself until a lot of time went by and I experienced other people relating to sound in that way.\" Whether or not you have to prove yourself as being a capable player. I think there are enough capable female players now (or they have had exposure) that it's not such a shock for people to see, and/or there's not this assumption that maybe you aren't going to be very competent on your instrument. Now there is possibly more a trend toward showpersonship, dancing, flashiness, production, rather than songwriting or instrumental capability. But there is also a history of women doing lots of creative things within the world of music that aren't necessarily related to \"skill,\" making the most of what you have available to you in sound is a great model. In my feminist rock band we always said, the music comes first. We are feminists, but the music is what we care about more than the feminism. We just want to have our music taken on its own terms. That was good to focus on. Also, the music before the glamour of rock band-ness, etc. Started with bass because guitar too frustrating at first and was offered a spot in an all-male band as \"female bass player.\" Continued with bass in all-female band but gravitated to guitar as it lent itself better to singing/songwriting for me. Learned the drums for thrills and to complete the understanding of rock instruments, wrote on piano as a challenge to self, chose flute in grade school because someone played \"Frosty the Snowman\" on it and ended up being in demand as a flute player on people's recordings after 2000 when it came back into fashion. Basically use whatever works in service of writing songs, and teach other people to play guitar, bass, and drums and how to write songs or parts to other people's songs. - Instruments: Opera houses and symphony orchestras all over the world (Royal Opera - London, Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Santa Fe Opera, Opera Theatre of St. Louis, NY Philharmonic, St. Louis Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, BBC Symphony Orchestra - London, BBC Scottish Symphony - Glasgow, Scottish Chamber Orchestra - Edinburgh, Santa Cecilia Orchestra - Rome, Dallas Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Opera Norway, Boston Symphony, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Western Australian Symphony, Atlanta Symphony - Years playing: classical/opera singer I am self-employed and a freelance artist. My managers help me make business and artistic decisions. One of the most difficult things for me was balancing the role of mother and performer. My daughter Elisabeth traveled with me when she was young and as she got older and involved in sports and music, she didn't want to travel, so my husband took over the parenting duties. Giving up some of those duties was particularly difficult for me. Trying to balance my performing schedule with my family time was always a challenge. I turned down opera roles throughout those years when my daughter was younger and sometimes there was regret on my part. And there were times when I was thousands of miles away from home performing and missing birthday parties at home or my daughter's concerts. Always tugged at my heart and lots of tears. Now that my daughter is grown, it has been easier for me to travel. I am away from home over 2/3 of the year. I think it is difficult for young artists starting out today. So many of the smaller opera companies which are great for trying out roles have folded because of the poor economy. Young artists have more difficulty finding places to learn their craft and also earn a living. I am fortunate, because the type of repertoire I sing is traditionally sung by singers in their 40's and 50's. My career started a bit later, but will also last a bit longer. The more dramatic and bigger voices just develop later. I am looking down the road and planning my next career when my \"limited commodity\" doesn't work the same way! I had so many wonderful mentors in my life ... my mother was probably the first and the best. She was a singer, not of classical and opera music like me, but she told me to always sing with my heart and let myself be vulnerable. I didn't quite totally get that until she became ill with ALS and I watched her young spirit start to die. She was still singing until it was physically impossible for her, and she always sang with gusto and spirit. She took risks and after her death at age 62, I at age 42, finally got what she was always talking about.I also had the opportunity to meet and work with the great Wagnerian soprano Birgit Nilsson. We worked together when I was in my 30's and just getting my feet wet in the business. My mom and I went to Germany and I worked with Birgit every day for several weeks. Birgit and I remained friends and she continued to mentor me until her death just a few years ago. And now I give master classes when I am on the road and quite often meet young women who have budding dramatic voices. I give them the advice that I had early on when my voice was still developing. I tell them to be patient and not to push their voices into the big repertoire too soon. Quite often when this happens the young voices are finished before the age of 40. I try to encourage them to take it a bit more slowly so that they will be singing into their 50's and 60's. I come from a family of singers. My mother sang semi-professionally in a jazz/gospel trio. My mother, brothers and I sang gospel music when I was growing up. I played the violin all through school, but always sang in choirs at school and was in the high school musicals. I went to McKendree College in Lebanon, IL and got a degree in music education. I taught K-12 music for a while, all the time continuing to study singing. My voice didn't start to come into its own until my late twenties and that's when I decided to pursue singing professionally. I got my start in the chorus of the Opera Theatre of St. Louis and that company took me under their wing helping to pay for voice lessons and audition tours, etc. After winning the Metropolitan Opera Auditions in 1989, my career path opened up. I signed with IMG Artists in 1990 and with the London-based management Askonas Holt in 1993. I have remained with these two managements. Alison Pybus is my general manager at IMG Artists and Peter Bloor is my manager at Askonas Holt. - Years playing: One string guitar, classical piano,melodica, organ Lead singer, Im a solo artist Moniter, Mic, bass,guitar, melodica, megaphone, drums, vintage mics, vocoda Yes, sexuality is pressure.

One of the biggest things I have learned and would pass on to any women musician starting out is to find out who you are before you can give the chance for someone else to tell you.\" \"I chose piano because my older brother started taking lessons when we were kids and it sounded so beautiful I wanted to also. Then I fell in love with the intimate sound of an acoustic guitar and decided to pick that up and began playing it. I have always sung since I was 18 months old, so it wasn't really a choice!\" - Instruments: over the years too many to mention . I now work mainly with my own group The Jane Stuart Quartet - Years playing: vocalist I am the leader. That means, my name is on the contract,I negotiate the pay, I contract the musicians that I need for any given gig,deal with the management of our venues, organize rehearsals (always a challenge), am responsible that the needed equipment is there and on time and in tune, make sure that the music (written) is in order and bring it! In the studio it is more of a collabrative effort, except the decisions are all mine. Selection of material and how to arrange it, style, what instruments, and which instumentalists. In the studio, always eager and open for interaction and contributions of ideas and interplay. Marketing...all me. I carry a PA head/amp, 2 speakers, speaker stands, cables, Mic, mic stand, music stand, promo materials, huge book of sheet music, huge book of lyrics and song lists I think it's a little different for singers verses instrumentalists. Generally, more so in the past than now,female musicians were thought to be lesser than males. The answer in general is, yes, woman being downgraded, but it's getting better. There are many woman musicians that are so incredibly talented, skilled, wonderful, that no one could deny it. What I'm trying to say is that it's changing and for the good. I work with, sing with many female musicians,not BECAUSE they are female, but because they are great musicians. As a vocalist, there are a whole bunch of other stereotypes to overcome. Most of all the premise of being dumb. But I don't think male vocalists are considered to be any different. Perhaps the vocalists have it in reverse. Yes. The younger musicians and singers don't seem to have any notions of the stereotypes. Ah! sweet bliss. I did get a lot of support from many people over the years. Thad Jones was a friend back in the 70's and used to tell me to just keep singing. Plan on living a long life, in music...PLAN ON IT. Along the way, just observing and learning from the many truly great musicians I worked with, I learned thhat it's always got to be about the music. Not the money, personalities, the \"getting ahead\", it's about the music. Oh, and save your money. Hah! I was a 'show biz kid'. I started at 5 yrs. old singing \"Me And My Teddy Bear\" on a local (NYC) TV show called the Moser Starlites. I was always putting on little shows on my street, just like in Our Gang Comedies. I really was training to be a dancer and became a very good tap dancer (alongside Christopher Walken) at Charlie Lowe's School of Tap and Personality (NYC). One day they had me sing The Trolley Song and it came easy to me. That was that! - Instruments: 2 Dmadness Project and Blue Blood - Years playing: Vocalist I believe in taking full control of decisions that are made regarding my career. Although I am open for suggestions and constructive criticism. With the band I believe that we all are a team and nobodies opinion should be excluded. In the studio my role is not just sing but i enjoy taking part in the track selection. writing process, and mixing and editing process. Soulful, Melodies, and Jazzy nuances! Live with a 4 piece band! Oh yes I believe there is a difference, the defining moment was when I realized their were no other women on a line up that i was scheduled to perform and wondered why.Later I learned that alot of times women are forced to prove themselves and are held to different standards as men. Its more difficult for women to have the same opportunity as a man even if she has more experience. From that it has made me stronger. My skin is thicker and I will not give up! I do see the differences I noticed that music constantly evolves, but a little piece of history is implanted in every female musician and carried on to the future. Women musicians to me are like fine wine we only get better with time. The reason why I am still thriving in the music industry is only because God has been watching over me the entire time. And he puts people in my life that not only I can learn from but also people to protect me. I have learned to remain humble, give respect where it is do. Encourage the young. And to never give up! Growing up in church I was encouraged to join the childrens choir. I was around 5 years old when was chosen to sing my first solo, I received so much love form that day, I just knew that singing was what I wanted to do and what I was supposed to do. My grandmother still has the program from that day! - Instruments: The Mammals, Sometymes Why, Mike & Ruthy - Years playing: vocals, fiddle, guitar, uke \"Mike and I performed in The Mammals for about 7 years. I was co-manager of the band and did all of the bookkeeping. These days Mike and I try to split the work down the middle but he is the more prolific songwriter and I am the more compulsive business head and I still do all the numbers. On stage we share the musical roles more evenly. Mike's studio knowledge has really grown over the years and now we have a great home studio. I like to do some editing, but he's more knowledgeable about the whole set-up. We're also sharing the parenting at the same time, so it's a very interesting puzzle. \" As a duo, Mike and I sometimes perform in a very acoustic style around a condenser mic. But sometimes I play electric guitar and fiddle thru his old Ampeg tube amp and he plays kick drum and hi-hat while strumming his plugged-in acoustic. That's more of a big sound. \"I have always been proud to be a woman on stage who can do more than just sing and play a tambourine. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) When I see a band with one or more women I am instantly more interested in what they are doing. As an actress it was brought to my attention that the ratio is 5 to 1 female actors looking for work and the reverse is true for female roles available. Why is it so common for a play to be written with many male characters and only one female voice? Maybe there aren't enough women playwrights? In music the field is more wide open for us to write our own play and raise our own voice. That's what drew me back to music. In addition to playing in \"\"Mike & Ruthy\"\" I have a collaboration with two women (Aoife O'Donovan and Kristin Andreassen) in a vocal trio called Sometymes Why. There is something very special about that project which is hard to put into words. \" \"Yes! My mom had a band in the 80's called Rude Girls. They were fun, irreverent folkies who sang bawdy safe-sex ditties, real-life love songs, and the occasional role-reversal murder ballad. These days I don't think we have as much to prove. In my \"\"all-girl band\"\" we don't really make a big deal about our gender and our freedom from oppression. I think we were raised as empowered women and we took that confidence and ran with it. Sometimes I think that translates as the confidence to be vulnerable. Together we create a comfort zone on stage where we can be pretty real. \" \"Hmmmm. Because my parents and most of their friends are in the music business I received plenty of advice good and bad. I think the best advice I got was in my theater training where I learned to breathe and be in the room in an audition setting. I know that sounds pretty basic, but it's easy to forget when you start playing high-profile shows and feeling like you have to impress everyone. It's the same advice I'd give to anybody. Be present. Don't forget to breathe . . . . . . and maybe a couple of tips I got from my Dad over the years, like: Don't burn a bridge if you can help it. Make sure you're still having fun! There will always be high-paying gigs that are no fun low-paying gigs that feed your soul! Get a good balance going and you'll be alright. \" \"My Dad plays the fiddle. His name is Jay Ungar and most people know his tune, \"\"Ashokan Farewell,\"\" from the PBS Civil War series by Ken Burns. I grew up at square dances on the weekends and folk festivals in the summer, so the traditional roots music scene is where I sprouted. Our 2-year old son is now starting to play the little fiddle that I started playing at 4. I say I've only been playing for 12 years professionally, but before that I was a kid with a fiddle who loved to sing. My mom, folk-singer, Lyn Hardy, is now a skilled luthier and lives nearby. We still sing together whenever we can. You might say that I didn't have much of a choice about playing the fiddle and making songs. I chose to be an actress in college and for a couple of years after that in NYC, but I came away from the city with a renewed love for music instead, and a lifelong musical collaborator too!\" - Instruments: 3 or 4 plus teaching - Years playing: violin As a freelance music, my marketing challenge is gettingmy name out there. Fortunately, because I have permanent job in a couple of symphony orchestras, I don't have to try too hard. My main job is tokeep my skills in tip top shape and come prepared to any job I take on. My \"gear\" is a very nice 100 year old violin which I use to perform in a variety of venues: symphony orchestras, chamber music, back-up orchestras for singers who come to town. I am also a private violin teacher. In the music world it is about how well one can play. If you can hold your own, then they can't do much to you. There is a \"good old boys\" club\" in some symphony circles but it is rapidly disappearing because women can play just as well as men. I went into this business with the assumption that there was going to be a difference but the more I became aware of my own power, the less it mattered what others were doing. Yes. The younger generation knows less about how hard it was for the older generation to break into symphony circles. It wasn't too long ago that the Berlin philharmonic had no women in it--not because women couldn't play but because women weren't allowed. The younger generation doesn't remember that time and I barely remember it. \"My initial training as a musician was horrible in terms of how to get started in the business. No one gave me any advice until I was much older. My advice to young musicians these days is to just stay with it. Don't give up. It is hard to get established as a musician. Sometimes it takes years but you must do whatever it takes to survive. Have plans laid out about how you expect to make money while you build-up your music career. Be willing to take on students and give back what you know to them. \" I started out on piano as a child but my hands couldn't reach a tenth. My piano teacher recommended I try the violin. - Instruments: only this one - Years playing: bass I'm the only female in a power trio. in the studio I take a back seat to the main songwriter and producers, listen, soaking in all the info and try to execute my parts as perfectly and quickly as possible. I'm very involved in business decisions and managing the band, as well as visuals for marketing, logos, CD and album artwork, and videos. I directed our most recent music video for the song, Gnat Mesa Boogie 200+ tube amp, Mesa cabs, Richenbacker bass, Tri OD, phaser, and whammy pedals \"there are far less women in rock then men. when I tour, I am often the only female performer of all the bands, and usually the only woman on a package tour. (including crew) This puts me at odds in many ways; having to find separate and private places to change, shower, etc..but the lack of female companionship is also a factor. I usually enjoy the company of the men I travel with, but once I'm home, I need to catch up with girlfriends for hang time, yoga, farmer's markets, that kind homey stuff. I think also, because I am a woman and work our merchandise table after we play, it's an invitation of sorts for folks to come up and talk-I might be more approachable than a male vendor. this is good and bad; it's also an invitation for getting hit on or insulted by drunk patrons. this doesn't affect me anymore. skin grows thick after years of touring!\" I can only really speak for myself here; seeing that I am a middle aged musician, I am a bit more jaded. I don't feel the need to check out all the opening bands like I used to when I was younger.. I am very picky now when it comes to music and what I'll subject my ears to, since most of it's loud with in my genre. I also really appreciate the small moments of privacy and silence on the road. this is a rare gem and I take advantage of it fully. When I first started touring 10 years ago, it was all about the comraderie and partying. I still like to have a few drinks, but sleeping and waking up refreshed is more important. The focus is on putting on the best possible performance which is hard to do when you're hungover. \"I didn't really have any mentors coming up, but we do have friends that started bands the same time as us who are now on majors and playing stadiums. We've made some pretty bad decisions regarding record labels and contracts, managers and booking agents. I've learned a lot from those mistakes and we're still soldiering on. This year, our 12th as a band, will be our busiest touring year yet, with 2 European tours done already and a few US tours coming up. the music industry is up in the air so it's undecided if we'll actually move to another label or release a record ourselves. Advice to younger female musicians? prepare for a life of poverty, but an exciting life of living out your dreams, seeing the world and inspiring others like yourself.\" it's rhythmic, I'm also a dancer so this was the easiest instrument for me to pick up. plus I've always been attracted to women bass players. - Instruments: 4 (Alyse Black, Thursty Love, No Jive Five, Purple Unicorns - my band when I was 11) - Years playing: voice, piano, kazoo, tambourine, guitar, violin artist (vocals/keyboard/piano), songwriter, accompanist, manager, agent, business manager, concert promoter, publicist, radio promoter, recording producer, mixing engineer, concert producer, graphic designer, web manager, admin, amateur lawyer/adviser. I am really starting to own that I own my projects. Which is nice. I'm stepping up to the plate. Nord Stage EX 76. Senheiser e935. Yes. Women ask for less money, so they get paid less. Men are assumed to have more draw then women, and it might be actually true, though I don't like to think so. I think younger musicians right now, particularly women, are finding that they need to be scrappers. They need to grassroots everything. I think many of the older women musicians are more talented and INCREDIBLE. But they don't necessarily want to get involved with the nitty gritty of getting their music out there. And I would be lying to say that there wasn't an industry pull toward youth. Work hard. Work every day at your craft - instrumentally, vocally, songwriting. And get out on the internet. Don't wait for permission to get your music in front of people. And ASK. Keep asking for what you want until you get it. \"No\" just means \"no for now.\" Don't give up if this is really what you want to do. Be unstoppable. The world needs the art that comes straight from who you are. Make the best damn art you can, and give it to us! Piano was the first instrument I sang to as a child with my father playing ragtime-style with me. It is the instrument my voice just sinks into best. But I also love singing to my guitar. - Instruments: Many Big Bands in Toronto & San Diego as well as The Chicago Six & Maple Leaf Jazz Band - Years playing: vocalist \"I usually work with all men on the bandstand and I think being a woman there on stage with them is very important. People like to hear a female voice and to look at a woman, looking beautiful and alluring. Also, I am able to talk to and really relate to the audience. The tunes I sing are always meant from the heart.\" I mostly just use the club sound system but I do have Mackie board and some JBL speakers. \"Well, I am a vocalist so I am sometimes not seen as a musician. I pride myself in knowing lots of great tunes, knowing my keys and being able to walk in anywhere count in the band and have them swinging with me in no time. That is important.\" Yes, many of the new younger singers, sing with a nasal tone. I think it all started with Michael Jackson. Even many jazz singers have that tone. To any vocalists, I'd say, learn to play an instrument, at least a little. Know you stuff and respect other musicians. Sing from the heart and everything else will follow! Just been singing since I was a little girl. I am lucky to be blessed with a sweet voice. - Instruments: Erin Barra (solo), Erin Barra and The Hitters, 3 PARTS ILL - Years playing: Vocals/Keys \"I DO EVERYTHING. With the unparalleled help of those that love me and my music, I manage, promote, book, write, perform, sing, produce, market, style, create, schedule, finagle and hustle my way to everywhere I've ever been. I have a woman that helps to co-manage me and keeps things in perspective, and also have just started working with a publicist (Fiona Bloom). Also I must pay homage to the amazing group of musicians, engineers, producers, DJ's, photographers, stylists, hair dressers, lawyers and fellow artists who have helped me to be the best version of myself. No matter how much I am capable of achieving on my own steam, these people really make it all possible. \" \"These are the three different versions of my live set Solo: I run a vintage Wurlitzer keyboard and my voclas through a Digi Tech loop station and effects processor. From there, I build loops live, effect and mix them - and the cornerstone of all my live sets is my Melodica which I solo on and add texture with. Full Band: Drums, Bass, Keys, Guitar, Me on vocals and Melodica 3 PARTS ILL: DJ droping break beats and sampling records, Guitar player running an extensive pedal setup though both a guitar and bass amp (very tricky) and me on key, vocals and melodica. \" \"Yes absolutely. Playing so many hats in my career, I find the impact of me being a woman in a man's industry manifests itself in different ways. Booking successful shows is hard not only because I'm a woman but because I'm also the artist. (Sadly I haven't had much more success with Male booking agents...). For promoting I think it works to my advantage to be a young attractive woman although probably not in the long run. Either way you look at it, from a negative or positive perspective (which I believe there are both), it really comes down to how you conduct yourself and the type of people you choose to surround yourself with. It's always about the network and body of work. As long as those two things are in place - cock or not, success is in your own hands. One time, I cried at a rehearsal. Never again. Women get a bad enough rap as it is for being emotional, which in some cases I absolutely agree with and in others not at all. It's our biggest asset and heaviest burden. But I think of it like this; why do men buy expensive cars and fight wars? The answer is between my legs and that knowledge if powerful if used wisely. \" \"I can only speak for my own generation but I imagine the pressure to have a certain body type and be attractive wasn't so omni-present in the past. But at least you don't have to make good music anymore right?!?! I joke\" \"I would say this to any musician, not just women and that is to enjoy every step of the journey - every rehearsal, performance, lesson, conversation and obstacle that you encounter. Take your mind off the final goal of whatever it is you seek to accomplish, (I'm almost certain 100% of musicians end up someplace different from their initial destination), and cherish the journey. If you are able to make music at all then you are a blessed individual, so take the pressure of success off your shoulders and don't judge yourself. Just BE and be your best - the rest falls into place and you'll be a sane and happy individual for it. Specifically for women - keep your emotions in your music and out of your business \" \"My parents put me in a music pre-school that led into piano lessons. I've never stopped since. I didn't start singing until I was about 17 - just out of sheer necessity because I needed someone to sing my songs. \" - Instruments: Bellevue Philharmonic, Tacoma Symphony, Spokane Symphony, Boise Philharmonic, Mid Washington Opera, Wenatchee Symphony, Yakima Symphony, Sylvan String Quartet, Swan String Quartet, Federal Way Philharmonic, Spokane Opera, Seattle Rock Orchestra - Years playing: Violin and Viola I'm the Manager- owner- violist of the Swan String Quartet and make all of the business and marketing decisions. As a member of the group I make music decisions with the rest of the members. \"Italian Violin made in 1794, maker unknown Modern Italian Viola made in 1967, maker Umberto Lenaro\" Less than when I started. Not among the strongest performers. Come prepared. Arrive early. Be gracious. Don't gossip. Be friendly. Be a team player even if you are the headliner or leader. The violin I chose in high school after trying many instruments and the final approval of my violin teacher, Edward Seferian, (a Julliard graduate teaching at the Univ. of Puget Sound). The viola I chose post graduate while studying with Alan Iglitzen, the original violist of the Philadelphia String Quartet. He had brought a number of instruments back from the East Coast and this is the one I chose. - Instruments: Elgin Sym., Chicago Philharmonic, Grant Park Symphony, Florida Symphony, Omaha Symphony , Hong Kong Philharmonic, Sioux City Symphony, South Dakota Symphony - Years playing: violin Violin Section, I am also the personnel manager of the Elgin Symphony. I hire the substitutes, payroll, details \"1981 Helmut Keller Violin, Tubbs Bow 1985 Whedbee Viola\" No, not really. I feel that there is almost no gender bias in my work, although there have been occasions where I have been hired to play in an all women orchestra. One such instance was for the drug company Merck, who was putting on a presentation about a new drug for women. I think they can get away with that, but if it were to be an all male orchestra people would complain big time. Not so much, although I think there are many more women than there were a generation ago. This is a very difficult career, especially if you want to have kids! The hours are tough, and if your spouse is also a musician the babysitting gets very expensive. It is very satisfying, though, if you can make it work. From my earliest memory I wanted to play the violin. - Instruments: I either play solo or with my own band that I've put together. - Years playing: Aside from vocals, I also play guitar, piano, harmonica I'm the leader of my band, solo or in a group, and very much involved in my business and marketing plans. I do have some people working with me on my team, but I love all aspects of what I do too much not to take a large role in everything. I have a beautiful Taylor 714-CE that's been taking a beating onstage for a long time, my dad's 1965 Martin D-35 that he bought new, a very young cherry red Gibson 335, a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard, and various harmonicas. Plus an egg shaker or two. \"All I have to do is look at my own music collection and see the disparity of men to women (about 70% male) to know that there's a difference. Rock and roll in particular was always thought of as a man's world...I think the first time I realized that the music industry was more male-driven was one of the first times I went into a studio. The engineers and producers, even the assistants were all men. And they were all SHOCKED that I brought instruments and could play to a click track!! Even now, when I go into a rehearsal with new players (who are almost always men), I wonder, Am I going to have to prove myself? Are they going to be skeptical? But the world is changing, evolving, everything shifts...Look at Cindy Blackman (Lenny Kravitz' drummer) and Julie Greenwald (one of the two top people at Atlantic Records)...We're everywhere!\" I think that generational differences exist between women musicians just like they exist between people everywhere. As artists, we reflect our world, our cultural and political experiences and histories that precede us...I think women as a whole in the music world now are more confident, more likely to dive into any realm they want, without fear of reprisal or unspoken rule-breaking. And it's because of women like Joni Mitchell, Tina Turner, Madonna and some other heroes that I dove in too. Absolutely! My mentor, Chuck Plotkin (producer for Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan) coached me relentlessly to live, breathe and sleep the songs I love...He taught that they would infiltrate my subconscious and in turn help teach me how to write songs that work, songs that stand solidly and can't be knocked down. It's the best advice I've ever gotten--works for a man or a woman. For women specifically, I would also say--be kind, don't be a pushover, and always--ALWAYS!--accept help carrying your gear. :) I played piano for a couple years when I was a kid, but then I let it go...When I was studying abroad in Spain I thought, Why not pick up a guitar? What better place to learn? So I started taking lessons in Madrid! Plus guitar is so easily transportable, and I always felt sorry for drummers. :) - Instruments: 20 (+) The Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra, The IJQ, Project O (with Gary Versace and Seamus Blake), The George Schuller group, Circle Wide, The Mingus Big Band, DIVA, The Christine Jensen Jazz Orchestra, Darcy James Argue and Secret Society, The Vienna Art Orchestra, The Jensen Five, The Terri-Lynn Carrington group, The Beata Hlavenkova band (Prague), Nordic Connect, The Maggi Olin Quartet, The IJQ West, featuring Dawn Clement, the Jazz Rainbow Coalition, the Christine Jensen Quintet. - Years playing: Trumpet. \"I am either the leader or co-leader. In the studio, I am the producer but not in an upfront way. My bands and the music we make, is very democratic and organic in it's function. In business I keep things very basic. If big decisions need to be made, I will mull them over with my husband or with my friend Maria Schneider. I had management for a few years but am now handling everything myself. Fortunately I am in a unique position in which all of my work comes to me. I make all of my marketing decisions and they are very strict. No mention of (my) gender, no big deal made out of the potential freak show element, etc...No Women in jazz festivals.\" \"A custom made Monette (gold plated) Bb trumpet. Dave Monette himself. TC Helicon voice processor,original VOX Wahwah pedal, line 6 delay unit and a number of very good mics. \" \"A French bass player I used to play with once said that the only difference between male and female musicians is the obvious. Our organs! (she actually said \"\"we get periods, they don't\"\", it was classier when she said it in her lovely French accent) There may be some social stigmas and ingrained behavior based on one's upbringing, but I don't find that there is any scientific proof that legitimizes a difference between me playing a solo on an F blues and a man doing the same thing. Nor do I think there is a difference between a female opera singer verses a male opera singer. The difference in the eye of the beholder. It is merely a matter of education versus ignorance. The big moment of aha to me was more to do with the race issue (me being white and sounding like a black man from New Orlean's- as a famous musician once said upon hearing me, without being able to see me). Because I was raised in a very female heavy music program, my early impressions were that women and men could play well and have careers, as long as they practiced.\" \"absolutely. My generation and many of those older than me were put in positions to prove ourselves against the many men in the limelight. Now that there are more role models for the younger generations, both male and female student players have more hope, faith, dream potential, whatever you want to call it. \" \"I never had the drive to become a big star figure, like my hometown superstar and former role model Diana Krall did, so the industry was and is something that exists on another level for me. I dislike much of what it does to people's impression of success and moreover, how that success idea gets in the way of of artistic freedom, honesty and all out strong music. My mentors were (and are) all adventurous people whose advice I took from their integrity filled projects and honest characterizations of themselves that they portrayed passionately through their music. To all younger players, especially the female ones, I advise getting a good teacher that can help them play their instrument well. Invest thousands of hours into listening, transcribing and playing with everyone possible (both peers and players at higher levels) and make sure you really love music. You have to love it enough to get over the many highs and lows that the long road of self-discovery had laid out for all of us.\" \"I did not chose it. It was forced on me. Something to do with a spunky,feisty attitude that my parents and band director noticed in me at a very young age. Trombone was my first choice but my older sister already had chosen it. thank GOD!\" - Instruments: several -- currently one, but have played with several including Tjovi Ginen (Haitian), Patrice Williamson (jazz), In the House (cover) -- played with many \"sitting in\" but not a \"member\" as well - Years playing: percussion(including african and caribbean drums, african harps and \"pianos\"), flute, cavaquinho, vocals I am founder, band leader, one of the vocalists, and lead percussionist for Zili. Right now I am manager (would love to pass this role!!) and booking agent. I have co-produced our first two albums with our engineer, Gabe Herman; but we mixed together as a band.. We collectively (8 women) make business and marketing decisions. The gear that I use in Zili Misik: congas, bongos, a bag of smaller percussion (including different kinds of bells & rattles and flutes), udu (clay pot -- makes a water sound), flute, cavaquinho (a four stringed instrument from Brazil & Cape Verde), mbira (an African \"piano\" or metallophone), various stands to hold all the instruments, microphones & a full PA system (monitors, speakers, mixing board, stands, etc)! (but it all fits in my toyota 4runner!) \"In some ways, definitely! I began Zili as an all-female band, because I was often the only woman in large world music bands (Batwel Rada, Tjovi Ginen in Boston) and, while I LOVED the music, I got tired of hearing how good I was \"\"for a girl\"\". So I started Zili Roots with two of my friends; when I went back to grad school, the band became co-ed as the membership changed. As the musicianship got better and better, the women in the band (maybe it was just with this particular group of men) became more and more invisible, til one day I just left the rehearsal for awhile and the men in the band didn't even notice -- they were vibing on each other so much. It just seemed that the original intention of the band -- to become a place where female musicians could shine -- without feelings of gender bias -- had been lost. I decided to put an ad on Craigslist, just to see if there were female musicians that would be interested in this concept -- and many of the women who are currently in the band responded! We played for awhile with our male drummer as the only guy (he was perfectly happy with this ratio), until he moved to NYC. When we put out feelers again, we had 5 female drummers to choose from. NOW, five years after becoming all female again, we have grown, our musicianship has grown, our band has grown, and, while it is important to us that we are all female, we also appreciate being musicians first and letting our gender be second. \" I look to those female musicians who have inspired me -- Sweet Honey in the Rock, Sarah Vaughan, Big Mama Thornton, Women of the Calabash, Marie Daulne of Zap Mama, Emeline Michel, Meshell Ndegeocello -- (and I know everyone in the band has a different list of mentors) who have paved the way for us. They have given us hope and guidance and I know, we have little of the challenges that they faced because they have already faced and traversed them. I give thanks for their work and they knowledge of the women we inspire today is what keeps me going. Listen listen listen. Ask questions. Find good mentors. Try not to burn bridges even when it is difficult. I have lots of mentors that I still call for advice (although my mother is not a professional musician, I ask her advice everyday!) I didn't begin playing percussion until college. I met a Professor from Haiti who taught me about the importance of Haiti, particularly to this region of the world. He also introduced me to the world of ethnomusicology (which was not yet taught at Wellesley College) in an independent study. During that course he explained to me the importance of playing music -- in order to truly understand it, so it was a natural next step that we begin playing -- I invited some of my friends to meet with us and that course became the drum and dance troupe that I now direct at Wellesley. I began to travel to study with master musicians (Haiti, Brazil, Cuba, Sierra Leone, Cape Verde) and to seek them out more intentionally here in the U.S. - Instruments: I don't know. none of them were serious or lasted along enough to mention. - Years playing: Baritone ukulele, bass guitar, vocals That's funny. We really try to keep everything pretty even in our band. We all take turns leading songs. Everyone has the same say in the studio and we make all of our business and marketing decisions together as a group. I have been playing a Baritone Ukulele that is a piece of junk with a contact mic inside of the body. I was playing a Kala but it is on the fritz right now and needs some work. blah. I play though a Fender Acoustic Amp that is also in need of some repairs. man I really gotta get it together! it really depends. I'd like to think no. I would rather not mention the times it has made a difference because it's usually not very positive. I was turned on the baritone ukulele by a friend of mine when I was living in Olympia ,WA. I moved shorty after that back to my hometown. My Dad had one laying around his shop and gave it to me (which is still the one I play now). I started playing bass because we switch off instruments so much from song to song in our band. I enjoy playing bass a lot. Although I am so new to it and is a such a contrast to the uke. - Instruments: John Mellencamp (18 months), My own group 6 years - Years playing: vocals/piano I'm the lead singer, pianist, songwriter, main arranger, manager, booking agent, band mom, travel agent, etc. Too many roles for one person, but it's taught me a lot. I perform on a Yamaha p90 Keyboard. \"I definitely think there is a huge difference! Unfortunately, it seems as if it is almost always necessary for women to look a certain way and act a certain way to be accepted in this industry. It's not very often that you find a heavier woman making it big. And I can't think of a single woman in the spotlight right now that you could say is 'unattractive'. Men on the other hand: I am constantly amazed how ragged a male lead singer can look. A lot of them today look as if they just rolled out of bed and the industry doesn't blink an eye. It's frustrating to me that when trying to book a show or be accepted, I have to attach my best pictures in order to usually get that first glance. I play the role I don't like playing, but it is ALWAYS about the music to me. I've kind of known that's how the industry is, but it's always been interesting to see how live engineers and venue owners approach me when they first meet me. \"\"Great, another girl with a piano\"\" type of attitude. But when we soundcheck and perform, they become our best friends and I become 'just one of the guys'. Quite silly to me, but for now it's worth it if I get to do what I love at the end of the day. \" Women in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s seemed much more empowered, especially the 70s! They were also much more respected for their talents rather than their bodies. Women have always pushed a sexual edge, so I guess the argument can swing either way. But, I think women today take it to a whole new level by showing everything they've got physically and fake their way through the actual vocal/musicianship side of things. With pitch correctors and such, it feels as if a majority of the female artists out there are focused on image more than the art of music. Back in the day it was about the art, sweat, tears, and heart of the show/song. I've basically learned everything by experience. I wish someone had told me early how things would effect my career. My advice, and it's the advice I give my students, has always been 'Be you'. If you start to give up pieces of yourself to please others, you are just a step closer to losing yourself. I always do my best to play the role without losing my integrity. I love my job, I love performing, I love writing. If I can do those things and keep the love, while making the music world a better place, then I don't think I'm really losing anything by not conforming to what I see on Mtv, Vh1, or the internet! My fans are my fans for the pure fact that I have never been false, I have never lost the drive or passion, and it's obvious that I love what I do. I believe I will live longer in the industry by staying true to myself and to my fans! I'm classically trained in piano. Have played since I was 4 years old. Was accepted in the Indiana University Music school for classical piano performance. It's what I know best! - Instruments: ELGIN SYMPHONY ORCH, rOCKFORD SYMPH. ORCH, LIGHT WORKS, OPERA CHICAGO - Years playing: oboe/Cor Anglais - Instruments: one - Years playing: guitar, vocal So far i have been solo, mostly. I write and record all of my own songs and spin ideas off one or two people who help me record later. Guitar (acoustic or electric), amp, mic (for vocals), mic (for amp sometimes) In some ways, I feel responsible for being a positive role model. I don't feel that many of the male musicians I know are very personal in their writing - which isn't a bad thing... I make it a point to be confessional in my lyrics, and not afraid to show my emotions. One of my messages is that it's ok to be sad - and that positive things can come from that - and I haven't found may male singer/songwriters that have conveyed they feel the same, to me. I think there are a lot of singer/songwriters that carry the torch of guitar picking styles and political messages, as well as taking old folk and putting it into a \"now\" context (i.e. Meg Baird of Espers solo project). There is still a lot of traditional folk music, but I think that new female singer/songwriters are crossing new territory, with pedals and layering and vocals - really pushing themselves to stretch what folk music means now. Be honest, always be nice to everyone, if you believe in what you do and what you say what you write, you will never be disappointed with a show or a release or your decisions. And ALWAYS work with people you trust and know and would consider a friend. And NEVER do anything because you think the listener would like it - you should do it because YOU like it. For it's simplicity. I like being able to sing complicated melodies and lyrics and rhythms over the strums. Makes it more interesting to me... a lot more room for harmonies when recording and performing live... - Instruments: My own groups - Years playing: Vocals I am the leader, and make the decisions for my musical groups, in business and in marketing. Yes, but I can't think of one moment in particular that made the difference clear. I am not around a lot of other women musicians of various ages to make the comparison. The advice I've received is not particular to me as a woman in music. I'd tell young women starting out in music to have a backup plan. Study hard and learn all you can about music, harmony and what you're doing. Listen to a variety of jazz musicians and learns from the masters. Started singing and playing music at a very early age. My family is very musical, and it was a natural progression. - Instruments: I perform free-lance in a number of ensembles, as a soloist, and I conduct a church choir - Years playing: Vocals, piano I remember noticing how my male colleagues at the Deutsche Oper Berlin were paid more than me or the other women. There does seem to be a higher premium placed on men who sing. The implication seems to be \"You girls are all lined up and waiting, so don't expect any special treatment.\" Women have made huge in-roads in European orchestras where they once only appeared as harpists or second violins. I would say, be open to everything, but don't stick around where you're not appreciated. It was in the house (piano) and I was born with it (voice). - Instruments: just this one - Years playing: vocals lead singer in the band and studio. shure 58 microphone i don't think there should be a difference as far as equal treatment is concerned. but i think the world still treats women in music differently. often times our band is described using words that i think are inappropriate in this day and age. people (writers, critics) often use comparisons to other female artists in ways that i find are inappropriate and aren't used with men in music. yes and it mostly reflects the times. it is very interesting to observe the differences between generations and to observe what is happening with women in music now. there seem to be a lot of strippers making their way into the business now. lots of valuable advice to share. to learn the balance to protect yourself at the same time as you share yourself. hold your own, do not listen to critical voices, do not give them power. be authentic, always true to yourself. we are all in this together like sisters who share in the same love of music and art and self and light and soul and fashion and self expression, etc.... all these things together. at this point, in this generation, it isn't about being original anymore. if people are focussed on originality then there will always be competition there. almost everything has been done, but authenticity is golden and we all have an abundance of authentic energy to share with one another and the world. i always loved to sing and dance and play dress up since i was a little girl. - Instruments: solo stuff {cherish alexander}, the girl led zepelin band}, maxi-tit, and a bunch of jam bands as well. - Years playing: Vox, Bass, Piano, Guitar we are 4 piece band called BELLA BAZARRIA. i play bass and sing. my guitar player and I write all the music and I write all the lyrics. in the studio, we are producing the CD ourselves, so we are all equally involved in the process. \"I have about 6 electric guitars ranging from telecaster to strat to les paul. 3 acoustics. one ovation the rest takamini. I also have a few basses {acoustic and electric} fender jazz bass. 2 keyboards. my baby is the roland. we have 2 upright pianos in our house and a drum set just for jamming. then all the other amps. marshalls, line 6 etc.\" not really. i think these days women musicians are AS respected as male musicians. if not more. janis joplin, dolly parton, carole king, patti smith etc all paved the way for us. \"emotionally. no. socially. yes. these days, we are able to express ourselves more in a way that is accepted. but as women. we are pretty much all the same.\" \"i would say write what you feel. sing what you feel. be who you are, no matter what anyone tries to tell you to sing or play. the female musicians, i respect the most, were the ones that took the road less-traveled, when everyone said it was the wrong path. xo\" i play many different instruments. right now, bass is my love. just depends on what i'm in the mood for. but i play piano, bass & guitar. - Instruments: I've performed with many groups - Years playing: I am a composer I am not in a band. I own a Technics keyboard (and a trumpet from my college days). Since I've never been a man, I don't know. Women tend to be paid less than men are paid for the same job and receive less respect and accolades for the same--or greater--accomplishments. Some younger musicians seem to have less stringent work ethics. \"Let you music be its own reward.\" My first instrument was guitar, which I played for liturgies since I was 9 years old. Trumpet was chosen since it was the instrument that remained when attendance was taken. I later played French Horn also. In college piano performance was mandatory. - Instruments: Over the years,many regional, local and international companies - Years playing: piano, harpsichord I'm independent contractor and head of my own two educational/performance-based projects. So, all the decisions are mine. Steinway grand M 1922 \"Yes, of course. The boys' club is very much alive and well, and prejudices are everywhere. The difference was clear from the moment I began to seek and get jobs in my field at every level, even the most menial.\" That's hard to say; It's more personality than age. And personal choices: like between family or work which still have the greatest effect on the career path. Think hard about what you're trying to get and what you may have to give up. Your personal sense of fulfillment. The musician's life is a difficult one full of sacrifices on every level. Not original but ever true. I loved it. - Instruments: just PIT ER PAT, for the last 8 years, so far - Years playing: keyboard, guitar, drums, vocals, etc Well, now there are just two of us. We collaborate on everything. Nord Electro 73, Roland EP30, 71 Guild Natureboy, Fender Twin, black four piece found trapkit, various pedals. I think that's a bit like asking a twin what it's like to be a twin. I did grow up in a music community that was predominately men, and I was conscious of that, being surrounded by men, but I'm not sure what the difference is. I've never played with women before. I just wanted people to hear me as a musician, not a female-musician. You can only make one dot at a time. (from Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies) I just play whatever feels like I need to, whatever I'm being drawn to. - Instruments: I've performed with and opened for (as a solo artist) at least 40 groups, including George Clinton and P-Funk, Herbie Hancock, Sting, Josh Groban, Jimmy Page/Robert Plant - Years playing: violin, vocals, viola, programming, iano I'm the composer, lyricist, producer, arranger, and part time engineer of my music, and co-manager of my career. \"I have a 250 year old English violin, and a big pedalboard full of vintage effects pedals which enables me to rock out or create a soundscape, or build a quirky love scene, or ominous forshadowing for a movie that i might be scoring. I also have a full recording studio, complete with a Pro-tools rig and microphones and lots of instruments and complicated software. \" \"Ultimately, I don't think there is a substantive difference between men and women musicians, in that it takes passion and discipline to master any instrument, and the expressive qualities of receptivity or aggressiveness are not necessarily particular to one or the other gender, despite the stereotypes. But as a woman, I have noticed that I have to be exceptionally on top of my game as a musician and as a business person in order to be taken seriously. I am the only woman composer at the large complex of composers and musicians where my studio is, and I have almost always been the only woman musician at any festival where I've performed. This became clear to me when I played at the Montreaux Jazz Festival in 1993, where I notice there were several women singers, but no women instrumentalists. Even as I've continued to tour the world, not much has changed. I also became aware of the unique challenges of being a woman in the music business, when I was making my second record with a producer, a fundamentalist Christian who was simultaneously trying to save my soul, and bed me. When I wouldn't submit, he sabotaged the record, both musically, and with the label. The cd never came out, but I learned a valuable lesson: that I had to be more vigilant about taking responsibility for my music, both aesthetically, and in business, so no one person can ever derail a given project again. Since then, I've produced or co-produced everything I have put out.\" I think every generation of women takes the progress made by her predecessors for granted. I don't know if it's true, but it seems like women over the last century had to be more serious in order to be recognized, and we may not be quite as intense as those who came before us, because we haven't had to be. I get to ride on the shoulders of jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams, bassist Carol Kaye, and film composer Shirley Walker, in the same way that the feminists who came before me allow me to be more relaxed about my right to equality and self-determinism. That said, every art requires tremendous dedication in order to truly succeed no matter what era or age. My mom, comedienne and singer/songwriter Lotus Weinstock, told me \"No one ever gives you permission to be original.\" I would tell anyone, and especially a woman starting out, not to be afraid to experiment and be outrageous, because the only way to really have fun and longevity is to be authentically yourself and to stretch to your limits. When I was 7 years old, I had a dream I could play violin, and my mom honored it by renting me one, and writing a song in G Major, so I could play open strings with her and have a sense of music right away. - Instruments: razia said - Years playing: vocals I am the band leader, making final decisions in studio and taking care of all the background business part and helping with marketing as well. drums/bass/2 guitars/keys or accordion/vocals \"Very different indeed. It seems like we have to do the music part like men do and beyond. We are a more nurturing gender,we become the mother or big sister to the whole band, so we have more responsibility at the end. It's been clear to me since the beginning.\" \"with the whole feminism movement i believe we play more parts with time. It's great in a way that we can make more decisions, but we also take a lot on us.\" \"The best advice i've had was not to do it for the money but for the passion of it. The best advice i could give to a young woman who is starting now is basically the same and to be ready to do a lot of sacrifices.\" because i love singing; it's the best way to communicate. - Instruments: fronted my own bands w/ various members - Years playing: vocals/guitar When I've had bands I'm always fronting them so all of the decisions are mine to make. However, my general philosophy is to let the players do what comes naturally to them rather than dictate what sound I'm going for. If I'm exploring a particular sound I try to chose players that lend themselves to that direction and then see what they come up with. On the other hand if they come up with something that I can't stand, I'll let them know. In the studio, I pick producers I can trust and then I just have to trust them. In terms of business and marketing; again all the decisions are mine- this is the one area that I'm genuinely uncomfortable with and feel out of my element. 2 acoustic guitars. I play slide on one of them. I also have a full PA which I often use for gigs. \"It's definitely different and it's difficult to discuss because it tends to put people on the defense. My perception is that this is because being a musician is a difficult path for most of us- male or female but it is more difficult for women and when both men and women are struggling, it's hard to distinguish why one path might be more difficult than another- it's like degrees of struggle. We're all up against the same issues; poverty, art verses commerce, ego verses truth, remaining sensitive and at the same time navigating the business of music which is not concerned with our feelings or our truth. Yet, in business and in art, in general it's much more difficult to be taken seriously as a women. Artistically speaking, I've never heard of women who was referred to as a genius, on rare occasion you may here of a woman referred to as unique or even brilliant but she's never a genius? She'll never be the voice of generation just the voice of women which is deemed somehow less, or other. We have to navigate maintaining our femininity and sensuality as songwriters and performers and the same time, somehow carry on business in an aggressive industry where, if we act too aggressively, we'll be perceived as \"\"difficult\"\". Secondly, the notion of self-promotion, which is essential to surviving in the music business, can also be a fine line to walk as a women. As women to some degree, I believe we have been taught that it is unbecoming to boast and display, yet how else does one self-promote? There is also the difficultly of convincing anyone that a women is marketable past the age of 30 or 35- of course that's problematic throughout all arts and entertainment but I've always found it ironic;, since for women I believe, it is usually in our thirties that we truly find and define our voices. Men are usually given a little more leeway in this department. A marginally success man a the age of 35 may still be able to find investors and can mature and still \"\"break-out\"\" but this is much less likely for a women. The music industry, in general is focused on a youth driven markets- due primarily to it's own history- \"\"Big Money\"\" in the music business started with folks like Elvis and the Beatles, and it can be difficult to convince \"\"the powers that be\"\" that there are markets out there, over the age of 30, who are interested in hearing from voices closer to their own life experience and that those markets are worth pursuing. To be fair however, the over 30 market won't support \"\"monster acts\"\" or \"\"big stars\"\". The music business is changing radically right now- all the markets are getting fragmented. In general I see this as a positive augur for artists because they can find their niche and create a career. The difficultly is getting the investment or capital to enter those markets because the pay off takes longer, is usually a lot less $ and it's still an extremely risky investment.\" I do think there is a difference between generations of women musicians and I'm greatly encouraged by it. The new generation of women coming into the business are a lot less inhibited than previous generations. They've been supported and encourage to learn all different instruments that previous generation were discouraged from learning. Now we see many more women drummers, bass players, sax players etc. Slightly older generations of women were subtly intimidated into believing that they could not master their instruments- the idea that women could be good players but no woman could fill the shoes of say, Les Paul or John Coltrane. The new generation of women musicians has greater confidence in the notion that they can and will be great musicians. I've been given so much valuable advice from so many different sources that I wouldn't even know where to begin. I suppose I'd just say, stay open and try to focus more on the process rather then the goal. The goals come gradually and by the time they come, if you're too focused on them you'll lose sight of enjoying what you've accomplished. At the end of the day the only thing that matter is that you keep doing the work because it keeps you whole. What you achieve and being successful have nothing to do with who has noticed or how much money you make. Feel free to look at my web page. www.stefaniefix.com I hope this was helpful. I'm not sure, probably a number of reasons. As a young girl, who wanted to write songs - guitar seemed like the appropriate choice. I tried piano for a while but I was so hungry to express; that guitar lent itself more quickly to my being able to write. It was also easier to learn how to play songs I liked by other people in a very parred down form. My experience was that piano teachers usually started off with nursery rhymes where as guitar teachers started me off with songs that really spoke to me. Finally, I think I wanted to be like Bob Dylan. - Instruments: The Mama Doni Band! - Years playing: Vocals \"I am the MAMA of my business. My name is Mama Doni, and that is exactly what I do. I am the boss, the decision maker, the creative director, the artist, the grapahic designer, the feeder, the marketing director, one who writs the checks. I have a wonderful team of people who works with me, but ultimately I am running this business wearing many different hats. I love collaborating with my band to create the music, with my creative director to create the album/website designs, the booking agent to coordinate the programs, the publicist to generate press, but at the end of the day I am living, breathing, and loving this project in and out. \" \"My first 4 albums were recorded either: 1. In my kitchen 2. In my basement 3. In a home studio in Brooklyn 4. In a home studio in Jersey City Recognized in The New York Times, LA Times, The Jewish Daily Forward, New York Post, The Star-Ledger, The Record, Time Out New York Kids, New Jersey Jewish News, The Jewish Week, Jewish Woman International Magazine, and more....Performed over 175 concerts since May 2008.\" \"I feel that being a woman and a mother has changed my whole life, and made the musician in me emerge. I think that giving birth to my babies empowered me to live my best and truest self. I feel that as a woman I understand audiences and people in a special way. I do feel that as a performer it is hard to be a mother and travel and this is something I think about all of the time. I do not go on month long tours, I typically go away for one show or two, but having 2 small children, and a BIG dream and passion can be quite painful and confusing. I try each day to see who needs me and give to that person. Sometimes it's my daughter, sometimes, my son or my husband, my band, my booking agent, my parents, sister, and once in a while..... it's ME!\" \"I feel like I am in the middle generation right now. There are the young hipsters in their 20's, and I am not that anymore, I am a mother... There are women who have been performing for years and years with established careers, and I am not that either... I am in my mid 30's, a mother of two children, who after having had a different career before children, finally found my VOICE as a young mother. I feel honored to be part of the world of female musicians and know I can learn from everyone...I also know that I couldn't have done this in my 20's, I didn't know who I was then, and I certainly wasn't going to be singing this kind of music then....My music is not religious like traditional Jewish music, but it is also not totally secular because it is Jewish-themed, so often I feel like I don't fit in to any genre. If I was a younger woman I couldn't have handled this. I think I needed every experience and moment of my life to bring me to this music and this spot. I needed every moment to give me the courage to put myself out there in this way, and to believe in my voice. I needed every moment to have the humility to stay grounded and humble during big successes and hold on during tough moments. \" \"I have been following my heart and my instincts along the way. Anyone who I speak to has told me to keep doing what I am doing. For anyone starting out I would say: Even if you think nobody cares, or if you feel like you are all alone, if it feels right deep down inside, if you feel like this music is your truth, then keep doing it!!! \" The instrument I play is...ME! I have always been immersed in the arts, music, and Jewish life, and when this music came to me I knew this was what I was meant to do. I felt like there was nobody sharing Jewish culture in a light and fun cool way through music like this, and it became my passion to do it. I had an immediate heart warming response from kids, families, seniors, mothers, everywhere and I know feel that it is my life's work. This music is my heart and soul and I am so grateful to be able to create it and share it with people. I feel like it is my job to share Jewish culture with all audiences so everyone can get a little flavor of the richness of Jewish culture - weather you are reform, conservative, orthodox, reconstructionist, Half-Jewish, Not Jewish, married to a Jew, or \"Jew-ish\", this music will make you feel just a little Jewish! ;-))) - Instruments: Martha Munizzi - Years playing: Vocalist - Years playing: Vocals/keys/guitar/programming I don't really have a band so I am my own boss. I work with another producer and we bang heads and get to a final song we both like quite easily. In business, I have Vagrant and I have a manager but I am pretty lucky as they are quite happy to let me make decisions or at least be involved, from what I hear of the industry that is quite a rarity so I do feel really happy about the people I work with. Me, keys, a Mac which is old and needs updating, software which I don't entirely understand and lots of wires. I think the audience and the public requires different things from a male and female musician. If you're in a band and you're a woman and you're not the vocalist, you have to make a real point of being amazing and standing out. Guys can be in bands and just blend in and be part of the background. Something like a female drummer makes such a statement, I guess because it's a rarity. It's kind of a stereotype but a true one that women have to be sexier too. Male musicians can be fat and hairy and no one cares, if I was fat and hairy, I don't think people would like it so much! The whole Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez era was about the craft...I'm hard pushed now to find big stars of today that are about the craft of songwriting. It's about the art of performance now and celebrity. I don't think either is more wrong or right but there is a definite change over the past 40 years. My advice isn't woman specific, it's just work! Work work work, work like no-one else has before...think outside the box. Contact everyone, the people no-one usually bothers with, those people become your friends and help you out more than you will ever know. Be kind...it might seem girly, but people like sweet kind people, if they like you, they will want to see you do well and work harder to help you achieve what you want to achieve. Simple, but true. When I was growing up, my parents kind of imposed piano lessons on us from an early age and I am so pleased they did, sitting at the piano calms me down and inspires me. I never get bored of sitting writing at a piano. - Instruments: many supporting ensembles under my name. Blaring exception with MTV 'Cutting Edge' punk band in the 80's called Dino Lee & The White Trash Review & His Jam & Jelly Girls (think Ricky Ricardo & Band on acid) - Years playing: vocals, guitar, dulcimer Songwriter, vocals, guitar - I'm the front person or I go solo, when I perform. In the studio, depending on the session, I may be producer or I may put myself completely in the hands of another producer to grow and learn from their artistry. As far as business and marketing, I make the decisions with ongoing consultation, research and advice from my peers in the biz. \"Instruments: a hand made 2004 Collings Om1 acoustic guitar, a 1997 Taylor 510 acoustic guitar, a 1986 yamaha FS-350S acoustic guitar and a hand-crafted dulcimer. Sound Equipment: a Baggs para acoustic DI, a SansAmp para driver DI, a Sure Beta 87A mic and ALWAYS D'Addario strings (no promotional deal ,just love their strings.)\" Early in my career I was a 'target': Imagine a young girl, on her own, playing bars and clubs in Houston and on the road in the 70's? In so many places where a man could be transparent, I could not. It was scary, sometimes. It took some daring to alter my middle-class culturing and embrace all the risk that came with being single-force-woman pursuing my dream. Why didn't I want to finish college? Why didn't I want to get married, have kids? It's much easier now. Occasionally I still have to dodge the 'come on' bullet but there are a lot more gentlemen out there in the biz now. Yes, it's inevitable. Technology and culture has changed so much. But at our root, the longing and drive are no different. When you feel the calling to be a troubadour, manifesting it is in the details. It's 'the song' that drives us all - young and old. I don't recall who said it but somewhere along the way I heard that there are 10 people waiting right behind you to do what you do so you better take your gift seriously. I can't believe how many really talented female singer songwriters there are now. It's become acceptable to pursue the risk - parents and peers are more apt, it seems to me, to support a young girl with talent and dreams. I would say go for it - just keep in mind that you do it for the love of it. If you ever feel like you're loosing touch with your creative voice, don't hesitate to reassess why you are making music and what you want most from it. Fame and fulfillment are not necessarily the same. I was stunned by James Taylor, Joni Mitchelle, Peter Paul and Mary, Mary Hopkins, Cat Stevens, etc ... the great guitar slingers of my youth. Also, Joni played dulcimer in a non-traditional style that lured me to try one out. I figured out it was esy to play yet the notes were complex and layered because it was tuned like a banjo - an open tuning. Then I learned that I could do the same thing to a guitar - alter the tuning. Freedom! I also played piano for a while but lost it in a flood along with my good dulcimer. - Instruments: See above for recent regular groups. Many other groups in Boston area, where I lived before this. - Years playing: Primarily a conductor. Also a classical soprano and pianist. In my professional ensemble and at the college where I am a professor, I am the artistic director who makes all musical decisions and many of the administrative decisions. As a conductor, my main gear is my baton; I have a case with several batons that travels with me. As a singer, I don't need much gear! But as a rock musician, I do carry my keyboard and keyboard stand. I have sometimes found real differences as a conductor. I think that many people have a mental image of the conductor as a dominating male who leads with a traditional, top-down leadership style, and who has particular physical mannerisms that communicate \"power\" in physically male ways. When I was studying conducting in graduate school, I conducted a regional orchestra in a master class/workshop, and was given the feedback (by a female violist!) that my conducting needed balls. I was really ticked off by that feedback, even as I understood that she meant that I had not yet figured out how to show aggressive music in an organic way on my curvy female body. I went to my teacher at the University of Michigan, a wonderful male teacher, and asked him for his help. He suggested that I consider how powerful the female body is - what more powerful image than the womb, the giver of life? That led to a real breakthrough for me, that I can show power in my own body by being grounded and true to who I am, not by trying to replicate male conducting gestures (that inevitably looked forced on my body). Yes, the generation before me had to fight harder to gain acceptance. I have observed women now in their 50s and 60s with war stories about having to fight to be given opportunities equal to the men of their age. (One of my women teachers was told by her mentor that \"it was a shame she had been a woman, she would have made a hell of a conductor.\") I think that women today in the conducting field have equal opportunities to have access to training and jobs, but that there are still fewer women with the top positions. People still have subconscious associations with what a conductor should look like and act like that may keep women from some of the top positions; just think about our leadership roles in government and the gradual emergence of women in Congress but the continuing lack of a woman president. You can do anything your heart desires. Just be prepared to assert yourself, know what you want, and have to prove to each new person or organization how competent and creative you are. I fell in love with choral music in middle school. I had played piano since I was in elementary school (mostly because my friend, Maureen, had started taking lessons and I thought that sounded \"cool\"), and I was the kind of kid who would race home because I couldn't wait to practice the piano. When I started singing in middle school, it was because I wanted to join our famed show choir in high school (think \"Glee\"), and I was an aspiring dancer. It turned out that I had a good voice and loved to sing, and I studied music seriously at Princeton, the University of Michigan, and Boston University (my degree institutions). - Instruments: 3 - Bucketfunk, E Serenes (now E Muzeki), Vanessa Lively band - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Percussion \"I am the singer/songwriter and front person in the band. I perform quite a few shows either solo or as a duo with my husband Jason. Then we have a band for our larger venues and events. In the studio, I always have a large role in producing, recording & mixing the albums alongside my husband. We work as a team. I tell him my ideas and vision and we will collaborate. I feel that I lend more on the artistic, creative side, and he has more of a handle on all the technical sides. The same goes for business and marketing. I do a lot of the footwork myself in this area, and am the primary person responsible for getting it all done, but my husband is always there to help with these projects and give his input on our business & marketing plans. We really work well as a team with all of this.\" I own two Alvarez Acoustic guitars, a Kustom PA system, vocal mics & stands, cables, etc. I have percussion instruments (mostly shakers) from around the world. My husband, who plays with me, owns a charango from Bolivia, a few guitars & a bass. \"Yes. Definitely. There are a lot more men in the music community and business, and I feel that they dominate the field. I also feel that somehow they are taken a bit more seriously and treated differently, but it is not something that I personally feel too affected by. I just see it around me. The one thing that I do feel I have to battle is getting people to get past their initial judgements on female singer/songwriters. I have heard folks say that it is all so sappy and whiny, without much content. I couldn't disagree more. I have seen so much variety of content and sound and style just in my immediate community of singers & songwriters. Each women comes from a different walk of life, has a different history and different ways of expressing themselves. I think that one thing that does set us apart is we might tend to dive a little deeper into some heartfelt or touchy subjects that might not be covered by as many men. I lived in South America for a while and I have never felt the division between men and women so strongly as I did when I was there. Music was a big part of my life during that time, and I can feel these surroundings having an effect on my music at that time. And when I returned to the United States and decided to pursue music, I did feel a certain sense of pride and freedom being able to pursue my dream, as a women, and say what I want to say. Exactly how I need to say it. I have since surrounded myself with amazing women in all areas of music & music business, and also participate in a monthly meeting of women here in Austin, TX called WIMPS, which means Women In Music Professional Society. It is really a joke because all the women are so incredibly strong and driven. I have learned so much from these gatherings and gained so many new friendships. If anything, I feel now that being a woman can actually open more doors for me and create stronger bonds with my peers. I want to celebrate it and not focus too much on how it might hold me back.\" \"Yes, I do. I feel that in the past, women had to work really hard just to be taken seriously, and this is as recent as the 60s and 70s here in the United States. If you were singing about real life and real issues, you had to make quite a stink and really blow people away in order to be noticed. And I feel that for my generation, we had some really great women musicians to look up to and follow in their footsteps, such as Ani DiFranco, Tori Amos, Tracy Chapman, The Indigo Girls, Sarah McLaughlin, and many many more. These women really got their music out there and even under record labels, remained independent and had control over their own creative and artistic ideas. I feel greatly inspired by all of these artists, and am continuing to find more women who inspire me now. I am also grateful that I live in this time because in the past it might have been even more frowned upon if you didn't decide to stay home and raise a family. Artists always have to struggle with these choices, especially touring musicians. It is very hard to lead a \"\"normal\"\" life and do what we do. But nowadays, all norms are shifting and all people are opening up to living life in a different way, so the choice is not so hard, and I feel that our friends and family are very supportive in most cases. In the past, this probably was not the case.\" \"Oh my goodness, so many people have given me advice in this area. I am so fortunate to live in Austin where we have many resources at our fingertips and we are surrounding by working musicians everywhere, so there is a wealth of knowledge and wisdom all around. You just have to ask. As far as some people who really helped me out, I feel that my friend Danny really helped me know how to approach this life and what things I needed to do in order to move forward. And my two very close friends that I met in South America, Stefan & Dave Pope, really gave me some great tips and ideas in regards to my music and how to grow. They also played a huge role in my first album, which was recorded in Ecuador. Then also continued to play that role on my second album, since we recorded it at their home in England. I now feel that I am beginning to get a hold of everything and I am ready to step out on my own even more, but I am constantly relying on the support and advice from my peers. What I would say to a woman musician just starting out is this: If you know in your heart that this is what you want to do, and you fully accept all the difficulties that come along with this choice, then just go for it no matter what. Always remember to be willing to grow and expand and get better in all areas that you can, and learn to take critiques well. And beyond that, follow your heart and know that you can achieve anything that you set your mind and your heart to. Most importantly, have faith in yourself and in life helping you out. Be confident and know that you have something unique and wonderful to offer. And never be too shy or scared to ask for help and advice. It is how you move along and how you learn.\" \"My mom owned a guitar growing up and played it a bit here and there, mostly for her school, the church or weddings. She loved to sing, and we would sometimes sit and sing Beatles songs together. The guitar feels like a universal instrument. It is played all over the world. You can take it with you wherever you go. I don't know how many times I have sat around a campfire and swapped songs with strangers, who through the night became friends. It is a communal activity and feels beautiful.\" - Instruments: In my whole life? Wow, this will be fun. I was in the school choir from 3rd grade until I graduated High School. Does that count? I was also in a band my Senior year of High School -formed specifically for our graduation party. I don't think we had a name. I was in several Choirs in College, as well as in a band called 'Fierce Mullet' though we didn't play shows much. My husband and I have been playing music as 'We are Jeneric' for eleven years and I have been in 'Sgt. Dunbar & the Hobo Banned' for three years now. - Years playing: vocals, violin, percussion, piano, drums \"In We are Jeneric I am a general partner with Eric. The two of us write and record all of the music, produce the albums, book the shows, keep the websites up to date. As the co-owner of a small business I'm in charge of everything from submitting our sales tax to the state, to coaching Eric on his vocal techniques, to filling CD and tshirt orders. In Sgt. Dunbar & the Hobo Banned I am one out of eight in the Corporation. We incorporated last year for tax and legal purposes. In addition to bringing songwriting ideas to the band and performing live, Eric and I also host regular writing and recording sessions at our Farmhouse, where the eight of us hole up for weekends at a time. I'm also the band's Secretary -keeping track of meeting minutes, merchandise, as well as tax and legal information. I've always gotten bored easily, and being involved in so many different aspects of the business keeps me excited, interested, and never bored.\" \"Well, in Sgt. Dunbar my gear includes my violin, my amplifier, and a blue box I carry around which includes 1/4\"\" cables, my violin neck rest, extra rosin, a tuner, screw drivers (just incase), extra strings, and our snare drum stand (it is the only place it will fit). For We are Jeneric my gear varies depending on the type of set we play. It ranges from my violin and amp to almost a full drum kit, a children's xylophone, lots of percussion instruments (washboards, jars filled with rice, phonograph horns), a mandolin, and an accordion.\" \"Yes definitely. Just looking on most stages the ratios are way off. Out of eight musicians in Sgt. Dunbar & the Hobo Banned I am one of two girls. I remember before I joined the band I would often go to watch them play. I felt differently about the band because Donna was in it. Although we are all best friends now, I didn't know any of them back then. I don't know if I would have felt so fondly about the band if Donna weren't a member, and I don't know if I would have joined if she weren't in the band. I think often times bands appear to be boys' clubs, very exclusive -which isn't necessarily the case. Because Donna was in the band somehow it made it feel like it was okay for me to be there. There just don't seem to be as many female musicians in bands as there are men. Maybe there are, I just haven't seen it. I remember last year after our South by Southwest Showcase a guy came up to me and was really praising the band. \"\"You guys are great. Those boys can play so many different instruments...but you girls really need to work harder.\"\" I got totally bummed out, because in my case it was true -in the set we decided to perform I only played violin, percussion, and sang a few songs... all the while the guys were swapping guitars, banjos and basses for trombones, tubas, trumpets and accordions. All I could do was defend Donna who I knew had played trumpet, trombone, and french horn in the set. The guy continued to pick on me. I just wanted to say \"\"hey man, violin's not even my main instrument!\"\" but I just smiled. I didn't know what to say. I don't think he would have said that to any of the guys if they had stayed on a small number of instruments the whole set.\" \"Just looking at some of my favorite female musicians: Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Emmy Lou Harris, Rita Lee, Kim Deal (from the Pixies), I can see that there's a huge difference. All of these women certainly have spitfire in them, but just compare Billie Holiday to Kim Deal (at least from a performance standpoint) and Billie seems rather poised, whereas Kim is totally wild. I think that through the generations it's become increasingly acceptable for women to show that spitfire to the outside world. Either way though -it's there and has always been a source of great strength for me.\" My advice would be -don't listen to most advice. There are a lot of people out there who think they know the way to do things, or think they know the answer to your success. Truthfully, if you don't follow your own instincts and your own integrity you may find yourself successfully miserable. Only you know what you are trying to achieve from your music. \"I've always loved to sing, it helps me to express myself in ways I can't anywhere else. I started playing the violin when the original bass player for Sgt. Dunbar moved to Syracuse. The guys asked my husband Eric if he wanted to play bass with them and asked if I wanted to join the band as well. I told them that everyone else already played every instrument I knew. They told me to learn a new one. It was the impetus I needed to really learn the violin, and so I did. I love it. I think it suits me. \" - Instruments: 6 or so main groups: Subrosa, Violet Run, Stiletto, Red Reb, The Highrollers, Phono - Years playing: Vocals, guitar \"I am pretty much the founder and leader of the band, but it has become more democratic over the last two years. We have a rad lineup and everyone writes their own parts now. Everyone's a lot more invested. I write almost all the main riffs, vocal melodies and lyrics for the songs. I make most of the business and marketing decisions but have been splitting them with Zach, the drummer, as of late. In the studio my band has total control over our music and the way it sounds. I guess I have final say, but lately I really want to defer to the other members and make sure everyone's on the same page.\" A tube Peavey pre-Butcher VTM A handmade cab A Schecter Diamond Series guitar ($287). \"Of course. As long as our society insists on gender differences, rigid gender roles, and inequality between the sexes, those same circumstances will manifest themselves in the music world. And as long as men use women's sexuality to sell products, including art they see as \"\"products,\"\" that same attitude will manifest itself in the music world. I am very careful about not using our looks or bodies to market Subrosa's music. I refuse to let our music be overlooked because people are distracted by a shallow marketing ploy. I insist that our music be listened to and taken seriously for what it is. Maybe for female pop artists, their goals are different, but I want people to focus on our music. I think there's sometimes a fine line between being sexually confident and liberated, and females using their sexuality as something that sells and overshadows their music; as a means to being exploited and degraded. I don't know if there was one moment that these thoughts became clear to me. My attitude came from a gradual buildup of disgust, disappointment and bleakness at humanity from years and years of looking at mainstream music magazine covers. \" Yes. There seem to be less strong female role models in the heavy rock world now. Less strong female role models in general. There are some great role models in the indie rock world, like The Gossip. But in the heavy music world, females like Angela Gossow of Arch Enemy, Karyn Crisis, Joan Jett, and PJ Harvey are rare. \"Yes. Some of the most valuable advice I've been given had nothing to do with being a woman, though. In regards to advice about being a women in the music world, though, I had a friend tell me once that if you're a girl in a band with guys, people are going to automatically assume the guys wrote all the music. So be clear that you write the music (or explain what parts of it you write). Advice I'd give to a girl starting out? Be strong and don't let yourself be used or exploited in any way. Demand respect and you will get it.\" My Schecter guitar playing through my VTM amp gives me a heavy, gnarly, distorted sound that I think other heavy stoner bands spend thousands of dollars to get through their Orange and Sunn amps. My VTM doesn't have a clean channel. I think that says it all. Of course, my amp might not be as good quality, but I am satisfied with the tone and sound. - Instruments: mostly The WIlders - co-founded in 1996. Also perform solo - Years playing: fiddle, vocals, viola, cello, tenor guitar I am not the leader of the band, but my presence influences the band. We're all strong players but perhaps something about holding a bow makes a difference. I am known for my energetic, engaging performance and if I were to stop being outgoing on stage, the band would lose a lot of momentum. In the studio I've learned more to step back, watch and wait, as I have three strong bandmates with strong opinions. I made a solo album last year so I could explore more of my own ideas. That helped me to be a better bandmate, I think. I try to manage publicity needs for the band, coordinating interviews and often giving them. I am not so much a business-minded person and thankfully have a bandmate who ably manages these areas - I give input when it's asked for. My main fiddle, \"Beloved\", a French violin, is from ca. 1880-1920, from the school of Jerome Thibouville-Lamy. I've had it since I was 16 years old. It's not the prettiest fiddle in the world and when I first saw it, I didn't want to play it. It's missing some corners, has a dark varnish, plain back... but when I played it, I knew it was the one for me. I can't imagine being without it. Once I had to travel without it for a tour and was miserable (this was after the Heathrow airport scare in 2006, and the band was traveling to the UK). I own another unnamed French violin from the early 20th century, which I bought in Edinburgh, Scotland. I now own another Lamy fiddle, not as finely made as mine but a good \"Compagnon\" (the model name). I travel with two fiddles always as the music I play includes old time fiddle tunes, some of which need to be played in cross-tuning (open tuning). I own a decent viola and a funny little 1950's Kay cello, and a variety of tenor guitars, including a sweet 1930's Gibson archtop. I play these other instruments on recordings, for The Wilders and my solo projects as well as collaborations with other artists. Each one has a story. But Beloved is my true love. Well, probably. Look at the world around us. It's still notable when a woman achieves something of great importance. There are still issues of gender (and of course race or religion or...) in the workplace. I have more male artists on my iPod than female. But it's fair to say that personally, I tend to like the music from male artists more than female ones. I love to play sensitive music but I can't stand for all of it to be subtle. I guess I play with balls. And I'm okay with that. It's still crazy that women are judged for their appearance on stage first and their artistry second. That probably hasn't helped my own career any. I can appreciate physical beauty on stage, but I think music is supposed to transcend normal ideals. Maybe. I think I feel the difference of being a women frequently. Often I am the only woman on stage at a festival finale or similar gig. That's starting to change... I guess. Not sure I do. Memphis Minnie was an incredibly strong player and singer. So is Joan Jett. But Billie Holiday was perhaps a sweeter style and overtly feminine performer. So is Joanna Newsom. Can't remember specific advice that I received. Sure I was given advice by many over the years and I'll still take advice any time. What do I say to young women musicians? I just had the opportunity to give advice to a talented 13 year old singer/guitar player in Scotland. I suggested that she spend lots of time working on her scales and knowing her chords and playing as much as she can with others. And I praised her for her listening skills. If I'm asked by a young woman what she should do to get started in the music biz, I will tell her to know her instrument really really well. I will tell her to not be too defensive when people give her advice or criticism. I will tell her to be honest and diplomatic and kind. And that she may have to make a choice sometime whether to be kind, or to completely mow over anyone in her way. And that she should consider this choice carefully and not with an impulse decision. And I'll tell her whatever else comes to mind at the time. Thanks for providing this survey. I appreciate thinking about these questions and the opportunity to add my voice to the mix. Circumstance. My mom saw an ad in the paper for a new violin teacher in town, offering group lessons. She asked me and my brother if we wanted to try. We said sure. Six months later we both moved on from group to private lessons, and piano lessons too. Fortunately my first teacher was incredibly enthusiastic and fun, and I never stopped playing, even during the dangerous junior high/high school years, when it wasn't very cool to play the violin. I made up for it by listening to The Clash, Velvet Underground, and doing funny things to my hair. Nowadays it seems a lot cooler to play a stringed instrument as a young person. - Instruments: 5. Half Mann Band (ages 10-13), Chapter 12, Spy Gods, The Loved Ones, The Robin Renee Band, plus solo work - Years playing: vocals, guitar, harmonium, keys \"Right now, I am the band. I sometimes hire drummers/percussionists depending on the show. I think I love working in the studio best, of all the roles I need to play. There, I bring the basics of the song along with some arrangement ideas. I have been lucky to work with some brilliant producers (Scott Mathews in Mill Valley, CA and Scott Pearson in Cary, NC primarily) who can hear my intentions for a given song, envision it even more fully, and bring it out in full bloom. I also generally make all the business decisions, which is not ideal. I will hire a PR person as needed. Finding the right fit with a manager would be belpful to alleviate some of the pressure of wearing all the proverbial hats. \" Right now my gear is pretty simple. I play a Taylor 612CE guitar and a Bina harmonium most of the time. I use various percussion instruments and play through a small acoustic amp. I like the stripped-down sound and it is easy to tour that way, but I miss the full sound of the recordings and want to produce something bigger. I am currently working on expanding my live sound to incorporate a mix of natural samples and electronica using a laptop and midi. I actually don't find that there is a huge difference for indie musicians, overall. That said, there are subtle things - I think that women have to confront how and if to use their sexuality in their presentation in a way that doesn't manifest quite the same way for a man. For example, I am bisexual and polyamorous and feel that it is important for me to be out and honest about how I understand and experience love and sexuality. I am aware that there is a way that I could use those facts to present myself in a kind of exaggerated form-- wear fewer clothes and give myself a simplified, slutty image-- in order to sell my image and my music. However, I'd rather present myself in a way that is closer to who I am-- a sexual being, yes, but one who is interested in examining what it is to be a sexual being, a spiritual being, a creative being, etc. It may be a more difficult image to \"sell,\" but I would rather appeal to those who are willing to examine life with me through words and music. I am not aware of one single moment when this became crystal clear to me. I think my understanding of gender and music has grown and changed over time. I can think of outstanding, outspoken women artists from many eras, Bessie Smith to Janis Joplin to Liz Phair and beyond, but I have the sense that there is a way to be bold, lyrical, and relevant since the 90s that wasn't around in the same way much before. Ani DiFranco has extraordinary talent, but she is not alone in the kind of approach and attitude that she uses. It seems to me that at many an open mic you can find young, outspoken women who will sing their lives out loud with passion, daring, politics- and with whatever attitude that helps them to say it best. \"I was friends with Warren Zevon (What a crazy, amazing, talented guy-- He is so missed.). I don't talk about it much, but he did give me some thoughts on my music and the industry in general. He once told me \"\"I don't know why anyone who could be a biochemist would want to be a pop star.\"\" (I studied Biochemistry at Rutgers and worked for a while as an analyst in a microbiology lab.) He was pretty cynical about the business, and most things for that matter. He did say though that the reason one should pursue music is that it is truly what you must do. It has to feel like the only thing you can do. If it feels like the kind of calling that you can in no way deny, then that is why you do it. That is a gem to me. I searched my soul for the reasons I keep going, and I found that I really must. I thank him for that reality check, and for teaching me that you have to have enormous drive to stay in the music business and that that drive has to come from someplace awfully intense and genuine. As for my advice, I would tell a woman musician to be all of herself: Be all of yourself and when you discover that you are hiding or holding something back out of the fear of not being understood or accepted, work through that and let yourself shine. I have found that the more truth I reveal in my work the better it is, and the more people care. You won't be happy presenting yourself as a clone of the last famous artist somebody thought you ought to be like, and you'll never find the audience that resonates with the music of your soul by masquerading as someone or something else. \" \"I began on piano at age 7. I began to become interested in the guitar while still in elementary school and learned a few chords. I liked the rock sensibility that felt natural on guitar, but I honestly think I chose it more wholeheartedly for its portablilty when traveling and performing live. I stil love the piano & long to come back to it with greater attention. In 2001, I had a spiritual vision - perhaps it could be described as a kundalini experience - that transformed my life. I had been exposed somewhat to kirtan chanting beforehand, but after the experience I was profoundly moved to spiritual singing and to immerse myself in this form of Indian chant in particular. It was natural, then, that I started to play the harmonium and to incorporate that element into the music that I perform. \" - Instruments: Mam\u00e1 burger, Selma Oxor, Bam Bam - Years playing: vocals, bass, guitar, keyboard, some other stuff... My role in the band, the studio........ I sing and do some lyrics with Bam Bam, I compose the songs of Selma Oxor some times by myself and sometimes jamming with my bandmates. Play bass and keyboards sometimes... we dont play that often couse we all have other projects so who knows... i might go solo some times is not that hard... i guess I do management of Selma Oxor?? getting the gigs, making art for the merch... you know, stuff you gotta do to actually get your band moving. Its all a la DIY I personaly dont own any instrumments couse of economical reasons had to sell most of them, My gear right now consists on a casio oldschool keyboard with cool rythms to jam with and vibration effects and some reverb that makes it sound kinda goth... own some thing that looks like an arp, flaut and some percusion stuff. I like any kind of instrumment, not neccessarily bought items but also stuff you can make with rocks and stuff that makes noise... I also use fruity loops to make sequences in the computer, some people say is for dummies but i like it, Its easy and fun and you can make lots of stuff with it. Woman musicians are more authentic some times becouse they r not affraid of looking like a girl when u play or like a guy, either one or the other is ok haha, so i guess women are more sensitive and follow their feelings a lot and that is a very important key when making a song. My band mate Mou said something like that when asked how was like to play in a group formed by girls.... And is true... some girls say man, woman we r all the same. We are not. And boys that play in bands most of them are as in touch with their feminine side as woman with their masculine... Just look at L7!! they act like dudes, but they are awesome!!! they have style... some times i see Anarko punk bands where girls singing and dressing totally like dudes... I dont get it... That just tells me lack of confidense, or being affraid of guys saying nasty stuff and that is something that i know, I've heared girls say i cant play on a skirt bcs of some nasty dude screaming stuff at me... there is always gonna b that guy saying nasty stuff... watever man he is the one looking like an ass, not you. Iam not againts dressing like a dude but just dont do it bcs you wanna be accepted.... thats just dumb... No yes, not officially but my musician friends just by beeing friends gave me a lot of advices, most of them aremuch older than me. I think im lucky to find good people allt he time. The advice i can give to anyone is not to listen to anyone but yourself and be friends with Satan I saw my older sister played the bass in a band so i just took it by curiosity... then started playing my favorite bands songs, got bored of other peoples songs... then I made my own, when you know how to play an instrument, the next instrument you try to play comes easier, then the other one too, so i would say i can play any instrument, I didnt took any classes but if I see a guitar im not gonna chicken out becouse i dont really know how the chords are called or anything... im not a super musician but Im not affraid to play anything and i can get stuff out of it that sounds good even tho i dont literally KNOW how to play it. I hate people that hates musicians that play simple stuff, like you need to be a virtuous player to sound cool. duuh no, I punk - Instruments: five. X, the Knitters, Auntie Christ, the Original Sinners, and solo artist - Years playing: vocals, guitar i write words and music, produce recordings, decide what work to take or turn down. 1964 gibson j50 acoustic, audix microphones. yes it is. women are not taken as seriously as men across the spectrum. that includes everything from playing, writing, producing and engineering. in the field of performance, women are usually expected to use sex appeal to sell their music. the moment is now. sister rosetta tharpe was an amazing guitar player and singer. she was one of the originators of rock n roll. primary a gospel artist, she invented the rock n roll guitar! she is seldom mentioned or credited. i think younger women, in their teens and twenties are becoming more visible in the arts, and are becoming more comfortable with being themselves vs being a sex object. they have a hundred years of american musical history to learn from. hundreds of people have given me valuable advice. i mostly learned by watching other women and figuring out what not to do. my advice: work, work, work. practice a lot. never stop writing. listen to your gut. don't let anyone use you or abuse you. stand up for yourself and what you believe in. work with other women, when possible and set a good example of kindness, chacter and responsibility for the women who will come along after you. be professional. don't \"act like a man\" to get ahead. \"if you can't beat em, join em\" DOES NOT apply anymore. rock on, sisters! dave alvin taught me the fundamnetal chords and strumming techniques. he's one of our greatest guitarists. - Instruments: Kyoto Beat Orchestra, The Evening Episode, Tired Hours, Winter Trees, Sister Crayon - Years playing: Vocals, Loop Samples I started Sister Crayon. It used to just be a solo project but I always wanted more-more sound, more players, more dynamics. It is now 4 of us and we all have roles in the band, I would say that I have a huge role in the band. I have done most of the booking and managing of the band in the past. We now are all taking an active role in different areas. In the studio, it's the same thing. We all take an active role in our instruments and the overall feel of the music. I am huge huge huge into vocal arrangements and the overall mood of the songs. I have a good relationship with our engineer so we will be in the studio for 16+ hour days sometime, working on songs. The same thing with business decisions. We are lucky enough to be working with a label, so we don't have to do everything. But we definatly get the final say on pretty much everything, and I am the main contact for the band with the label. As a band, we make all the decisions together. I sing and record loops live on stage. I use a kaos pad as well as a Boss Loop pedal as well as a Line 6 Loop Pedal. I sing thru the effects pedal (and also clean) while looping live to our music, matching the BPM's of the music to the vocals. I think everything is different being a woman compared to being a man. Living in a patriarchal society, it is inevitable to be treated differently as a woman (in any business/art realm). In the past, I would have sound guys at venues that we would play at that would think that I was just some girlfriend of a member...and then they would see us play and then come up after the show to say how much they liked our sound or whatever. I tried to never let it get to me though. I always thought it was funny. I think that it's getting better for women but there is still a long way to go. It's always a little scary to be a woman and to try to create art and try to be taken seriously. People will always look at the way that you look before anything, no matter how good your voice may be or how genuine your lyrics will be. First thing, will always be how attractive you may or may not be. It's sad. There are differences for sure, I believe. I think that there are great things going on now and there was amazing female musicians in the past as well. I have to say that even though I adore many contemporary female musicians, I am a sucker for the past. Watching old videos of Billie Holiday and hearing the real pain she felt in every song, or Patsy Cline crying during songs...man, you don't see that everyday now. You know? But I think that women have more of a presence in music today, which is great. I think that more women are creating music that has not only become popularized in society but that is loved and adored by the world. I don't really remember any one single thing that has stuck out, other than people who have just told me to keep it going. There has been a lot of support for the band that I am in and I appreciate it so much. It's amazing to me that people even listen at all, you know? I would just tell someone that if they have the feeling where they would not feel complete or even alive if they were not making music, then go with it and stay with it and run with it. If it's genuine, people will respect it and see that. Genuine music/genuine people will always win. I believe that. I've always sang. I used to be really shy when I was younger and would never sing in front of anyone, but when I was alone in my bedroom-man. I would jump on my bed and grab a hairbrush (you know, the classic tale) and sing and scream and dance to Elvis, Diana Ross & The Supremes, and 50's music. It was always 50's music. I would charm my stuffed animals that I would have lined up in my room. I lived a completely different life in my bedroom. I was about 5 when I first started this. Gradually, I couldn't prevent from singing. I started a band in high school and played a lot in the area. And I've been in different bands ever since...all sounded drastically different from one another. I finally feel complete in Sister Crayon. - Instruments: Two: my own and Jennie Lowe Stearns and the Fire Choir - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano In the band: songwriter, vocals, rhythm guitar. In the studio: co-producer, vocals, guitar, keys. in business & marketing: all positions (I just started getting help from an intern who runs a wonderful website: www.skipster.us) Red Yamaha steel string guitar. Roland FP 500 keyboard. 1. I played a Clash tribute concert last year and a girl came up to me after my set saying how great it was to see a female fronted band at the event. I think there was only one other female fronted band in a lineup of ten bands. 2. Men may be more likely than women to make sexually laced comments in either rehearsal settings or venue settings...and it's important for a woman to know how to set limits. 3. In general, however, I don't usually pick up on a difference as an audience becomes attached to the artists they love whether male or female. I'm not sure. I would have to give this more thought as there are so many different pockets of women in music--rock stars, divas, folk singers.... I once played a couple songs for Pete Luboff at a conference, wanting to know if he thought I should aim to be a songwriter for other artists, or be a performing songwriter. He encouraged me to perform my own music--and recommended that I learn to crave the stage. That line, \"crave the stage,\" has stuck with me and has helped me come out of my shell a lot more. Whereas I used to shy away from performing, I'm now deriving some pleasure from it. So, budding fellow woman musician....\"Crave the stage!\" And, I would also say, be patient while practicing the craft. It's amazing how putting in the time really allows for growth and surprises. I grew up playing classical piano. While attending an arts high school for piano performance, I sensed an urge to be more musically free, but couldn't access that on the piano since I was so used to reading music while playing. I asked my parents for a guitar and found it opened up my ability to really listen and explore sound. I remain technically amateur on the guitar, but find it to be the most useful instrument for my songwriting. - Instruments: Packway Handle Band, Lera Lynn, Dancer playing: vocals, viola, flute, ukulele \"In the band: main authority figure/maternal-esque leader to my bandmates and to the audience, hopefully a compelling performer. In the studio: co-songwriter, instrumentalist, co-decision maker on artistic direction. In business: money manager.\" I play the viola and uke through a Sano accordion tube amp with a 15 inch speaker and two 8 inch speakers. Every once in a while I will kick on my Boss DD5 delay pedal. \"I think there are differences. For instance, I've noticed that more people (myself included) are more critical of a woman's singing voice. There are fewer liberties given to out-of-tune notes and tonal qualities when a woman sings. Perhaps this is because of the higher pitches... As instrumentalists, I think that women are held to a lower standard sometimes and maybe not consciously by most people. I know that when I see a female drummer or bass player, a position typically occupied by a man, I am immediately enchanted, whether she's good or not. And it's always more impressive when she is talented! From my position, I think I have that reaction because it's attractive to see a woman in a man's part. But I have overheard on several occasions some dudes at a show saying, \"\"yeah, she's pretty good for a lady,\"\" etc, etc.\" Etta James and Beyonce. I think this relationship (or maybe it's a feud?) is evident of the differences. Don't stop. Just don't stop. \"The viola has the qualities of both the violin and the cello. It can reach most the notes that a violin can reach (or at least the ones you want to hear) and some of the low notes of the cello without being too bulky and difficult to carry around. The baritone ukulele is perfect for someone with small hands like mine. I learned to play guitar, but the neck was too wide so I switched to the uke since the bottom strings are the same as a guitar and I didn't have to re-learn chords. Plus I can bring the uke anywhere I go just in case I have some inspiration hits me. \" - Instruments: Just solo, as Liz Fullerton, and with DUTCH - Years playing: guitar and vocals In the band I'm half of it, In the studio I am pretty breezy and malleable, really been open to suggestions and tried hard not to get too precious about things, but I'm not afraid to speak up if I feel its going in a direction Im not too excited about. As for business and marketing, In the case of Dutch, its in the hands of the record company, and for my solo project I will be fully in charge of that. 1 acoustic Olympia, 1 electric danelectro, 1 glass of bourbon and 1 vintage dress. \"As a woman singer/songwriter I feel a difference, because even that name comes along with some assumptions. I feel fortunate to be coming out as a musician in a town like Philadelphia which is I think irregularly supportive. As for being a female singer in a more hip hop group I feel really respected and welcomed so far. The difference is with my guitar playing, I don't wanna be a girl who doesn't have chops, and I realized that through this process of recording and having so many talented musicians playing on my songs, I want to be able to do that. \" For both those questions my answer would be confidence. It is a strange bird that can surpass even talent, and I'm not talking about the outward expression of it, EGO, but the inward one of staying true and grounded in your own style and way about you. You know who you are, so get after it. my dad gave me a guitar when i was 13, and I've been trying to play it ever since. I have always been singing, since I was just a little girl, and really started to explore my voice in high school. - Instruments: Just Dengue Fever and sometimes I do a few shows in the Cambodian Community - Years playing: Vocals As equal to all my bandmates. My voice, make-up & wardrobes. \"For women, we always need security and assistance for wardrobes; for men they can roam free after shows and they don't need too much prep. As for being a musician, I feel there is not much of a difference.\" Throughout time women musicians are given more genres of music to choose from. In the past, in certain cultures if women were to choose to be a rock musician it would seemed promiscuous. Now it is more accepted. The best advice I received was to stay focused and avoid drugs. Love what you do so it will show in your product. My family - we're mostly singers. - Instruments: 8/10/2010 - Years playing: vocals, keys, guitar I am the lead singer, singer/songwriter, head producer, and band manager. We use all different bands but are trying to lean more towards a full set up of one brand. We have a guitar player, thus a guitar amp; a bass player, thus a bass amp; a drummer, thus a drumkit and lots of percussion; a pianist, thus a keybaord; and we are all vocalists so four mics. We also tote around a PA if needed. \"Yes. Women must stay youthful looking (young, thin and attractive) to sell, this even often trumps level of talent. It is not the case with men who can come off grungy, old, dirty, or fat. As the manager of a 4-5 man band where I am the only female, and assistant to our actual manager, I've seen that people tend to see a strong woman as bitchy instead of ambitious. Our stuff is rock and can get pretty heavy; however, we are clumped in with many wishy-washy singer/songwriter and girly acts. Only recently have we been getting on male driven bills and tearing down the house!\" \"Women today are a lot less afraid to be political, or story tellers. Back in the early 20th centry, it was all about wailing on soprano notes about lost loves. In the nineties and early 2000s it was all about wearing nothing, having long flowy hair and videos were degrading. Though maybe not in urban music, this is slowly changing in other genres.\" I would say find that circle of supporters, that team that makes you comfortable and makes you feel supported. Then tear down the house. No one will be able to stop you. I was given a keyboard at an early age and was drawn to it. - Instruments: Paper Bird is the only real band i've ever been in. We've been together almost 4 years - Years playing: vocals We all have different roles but it rotates a lot. When someone is burnt out on business, there's someone there to step in. Or if there's a particular band or town or organization an individual wants the band involved in, that person usually spearheads it. We've made our fair share of mistakes learning by doing, but now our trust in each other is based on shared experience. When we come to a complex issue, we figure out something we can all agree with. By the time all seven of us can stand behind it, it is probably the right decision. Singing is the best because you never have to haul your instrument or leave it behind. I have it with me wherever i go. We have three women and four men in our band. It's only recently been dawning on me how rare that is. I can't imagine being in a band where I was the only singer and the only focal point. We are a very cohesive unit musically. I think our band and Denver in general are doing a lot to break the boys club vibe i feel a lot of other places. Of course it's still there, but we don't feel like we have to play into that to succeed. I feel more bias as a singer/musician than i do a woman/musician. I think any woman that has continued in music for more than a generation is a very unique individual. It takes a lot to be true to yourself when the road to marketing yourself in a shallow way is so wide open. Even if your music is the real substance, people might not see past the \"young girls that sing thing\" for a little while. But that's a very vulnerable position to put yourself in. There are a lot of girls that could replace you if you let someone else make you. You have to believe in what you're doing and feel connected to it or it will never last. The women that are still around are often the best role models. Surround yourself with people who challenge you as much as they support you. If you respect people that contradict you, it will be a catalyst for growth. Singing is the only thing i've been doing my whole life. - Instruments: 20 or so? depends on def of \"regularly\" -- incl Tucson Symph, Eugene Symph, Aspen Festival Orchestras etc - Years playing: cello, some piano In the most basic sense, I am a freelancer. To that end, I am responsible for all roles of a music making enterprise, including but not limited to: bandleader, programmer, public liaison, marketing, accounting, human resources, soloist, chamber musician, instructor, coach, visionary... My \"gear\" is a 1995 cello by Thomas Schmidt and a 1989 bow by Greg Gohde. Occasionally, I also use the Realist brand acoustic transducer. \"ABSOLUTELY, being a female musician differs from being a male musician. Women are supposed to be modest and not stick out too much -- at least that's the programming I've received most of my life -- and that completely flies in the face of what is needed to be successful as a musician. Sometimes it seems a musician needs a confidence that borders on arrogance, which is behavior much more encouraged and/or tolerated in males than in females. Still, let it not go unsaid, that these dynamics can change. Si, se puede! \" I would imagine the previous generation of women musicians was more geared toward teaching than performing, Luckily, as times goes on, there are more opportunities for women to be performers as well. (e.g. Vienna Philharmonic!) \"In graduate school, there was another cellist I considered to be my main competition within in the school. My professor observed how I deferred to her and basically told me that was totally unnecessary. I think it just taught me an important lesson about valuing your own point of view. So that's pretty much what I would tell other female musicians: Come, on girls! Know your Inner Goddess! Damnit! :-) Hope this helps. \" I chose the cello because it was what my older brother *didn't* play. (He was a violinist.) - Years playing: guitar and vocals I run all business/marketing decisions for the band and write the music as well as SING both lead and harmonies. My twin sister helps write music and runs the photography business we have. I have a 2008 Breedlove Pro...she's my \"purchase a NICE guitar so I'll play it more\" purchase. \"OF course....the entertaining aspect is completely different, especially in the Tx Country category. Guys get on stage and it's a Party...girls have to capture the audience in a different way, unless your songs are all drinkin' songs. We moved to Austin a year ago and started looking for band members and I posted ads on Craigslist....I noticed that when I put TWINS and a picture it generated more of a response....there are just so many artists here that setting yourself apart is imperative. \" It's honestly all about the perseverance and networking. Keep meeting people and if they like you they will promote you and so on and so on. You can't expect EVERYONE to like what you do but keep going after those that do. I hung around some Tx Country musicians in college and a friend gave me a guitar for Christmas. I didn't play it until after college and then after a breakup decided to pick it up again and wrote my FIRST song. - Instruments: I perform with my own group exclusively. - Years playing: Voice and some piano I'm the artist and I formed my band, I raised money to start my own record label and music publishing company. I make all the decisions. I hired a producer to be in charge in the studio. My gear is my voice. In terms of other independent female artists like me, I find they second guess themselves a lot and don't always ask for what they want from their male band members. That could also be attributed to having a \"singers complex\" where we don't feel respected as musicians. I find that although I have a degree in voice and have sung my entire life and studied under some of the best teachers in the world, my musicians like to give me singing advice. I find it infuriating. I would never advise my viola player on how to hold his bow! But I find that my female string players are really pretty tough. They ask for more money, they act very professionally, I've been very impressed by that. They've acted more professionally than my male string players have who tend to be late and ask for way too much money. This is an interesting question because I think the answer is that there's not much difference. I do have a great aunt who gave up music after going to a conservatory because she got married, but that was right after World War II, which was a long time ago. I think because women are excepted to earn just as much as men now, we are actually encouraged not to go into music because the idea is that it doesn't pay well. I can imagine that in past generations, if the family had money, they thought it was a great idea for a woman to study music in college because she wasn't going to actually have a career anyway and music is a nice skill to have. \"People over the years have always told me to learn as much about the business as possible, so I did that for sure. I also had a female teacher try to claim ownership of my songs and it was very upsetting. For a while I didn't want to collaborate with anyone because if that. But my other long-time teacher and mentor told me that I had to risk it and go out and work with other people because I was living like a hermit! Well, that was some of the best advice I've ever gotten. The next week I hired my producer and started recording my first album. My advice to a woman starting out would be, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want with your business decisions, with your music, with your live show. Don't be afraid or intimidated by people and don't live for others. Live for yourself, do whatever you want, and make the music you want. Think up the ideas and do them. \" \"I was born with an amazing gift that was obvious to everyone who I encountered musically since birth practically, so I feel that my instrument chose me. I then enjoyed that voice so much and honed it with training until it became as good as it could be. At four years old, my mother put me in piano lessons where we would sing and play the pitches at the same time. She also put me in ballet where I was able to not only dance, but develop my rhythm and artistry. \" - Instruments: About 10 - here are some: Girl Monstar. Creatures From The Blues Lagoon, Jazz Brothers, Spunkrat, Eden AKA, Crocodile Banshee - Years playing: guitar/vocals/mandolin/bass/lap steel 'Solo artist' so I am the band leader, string and brass arranger, organizer, composer songwriter. I produce and record my own records as I am a sound engineer of sorts. I am a video director for my own and other artists videos. I produce and record other artist's records. I run my own record company and do just about EVERYTHING. Fortunately my agent, Linda Lewis shares the load when she can. '79 Gibson Les Paul, Fender Telecaster, Maton Acoustic Guitar, Lap Steel Guitar, Kustom Coupe 36 Amp, Mojave Audio Microphones, Pro Tools LE, Mac G4 Dual Processor, Wah-wah, Fulltone Distortion, Boss Octave, Line-6 Delay, Boss Flanger etc. I could go on but those are the main ones. Yes, definitely. It's still a male orientated business. Guys in the business just like guy musicians and male artists best. I don't think they really take women seriously as musicians. I'm not talking about male musicians here (whom I love), but men running the music business. They still think women should just sing. The only female guitarist they've ever 'let in' to the mainstream is Bonnie Raitt but there are plenty of us out there. Check out Guitar Player Reader's Poll where they had a Best Female Guitarist Category and many responses were: 'no such thing'. Needless to say Bonnie Raitt won that one every year as she was the only one they had heard of... Only that there are more of us now. I relate very strongly to Nancy and Ann Wilson. I have toured with them quite a bit and spent some fun times jamming with them and we are on the same page. Practice, practice, practice! Be your best. Shun the naysayers and don't let the bastards get you down. Play music with people you love, love your music. Leave your ego off stage. Write from your heart and soul. Love is all you need. I fell in love with the guitar when I was a kid. The Beatles??? and my brother played really well. I inherited his electric guitar and that was it for me. But not for that I'd probably have been an English Professor. - Instruments: The Sippy Cups, Tempest (2003 to 2005), The Brian Cline Band, The Palm Wine Boys, several local Jazz Bands - Years playing: Electric Bass (4, 5, 6 string), upright bass, piano, vocals. Working knowledge of several other instruments - I also occasionally get hired to compose or do sounddesign for games or websites \"Bassist (live and in the studio) Some bands are run democratic, so some (or all) business decisions are made together. Other bands I was with had a label (Tempest with Magna Carta, Palm WIne Boys with Wild Plum), so many decisions were made without my input\" \"Electric Basses: I am endorsed by two European boutique bass manufacturers, Marleaux and Fibenare 4 string, 5 string 6 string Consat 5 string Votan Marleaux Fretless 5 string Fibenare Bohemian Upright from the 1900s I am also endorsed by Eden amplifiers (World Tour 800 and several cabs) as well as Looperlative Looper pedals Gear also includes a host of pedals, loopers, a home studio, several pianos, a PA etc\" \"Yes and no. I think the experience of music and the urge to express oneself musically is universal. I see striking differences in the way my female students learn and memorize music as compared to their male counterparts (grossly simplified, women seem to learn more visual, men more auditory, women seem to use their voice more directly to help their ears, whereas males tend to be analytical...) There sure is still a lot of prejudice about women rhythm section players - I was excluded from auditions because of being female ('This band is not a punk band!'), and it was often assumed that women in the band would not get along ('There will be cat fights', 'They will fight over the spotlight/the drummer' etc.), assumptions on sexual orientation are being made (a very famous bassist once asked me: 'Are you gay?') and I will never forget that sound guy who asked me - as I walked in the door with my amp and bass - 'So, do you have a REAL bassist, too? Where do I plug him in?' \" \"I wish I could say that. I see a lot of fantastic female bassists on the scene today (Esperanza Spaulding, Tal Wilkenfeld for example) who continue the lineage of mavericks such as Carol Kaye, Me'Shell NDegeocello and Rhonda Smith. Professional female bassists still seem to be such a rarity, however. One o fmy missions in life is to inspire girls of all ages to pick up the bass guitar and explore its distinct feminine and earthlike qualities. After all, groove comes right from the belly and the hips and women know all about that, just watch them dance!\" \"I have gotten invaluable advice from my mentors and teachers, who believed in me and inspired me. Especially my (now) husband just encouraged me to explore playing because I loved it. When I first saw MeShell NDegeocello play live I was completely blown away. I truly didn't know that a woman could do something like that. When you are learning, you need someone mirroring back to you how well you are doing. Every person has music in them and, with a good amount of passion and desire, can learn to play. A good teacher will see the musical personality in the student and foster that and bring it to fruition. My advice is to search for that spark, never stop until you find it (get help from a teacher if you need to) and to go for it. \" \"I started out on piano and recorder, all classical music. Later I joined bands and played guitar and keys. At one point our band, a Blues Rock band, lost their bassist and we couldn't find replacement. We had gigs on the books. So I went an bought a bass. The guitarist showed me the lines and a few weeks later I played my first gig. It was love at first sight. A year later I started taking formal lessons. I went on to marry my favorite teacher.... \" I am it, me, myself and I. Just me and my vocal chords Yes. In classical opera the level of standrads for a female performer versus a male performer is extremely skewed in his favor. There are so many women to choose from that one mu constantly be \"upping\" her game whereas men get away with not being musically prepared, not able to remember staging and the inability to act. We are becoming more and more saturated with pop culture. Many women are being rejected for roles for not being physically what they want. In previous generations I believe it was more about the voice than anything else. I would say be strong in yourself and make sure to explore and question everyone you come across because I find too many young female singers don't care about the flaws of the idols they look up to. They take what one person says as gospel and refuse to develop their own minds. EXPLORE your own opinions, ladies!! It was the only activity that set me apart and that I shone in. - Instruments: MIchelle Malone Banned, Band De Soleil, Indigo Girls - Years playing: Vocals, guitar I've always had alot of creative control in my career. I write the songs, i co-produce, and i run my own label. I've had managers and labels off and on over the years, but at present i'm wearing all the hats. It's alot of work, but I feel like i'm doing just fine. \"I play electric and acoustic guitars - i started playing slide guitar in 2003. Since then, it has become somewhat of a signature for me. I play vintage Supro guitars through vintage Supro amps when i play slide. My favorite slide combo is a 1959 Supro Dual Tone through the matching amp...i bought them on ebay about 4 years ago- LOVE, LOVE , LOVE them! I also regularly play a mid 90-s Martin HD28, a late 90's Gibson Chet Atkins, a Gibson Everly Brothers reissue, a 73' Strat, and a few Hamer Duotones....they are both electric and acoustic.\" \"Where do i begin?! The whole rock ethos born in the 60's and 70's was by, for, and about men. That was a long time ago, but there's still a chasm between men and women musicians about what's expected and accepted from each.I was almost dropped from Arista once for my \"\"rude rockstar behavior\"\" (ok, i was off the chain when i was 22! HA HA HA HA!! Imagine anyone saying that to a man. Also, when i first started, my single was taken to AOR radio where i was told from 90% of them, \"\"We love your record, but we're already playing 2 women (probably Melissa Etheridge and Pat Benatar?), so we cant play you.\"\" Seriously?!! Oh well, chalk it up to timing! Things have changed some...but not enough. Thank god for the women who came before us and began breaking down the barriers - god only knows how bad it would still be if not for them! I guess i'm becoming one of those, having been at it so long...it's wierd and wonderful to transition from being the youngest to an elder stateswoman - HA HA HA!;-)\" Yes, and no...i think most musicians are still by and large, the insecure kid who sat in her room with a guitar and played alone every day...we're overly sensitive, insecure, and in need of alot of approval, also known as attention! Other than that...the younger ones are probably better at social networking (an absolute necessity now), posting videos, and staying in touch. And though I tend to concentrate more on playing and writing when i can, i still get sucked into the vacuum that is Facebook. I cant wait for it to be surpassed by whatever the next big internet thing is! \"No. I wish they had. Although i dont think I would have heard them. Listen more than you speak. Although it may seem like it's all about you (interviews, radio, singing and recording YOUR songs), it really isn't. Not even a little. It's about building relationships. Do that, and you'll have a future. Record deals, bands, money, etc come and go. Friendships last forever. More than likely, you wont get rich and famous, even if you have a record deal. So invest your money, keep your publishing and own your masters. They may be your retirement fund. It's a journey, not a destination. Whether or not you enjoy it all is up to you! It's alot more fun if you find something positive about every show, every fan, every day! If you make music for fun and friendship, you'll be spreading your joy and love with everyone! And that's a much better feeling than doing it for the money or fame. Trust me. I KNOW!\" My big brother had a guitar that his dad had given him....he never played it, so it stayed in his closed like a secret...and this kid was very curious....my mom is a singer and pianist, so it was natural for me to start playing professionally. - Instruments: regularly: Paper Bird - Years playing: vocals singer, writer of songs, business brain. all acoustic: guitar, banjo, upright bass, trombone, trumpet, 3 vocals no i don't. if you make good music that's it, doesn't matter if you're a llama or a shoehorn or a woman or a moon of jupiter. the songs should speak louder than the person singing them. my dad always sang while my sister and i were growing up, we three would sing together, i can't remember a time i wasn't singing. - Instruments: Tia two acoustic violins with and without Baggs pick up / Musicary carbon fiber bows and D'Addario Heliocore strings. Trace Elliott acoustic guitar amplifier. Usually there is a stigma with the older purist of jazz that a woman on a violin can't play especially if they have never heard of you before. So at least to meI always have to prove yourself. I don't know if that is because I am a woman or because of my choice of instrument. This may be true for men as well. I just try to give it all I have in every situation Not really The best advice I ever received was in public: Play what I want and how I want to and make sure I was very confident about it. In private keep working and perfecting and experimenting with sounds and styles. Ask questions from mentors and listen like crazy when given the opportunity to work with those who have more knowledge than I do. I heard some kids playing in elementary school and decided that was a great sound to make. - Instruments: at least 10 (including Damage from Bob, Swing Set, Sixteen Deluxe, The Pretty Please, The Witches of Mendocino, and Elevated Lines) - Years playing: vocals, guitar, keyboards front person. song writer. actively involved in production and decision making. Full partner and as involved or delegating as much as seems appropriate at the time. \"Sixteen Deluxe (currently- used to have more!) : Daisy Rock Rock Candy guitar, Kay hollow body guitar, 1980's Marshall Artist series head through a Marshall (celestions!) 2x12, overdrive pedal, Big Muff, Double Muff, mxr octave pedal, cry baby wah, analog reverb pedal, electroharmonix memory toy, electroharmonix chorus, boss tremolo... Elevated Lines: Kay Hollowbody, smaller fender amps (deluxe or blues jr) fuzz pedal, delays, variety of keyboards and midi synths, and lots of tea for singing\" It's different in that, although there is no doubt that men and women are creative and intellectual equals, there is an inherent difference in communication and listening styles. I think these differences can strengthen the creative process if one respects those differences and each other. There was no \"lightbulb moment\". I'm still learning about all of this! \"Absolutely. When I was on tour in the '90, everyone thought I was either the bass player or the tour manager. It wasn't common for a woman to be a guitar playing front person in a loud rock band that didn't advertise itself as a \"\"riot girl\"\" kind of thing. Also I felt like I had to be a tomboy to be taken seriously... but that's a longer story about perceptions of beauty and compentency. Women seem more accepted as musicians, whatever instrument they choose. There are also more women sound engineers, which also helps a great deal in establishing a basis of acceptance when a woman walks into a club or studio to work.\" \"If you are the only woman in a group of men, don't convince yourself that you have to be \"\"one of the guys\"\" to be accepted. Have confidence that you are all equal and enjoy the fact that you are different. Respect and nurture those differences. At the same time, take time to understand how male communication can be different. Learn the language and expect respect in return. Lastly: nothing is more important than your health. really. Know that your 115 pound self houses that brain that makes all of the music possible. Take care of them both.\" If a none to bright dude in a rock band could play guitar, certainly a smart girl could. - Instruments: me/ solo - Years playing: vocals and piano artists, writer, leader, i am involved in all decisions affecting my career my company and my product \"me with dancers, or me with acoustic set up, guitar or piano change it up for diff shows\" Yes it is but at the same time no. If your a true artists you are just that, it cuts through and gender becomes irrelevant \"yes not being from a family of music i can only comment on what I have seen through music's history... Women now have true control and can run entire empires and be producers of their companies..... but the art hasnt changed they were still as talented back then as now\" \"I figured most things on my own....but got good advise on many things along the way. I always tell my female friends who want to be taken seriously to not over expose their bodies in the studios to play down sexuality untill up on the stage or in a position of control and power.....Its all in the mannerism how you deliver yourself. Never come across needing a mans help.....always hold your own and true genuine people will come to you to help if they see true talent. And help you for your artistry not for other reasons ;-)\" i didn't it chose me ;-) - Instruments: metal pitcher, a careful workman is the best safety device, superchunk - Years playing: bass guitar \"In addition to playing, I have always been the person who had a head for financial matters. I always did the book keeping, took the conservative view in spending money, etc.\" I have a very old (from the 70's I bet) and beat up Ampeg 2x15\" cabinet with EV speakers, an Acoustic 370 bass head from the 70's also I think, a Fender Precision bass from 1977 (candy apple red!), and a distortion pedal called \"hot cake\" made by Crowther audio in New Zealand. I found out about this awesome company because Denise from the 3d's had a hot cake and I loved her sound...we did some shows together and she let me in on the secret. Back in '93 it was really hard to find a distortion pedal that sounded good with bass. Yes. My friend Jennifer Barwick, who played in a band called Erectus Monotone around the same time that Superchunk started, and I were talking about this recently. Back in the late 80's early 90's we would walk into the club with the other people in the band and it was assumed by the people who worked there that we were either \"just the girlfriends\" or \"groupies\" and some comment would be made at some point that alerted us to that. Also any technical opinions we might have had were sometimes dismissed by people who did not know us. I think it is a lot better these days, it seems like it is far less unusual for there to be women in punk rock bands and bands in general now. When I tell people I am in a band now, I still do occasionally get immediately asked if i am the singer. People assume that if you are a woman, you are going to be that one. mmm, not that i can generalize. Not specifically as a woman. I would advise anyone in the music industry to do it because it is fun and personally rewarding, and try not to think of it as a way to get famous or even make a living, or that might make it disappointing for you. Take it for what it is and keep it fun. Keep your day job. Most musicians don't become well known. this guy I was dating needed a bass player! - Instruments: Lots! Ryan Adams, Asleep At The Wheel, Dave Alvin, BeauSoLeil, Van Morrison, Rod Stewart, more. - Years playing: steel guitar, Dobro/various acoutstic slide guitars/ lap steel \"In a band, to musically support both the vocalist the and other musicians.. Same in the studio. As a side person, you have to suss out each new situation quickly and find where to fit in, and add your sound in the best way possible. For business, I have a booking agent to help, and for marketing, I make sure website and social networking avenues are up to date. In this business overall, I sometimes find good intuition is valuable as well! \" Various steel, lap steel, and slide guitars, both vintage and contemporary. Three different amps, (all Fender amps). Two pedal boards, one for Dobro and acoustic slide guitars with built in pickups, and one for the steel and lap steel guitars. I do a variety of music styles, so need variety with gear. There's been a few moments I've experienced, such as people saying \"You play like a man\" (?!). Or, when I'm the only female in a band, to try to eat as fast, change clothes/get ready for a show as fast...men always seem to do both of those things at top speed. There's definately more female musicians in each generation...of course there's always been talented women players, it's just that as the years progressed, it became more acceptable and common to be able to do it for a living, casually or full time. The \"a woman's place is in the home\" mentality kept a lot held back for so long. \"I never really got any advice, I think it was all through experience and learning from each situation. The music business has gotten very tough, due to economy and everything that has gone along with it, but regardless... Try to be as professional as you can, no matter what the situation, and to learn as much as you can as well. It's just as important to learn the technical side of things too, i.e. so you can communicate with a soundman at a live gig or an engineer in a recording studio. Don't be afraid to ask questions from those more experienced than you. Above all, you have to love what you are doing, and do it from the heart..there's no guarantees to \"\"fame and fortune\"\"! \" I started out playing regular guitar, and switched to Dobro and steel because I fell in love with the sound, and wanted something different to play/hear. - Instruments: Any regular performances have been as a solo artist - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, percussion, some strings I'm the boss, on all counts. I have a computer I use for recording, as well as a 4-track cassette. Instruments include: Fender Jaguar electric guitar, 12-string electric (custom-made hybrid Vox Phantom & fender Shenandoah), Fender Musicmaster bass, Ampeg Jet II guitar amp, Korg monophonic synth, violin, cello, recorder, various percussion instruments, etc. \"Yes. We are often judged by appearance rather than our music. One thing that is really tough is when I see someone commenting on how hot a female musician is (especially if she's a friend) on lastfm.com, or some other place where people can leave their comments about the music they listen to. Things said can be downright vulgar, which is hugely disrespectful. The first time I really noticed being treated differently as a female musician was going into a guitar shop with a male friend to buy my first guitar, and the salesperson wouldn't talk to me, even after it was made clear that I was the one making the purchase. But this doesn't really happen anymore, there are a lot more women buying guitars and drums than there was 15 or more years ago. \" Maybe just that more recent generations of women are doing so much of it themselves (making the music, recording it, releasing it, booking their own tours, etc), whereas in recent decades, bands or performers would look to be signed to a record label that would handle most things for them. Yes, but I probably haven't followed it. I might tell a young woman that if she's going to do it, give it all she has, and don't look back. Don't let anyone stand in your way. Anyone that really loves you will be happy to see you pursue your dream. And don't get into debt that you aren't sure you can pay back. I play whatever I have to to get the songs in my head recorded. I'm more of a recording artist than a performer, and have never managed to master any one instrument. - Instruments: I couldn't begin to recall, but mostly solo these days or with a contracted group - Years playing: voice and piano, formerly a jazz & classical double bassist Usually the leader in all of the above Yamaha P-85, or acoustic piano, mic set up. I think you get automatically rejected as a woman in music in some situations, but there are also clear advantages. When I work piano bars I feel I can cover all the music that the men do, as well as music by women that they wouldn't touch. There are a lot of songs that I've never heard men do e.g. \"Natural Woman\" - how many piano bar guys are going to do that? but I can pull it off! Not really. I think these days women are less afraid to appear \"tough\" in the music arena, but I think the fact is that underneath we always were. However, maybe things have changed a bit, because when I was playing bass in London many years ago, I used to post ads on the wall of the music shop in Picadilly for my services, signed \"Alex\" and guys used to call and ask for the bass player and when they heard a female voice would sound confused and hang up. I know some young people are \"gender-cliquey\" but hopefully that wouldn't happen so much now. I've been told so many times to stop apologizing for myself, and I would definitely take that stance with someone younger. In this business, a lot of \"civilians\", i.e. prospective clients, people who want to hire you for education purposes, etc. don't really know how to judge good music or musicians, so they take you on the terms that you set yourself. People who are hiring often don't know what they want, so you have to be very clear in explaining to them. If you're not what they want, also don't try to just fit into another mould - they'll ultimately be unhappy and so will you with the product. Define yourself and your music and be who you are. My parents were given a Steinway Grand when I was a child - Instruments: too many to count... right now, main projects are \"Pangaea\", \"ARG Sextet\", duo with pianist Anat Fort, \"Mycale\" - John Zorn Vocal Quartet, and \"Shiv'a\" project with Ethel String Quartet and percussionist Satoshi Takeishi... - Years playing: vocalist / composer \"I am the bandleader in most of my groups. in others (like Mycale) it's an equal collaboration. and in some, I'm a sideperson, though those are rare occasions. as a bandleader, I am also the producer, composer, conductor, fundraiser, booking agent... I usually (whenever possible) hire a PR person to work on press, and luckily, all of my albums were released on record labels who take care of a lot of the marketing, so i just need to \"\"fill in the gaps\"\"... \" my gear? or my band's? my gear is my voice, my microphone (just ordered my neuman 105...) plugged into the local PA system where I play that night... I think as I grow older and more confident as a person, those differences matter less... as a young musician, being a woman mattered a lot. the testosterone levels in the room would rise by having one woman and several guys together... that would often lead to sexist comments, and uncomfortable situations... as time passed - I learned to keep a certain distance, choose my musicians based on personality (at least as much as based on their musicality), and cut people out of my environment if they are unable to address me as an equal based on my gender. also - I often work with other women, which is very nice as well... it's hard for me to say. what i see is that there definitely seem to be more women musicians than there used to be, which is GREAT. seems to me, as the woman's \"roles\" in society keep evolving and changing, so does the dynamic in the music scene, which has always been predominantly male. \"many have given me good advice. and many have given me living examples... I think most importantly, for men and women - have conviction in your way. be truthful in your music... meaning - make choices that make sense for the music, without concern for how it will be received (you can figure out marketing LATER, and you should... but first, make good art...) constantly work on developing your craft. you're never done learning... keep an open eye for venues, series, musicians, groups that make sense for YOU, for what you do or aspire to do, and try to get involved with them. if you're genuine, persistent and good at what you do, you can have a life in music. it takes a lot, but worth every second...\" \"I played flute for many years, and when I started singing (at age 17) I loved the how immediate singing felt. straight from my head / soul to sound... nothing in between... I felt much more connected to the music through the voice than through an instrument, that suddenly felt limiting... another reason is, I love working with words. literature, poetry, ideas... have always been a big part of my life. as a vocalist, I am able to link those into my work easily... \" - Instruments: 2- \"Danika Holmes\" and \"The Remains\" - Years playing: piano, guitar, vocals \"I am proud to say I'm the weakest link musically in my band and I like it that way. I've surrounded myself with amazing musicians I can learn from and grow with. I write the music and melody lines, but in terms of the production, my producer has most of the ideas for the finished product. Business and marketing decisions are a completely different story. I am 100% involved in every decision that is made on behalf of my music career when it comes to performance sets, songs on the album, anything concerning money, etc. I have always wanted to own and operate my own business and now I am! In my \"\"life before music\"\" I was going to be a college professor. I was only a dissertation away from my PhD before I switched gears completely. \" I play a Taylor 614ce and LOVE it! In terms of amps and the rest, my band mates take care of that part thank goodness and I'm really thankful to them for that. When I perform live, I've had a lot of comments that \"it's nice to see a woman\" in a local setting. I've found that interesting. \"Consistency, consistency, consistency! Also, LISTEN!!! There are a hundred other musicians out there who are willing to help and want to see you succeed. In this era of music, I really believe there is a market for everyone who wants to pursue music as a career to be successful. Don't view other musicians as the competition but instead as colleagues to bounce ideas off of and to grow with and support! We can accomplish so much more if we work together. I really believe that. \" My parents put me in piano lessons at a young age. My second instrument, guitar, I picked up when I was 25 when I was going through a really rough personal time. I spent about 8 hours a day learning to play guitar as a way of clearing my mind. Worked better than 8 hours with a therapist a day! - Instruments: Just one. My current band - Years playing: voice, guitar, omnichord I am the CEO of my music business with my husband being a chair person. Everything goes through me in the end. I think it's strange for some people know that my husband is essentially an employee of mine. Luckily he's very supportive and is totally fine with it. It works the same way in the studio. In the end, I call all the shots. I like to listen to what everyone's ideas are, but since my name is going on the music, I need to be happy with it. Since signing to a major label I've had less to do with marketing decisions. My manager is in charge of making marketing strategies and sharing them with the label. My manager is a woman and so is my marketing point person at the label. My entire team of publicists are women and in fact most of the people I deal with are women. I usually travel pretty light when on tour. I play a Collings parlor guitar. I also use a sampler to supplement some of the beats in my songs. I play the Omnichord which is an instrument that is like an electronic auto harp from the 80s. It has it's own little set of beats and sound effects.My husband is my guitar player. He also uses pedals and other \"noise makers\" to supplement what is on my record The Cricket's Orchestra.Sometimes we travel with an upright bass player. He just brings his bass. I am still at the stage of my career where I need to be an opening act. It can be more challenging for a woman in terms of exposure. It's not hard for a male to get an opening slot for a male or female performer, but a female performer usually has to try to get an opening slot with a male performer. So there's more competition for female performers. I also hear this comment a lot; \"I don't usually like female singers but you're great... \" and so on and so forth. It's so frustrating to know that a lot of people (generally male) won't listen to certain music just because it's performed by a female. I also noticed that when both my husband and I enter a venue to play a show, he is approached first. It seems to be assumed that he's the point person. I'm not usually offended by this, but I do find it interesting. Even though \"Meaghan Smith\" is on the bill.My manager is also ALWAYS referred to as \"he\", if it's not know that she is a woman. Again, it's assumed my manager would be male. I recently did a broadcast that involved me and four other artists being showcased with an orchestra. The other artists were male and after the first dress rehearsal, I was told to \"sex up\" my number because that was what people would be expecting from \"the girl on the show\". I rarely run into such ignorance, but it's shocking to know that it still exists in some places. \"As a musician of this generation, I am so thankful that a lot of the pathway has already been cleared. This is not to say that we are in any way close to being on equal footing with our male counterparts, but at least some headway has been made. Lilith fair did a lot to help out with this by proving that a bunch of women on the same bill is actually a great thing. I am thrilled to be a part of Lilith this coming year.This topic is important to me and if you would like to make use of me or my experiences in any way, please feel free to do so.My email is meaghan@meaghansmith.com \" Sarah Mclachaln is someone I am inspired by. I grew up listening to her and am eagerly anticipating this summer's Lilith Fair as I'll be one of the performers in the line up. She is obviously a very smart business woman who is creative and original. I aspire to her level in every way. She has given me amazing advice and I would pass it on to other musicians. And that is to be yourself. Be smart. Don't dull down the brightness of your light and work hard. I hope at some point we don't really care about the fact that a musician is male or female. If you make good music, that's all that counts. My dad bought me a guitar when I was in the 8th grade. I had expressed an interest in learning after falling head over heels in love with the music of Sarah Mclachlan.So I learned to play and have been doing so ever since. I didn't become a musician till very recently. I used to be an animator, so I took my time getting to this point. I am now managed by Sarah's manager and consider her to be a good friend. - Instruments: 10-Longshot, Citizenz Band, Minor Miracle, Swingstreet, Stepsisters, Angel & the ReRuns, Divine Horsemen, 2 Leonard Cohen Touring Bands, Julie Christensen and Stone Cupid - Years playing: vocals, guitar I'm the lead singer, songwriter, writer of charts, arranger, producer, bringer of snacks, producer, booking person, webmistress, promoter, and now guitar player. (Though I usually employ at least one other person on live gigs to make me sound like I know what I'm doing.) \"I have a Larrivee Parlor guitar (from around 2000- made in Vancouver) with an iMix pickup, and a Dean Markley practice amp. My voice is a mezzo-soprano, and I had a successful vocal surgery last July (for a polyp caused by an acid problem). It's a joy to sing once more.\" Yes, unfortunately I do. For better and worse. I remember a moment after I'd been dropped from one major label when my manager said, \"Well, they all went home from the weekly meeting at Warner with your demo, but came back and decided that they already had Julee Cruise and Jane Siberry, and didn't need another female artist like that now.\" (Among all the other men they have on board!) Also, I had a manager say that my being a woman was detrimental (in the year of Lilith Fair), and that because I wasn't 16 and black, the industry wasn't tooled up for me. Of course, I terminated that relationship. I see that the younger ones now seem to have a lot of confidence and seem like they have an equitable relationship with their male counterparts. And the ones before me had it even harder than I did. But it probably still takes an iron will to get launched. \"When I was doing jazz at an after-hours club in Austin at around 20, I'd just come off stage from singing \"\"How High the Moon\"\" in the style of Ella Fitzgerald. A man stopped me and asked me to sit down. He said, \"\"you know, you pulled that off just fine, but when you drop the needle on a Linda Ronstadt record, you know within seconds it's her. Use your OWN voice, your OWN soul.\"\" The man was the famous jazz guitarist Barney Kessel, who once had to wear blackface and hands to be in a film with black musicians and singers, during segregation. I would pass on to younger singers that the pyrotechnics that can make you a finalist on American Idol pale in comparison to standing in the middle of the truth of the song. And always be kind to the crews who work so hard in every aspect of this business. They're the ones who can make you sound and look beautiful; no matter how salty they may be. And keep yourself healthy. Drugs and alcohol age you and your voice faster than the road itself will, and that alone will add years if you aren't vigilant with your health.\" I don't remember not singing. And I'm trying to be more self-contained and less reliant on having to pay a whole band in these more difficult times, though I love so much to work with other musicians. That's why I picked up the guitar again after having been frustrated with it in my youth. - Instruments: 1-Delia y los aminoacidos 2-aterciopelados - Years playing: vocals and guitar Singer-composer. For the first time in 20 years, I am learning Pro Tools and currently I am making a solo album, produced and played by myself. I do a bit of everything! Acoustic guitar and a microphone It is too deep, too subtle, too complicated, to answer in a paragraph. When I became a mother, the differences became pretty evident. I don't know that many female musicians personally.... Nobody ever gave me advice, and the advice I would give is don't ask for advice, look for yourself, all the answers are INSIDE, not outside. I took lessons when I was a child, my mother plays it too - Instruments: Mine, Cariad Harmon - Years playing: Vox/Guitar \"I'm the singer/songwriter, booking agent, marketing director, band leader, manager, tour coordinator, I do it all! I did work very closely with two producers in the studio on my recent record and we developed a great working relationship. Having three opinions to work with was fantastic as when we had a question about a decision, generally speaking two people would agree and convince the third that they were on the right track. It was a very smooth and collaborative process and a great way to work. I work very closely with one of the producers still, we co-write a lot of music together and he's been instrumental in helping me to create and define a live sound that compliments the record. I do find the business side of the industry exhausting and am still learning how to be an artist and a business woman without one of the elements suffering. It's a tough industry with so much competition and you have to develop a very thick skin in order to make it work, you have to send out 100 emails for every 5 you receive back, you can never allow yourself to be discouraged by anyone's lack of enthusiasm about what you do, you have to sell yourself, convince people that your music is better than the next record they'll hear and stay on top of all of the social media that we use now. Twitter, Facebook, Myspace are all incredible tools for an independent musician but it's very easy to feel overwhelmed by everything an indie artist is expected to do and I find all of that external noise very counter productive to creativity and self expression. The music itself is only a part of the process with more and more pressure put on artists to prove themselves. Unless you get very lucky, a manager, booker or label will not consider you unless you have a viable fan base and solid marketing opportunities already in place. It can be very hard to keep the motivation and faith while working full time, paying bills and taking care of the creative side of things. You certainly have to love what you do because it's a hard road to travel and I think most of us would much rather be in the studio, or at home writing a song than glued to a blackberry answering emails and updating a twitter feed. \" I own the basic equipment for live performance, I have a tanglewood acoustic/electric guitar with a built in pre-amp, I also have a fishman Aura pedal that is a great second external pre-amp and gets rid of a lot of the twangy sound that you hear with acoustic guitars that plug in direct. I have a tuning pedal as I use a couple of different tunings on stage, I have a sure SM58 microphone, a mike stand, cables etc. I have a piano at home that I use for writing and I work on garage band a lot when I'm writing new songs, to hear how they sound, send them to collaborators etc. I also have a small Marshal amp and an old univox hollow body electric guitar that I've been experimenting with and play on one of the tunes on my recent album. \"I do think there are a lot of differences but I certainly don't think they are all negative and I think you can use your femininity as a definite advantage if you work hard. I think that while it's easier for a man to be taken seriously as an instrumentalist and musician simply because there are more men involved in the industry, if you work hard as a woman and stand out as a musician you are seen as something of a novelty and people respond very positively to working with a woman who can prove that she knows her stuff and is serious about her music. \"\"Chick singers\"\" often get a bad name and it's assumed that we don't really know what we're talking about or understand how the band works as a whole and that we just want to stand at the front and look pretty. I think it's easy for a lot of women to feel intimidated and to fall back on their femininity as a crutch in a nerve wracking situation. There will always be a guy around who knows how to make that amp work, or how to stop the feedback, or who understands how to get a point across to the band but in the end that attitude doesn't get you very far. I empathise a lot with women I see looking lost on stage and not quite aware or confident about what's going on around them. I think a lot of it has to do with learning to be passive and agreeable, pleasing people and being afraid to take risks. Of course men struggle with risk taking too, but I do think we are still conditioned in a way that makes it hard for a younger woman to know exactly what she's talking about, outplay or out perform a man and feel attractive at the same time. I think on the other side of things, fear of looking ditsy and foolish stops a lot of women from asking questions. I had to really learn to take the time to understand what was going on, to politely tell the men around me what I needed and as soon as I expressed an interest and showed some intelligence I got a great response. Of course I have heard male musicians make terrible comments about very accomplished women who are excelling on their instrument, questioning an individuals success and intimating that it had more to do with her sexual prowess or the way she happens to look than with genuine talent and hard work but I think in the end your work speaks for itself and your drive wins through. People will always find a way to knock you, if they assume I got a gig because I look good I try to laugh it off and take it as a compliment. At the end of the day, getting the gig and performing as well as I can is all I really care about.\" \"I think that it has been acceptable for some time for a woman to be a killer vocalist, from Bessie Smith to Aretha, Ella Fitzgerald, Anita O'day, all these women were taken very seriously and deserved every bit of recognition they got. Nina Simone was somewhat of a different kettle of fish as she was a controversial lyricist with songs like \"\"Strange Fruit\"\" (I'm not aware of any female lyricists and songwriters back then) and she was also a fantastic piano player but she is still far more widely recognized as a vocalist than she every was as a pianist or a songwriter. I do think that has changed dramatically, with artists like Joni who came along just a few years later and was revered for her songwriting above all else, and women like Feist, and Adelle who are now being celebrated for their musicianship and instrumental ability as well as their vocal style. Interestingly I think that country music has been very open to the idea of women being versatile musicians with artists like Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline and Dolly Parton who were songwriters in their own right from the beginning, I wonder if that has to do with music being more of a family tradition in the South and an audience down there being more accustomed to the idea of seeing women who can really play. Then there's Madonna who was really our first female iconic pop star with the same level of superstardom as the Elvis' and Beatles of the world. Now we have Lady Gaga and Britanny and I think it's a great shame that people still associate strong successful women with bitchy and hard nosed characteristics. The softer women at the top seem to be eaten alive by the industry like Brittany Spears was, but I think that is changing like everything else. Gwen Stefani seems to have a good balance between the two extremes that the tabloids sell us. I also saw more and more female recording engineers creeping into the industry when I was managing a recording studio although I think that is still a very tough road. I immediately saw many clients become uncomfortable around the idea of trusting a young woman their session and I had to fight harder to sell their time. It was definitely much harder for women to get over the initial hurdle of meeting the client before proving themselves with the level of their skill. However with anything, I think your talent and hard work shines through. People care about the quality of your work and if you consistently put out a good performance or product people will want to know who you are regardless of your gender, sex or sexual preference. That is one of the reasons music is such an amazing medium, it has the power to transcend everything and to change peoples lives. \" \"I have had a lot of advice along the way, some useful and some not so useful. I think believing in yourself is the most important thing regardless of your gender. It is such a hard and competitive industry, I think it's very important to take care of yourself, to remember that you love what you do and to work hard at maintaining a high level of self belief. I think that the best advice I ever had was to make friends and collaborate with people. Every artist needs a network of sympathetic musicians and friends in the industry who believe in and support what they do. Reach out to artists you admire, go see a lot of shows and introduce yourself to the people who's work you love. In times when you want to pack it all in and go be an accountant, it's these people who will feed your soul and persuade you that what you do is important and meaningful enough to continue doing. They are also the people that will stay with you throughout your career and help you as you climb the ladder. With any luck, you'll also be in a position to help them one day and the wheel spins on.\" I chose it more or less accidentally when I was about 16 because it was easy to carry around and I could sing at the same time as play. It was easy to put a song together with a little bit of knowledge and there were guitars in my house when I was growing up (the guitar I still use is one I stole from my brother as a matter of fact). The artists that I gravitated at first were also guitarists, Dylan, Mitchell, Van Morrison. Later, when I got into listening to vocalists like Nina Simone who also played piano my instrument choice was made. I dabble in other instruments but the guitar definitely came first. - Instruments: The Warblers, The Blue Hit - Years playing: vocals. guitar, piano I am the lead singer and I write most of the songs. Usually I will play the finished song for my boys and lead them through the arranging process. Some of the songs were instrumentals that they wrote together and I wrote lyrics and melodies over them. I also make all the merchandise - I design and screenprint the t-shirts myself and I design and print the postcards, stickers, and other handouts we have. I sing with a Shure Beta 58 mic. I take it to every gig so I do not get sick from using random microphones. I play a Martin 000-C electric-acoustic guitar, and I have a Yamaha P-80 keyboard. It is definitely different for women in music because it is mostly males with whom we work. There is a sort of camaraderie of competence in the field, and in my experience I have noticed that a lot of the music guys we deal with will immediately talk to my male bandmates first about stage setup, pay or other details. I am respected in my field only if I prove myself by performing well or speaking with confidence about a subject. We also perform in bars a lot, which is a place where men and women go to meet other singles and find mates. Being a good-looking female who puts herself out there, I get hit on a lot - even sexually harassed - while I am working. Many men are either intimidated unnecessarily by me or they don't take me seriously at all. The one moment that sticks out to me is when we played a small town in Louisiana. The sound man, the bar manager, and the booking agent (all male) literally ignored me when we first came in, they only talked to my bandmates. Once we finished playing our set, all three of these men were falling over themselves to talk to me with this newfound admiration that hadn't existed before. They set us up with a place to stay (with hopes of getting closer to me) and begged us to come back anytime. Funny how that works. The older women who have been my mentors tell me that I am doing a very brave thing. They warn that it is hard to earn your place in this industry, especially if you are doing it for the love of the art, but once you make your name known the way can be paved for you. The younger ladies I have met are often either very shy or over-confident. It seems like they have had to jump some significant gender hurdles already in their career, and everyone handles that differently. The younger girls are also much more concerned about their looks than their stage presence or musical content. Anais Mitchell told me to never be afraid of making music that doesn't \"fit\" anywhere. If my heart is compelled to compose it, the piece has an innate right to life and I should nourish it all the way. She also encouraged me to hold onto my publishing rights because so few people still do. I would tell a new musician the same thing, and I would add that a little confidence goes a long way. But the most important advice I can give is that (if you are a singer) your lyrics are prayers that you say over and over. If you only write about one subject, like bitter love or endless war, you are bound to relive that feeling over and over in your heart. Too long repeating negative prayers or mantras like that will weigh heavily on you eventually - you are better off taking that negativity and turning into a song about what you learned from it, rather than just griping aimlessly. I have always sung, but I have not always been \"a singer,\" if that makes sense. Growing up I was pretty insecure about it - about everything really. I knew I had an extraordinary gift, but I could never visualize myself singing for people. I guess you could say I was afraid of doing well, thus drawing attention to myself. After twenty or so years of closely studying music, I came out of my shell and took command of my voice. I started writing and singing because it was so therapeutic for me - something I had to do to maintain my physical and mental health. - Instruments: I had/have ensembles at Los Angeles Valley College and Lafayette College. I am also hired as a conductor for independent groups. - Years playing: conductor of choral and instrumental ensembles, sing, piano As an ensemble director in a college situation, all teaching, organizational, administrative, publicity, budgetary, personnel, music decisions/duties related to my ensembles are made by me. That is the nature of our job. My baton, my hands, colored pencils, scores, enthusiastic ensembles, scholarship on composers and performance practice, and a continued desire to learn. \"Women conductors at the college and professional level are still rare. Doing research for my book, I have learned that many strides have been made in classical music for women composers with regard to education however that does not often translate into the number of commissions, publications, performances, and therefore opportunity for critical reception. Just study the publishing houses and concert seasons and textbooks. Women's presence in alternative compositional fields such as jazz, musical theatre, film/tv music, video games, etc is even less. I find this quite interesting as a scholar, teacher, and conductor...and as a woman. Example: In college (UCLA), we spent 2 years discussing men in music theory/harmony courses. At the end of the 2 years, I asked to do a presentation on women to last 20 minutes. After 15 minutes of the presentation, my teacher asked me to hurry up and finish. He was a good and mostly enlightened teacher who taught me a great deal, and yet he didn't get it. He was following the textbook with MAYBE one woman in it. After my 20 minute presentation (I used every minute of it), every woman in the class came up to me individually and said thank you. That was the moment that I realized I would continue not only in music performance, but also in scholarship and advocacy for women composers.\" Classical music: In the past 125 years, many strides have been taken by women beginning with access to music education. Since WWII, the changes for women in music continue to be tremendous and encouraging! And yet, there are still many \"firsts\" that keep surprising me when I interview composers - first woman to receive a doctorate at this school, first woman conductor of this ensemble, first woman commissioned for that ensemble, only the third woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in music (2010), etc. I teach a Women in Music course at Lafayette, and I continually learn from the in-class discussions with students about where they are, what they like, and their awareness of gender issues. Advice - do it. And be aware. Study and be great. Focusing on the music is the first priority, but don't deny your gender because you are afraid you will always be sub-categorized. It isn't equal yet. It isn't equal yet. Act equal, choose textbooks and readings wisely, program music with an open mind, enjoy your music and your womanhood, keep learning, keep listening. Be responsibly critical of all music. You vote with your dollars - know what you support. If you love music enough to make it a career, study intelligently, and be really really good. I grew up with a music program in place in my school system - but that's another topic! Because of this, I sang, played recorder, then trumpet and piano and guitar. I continued music in college and soon learned that I did not want to make a career of singing, (but I still perform and take the occasional classical or cabaret gig). I quickly learned that conducting combined my talents and my desires. I am an advocate for new music, women composers, and live music. I believe that storytelling through passion is even more important than the \"perfect\" sound. If \"perfect\" sound is desired in classical music, then there are a host of digitally mastered recordings out there from which to choose. Although I believe in recorded music, and have been a part of recordings, the nature of my job puts me in the business of live music. I have the opportunity and responsibility to make an impact on an ensemble and an audience, to teach, to create art, to help someone feel something, if only for the length of a single piece. These are my talents, my desires, and why I chose conducting/ensemble as my instrument. - Instruments: I would say a couple dozen. - Years playing: Vocals On the bandstand, if I book the gig I lead it. I also work as a freelance vocalist, anything from duo to big bands. In the studio, I sometimes lead my own projects, but the ideal is to have a producer who can take me and my sound and point us in the best direction for the music. It's sometimes overwhelming to try and figure out what works and what doesn't, looking from the inside, out. Having a producer with good ears and a vision makes all the difference. As far as business and marketing is concerned, since I manage my own business and marketing, I make all the decisions. It oftentimes is just a matter of what one can afford. I have two p.a. systems: the small one is a Gallien-Krueger Vocal Monitor that I use as a speaker and also as an amp to drive a small external speaker. The large one is a Mackie 808 Stereo 8-channel head, with two Bose 402 speakers. I currently use an EV microphone. I prefer a Shure BG-58 Condenser mic, but alas mine was lost on a Delta airlines flight, along with all my luggage! I think it's different for women singers and women musicians. It seems to me that the role of female singer was always more or less accepted as the appropriate place for a female in music. I think in the past the female musician had tougher hurdles to cross, but that has changed over the past generation or so, and it's less of a concern these days. This is attributable to the determination of women musicians and the respect they have earned from the men musicians, the audience and the music industry. The reality on the ground is, when you're good, you're good and musicians just appreciate that. They want the best for the music - never mind what gender you are. No, apart from social and racial discrimination that weighed heavily on earlier generations I don't really see a difference in the generations of women musicians themselves. Lil Hardin (Louis Armstrong's wife) just did her thing. Mary Lou Williams was a pioneer in jazz; she answered the call to music and left a legacy behind. The same can be said for artists like Nina Simone and Shirley Horn. Today you have bands like the Maria Schneider Orchestra, Diva (led by Shari Maricle) and new artists like Anat Cohen who are here to stay. There are so many more amazing women artists: Carla Bley, Tokiko Akiyoshi, Anita Brown, the list goes on and on. I think there is more a common thread between these generations, than differences. A valuable piece of advice I received early on was to never turn down an opportunity, even if you think it doesn't fit into your \"career plan,\" because you never know where it might lead you. This has proven to be invaluable to me. I think it's important to own your own material. And lastly, ignore the critics, respect the musicians. I grew up in a family where music and singing was a part of everyday life, and certainly all family gatherings. I received a scholarship at age nine to study violin. I did that for several years, along with some piano and guitar. In high school I had an accident that injured my left hand and prevented me from playing violin. I still managed to play mandolin and guitar and would accompany myself. On one occasion I was playing and singing and my friend said, \"You know, you should get out from behind that instrument and just sing.\" So that's what I did. I was lead singer in a nine-piece band, and also the school jazz band. I found I could improvise better through singing than with an instrument. So that's where I went with it. I feel most comfortable out in front of a band in live performance. I'm a live performer, not so much a \"recording artist.\" That's an art in and of itself. - Instruments: One - Years playing: Vocals (MC) My role in my band is the lead vocalist. Whichever role is necessary for me in the studio as a solo artist, collaborating artist, etc. I perform that role. This is best decided depending on the music and artists involved. I am like the director in business and marketing. While my management handles the business and marketing of my music/work, all decisions, e.g. finals decisions, are made through a collective choice between me and my management whenever decision directions are made. I must have it this way, otherwise I am no longer the master of my destiny. I use a microphone to rhyme and sing lyrics, therefore I am a lyricist. Fortunately, I have achieved the status of \"Queen of Hip Hop\" having worked with legendary artists including The Roots, Sweetback (Sade's band), the British band Morcheeba, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and many commercial / main stream artists. I am the female protegee of Gangstarr's Guru and have had a successful career as a female rapper in a male dominated genre of music in the industry. Yes, being a woman musician, especially in the hip hop world of music, is definitely different from being a man. If you just take an obvious look at all of the male hip hop artists with commercial appeal and see that there is no equivalent to the number of women hip hop artists, you have the answer to your question there. There is low or no expectation for women to succeed in this genre of music outside of the hip hop sound being pop. Fortunately, I have been and continue to be blessed to have a strong voice in this genre of music and can rap/connect with the best - from Jay-Z to Kanye West and beyond. The moment that made a clear difference to me between men and women in the hip hop artists world is watching male hip hop artists that I nurtured before they became mainstream, surpass me in the commercial world and foregoing the reciprocation of this nurturing once cmmercial success was at hand for them. This does not imply that I am owed anything, simply that to do seemed the logical, natural progression considering the love that was shown. The major difference between women from the late 80's until now, with the exception of maybe Sade, is a nurturing quality to their music. Women used to be more inspiring and loving rather than competitive and materialistic with their lyrics. Older generations, especially in soul, jazz, and R&B used to be family oriented, revolutionary, filled with pride, and loving. I think this has changed a GREAT deal. The most valuable advice I have been given in this industry is to stay true to myself and honor my gut feelings about decisions. Although this advice was not followed early on, experience becomes your best teacher. Staying tight with your family, especially the mother, keeps you grounded despite what \"industry\" or people come your way. Decisions become clearer when you know yourself before going into the music business. Otherwise, it's an expensive and heartbreaking place to learn who you are. This is also the advice I would give any woman musician starting out in music, especially hip hop. Stay true to YOU even if that seems unpopular, unacceptable, invalid, or wrong. You are going to win and succeed in the end with perserverance, prayer, and talent. My music as my life is a product of my environment. I also describe it as semi-intellectual, tapping into subjects of life, the psyche, and a representation of the ethnicity, culture and people of which I come and who I am. - Instruments: one, Regina - Years playing: vocals I'm an equal member of the group together with other two male band members. When it comes to business or marketing, I take full responsibility about decisions together with another band member (who also happens to be my husband). When performing, I am the lead figure of the group (even if it is not something that I have chosen myself). I don't see a very clear difference here. For me, it has been mostly easy and a natural thing to be a female performing artist. It is easier for women of our generation than it used to be during the previous decades. Even in the 80\u00b4s women musicians were still partly working as pioneers, and it wasn't until the 90\u00b4s that women no longer had to constantly prove their talent among male musicians and the music industry. No. I would say that don't get stuck with the idea that being a woman would restrict your work as a musician in any way. I write the lyrics and it was a natural thing to become the vocalist of the group as well. - Instruments: 5. Bearfoot, Syran, The Woolwines, Years playing: fiddle/violin and vocals I sing and play the violin the best I can. In the studio I try to sing and play the best I can. In business or marketing decisions I say yes as much as I can. I have a beautiful fiddle from the late 1700's. I think it is gorgeous. For amplification I use a realist pick-up. I use an LR bags DI along with the Pre-Sonas tube pre-amp and when I play with drums I will add a volume pedal...:) I was breast feeding my newborn son while doing a scratch vocal take in the studio. Women are the same, we are just treated differently in this generation. \"someone told me to \"\"make sure your home on kid's birthday.\"\" I would tell a woman just starting out just to really listen to herself. \" My parents chose it for me. Mom was a violin teacher and Dad was a cellist. - Instruments: many: Madison Symphony Orchestra; Illinois Symphony Orchestra; International Chamber Artists (Chicago); Wisconsin Philharmonic; Southwest Michigan Symphony Orchestra; Civic Orchestra of Chicago - Years playing: Flute and Piccolo \"In my chamber group, I handle a large part of the rehearsal scheduling burden. We are all freelance musicians with day jobs, whether it is teaching private lessons, rehearsing with the Chicago Symphony, or a more traditional \"\"day job\"\" like my own. Also, we come together in Chicago from all over the world. It can be tricky. As for my orchestra work, I learn my parts, attend rehearsals and work to become a part of the ensemble. I don't handle any business aspects.\" \"2 flutes: Altus flute (14K gold Ultimo (grenadilla wood)\" \"I do. Flutists in most school programs are female, but many of the more famous flutists out in the professional world are male. However, I have seen this tide turn even in my short career - more women are winning positions in orchestras, for example - but there is still a lot of work to be done to encourage women to pursue careers in classical music. For that matter, there is a lot of work to be done to encourage young people in general to study classical music in the first place! Where I have seen trouble: many of my friends and colleagues are now in the part of their lives where they are having families. My closest friend has a daughter who is just six months old; the child-care issues surrounding her freelance work (rehearsals for her chamber ensemble are unpaid) and how it conflicts with her husband's more standard work hours are so, so difficult. They're essentially \"\"swing-shift parenting\"\", like many. It has affected what sorts of gigs she takes and has been an additional burden on her marriage. They're making it work, but I ache for her when she has turned things down. My male musical colleagues with young children, unless their spouse is also a musician, don't seem to feel this quite so much.\" Yes. I am well aware that I am standing on the shoulders of giants. I grew up in the post-Title IX era, and there is much that I can take for granted that my mother's generation and my grandmother's generation could not. They endured relentless sexism from the podium, from colleagues within the orchestra, and from audiences and patrons as well. I have benefited from the strides made to make audition processes fair and arbitrary (screens between the committee and the applicant, for example). This can be a more global generalization about the difference between my generation and my mother's generation, however, so your mileage may vary. \"Yes! Jeanne Baxtresser, my teacher for my graduate study, told me that I must always think of the music first, to be in service to it and to trust in it, to remove my ego and my self from the process. Ms. Baxtresser would know; she is one of the pioneers in my field, having spent 35 years as principal flutist in the main symphony orchestras of Montreal, Toronto, and finally New York. She has given me much more advice than that over the years. I also received valuable advice from my undergraduate teacher, Ernestine Whitman (professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, WI). \"\"If you quit, you'll never win.\"\" I took more than two dozen orchestral auditions before winning my first position. This is not unusual; statistically speaking, finding orchestral work in the US is like trying to be a linebacker in the NFL, and it's only getting harder. If I had given up after audition five or six, I wouldn't have the career I have today. I also love that I have a hybrid career. I grew up in a library, thanks to my mom's work as a librarian and library director, and I am happiest and most balanced when I have all of my work together: teacher (I teach online for the City Colleges of Chicago and give masterclasses), librarian, performer. I wouldn't trade my life for anything. As for young women in music just starting: Take charge of your decisions and own them. Say \"\"no\"\" to things you really can't do, but still say \"\"yes\"\" far more often than you say \"\"no\"\". Make good friends with people who play your instrument; while you may see them in the green room at an audition as your competition, if you are a good colleague and a trustworthy friend, s/he will remember that and give you opportunities later when s/he can. Also, no one is going to understand you better than someone else who struggles with the same things as you do (this is another gem from Ms. Baxtresser). My closest colleagues in music have come through for me personally as well, and I can't discount the working relationships that have enriched my life deeply, particularly from my years in the training ground of the Civic Orchestra of Chicago. Finally, if this is going to be your life's work, be kind to everyone you meet. You will see these people and work with them for the rest of your life, even after your so-called \"\"retirement\"\". Memories are long, and you want to be your best self, always in service to your music and your art. \" \"On my tenth birthday, we had trials for instruments for band. I wanted to play the oboe, but the double reed was difficult to vibrate. Flute was next on my list. It became my voice in many, many ways. But why I became a professional is more complicated than that. When I was almost 15 and a sophomore in high school, I moved away from home to attend a public, state-wide math and science high school. I didn't take private flute lessons for much of my sophomore year because I couldn't afford them, but I saved my money from part-time summer jobs to pay for lessons for as long as I could during my junior year. That fall, for my 16th birthday, a number of my close friends in school pooled their resources to pay for flute lessons for me for the balance of my junior year. There was enough money left over to purchase some music for me that I needed, too. I wept then, and every time I tell this story, I cry again. That gift of support and love that I received to me at such a tender age from such young and mature people led me to the work I do now. I will never, ever forget it. Though it was a gift, I feel like I became responsible--in the best way possible--to others for my opportunity to play. To that end, I have pursued music ventures that aim in particular to give back to those who cannot always afford a concert experience.\" - Instruments: 10 - John Stafford Big Band, Herman Jones and the Exciters, Cattanooshoes, Blue Duo, Blues Connection, Mojomatics, - Years playing: Vocals/Percussion THE BAND: Artist & Band Leader. IN THE STUDIO: Artist, Arranger & Co-Producer BUSINESS & MARKETING: I make the decisions for my business and marketing either on my own or with the Team of folks I have hired to work with me. In my case I have two excellent First Teams (my Band and Alligator Records). I also have a small number of folks I have contracted with to do specific jobs ie: Social Media Marketing, etc. I usually get a good chuckle to myself when someone asks me \"\"Are you with the band? What are you.. the singer?\"\" I just smile and say \"\"Yes!\"\"\" Sure SM 58 Beta Microphone. Sure PSM Wireless In Ear Monitor System. \"Yes, absolutely different. I believe women have our own set of challenges that comes with being in the music business and on a bandstand or in a studio. I believe men have their own set of concerns but I cant really speak to that. However, I have ever felt the male/female difference but did not clearly understand any of it until around 1983 I had been working with a group of players for several months. I was doing a LOT of the booking. There was a conflict between myself and one other player in the band about a particular date booked. They were going to back up a famous artist without me. I did not mind that \"\"the guys\"\" wanted to do that, it was simply the way this other band mate went about making that happen. Pretty underhanded in my view. I realized right then and there if I didnt start taking the bull by the horn and acting much more like the Alpha, that I was gonna continue to be run over by this guy and a bunch more just like him. So I booked a huge pile of shows (translation: I got the work!) to be billed with MY name out front and let everyone know right then if they wanted to continue to work with me, it would continue to be as Janiva Magness and...... Everyone was really cool with it, except the one guy who had been behaving poorly. He quieted down when he understood that I could work fine without him. In the end, he took the work. But I have to say I really had to do some soul searching before I was willing to step out and wrestle this guy (and anyone who stood behind him) for control. My nature was to be a lot \"\"nicer\"\" about business than pro-active or aggressive. That was a very valuable lesson for me. Turns out - wrestling him down was the best thing I could have done, for me, for the band and for MY career. I did not want to have to behave so Alpha like, but it paid off in spades, especially in the long run. Turns out, I am a really good at arm wrestling...today I choose my battles as wisely as possible, I now realize that NO ONE has power over me unless I give it up to them. I dont have many conflicts with people any more, if they cant or dont give me what I need, I just move on. I still try to be fair and kind, but its best for all involved to not waste time. Shocking, but true. A whole lot less blood gets spilled... What a relief that is!\" \"Yes. I see a lot more women on Guitars, Bass & Drums than I ever have before... Keyboards and Wind instruments too. It used to be VERY rare to see a woman on the bandstand other than traditionally speaking, IF a woman is on the bandstand - she's singing. That's great, but there is also the \"\"No Chicks\"\" rule that is of course totally insane, but it still does exists amongst male musicians. Not as severe as it used to be... but I still see it here and there. I'm just relieved women are continuing to break those small minded high school rules. I hear a lot less of \"\"yeah, she's good ... for a girl\"\" and a lot more \"\"yeah... she's good or great!\"\" and that's excellent. There is definitly evolution in process.... in my view, that's a beautiful thing for all of us!\" \"Yes. Bob Tate who was the Musical Director for Sam Cook for many,many years. I had the honor to work with Bob for a few Years in Phoenix, AZ. What a beautiful soul he was. He taught me much (and still does) about practicing and getting better command of my instrument. He used to tell me it was the ONLY way to get respect from other players. He talked a lot about Sarah Vaughn and Aretha Franklin and how they could show up ANYBODY on their instruments and piano. Sarah was ruthless - so he said - about players that gave her crap and didnt play the right changes behind her. She would school them fast and hard - it wasnt pretty - and they would get in line or be fired. Simple. But she had full command of her instrument and knew music and could read like a M.F! So can Aretha he said. He would tell me again and again \"\"...and dont take no stuff from these men... cause they gonna dish it! But dont take it, no matter what they say. And for god sake dont sleep with them... cause they all gonna want to sleep with you - soon as they feel your power! Soon as you do - its over!\"\" Well I took his words in and boy was he right for the most part. Hahahaha God Bless Bob Tate! My first voice teacher, Gail Hensley Gunderson told me similar things, including that \"\"...when folks started to praise you, be very very careful to not buy their words hook line and sinker, cause people in the music business eat their young!\"\" Hahahaha boy was she right! Nancy Cox my second voice teacher taught me - practice, practice, practice! And I still do! MY ADVICE: Get control of your instrument. Practice, practice, practice. I still practice vocal exercises to this day - after 34 years. I do that because it works. I see so many players trying to make their way and havne't done enough homework to have a grip on whatever their instrument is, enough to command respect from their fellow players and artists. So players get frustrated cause they cant get any respect and get an attitude about that! Ha! Respect is earned, not a given. Remember half the gig is YOUR ATTITUDE! I work with people who give me what I need musically and otherwise, and if they dont or wont, I simply move on to find the right fit. Oh yeah, get real good at handling your own business. You are gonna need that skill! Also, try to be willing to have the \"\"student mind\"\" and be teachable, a very valuable thing I have learned. Learn what it is you want and then pursue that with a vengence. Be clear and whenever possible be kind. It is usually possible to be kind to people. Take the high road whenever possible when dealing with other humans. The music business is full of really bad musicians, taking money. Then there is this huge glut of mediocrity taking more money, above that are some tremendously talented and disciplined people, hopefully taking money. Strive for the 3rd category!\" It chose me, I did not choose it... ; ) and its the one thing that came the most naturally to me. Singing speaks to the place where there are no words, and I need that speaking. - Instruments: I'm a solo artist - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano artist, coproducer (in studio), and record company CEO. Gibson J-185EC acoustic guitar, Taylor 510 acoustic guitar, Gretsch electric guitar, Yamaha C7 grand piano, Neumann KM105 vocal mic (road), Neumann U87 vocal mic (studio), Roland VS2480 recording desk, various other stringed instruments (mandolin, vihuela, bouzouki, etc.) \"The recording/publishing business in Nashville is a boys' club, and it was especially so when I moved here in 1987. As a woman I had to be assertive in areas where a man in a similar situation wouldn't have. Sometimes in the studio I encountered people who were ready to discount my ability to understand technical things, or play well. I had to prove my guitar playing was \"\"good enough\"\" to record on master sessions. I tended not to work with those people a second time. As an artist, I felt the pressure of the sexualization of female recording artists. I think that may be the biggest difference, and the most troubling one.\" I think younger female musicians feel freer (and have more role models) to express themselves musically in a lot of areas. There seem to be more young woman instrumentalists, including drummers and lead guitar players, which was very rare when I was growing up. \"I was lucky to have great mentors along the way. The best advice came from my first publisher, who told me not to worry about conforming or trying to write songs that sounded like what was on the radio. For me that meant sticking to my guns and writing by myself, rather than co-writing (which is the norm here in Nashville). It set me on a path of independence, later as an artist, but first as a writer. I'd reiterate this same advice to a young woman musician, and if her ambition includes being a recording artist, I'd add that she ought to think long and hard about how she feels about her image, and the possible pressure she might feel from her record company or management to \"\"be sexy\"\". This doesn't concern me from a \"\"morality\"\" standpoint - it bothers me as a feminist, as it undermines the idea that women can be talented, brilliant and successful musicians/songwriters/singers without using their sexuality to get noticed.\" I was 8 years old and wanted to play Bob Dylan songs. - Instruments: In music: The Gypsy Nomads - Years playing: vocals, percussion and drums \"Singer/Percussionist/Lyricist/Co-producer The Gypsy Nomads is a duo. We handle all the business (although we have recently hired a PR firm to help us promote the new CD, \"\"Happy Madness,\"\" and our summer tour) In the past I did all the show bookings and promotion. Now the guitarist/partner, Scott Helland, does most of the booking but I still do the promotional side. \" \"Mic: Shure beta 58 Percussion: Sabian cymbals, various LP percussion (tambourines, maracas, shakers, castenets...), Djembe (I bought when I was in the Ivory Coast), string with bells, chestnut shaker, seed pod, zills, Drums: Pearl drums\" \"Yes and no. Yes, because the type of things that a woman will write about can not help but come from the perspective of being a woman, there is just no way for that not to be so. There are different standards on things like appearance (although that is more true of certain musical styles than others), vocals (men can belt songs out and be out of tune and it's ok, women can't get away with that as easily!) but I have to say that I don't feel that I have been affected by that. On the more practical side... sleeping in the van on tour can be more challenging for a woman at certain times... changing clothes in the parking lot, a little trickier! There is probably more differences for other women who have to balance a desire to have children. I knew from a very early age that I didn't want children so that has not been a concern for me. Where I think it is the same is the experience of wanting to create the best music you can, to perform in the best way and the desire to play and have people enjoy the time they have with you, to let go of any stress they may be having in their lives and lose themselves in the experience of sound. Our core fan base is rooted in the mystickal/metaphysical/alternative community. Although we appeal to a very wide range of folks, that is where we began and where we are centered. Although we don't overtly play \"\"spiritual\"\" music there is a strong spiritual/mystickal undercurrent in the music we do. I tell you this because we are blessed to have fans that are open minded and who embrace the feminine. I dare say that if you connect with the music we do chances are you are of that nature. The lyrics I write tend to express the nature of being a strong woman, of finding your true voice, of following your true path in life, having the courage to do so, of living in the moment. I struggled to allow myself to become the creative person that I always knew in my heart that I wanted to be. It was a long process. Although I started dance when I was four (studying ballet, modern, jazz, hip hop...) I still, after college, ended up going to Grad School and getting an MBA, something that was not right for me. (It was confusing for me that I was so good in Math and Science yet I wanted to be an artist) The process of owning my own creative power is directly related to my process of letting go of the \"\"climbing the corporate ladder\"\" way of thinking and allowing myself to fully engage in the life I was meant to live.\" I am no historian when it comes to women musicians, however, I do believe that it is much easier to be a woman musician today than it must have been years ago. My opinion is of course colored by my own experience as I described in the previous question. However, women can be strong, fierce, beautiful and powerful without the back lash of old conservative religious views that they are somehow deviant or damaged. I'm sure those beliefs still linger but the culture has changed. When I'm pounding on drums I can see that it has a strong affect on girls/women... they are inspired by it and they can feel it in a profound way. For a woman to express her fire through music can be exhilarating and inspiring. \"I see music as a creative endeavor. I danced, I studied sculpture, I paint. Music is part of all of this. The best advice I got was from my sculpture teacher in college. I asked him, \"\"how do you know if you're supposed to do this?\"\" he replied \"\"you do it only if you can not, not do it\"\"... it took me 8 years to understand that statement. What advice would I give to a woman starting out? Be true to yourself, do your creative work everyday, know that nothing happens overnight and if you just do it instead of thinking about doing it you will end up in the most amazing places that can surprise you, inspire you, and guide you along the path you were meant to be on.\" I have always sung. For me singing is a direct line to the soul. Singing was also an integral part of my upbringing. On my French side; my grandfather had wanted to be an opera singer but was not able to devote himself to that, he had a beautiful voice. (he was a \"chef de gare\" a train station master and later a small business accountant) Both my mother and uncle have really nice voices too (also French side). My uncle invariably sings at the end of meals..(the wine perhaps!) and my mother performed as an amateur singer for many years. Her favorite songs to sing were by Edith Piaf. My father (British) has played guitar and banjo from an early age and he loves to sing as well. As a family we used to sing in the car whenever we were on road trips. Percussion came naturally for me as an offshoot of dance. I have always had a yearning to play drums and have gravitated to that sound for as long as I can remember. - Instruments: my own band under my name, and also Peter and the Wolf - Years playing: vocals and guitar i write all the songs and direct the band. i make all of the business and marketing decisions as well. i play a nylon string guitar (ibanez). gina dvorak sings and plays a floor tom, which we run into a boss rc20 looping pedal. she also occasionally plays a banjo. lauren mcmurray sings and plays keyboard. sometimes we add other experimental instruments like coffee beans and crumpled paper. \"well, i've never been a man musician so i guess it's hard for me to say. i guess i don't really think that there's any overwhelming difference, enough to say that it's easier or more difficult for men or women, but there are surely some small and interesting differences. i think that it's hard to be taken seriously as a female musician (especially if you are solo, or if you only have females in your band like i do), but i'm sure that there are some men that would say that it's hard for them to be taken seriously as well. i've gone on many tours and walked into bars with my two female band-members and been treated like little annoying children. this tone always changes after we play, and people are much more responsive and respectful. i'm not sure if that's female-specific, though, it seems that it could be true for any unknown artist. i have sang back-up vocals for many different bands (almost always men), and it's always interesting to me how that role is spotlighted. i suppose i can't be sure, but i think it may have something to do with it being a female role. there have been multiple situations in which i have come in at the end of a project, right before the performance, when the rest of the band has been rehearsing for weeks. and though i have put the least amount of time into the project and my parts are only accents to the real back-bone of the song, i am given a microphone right next to the lead singer, and treated as a featured member of the band. this has always made me a little uncomfortable, as i feel that i haven't earned that role. and maybe the same would be true for a male back-up singer (maybe people just want to highlight vocals in general), but it seems at least to be much less common. i think female guitarists are treated much differently than men. people seem to always be surprised that i put as much emphasis into the guitars lines as i do, and that i fingerpick most of the time instead of strumming. i find myself falling into this trap, too, and expecting a female guitarist to lightly strum chords. probably the difference between male and female roles in the music industry is most visible in the business end of the industry. in my experience, it is still pretty rare to come across women producers, label owners, bookers, club owners, etc. i definitely know women who do all of these things, but this part of the industry still seems to employ a majority of men. \" \"my former dance teacher, whitley hill (a dancer and musician herself) told me when i was young that she thought that making art was just as important in the world as being a doctor. i have lived by that sentence since then. i think that an important piece of advice is to always keep your art safe. treat it like it's your baby. always sign contracts and define roles very clearly, in order to protect what you love. also, always keep in mind that no-one knows your art or your path like you do, and while people may have great ideas and suggestions that change it forever in positive ways, it is ultimately your decision. \" my dad brought home a little 3/4 size guitar he got for free at work, and i started playing that. i was obsessed with the beatles and wanted to learn all their songs, and guitar was the most readily available way to do that. - Instruments: Just one, my own (Vienna Teng) - Years playing: piano, vocals Since I'm the artist, most decisions come to me. I write all the songs, except for two that I've co-written. In the band, I'm responsible for hiring the musicians (and paying them, providing travel & lodging, etc) and giving them some musical direction, though it's a pretty collaborative process. Especially with my main collaborator, Alex, his ideas and opinions carry a lot of weight. In the studio, I bring the songs and some particular ideas for arrangements, but otherwise I often defer to the producer. I've been trying to learn more about production\u2014I co-produced my last album with Alex\u2014but it's definitely a student role, a hands-on learning process. I'm very active in business and marketing decisions too, because the reality of my life has a lot to do with how those decisions play out. Routing tours, release strategies, nurturing an online community: these things determine whether I'm home a lot or not at all, how much rent I can afford, how connected I feel to the people I play music for. I play grand pianos whenever the venues have them, which is fortunately often these days. Other than that, I carry an Electro-Harmonix 2880 looper, which I hook up to a vocal microphone so I can create loops with my voice, the piano, hand claps, etc and bring them in & out of the song at different times. Sometimes I also travel with a Nord Stage 88 keyboard, which has organ, Rhodes and Wurlitzer sounds (as well as acoustic piano sounds, for the times there isn't a piano at the venue). I feel really fortunate to be in a sector of the music industry\u2014singer-songwriters\u2014where it seems to be an even playing field, gender-wise. I think there are as many women as men with distinctive voices writing brilliant songs and being recognized for it, right now. I don't think that's true in other genres like rock, hip hop etc, and I think successful women are still rare in some roles, e.g. drummers, electric guitarists, producers who produce other artists. If there is a difference, it's the same conundrum working women face across the board: the biological clock. My career doesn't lend itself easily to having kids, or even being in a stable relationship that could lead to marriage and kids. There's both the cultural norm and the instinctive sense that a mother needs to be with her kids when they're young, much more than a father does. And that just isn't feasible for a touring musician. At a certain level of success and income, it can work\u2014bring the nanny on the tour bus, tour less frequently. But I struggle with how I could be a good mother while traveling half the year to play 200-seat clubs. I haven't met many older female musicians. Of the few I've spent time with, I haven't sensed any major differences between them and their male colleagues\u2014though I'm sure they must exist, just given the cultural shifts in gender equality that have taken place over the past few decades. I've always tried to make music as a human being first. I am a woman, an Asian-American, a heterosexual, college-educated, classically trained, raised upper-middle class, an ex-software engineer, and so on. These identities inform the music I make, but they don't define it. The victory of feminism (and other equality movements) is that someone like me can move in the world without qualifiers. It's something I'm incredibly grateful for. So if I were to give advice, it'd apply to men as well as women: Be good at what you do. Be fair to the people you work with. Know your own worth; don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Know others' worth too; learn from people you admire. Ask them to be your mentors. Know your priorities. Yes, a lot of a life in music is luck. Yes, you'll have to work hard, maybe for a long time. But remember the bigger picture: what do you want out of your life, your finite years? What's most important to you; why is it important to you? If creating music fulfills that completely for you, and it'd be worth it to you to labor in obscurity for years or ride the rollercoaster of big breaks and heartbreaks, go for it. If you can't imagine doing anything else, if it's the only thing that really makes you come alive, go for it. But if there are other things important to you, make room for them. Supposedly I climbed up on a neighbor's piano bench when I was 4 and started plinking out notes. I was also singing before I could talk. I had two wonderful piano teachers growing up, particularly one who taught me a bit of composition, transcription and jazz theory as well as classical repertoire. A combination of circumstance and the instruments choosing me, I guess. I haven't really fallen in love with playing anything other than piano, though I love the sound of a lot of other instruments\u2014strings, drums and electric guitar especially. I often wish I were a multi-instrumentalist. But I think there's a certain willingness to plow through the frustration of being an utter beginner, a certain innocence and stubbornness I had as a kid, that I don't have anymore. And the piano is an instrument of boundless depth\u2014I've played it most of my life and I've just discovered the tiniest corner of what it can do. - Instruments: 4 Kobofoofaroo, The Redding Street Band, The Hudsons, The Belleville Outfit and well as have played with TONS more than that 20 or 30. Had string quartet in High School called The Acoustic Dreams String Quartet - Years playing: fiddle, vocals, guitar, ukelele \"I call myself the \"\"T.C\"\" of the Belleville Outfit, meaning the Token Chick. Now, while I am saying that in jest because I know that the guys in my band respect me musically and as a human, there is a bit of truth to the statement. The truth is that I represent the femininity on stage-- I know it so I dress the part. I wear a dress and smile a lot. I do love performing and when I perform I try to leave my own personal baggage backstage and really put on a show. I sing and talk to the audience, I look at all the guys on stage and connect with them so that we can really be present in the moment. I feel as if I am nurturing the stage. But as far as more official easy-to-title roles? On stage: I write songs, I play fiddle, I sing Off stage: I think of myself as band HR (Human relations) Within the group, I do my best to keep communication constant and talk about band issues as they come up, or help to put out fires. I like the band the most when we are all truly happy. So I look at the guys as brothers, and I put effort into investing into their feelings--not always the easiest thing to do. But the way I see it, if we genuinely care for one another, the band will last a whole heck of a lot longer, and we will enjoy the process along the way. I am lucky to get to play with these guys, and want to appreciate it rather than resent it (which I have seen happen too). As far as in the studio and in marketing decisions go, I am lucky enough to be with a group of guys that really are hard workers. So they do a lot of work, but I dont hold back on my input. We work hand in hand, and I choose my battles. So if something is happening that I would like to happen in a different way, I say it, but if I am on the fence about something I may save that one. I want my voice to be strong so I try to save it for when it counts the most. That said, I am sure I talk to much anyway ;)\" I play fiddle or violin (whatever you want to call it) through a simple pre-amp called the Red Eye, its unique in that it was designed specifically for the violin by a man who really wanted to hear violins (Darren Appelt) that sound like violins on stage, cutting out most of the high impedance frequencies. Plus it has a boost button, so I can have a solo boost and it is really small so it is super easy to travel with. For guitar he has made a double instrument version of the Red Eye. If and when I start using an electric guitar on stage, I am gonna want an amp probably a fender delux. I used to have a polytone that I used on my fiddle just like Johnny Gimble, but sold it when I got the Red Eye. Whew! \"There is definitely a difference. I dont know if i can vocalize it but I'll try. Objectively, there are way more men musicians then women. I have been in 5 bands and all of them have been all guys and me. So even within my limited bubble of personal experiences, that is one girl and 20-25 guys, the obvious minority. And because of this it makes me the 'different' one. My personality has been affected by being the only chick in a room full of guys that when I hang with my girl friends, I find myself thinking like a guy sometimes, and it ruffles me. I cuss a lot, I am blunt and to the point at sensitive times, and I have missed some of my best friends weddings because I am gone and on the road. I am an extremely independent personality which is a result of being a touring musician on the road with a bunch of guys. I have never dated a guy in my band, because I have seen what happens at the end of that road, and it doesn't usually work out for the band. Of course there are exceptions. So much of my personality and character has been shaped as a result of me hanging with a bunch of guys. So yes there is a difference. Also I am treated differently by the fans. I get the question a lot in interviews \"\"What is it like being the only girl in a group of guys?\"\" and I think that one of the differences is that i am singled out more. In pictures I am usually in the front, and whenever we stay at a house on the road, the man or woman of the house points to the quarters they have chosen for me and says \"\"This is Phoebe's room-- you guys can figure the rest out\"\". I would call that a perk of being the girl. But there are also down sides. When we walk into a venue that has never heard our music, the bar tender and people working usually assume I am a girlfriend of one of the guys and there is just something inside me that wants to prove to them that I am actually a musician too; to let them know that I too have spent my entire life working on this craft and care more about the music than what I may be wearing that day. But don't get me wrong, I haven't lost the part of me that likes to shop.\" \"I do see differences and similarities. Women are always gonna be seen for their beauty regardless of their talent. But I believe there is so much beauty in talent that it can outshine the need to look like a model in order to be successful. I see younger girls being more and more bold about being a musician. I see gender stereotypes declining. For example, I see the older generation of women being glorified for beauty above talent, where people like Madonna helped to shift the mindset a bit by being so outlandish and independent that although she marketed her beauty she also shifted perception. And now there are some really genuinely talented females being glorified-- Norah Jones and Bonnie Raitt are two good examples but an even younger example is Sarah Jarosz, an incredibly gifted multi-instrumentalist who is receiving national acclaim. And even Taylor Swift (as marketable as she is) is being recognized as a lyricist and visionary for crossing the pop and country worlds (even though I dont see it as much of a cross since the two today are so similar already). But still, she is being recognized for intellectual virtues. This is not to say that the vanity surrounding the female gender will ever go away, we are still the society that glorified Brittany Spears and her beauty at such a young age that she lost herself in the whirlwind. \" Do what you love and the money will follow. If you love music and are truly ready to sacrifice the majority of the rest of your life, go for it. If not, keep it as a hobby. When I was 6, a sweet lady tapped me on shoulder as I was eating lunch on a picnic table at The Austin Montessori School (my elementary school), and said \"It's time to get fitted for your violin.\" I remember asking \"Does my mom know about this?\", and she said, \"She is the one who told me to come get you.\" I also remember having watched a violinist on the TV before this meeting and wanting to play, but I had no idea my mom knew. It was definitely a mothers intuition. Now, I took a liking to the ukulele because I wanted to learn applicable music theory and although people say I should play mandolin, I feel like I am cheating when I play mandolin and dont actually learn what I am doing, so I needed an instrument tuned completely different so I couldn't cheat. And at first the guitar was to hard on my hands, so my boyfriend of the time gave me a ukulele for my 21st birthday and I fell in love. Now, I have adopted a serious interest in the guitar because I really want to be able to back myself up on self written songs, and sometimes the ukulele is just not a big enough sound. So, I have sucked it up, and worked on the hand strength and dexterity required of guitar, and my father (an excellent guitarist with both undergraduate and masters degree in classical guitar) has been giving me lessons for the past few years, and I am almost ready to show up to a show with a guitar in hand. Was that long enough? ;) - Instruments: Ida, k., The Naysayer, Beekeeper - Years playing: bass, piano, vocal In my \"main\" band, Ida, I play bass and sing and contribute songs. I'm not involved in directing studio sessions or business decisions. 1 Fender Precision bass, 1 Gallien-Krueger amp. yes. I feel like young musicians today are more plugged into a DIY network that includes more fellow female musicians than when I was in my teens and 20's. I would say \"think consciously about being a woman musician when you need to, but always stay rooted in the music, the music, the music.\" Easier than guitar and I like the role bass plays in most songs -- melodic, rhythmic, stealth influence on overall feel of the song. - Instruments: This is my first real band. - Years playing: Guitar/Bass/Vocals In all three aspects we try to keep things pretty equally distributed. It's kind of the whole ideology behind what we do. There's no front man/woman, every one gets their time to shine. Since our partnership is set up between my 2 fellow bandmates and our manager, we all own 1/4th of everything and have 1/4th of an equal decision in it all. It's cool! I play a blonde epiphone casino guitar through a 70's fender pro reverb with 2 12\" speakers. I also play a black hofner bass though an ampeg rocket bass. \"There isn't a difference. I go out there and I play music and I rock and I roll. People enjoy it, I get payed at the end of the night, I go to the next town, I write songs, I record a record, I put the record out. It's all the same in that regard. The difference is in how others perceive me as a woman musician. The difference is people notice my gender before they notice my songs, or how I play, or what I play. I'm not saying this is always a bad thing, but it is a difference. People don't look at an all male band and say \"\"whoa, that's all guys.\"\" or \"\"whoa, where's the girls?\"\" People don't say to a male musician \"\"When you walked on stage I thought, WHOA a dude band, what are THEY gonna do? But then you guys can ACTUALLY play!!!\"\" Sometimes people come to our shows because they are interested in what a buncha girls could do. Sometimes people don't come to our shows because they don't care what a buncha girls could do. I've often heard \"\"I don't like female vocalists.\"\" Can you really block out the entire sex of womankind and say that not one of them you would like their vocals? What if they sing like a man? Anyway, I've always been aware of this perception of women in general, but especially in music. Coming from a family full of boys wailing on guitars... When my mom said \"\"You better practice that guitar so you can show up the boys\"\" it really stuck with me.\" With the music industry in such a change and the rise of the independents, male and female musicians have been able to go out and say \"this is who I am, this is what I want to do.\" It's a beautiful thing! In terms of women of today and women of years before, I think this change in the industry is what makes them different. In years before, even the most badass women have had to answer to their Big Time lawyers, managers, and record labels telling them to dress like this, talk like this, walk like this and baby we'll make you a star. Today's woman musician now has so many more doors open to her to be an independent woman in more than one way! I am really grateful to be making a living playing music without someone telling me to fix my teeth, shave my legs, and suck in my stomach. Instead I have had the opportunity to make decisions like, do I even want my picture on the cover of our first album? (I chose no.) \"I grew up around a lot of musicians and was influenced by a lot of different people, so I don't really remember a specific moment of valuable advice... But I do know that as a 17 year old girl trying to make my way in the music world, I had a few things in my mind... Which is what I would tell any woman musician starting out. Stick to who you are, don't back down on your beliefs, STICK TO YOUR GUNS! Also, don't forget to have fun. That's what music is all about. If it's not making you happy, you are doing something wrong.\" It's kind of a recquirement in my family to play an instrument, and since my grand father taught guitar lessons I decided to try it out. - Instruments: 2. On Air Library and School of Seven Bells - Years playing: vocals, guitar \"band: lead singer, rhythm guitar Huge Loin distortion pedal, Moog Freqbox Not that it doesn't still happen, but I noticed it way more when I first started out. It would be things like engineers or promoters assuming I was a girlfriend of a male band member, being looked over while a male band member was addressed about sound or money or whatever- those kinds of things. I mean there are some notable differences I think. It wasn't until around the early seventies when you saw the first all female rock bands. Being a women in that context was way more of a novelty back then then it is now. \"Oh yes. BP Fallon told me to never carry anything in my back pockets, because it \"\"looks shit\"\" - I'd say that's some pretty solid advice, don't you think? I mean, I haven't forgotten it :)\" because my band at the time needed a guitar player - Instruments: Wild Ones; Double or Nothin'; Inside Straight; Otter Space Band; 3rd Try Lefty; Good Goddess Almighty - Years playing: vocals and learning bass play, sing, write, laugh, take life lightly Goddess gear Absolutely. Men have dominated the music scene for many years. Now is the time for the feminine energy to be expressed. Women use music for more healing and inspiring purposes. I was inspired to pick up the bass by the bass player for Bob Schneider. Let your music shine. We all have something beautiful to share with the world. And we all are instruments for the Divine. So just enjoy your own unique sound. I love the richness of the bass. It connects me to earth energy. - Instruments: 3, The Art Of Shooting, Patrick Bower, and Mystery RKO - Years playing: Vocals/Guitar I am the songwriter, lead singer, guitar player, booker, and so much more. I play a Gretsch Electromatic guitar, a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amplifier, and an assortment of effects pedals. Yes, of course! I get people who tell me regularly that they wont come see me because I'm a \"chick\" in a band. That I hold the guitar like a \"chick\". \"Girls can't really rock\"...e.t.c. I get people screaming at me to show them my tits, that we should shut up and play Hole. We're harder to book with similar sounding artists on a larger scale, as there are just fewer female fronted bands that compare. I also get blatantly ignored at big chain guitar shops....and untimately, I once went into Sam Ash to buy an egg shaker. When the person behind the counter asked me which color I'd like I said \"Hmmmm,I dunnow...purple.\" to which he quickly replied \"Oh, right...I get it. Purple like your uterus. Totally!\" I was so stunned I said nothing and left. But it made for a good story. I'd say yes, but I see so many styles whirl back around and become en vogue again that I can't honestly say that I've noticed alot of truth in that. \"Yes, they said to me \"\" Don't say you're a girl band\"\", you are a woman who happens to be in a band, you are no different than any other band aout there trying to do the same thing you are. They've also said \"\"Don't give up before the miracle\"\" which has been one of the best pieces of advice I hold to when I'm frustrated. The advice I regularly give to young women musicians is after usually hearing a bevvy of excuses.... \"\"Shush up and play anyways!Play no matter what.\"\"\" I play the guitar becasue I was a bad drummer, and pianos weren't a practical instrument for me once I moved to NY. I also play guitar because my first instrument is my voice, second is pianos, and the best way I've found to form songs is to pluck them out on the guitar, and then find ways to sing around what I've created. - Instruments: 2. Mosquitos. Undersea poem. - Years playing: vocals, tambourine, harmonica I'm involved in the whole process. One cordless microphone. Two hand painted tambourines and a cheap C harmonica. \"I carry less gear. I have to sit to pee, so it makes a difference on the road.\" . \"Yes, Chris said: \"\"Don't worry about it and just shake that ass\"\". My advice would be the same that I'd give to anyone that wants to follow their dream in any area. Stay truthful to yourself. Find your own voice in whatever you are doing. Don't worry too much about the opinions of others. Live your lives fully, open heart, open mind. Go inside.\" I didn't. Chris (my husband and band mate) did. - Instruments: 2 - this group and Le Concorde - Years playing: Electric piano, synthesizer, tambourine I'm the hired hand in the live incarnation of the band. I haven't done studio recording with this band yet. I'm asked my opinion in business and marketing, and I do a little flyering but that's it. I have a Roland Juno-D keyboard and Roland KC 550 amplifier. Don't know the make of my tambourine. Some people perceive you differently. At least twice I had an experience where people who worked in clubs asked if I was a member of the band (during load-in). That surprised me because I'd think people who worked in clubs would be used to women musicians by now. They wouldn't ask a man who was hauling an amp out of a truck if they were members of the band... why would they ask a woman that question? \"No. Normally I'd give the same advice to anyone - don't be a jerk and don't sweat it if things don't go exactly your way. Be nice to the sound guy.\" I've played piano since I was very little - it chose me. - Instruments: always under my own name, different players - Years playing: vocals, guitar I am a band leader of 5 other (male) side players, I work (and rely heavily on) my team of people which consists of a manager, a label team, a producer, an agent, publicists, but I have a major hand in ALL decisions regarding my career. minimal. I have a vintage washburn parlour guitar, and a Gretsch Tennessee Rose hollow-body electric Yes, I think women think and feel differently in this business. I feel that being a woman has both its advantages and disadvantages. In my early career I felt constantly \"ghetto-ized\" as a \"girl with a guitar.\" But now that I am established in my career, and have developed my own unique sound, I feel that it helps to be a woman. I feel like my music/song-writing comes very much from the female perspective and is therefore very relatable by other females (a good thing, in demographic terms.) But I also feel that many men in engage with and relate to my music as well. Personally I think that there are more interesting ways to \"market\" female artists than men, mostly because females can play with looks/fashion/roles, and can pull it off better than most men. I don't strongly feel that there are differences in generations of women musicians, but the climate has changed. There are many more opportunities for women musicians now. Even 15 years ago when I began playing guitar it seemed rare for girls to play/write. It seems to be more common now, young girls are more encouraged. I had an older brother that encouraged me from the get-go. I had lots of people give me plenty of advice, but my approach has always been trial and error. I started early, and moved slowly through the business. I feel that the business aspect of music has always come pretty naturally to me. I've always worked hard, but never had to try very hard to understand the ins and outs of the business. Sometimes I worry about young musicians who attend music conferences to \"learn the ropes.\" I'd rather see them get out there and just do it their own way and learn as they go. Because my brother played guitar, and I picked his up. - Instruments: I am a soloist and chamber musician - Years playing: violin I love the flexibility I have with my work with choosing what repertoire I will play with different orchestras, when I will travel, what photos I will use on my website and what I will record etc. I pretty much make all the decisions but am so appreciative of the input and guidance I get from my publicist, record company, and managements I work with. My 'gear' consists of a beautiful Stradivarius violin, made in 1730. It belonged to the King of Spain at one time and is called 'The Royal Spanish' Strad... I think the biggest difference is that when you are a women and have children, it's more difficult to leave home. A man can maneuver more on the road, especially if his wife or partner can take care of the kids. Marketing oneself these days is so important. With all the social networks, websites, direct access to audiences and fans, it's important to show what one is doing as it generates more interest in one's art. No hiding behind a great curtain anymore...this is the biggest difference I think. I remember my teacher, Ms.DeLay telling me how important it was to be nice and thankful to everybody involved in the concert production. From the stagehand to the presenter and collaborating musicians. We are all in this together producing something that hopefully moves people to come back and enjoy their time in the hall. This I think was great advice for me. It makes you respect everybody's work there and helps elevate the spirit of what you are doing and saying through your music, which everybody can feel. Because it was the only one I understood right off the bat! - Instruments: Solo work, Mr Curt Ensemble, Carriage House, Plumerai, Country Mile, Chad Burdick, Hark! Orchestra - Years playing: electric violin, vocals, guitar, a little piano/woodwinds \"Since I am the band, for myself, I am the booking agent, PR rep, web lackey, promoter, writer, business manager, and accountant. I've always worn a lot of hats. I really like the recording process. I've done a little bit at home, but I really like being in studio. I enjoy being in the physical studio and interacting with the engineers and producers. I enjoy the recording process/creative process a lot and bringing life to sounds. I produced a track for a British band the Nightingales. For myself or recording for/with others, I like the rewarding feeling when after working hard, something comes back that has captured the essence or emotion of that moment has called for. \" \"Chinese model electric violin A nice acoustic violin Boss GT6 pedal Boss Octave pedal Pitch Harmonizer pedal Line 6 loop pedal Boss LoopRC-20XL A few guitars A few amplifiers (SWR, Peavey)\" \"I guess for me my distinct lack of fart and penis jokes would be a definitive separator. When I've been at a gig of my own and been asked if my boyfriend was playing. But it's more often I think it's a social question rather than a general assumption. The biggest difference I would say is that questions like this are still being asked. I haven't heard to many men commenting on what it is like to be a man in the music industry. \" I see differences in the function of marketing - the packaging and presentation of image. I go with what my parents told me in regards to everything - work hard and keep working. And I listen to my dad's advice to \"not eat yellow snow\" When I was 5 I begged my parents to play and I have always played. It's been a bit of a conflicted relationship. When I was in my teens, I threatened to quit and my parents, in a brilliant use of reverse psychology said \"go ahead.\" And then I though the better of it. I played all the way through college and perhaps got a bit burnt out and stopped playing for awhile. When I started playing again, not to overdo a cliche, I felt like I had come home and found new purpose. - Instruments: mostly just been focusing on my project which has changed names from OLD SOL to just my name MEGAN JACOBS. i have also played with my friends bands off an on. about 5 different bands i've played in. - Years playing: vocals and keys * i prefer the Wurlitzer \"I'm the singer. the songwriter. the keyboard player. the manager. the booking agent. the everything. this is my project and i'm the only one driving it forward really. i do have someone else who helped me produce the last batch of songs...but i also act as producer. i have found a great group of people to back me up and play in my band. \" well i'm a singer - so i have to keep my body and voice in tune, in shape and warm all the time....if i'm being good to my instrument that is : ) I also play the Keys. If i had the choice- i'd always pick The Wurlitzer- and electric piano from the 70's. I lug that baby around with me as far as i can. If i'm flying somewhere i'll take my carry on NORD keyboard which sounds close enough. for sure. being a woman in the music industry is just different. yes there are a lot of women who have succeeded in this industry but all in all i feel the music industry is Boys Town. I wish it weren't true but... to be a successful woman in the industry you not only have to sound hot you have to look hot to get anyone's attention. Yes it helps if the men musicians are attractive but they do not have to sell their sex appeal as much as women do...in order to succeed. If men want to sell their music - they often put hot chicks in the advertisements to help get attention. if you're a woman promoting your music- you better be in a hot lookin dress and showin some cleavage. it's true - that's the entertainment life we live in. Also i find men are more able to jump in and jam- take the mic- put themselves out there and get the gig than women are...generally speaking. yes the women from the 60's sang about political action and more righteous matters. they used organic sounding instruments and there was more freedom to be free back then. They created music that was more from the heart and simpler in once sense. back then - you had carol king, joni mitchell, joan baez. now the closest thing we have to that is ...norah jones and colbie caillet. music is much more produced now. there's more of a digital sound than analog. seems we've had to \"dumb-down\" lyrics in order to sell songs these days. I do believe people are still hungry for Real Music with Real Messages but i'm not sure if the Masses can digest anything heavier than \"oops i did it again\" \"yaah the people who work in the music industry told me to RUN far away from this biz - ha ha - but there's some truth to that joke. some people told me to go after my dreams and that I got what it takes to make it. I feel the most important thing to remember when going after your musical dreams... You have to always keep doing the work, you must be persistant, patient and always keep it real. Art for the sake of art. Art to make people feel. When your intentions are around making the best song you can and not worried about who's gonna buy it....or how it's gonna sell....you can keep it real. \" my parents started me out on the piano at the age of 5.

I think women may have to work a bit harder to find a management or leadership style that is comfortable for them. When i was growing up there were not as many role models for women in jazz, especially women who were leading their own bands. Meeting Marian McPartland and getting to know her was life-changing as she was a highly respected artist that exuded humor and charisma on stage but could also be pretty salty off-stage! I sense bitterness among some older women jazz musicians; they feel as though they did not get a fair shot in the 60s or 70s and that they were discriminated against. As more women have entered the field I think that has changed. I don't think the younger female jazz musicians feel that it is necessarily an uphill struggle due to gender concerns anymore, although I still sense some discrimination within the more \"macho\" instrument groups, like trumpet. Women musicians just need to be the very best musicians they can be, like everyone else. They shouldn't worry about being categorized as \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" in their approaches; they just need to play from their hearts and the truth of that will reach people.

It's hard for me to pinpoint the differences but we're a minority on the scene...if we were the majority I know, at the least, we'd be more empowered. One day, I looked around the bandstand and noticed that I was the only woman on stage. I think this is often the case for women. Before that moment, I was so determined to get on stage and start singing that it never occurred to me that I was the only one. \" Yes, absolutely! Women no longer play the single role of looking pretty and singing pretty in between killin' solos played by men. Now, you'll find women playing killer solos on guitar, drums, sax, bass... this is a recent thing! Also, women feel empowered these days to emote more- to sound angry; sound ugly if they want to; to display things that were once considered inappropriate and unattractive coming from a woman. \"Yes. Jose Feliciano told me to never let any man come between me and my music. My advice to a woman starting out: Listen to your heroes and try and make music like them. Good music doesn't die with your heroes. Don't waste your time saying, nobody sounds like that anymore. Go and be the real deal and let somebody say that about you one day. Go and be one of the ones.\" It chose me. - Instruments: pretty much just this one. - Years playing: upright bass, sing I am 50% of the band. Eddie plays guitar and he is the lead singer. He also programs the drum machines. I play my bass and sing. We write together. Sometime Eddie will come to practice with a riff read that he has come up with, or even most of a song, and then I'll add my part to it. And sometimes we start from the ground up together. We've become very accustomed to writing together at this point. As far as studio, business, marketing, booking, touring, all of the above, we're pretty good at being 50/50. We divide up booking, driving, flyer making, etc. and try to split the burden as evenly as we can. Studio wise, Eddie typically has more to say based on his audio engineering background and the fact that he sings on every song and programs the beats. I play a 3/4 size upright bass through a stack- SWR workingman's cab, a marshall guitar cab and a GK head. Do you need more specifics? Yes and no. I think just being a man or a woman and being a musician is one thing. But when you are a woman in a band, I think then it is different. I mean, I personally don't see why it is different but I know that it is, or that people perceive it to be different. I know this because, despite the fact that I am 50% of the band, a club owner will push his way past me to hand Eddie the money at the end of the night. Or the sound guy might look past me to ask Eddie what we need. I've even had sound men ask Eddie questions about MY rig. What??? Are you freaking kidding me??? Sometimes, though, I am lucky enough to find myself in situations where I don't see the difference anymore. Like shows when we play with all female bands, or every band on the bill has at least one female in them. Or the club is owned by a woman, or the sound guy is not a sound guy, but actually a sound woman. So yes, I do think unfortunately some people still think it's a man's world, but not everyone. n/a Well, not so much music industry advice as something my first bass teacher said to me that has always stuck with me. I was struggling with learning how to carry my instrument. It is a beast. I was even shorter then, and I'm only 5'2\" now, this thing was huge. And I must have asked someone for help or something and she told me that if this was what I wanted to do, if I really wanted to play this instrument, I would carry it for myself. I would always carry it on my own. I still hear those words in my head and I think it's important as a woman to carry that over into other aspects of being in band, not just schlepping my instrument around, but being sure to pull my weight with everything we do just like any guy would (or should). When I was like 11 years old, in elementary school in Idaho, this group of local musicians came to an assembly at my school to teach us all about string instruments. So they demonstrated each one and I was just like yeah, yeah, whatever, and then this guy, (who I wound up later playing in symphonies with), lifts up this big bass, and plays the low E string and it reverberated through the whole room and I loved it immediately! I asked for one right away. The school district, however, did not have an extra at that moment, so I played cello for a year or so until they could get me a bass. And the rest is history. - Instruments: Under my own name, Luke Doucet, Sarah Mclachlan, Blue Rodeo, Jesse Cook, Ladybird Sideshow - Years playing: vocals & guitar, sometimes piano singer/songwriter in my own band. backups & guitar in other bands. fully involved decision maker & player in the studio, but not the producer. Six Shooter records is in charge of business & marketing, but all decisions are made together. Martin D18 1973. Telecaster 1966. Pedal board with distortion, reverb, tremolo. Custom made amp built from a bell & howell film projector, called a Bernie. I'm sure it's different, but I'm not sure what that difference is. I have never felt at a disadvantage. I think men approach music from a different angle, but those lines are becoming blurred & that's a good thing I think. women are starting to master their instruments in the rock/pop/blues/jazz/folk world. Instead of just being a 'voice' or a 'songwriter', women are playing lead guitar & getting behind the drum kit. That wasn't as common back in the day. work tirelessly at your craft. That's your only job. Find good, honest people to work with. started with violin as a kid, but picked up guitar & piano in my early teens. good tool for writing songs. - Instruments: 2 - Catherine Dupuis group and Russ Kassoff Big Band - Years playing: Jazz Vocal In my group, I'm the leader. I handle all my own business decisions, booking, contracting, marketing, preparation, scheduling, personnel hiring including arrangers. With the Russ Kassoff Big Band, I'm a sideman. Mike and stand, chords, speaker and stand, extension chords, music stand and stand lights. I'm also my own librarian and handle all the music for my group. Yes - in both the big band and small group formats, jazz traditionally requires a pretty tough demeanor, especially where business is concerned. This isn't something that comes to women easily or automatically. But we develop it over time. There's a glass ceiling however, and it's hard to penetrate that, unless you go for glam, which isn't guaranteed to work either. Yes, my generation has much more opportunity than the generations behind me. For those younger than I am, the opportunities are even more endless. Having jazz taught in universities and conservatories now makes it more accessible for women; the old boys' network spent alot of energy keeping women out of the game, only a few really talented ones could get thru, unless they were vocalists. Male musicians still rarely believe that vocalists are musicians. Keep true to your self and your soul. Know what you want to say. Take care of your own business, don't expect anyone to do it for you. Grab what you do by the gonads and have all the fun you can with it. It chose me at a very early age. I also studied piano extensively as well as 6 years of violin. - Instruments: dorilevine trio,dorilevine/virg dzurinko trio, Over Easy - Years playing: voice vocalist, band leader mic & amp Yes. Woman are less excepted in Jazz and we require changing keys to accomodate our vocal range which is usually unwelcome. Yes. There are more Jazz programs available today than in the past and singers in particular are being better trained as musicians. \"NO! Save up some money. Self promotion can be expensive. Sharpen those skills..there's a lot of competition out there.\" love voice as an instrument - Instruments: Philadelphia Orchestra; Orlando Philharmonic; Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra - Years playing: Composer I also have an MBA and consult with non-profit organizations. I have a Ph.D., which is good for a professor (it's in theory, composition, and musicology). Finale 2008. Dell D630. Steinway D Grand. Yes! There was not one moment, but there were things like: **\"We didn't recommend you for that job at X College because you once taught in high schools and thought that's what you wanted to do.\" (Said as I finished Ph.D.) **A young composer who said, \"I can't marry and have children. That's really a disadvantage for my career.\" **Noticed that many of the successful male composers are gay. (Sorry, but it's true.) **Professor: \"Too pretty to get more than a C.\" (I'd been marked down for silly flaws on my papers.) **Walking out on stage to applause for my symphony, and several audience members said, \"It's a girl!\" even though my very feminine name was printed in the program. **And on it goes . . . The younger musicians are rarely in to melody, harmony, and communication. There's a lot of electronic and pseudo-electronic effects. I was not mentored AT ALL. I was not taken seriously by any males. Fortunately, I have done all right, but my way is not good for mental health. Many women who could mentor nowadays are still quite competitive - there is insecurity among women composers. I started as a pianist at age 3. Discovered I was a composer at age 8. Went to undergrad school as music ed major so I play all. writer singer neutral into 5th no, except women are more poetic no be the next you not the next anyone else....advice have a backup plan cheap - Instruments: It varies. Anywhere from 2-8 at any one time. - Years playing: violin I am mainly just a violin player. I add strings to other people's music, so I don't generally have much creative control in the studio, or much say in the business side of things. I play violin. Sometimes I run it through a series of effect pedals (harmonist, octave, delay, reverb, loop station, etc). \"I find that people (or men, I suppose) are often reluctant to let you do certain things, such as carrying gear, setting things up, tearing this down. It took me years to learn how to do simple things, like wrapping patch cords, or connecting things, or setting up PA systems, because the men I was playing with didn't want to show me, they just wanted to do it themselves. I still get the occasional nasty comment, or surprised look when men see me doing these sorts of things. Of course, sometimes there are things I CAN'T help with. As a woman I often find that I am physically limited. I'm much too small to carry some of the large amps that the men in my band use. Those things were definitely not designed for someone lacking in upper body strength... I can't imagine what I would do if I were an electric guitar of bass player.... Right now I'm thinking about buying a keyboard, and my one stipulation is that it should be small enough and light enough for me to carry on my own. \" I think that the best way to learn how to do things is to do them yourself. So someone just starting out should really make an effort to learn how to do everything for themselves, whether it's setting up gear, learning about various technological things, advancing shows, etc. When I was 8 years old I heard Vivaldi's string music, and I knew that I needed to learn how to make those sounds. - Instruments: four - Madison Symphony, Bach Dancing and Dynamite Society, Wingra Quintet, and Cactus Pear Music Festival - Years playing: flute i am a self employed freelance musician, and i play classical music, with small and large groups. Sometimes I make the decisions and sometimes I'm part of an orchestra that makes decisions through management \"flute piccolo alto flute\" \"yes, in terms of family. i think that women bear much more of the responsibility and make many more sacrifices in terms of their career and work when they choose to become mothers. \" Don't wait for anyone to give you permission to do anything. Trends are set by leaders. my parents chose it - Instruments: The Texas Duet - Years playing: vocals, guitar, percussion My partner and I are the entire band. We both make the decisions together. He handles most of the business end but not without discussion first. Full Yamaha setup: 8 channel pa with 2 15\" front speakers and 2 12\" moniters. All guitar cables, mic cables, Shure mics. Alvarez acoustic guitar, 2 Takamine acoustic guitars. Custom drumset played by feet. Not really. Yes. I believe that women today are able to do more with their music if given the chance. Back then there were more things that were looked down on coming from a woman. No. If you love what you do, you keep doing it and don't ever let anyone bring or put you down. Keep Playin' Ladies!! I've always like the guitar but could never learn as child. Got a lefty and was able to pick it up no problem. - Instruments: I've been in a series of rock bands. You may have heard of Skookumchuck, my first outfit. I was added as second guitarist. I could barely stand and play. I was epic. - Years playing: I sing, and I play guitar I sing and write the rock songs, pay for the studio time, press the records and the wax.I own a record label called Local 638 Records, and basically urban-kayak my way through music business rapids. So far I'm dry and wearing a helmet. I use a Fender Supersonic Pro head and matching cab. Play Gibson Les Pauls. SG's, Fender Jaguars. I use Heil vocal microphones. When I saw Guided By Voices pee in a bucket backstage. I knew I could never do it standing up. Other than that, not so different. I was driving, and heard Tina Turner start Proud Mary. While that wife beater Ike sang the rollin' part, she spoke, and talked about how they were going to do it easy, and then they were going to do it rough. There is so much history, soul-suffering, movement, and lady power in our rear-view mirrors. The differences between us new ladies and Tina, is that she built the riverboat we work on. Best advice was wrap your chord around your strap, THEN plug it into your guitar. That way when you step on it, no one shuts out the lights. And my advice would be to find what makes you happy, and try like hell to hang on. Guitar has always been the iconic instrument for me. Plus, I was using my violin bow as a sword and got it taken away in 3rd grade. - Instruments: MBird and several jazz groups - Years playing: vocal and guitar/piano/fiddle Everything...I am independent. I produce or co-produce everything I do. I do all of the arrangements. I own all of it and co-write with my friends. I handle all our sites from myspace to facebook to website to blogs to booking tours to writing the music and singing it to raising money for records and tours. I edit our video logs, I write our blogs, I answer letters and questions about how to do this. I also do any hiring of band musicians and put together the professional video teams. I am responsible for the visions for the projects, themes and ultimately in charge of booking hotels, vehicles, equipment, road managing. The success or failure of this music is mine period. I along with two other people get radio plays and I decide what steps to take and how to get from point A to point B. I also have a jazz career that I handle everything for as well. I have the same fiddle I've had since I was 8...I play an 85' Fender Acoustic and an Alvarez. I use a Peavey Portable PA when appropriate. I have a Sennheiser mic a Shure 55S mic. I use a Blue Snowball series mic for Macbook webcam streaming for live videos. I use music stands I stole from my college shhhhh:) I haven't had a chance to be a dude yet but I have had a lot of great advice and support from both men and woman songwriters, club owners, players and music lovers. I have heard stories about the sexualization of females in music so I know that can happen, but I think people overlook how much that happens to guys too. I only allow my sex to be involved as much as I choose it to be. I have decided to own my own character and support myself as a human which includes having a sex, which I think involves both masculine and feminine characteristics. I am a younger performer and I recognize that I have had ground work laid for me by many great females who have gone before me but I have never had someone act differently towards me for being a girl. I have noticed that people are often surprised I am doing all this by myself but I don't know if that's because I'm a girl or because they are just genuinely surprised. Particularly in the aspect of media...people: men, woman, teens, kids are the same now as they have always been, but the media has found a growing niche since the 40's that works for pretty girls selling things and hot boys being cheesy with cars. That is just the way it has always been and I didn't have the same road other woman had in music...maybe I was jaded when I started performing because I had been witnessing men and women working together in the Arts since I was a child. I had always been more inclusive than exclusive in my vision for music, and in jazz I spent a lot of time with old guys and old females telling me stories about race and sex and the rubs and blues that came out of that living. However those things are what make songs stand the test of time, and little girls and little boys are still singing those songs. Musicians are constantly evolving because everyone is moving and growing inside singularly, and then growing as a whole. Influencing each other and making a difference whenever they decide to engage and frankly any person who can hang in there through their own ebbs and flows is worth applause whether they are male or female. I do think the ladies have had an interesting road breaking themselves out of molds they feel are still in place for them, or rebelling against them so they can eventually embrace them in their own way. My generation is all about that. Shuffling off the past to break into the new. Indy music is a perfect example. The blurring of the male and female lines are awesome there because there are no rules yet. Yes. I came up in the Jazz and Blues communities in Kansas City and with prairie folks from North Dakota when I started writing and singing. I was told to never forget where you come from and that no matter what you play or what you sing you are the interpreter for your listener. Male or female, everyone has bridges they walk over, emotions they feel, and as a writer, player, or singer, in those moments you share you should set yourself free so the people listening can be free to go into themselves to feel or come with you to listen. No matter who they are. I sing the songs after I write them, playing occasionally onstage. I choose to do it because I like to share my lyrics and maneuver the melodies I write my particular way. Plus, after I write the song, allowing other people to play with me lets me step into their instruments, creating a world for us as a team, and stretches me as a songwriter and performer. (and my favorite is singing) - Instruments: Many--I can't remember them all easily--but the main ones have been: Elisa Randazzo, The Red Krayola, Northern Lights, Fairechild. Those are the ones I have spent time at--I have also played live with Spiritualized, and have guest appeared on many records. - Years playing: Some guitar but mostly violin and vocals. I record a lot of my own stuff at home before I add other instruments later--I work on marketing with the advice of Drag City--I produce my own stuff and also co-mix it, so I'm pretty involved on all levels. Remy violin from the 1800's, martin acoustic, fender custom tele electric Yes, I do think it's different in every way. A lot of it has to do with the way other musicians approach playing with you. I takes a lot of sensitivity to play certain genres of music, especially music with a female vocal. I try to chose musicians who add tasteful parts without overplaying. I think it's always better to be a player who is subtle works at facilitating the actual song instead of being showy. This is even more important when playing live music. I think things are always cyclical, especially since the 60's, so it depends what part of the cycle we're in, but I definitely see repetition. I think music can be amazingly reminiscent when it comes from a person's sub-conscience, and this depends on what one's soaked in over the years. At this point in our greater development, it seems like we are amalgams of many things. Like conglomerate rocks, you can see the what kinds of elements make the greater whole, but the combination can also be totally unique. Don't let the opinions of others thwart you from letting your quirkiest moments come through. Try to write a lot and not judge your work till it's really complete, and you've had some distance from it. If I had heeded this advice, I would have written hundreds more songs! Because it was small and because is was romantic! - Years playing: vocals, omnichord, percussion (scrap metal trash heap), clarinet, melodica I share the front of the stage with the frontman, but don't play anything particularly crucial to the songs. In the studio, my main role is back-up vocals. In business decisions, 50%, and in marketing decisions, I am pretty much the ringleader. I take or orchestrate the promo photos and videos, maintain twitter & myspace, built the web site, and I write the press releases. We recently hired a girl to do press for us so now I work in tandem with her. That's the part of being in a band I feel really good at. Two NPR SxSW tote bags from different years, one containing a tambourine, a trash can lid, and a clarinet case; the other containing a metal bucket, in which I keep drumsticks, an antique cowbell from a junk store, two flour-sifter-looking percussion instruments from the Dominican Republic. And my omnichord. It was joked about at the outset that my main role in the band would be to make the promo photos look good. Always can't help but wonder, when I feel uncertain about what to do musically at a certain point in a song, or I feel like a show didn't go well, whether everyone around me secretly knows that is actually my role. It's a little defeating. I'm just the girl in the band. I pick out a great outfit and stand near the front of the stage, so I feel particularly embarrassed when I'm not doing something really useful. Marketing is a big difference. A marketing approach (twitter, facebook, blogs, etc.). That may be age more than gender. I bet there is a difference in booking\u2014I will have to remember to ask some friends about it. A friend's aunt advised me to have a drink before I sing in front of people. My dad recommends drinking lemon juice \"like Frank Sinatra did\" (?). A lot of folks have stressed the value of not taking oneself too seriously. Since I'm not a *solo* woman musician, I don't know that I'm necessarily in a position to give advice, but, in my experience I'd say 'be confident and you'll go far.' If anything compromises my performance / my role in the band I guess it's a lack of confidence / fear I don't know what I'm doing as much as the older people in my band, the guy who writes the songs (probably true but they seem not to mind), and I don't want to give my opinion or participate any more than people ask me to. Sing when sung to. Because I could play it, and it was useful to my band. - Instruments: Lisa Otey, Diane Van Deurzen & Lisa Otey, Lisa Otey and the Desert Divas - Years playing: piano, voice I have been performing professionally, fronting my own groups and playing as sideman for others, since moving to Tucson in 1984. I started producing my own CDs in 1994, calling my label Owl's Nest Productions. I also produce a season of 20+ concerts each year, showcasing local, national and international musicians. The CDs have also been a great showcase for these players and singers. I do all my own publicity, booking, arranging, managing, etc. Technics keyboard, Yamaha PA and speakers, Sennhaiser and Shure Beta mics \"In the beginning, I think I played harder to try to fit in with the men. They never treated me differently as a musician because I was a woman. However, if I didn't play as well as they did, that's another story. As a woman, it can be hard to fit in with men who might look at you as a sexual object. I was 17 when I started and frequently had to deflect their flirtations. even now sometimes. I earned their respect, however, and have felt like an equal for most of my professional life. In my genre of jazz and blues, I have found an inequality- not among musicians, but with booking agents and festival and concert programmers. They usually want a white guy with a guitar in the US and a black guy with guitar or a black woman singer in Europe. In the US, you might see one woman piano player on a festival, or one woman period, but a dozen white guys with guitars. In Europe, they see jazz and blues as Black American music. They want it to be authentic so someone like me will be on a side stage, never on a main stage. Even so, I have felt very successful in my career and see more doors opening every day. I have also never waited for someone to discover me or to create opportunities for me. I realized early on that it cost the same money to produce a short demo and shop it to different record companies as it did to produce your own full length CD and sell it. When I realized I didn't fit with concert programmers, enough to sustain myself, I started producing my own concerts as well. I have felt successful doing these things on my own. The audiences have been very receptive as well.\" \"Women in general are more respected today then they were 100 years ago. In the beginning of jazz and blues, women had to turn tricks sometimes to make sure their rent was paid. Racism, gender bias and economic oppression has always been an issue for women. Of course, Black Americans have had a terrible time no matter what their gender. Women I know who are generations older than me weren't able to make their living just with music. They were also teachers and nurses. I am grateful that I have been lucky in that way. In the future, I'd like to see less gender bias in the industry so we never have one token female on the roster. Those decisions perpetuate the economic imbalance. If only one woman can be featured on a festival, the men will obviously have an easier time making a living.\" \"People told me to write my own songs, tell my own stories. They told me to K.A.T.N. (Kick Ass and Take Names). I have always believed that the universe will meet me halfway. I need to do my part, get my skills together, and put my dreams out there. Everything I have ever wanted as a musician has come true for me. It is a blessing to be able to make a living doing what I love. I encourage everyone to follow their dreams and trust they will be taken care of. It's hard in these times to trust that you can let go of something that seems like a sure income. What is a sure income any more? I have never made a lot of money but I have always been able to pay my bills. Every time I put a thought out there for some kind of work I would like to do musically, the phone rings or an email comes. This has happened for every creative person I know who has done their part to be ready for these opportunities. I have truly been blessed. I am told that I don't just keep the door open behind me, I hold it open and push others through. My life has been so full and I still feel like I'm just getting started. Thanks for doing this survey.\" \"Piano was my mother's instrument. I fell in love with it as a child. In my family of professional musicians, it wasn't a question of whether you would play, just what instrument. I started at age 4 on the violin, my father's instrument. When I was 6, I wanted to switch to the piano. My mother told me I needed to be serious and couldn't just flit from instrument to instrument. She said if I was still asking for lessons in a year, I could take piano. In the meantime, I started making up songs. Mom taught me theory and how to write down the notes for my songs. I moved to Tucson to study with a jazz piano teacher, Jeff Haskell, at the UofA. My roommate asked what I wanted to do with my life. I said, \"\"I think I'll play piano.\"\" She asked, \"\"What if it doesn't work out for you?\"\" I replied, \"\"it has to. It's all I know how to do.\"\" So far, 25 years later, it's been working fine.\" - Instruments: I perform mostly as a singer/songwriter with musicians and solo - Years playing: piano, guitar, voice I'm the songwriter and the performer. I have a percussionist that I feel pretty invested in emotionally and musically. I don't like to perform without him. I am partners in business with my husband. We run the record company together so we make marketing decisions together, but I make all the creative decisions. In the studio, I also feel like I'm in the drivers seat. I'm usually there for mixes and my producer and I understand that I have a high need for \"quality assurance\". I want to be involved in every level of recording. I have a keyboard for performing, a Breedlove acoustic guitar, a couple of 58 shure mics, and some recording equipment for home (including condenser mics, preams and computers). \"Having kids has really made it clear to me the difference. But that's a difference for any mother who would like a career as well. I really felt I had to stop playing music while my kids were little, I couldn't breast feed and be there in the way I wanted to without taking a full on break from music. Being a woman also has been helpful in some ways, and difficult in others. I remember trying to get into a venue called \"\"The Red Devil Lounge\"\" in San Francisco when I was first starting out, and they referred me to their \"\"women's\"\" night instead of just letting me come and play with my band. At the time I found that rather insulting. Also, it's harder to get \"\"real\"\" reviews about your music. Many people want to compare you to another female artist rather than comparing you to music that is similar. That makes it hard to be unique and female at the same time.\" I think that the differences in generations are trends in the music industry in general. It's much more about being sexy in some now a days in some genres of music, but I think that's true for men too. Maybe there is more of an expectation that if you are a woman making music, you better be able to have the whole package and be able to sell yourself as a product too. The only woman who isn't like that that I can think of off hand right now is Bonnie Raitt. The single most valuable piece of advice that I have been given, but really had to figure out for myself is: Write to please yourself. Don't try to please your audience, but really make the music you want to and the audience will follow. I feel like I have to re-learn this all the time, but it's a simple truth. When you are true to yourself and your art, it translates and your audience \"gets\" it. I think I chose piano because my older brother played and I wanted to be like him. But more than that, it's such a naked canvas every time you sit at the keys. It takes no effort to make something happen and there is a sense of control to what you are doing. Also piano is very linear.. it's all laid out in front of you and the choices are obvious. It seems like with guitar, there are several ways to play a chord and it feels like they are all hiding waiting for you to explore them. I guess that's how I feel about the difference between the two. Also, as a child.. your fingers don't hurt when you play piano. The texture feels good of the cool keys, so there is always a positive association. - Instruments: Merl Saunders, The eights, Zasu Pitts Memorial Orchestra, Sidepocket, Pamela Rose, Pamela Rose with Wild Women of Song - Years playing: vocalist, composer, bandleader Band Leader - Co-producer. While I invite a healthy amount of input from my musicians, I do always have a strong sense of how I think it should sound. Marketing, business, bookings, thta's the job we all hate, but it does seem that if you are promoting something you believe in, you've got to do it yourself. This new show I'm performing in right now tells the story of the women songwriters of the class jazz and blues era (Alberta Hunter through the early 50's), and we project slides of the women on a screen while I tell stories and we performn their songs. So....these days I need a laptop and projector, and I've never been too proud to haul the p.a. system. \"It's changed so much since the days I started out, when women were supposed to be 'chick singers' and cook dinner for the guys and clean up after rehearsals. (I kid you not). I used to feel that I had to sing powerful strong songs so as not to get pigeon holed as the 'ballad singer' (chick singer). My last CD which was about the women jazz composers naturally featured a lot of great women players. I'm happy to report in that I can't close my eyes and say that there's a 'women' style of playing that's qualitatively unique or different than the men's style. We've come a long way, and I work with some pretty bad ass women musicians. And of course, let's discuss the fact that to have a boyfriend or husband in this business, he better have a good healthy ego, able to handle that you are getting flirted with from stage or off stage. The male musician 'band wives' go to all the gigs, but the husbands don't, for sure. \" \"YES!!!! It used to be hard to find a really strong woman drummer, now there's scores of young women who are fantastic. and guitarists, too. I think the men musicians have also become a lot more sensitive - on the band stand, and in terms of process. \" \"My new show \"\"Wild Women of Song\"\" does talk a lot about the unique challenges of having a family and being in music biz. It's hard for anyone to juggle the demands of work chldrend...but so much harder when you are on the road, when you can't promise you'll be there for birthdays or recitals. And women, I feel, aren't as naturally comfortable promoting themselves as men are - so much of the networking happens from hanging out at parties and in bars, etc. Really difficult on the musician moms, who just can't do those things. I'm happy to say I've got a wonderful, very supportive, strong minded husband who is not threatened by my lifestyle, and who has had to throw many a birthday party for our kids when I've not been around. \" Funny thing - I was always pretty shy; folks that grew up with me are usually pretty surprised when they see me perform as a lead singer. I was always writing and arranging songs, and trying to give them to bands, but when I would sing the song down, I'd be asked to join that band as a singer. So....eventually I just accepted it's a big part of my alter ego. - Instruments: Cristi and I have recently sung with Bear In Heaven and Hooray For Earth. - Years playing: voice, keyboard, guitars cristi and i are the songwriters, and we are the band, zambri. so together, we make the decisions creatively and business wise. vintage synths, sampler, drums, bass, vocal effects, tiny amps. i think men and women in general have different experiences in life. being a woman in the music world is interesting. for starters, more often than not, you are surrounded by men. there was a particular moment that stands out to me, when i first started playing in nyc. the sound engineer for the night (a man), prior to soundcheck, assumed i was going to play acoustic guitar. after he learned i would be playing keyboards as well as electric guitar that night, he proceeded to show me around the stage telling me things like, \"ok so when you hook up cables input is for where you should put the cables \"in\" and make sure you plug this cable into your amp from your guitar, etc....\". i felt in that moment, i was being treated as if i did not know any better, and it was a peculiar moment to endure. these moment will continue to follow me around in life, but not all men are like that, and when i feel out-numbered, i can always look to my sister. i do see that these days 15 year olds are singing and dancing around with little to no clothing, and instead of admiring a girl for her ability, we see lots of people looking up to women as sex objects. i feel like back in the day maybe there was less of that going on. even when madonna entered it seems like she was simply expressing herself, but now all the copy cats are almost mocking that expression and abusing it. to a woman musician just starting out, i would say follow your heart, and listen to your gut feelings. singing always felt natural, and for a brief moment, i used to take piano lessons, which got me interested in keyboards. from there, guitar was an easy next choice as i like to mix it up and try out new instruments all the time. - Instruments: Garland of Hours, Benjy Ferree, Mary Timony, Tsunami, Jenny Toomey, Edith Frost, Rebecca Gates, played cello on record for Fugazi, TEd Leo, Bob Mould and more - Years playing: cello, voice, sometimes keyboard In Garland of Hours, I make all the decisions. For about 15 years I played (and sometimes still play) as a session cellist for other people and got to tour and record alot and have tons of fun, but I was not feeling fullfilled as a musician because I was playing other people's music. I am currently working on my third Garland of Hours record and it feels so lovely to be able to express myself how I want. Quintus carbon-fiber cello, electro-harmonix loop station, non-affected vocals. My husband plays drums with me, but I also play solo or with my friends Mary and Jonah on guitar and bass. Yes, it is different in so many ways. As with any job, there is always going to be this pressure around your mid-30's if you haven't had kids yet and how you are going to be able to work your music around that. It's something that I haven't dealt with yet and not sure I am going to. If your music is your livelihood it's even harder. There are tons of examples of women musicians who are also mothers and not mega-rich so I'm sure it can be done. And then there's the sexism thing, which I don't notice so much in the classical music world anymore, but I see it still in the rock world. It is still novel to be a woman playing an instrument, sometimes it works in your favor, so you get more attention, but sometimes the attention is not about your music at all. Which is very disheartening. I first noticed things were different in the early 90's when I was in college and had started playing bass with some bands, as a release from my classical cello studies. This was when Riot Grrl stuff was happening, I played in a band with all guys, and then another band which was mostly women. In the band with the guys I just wanted to fit in, but I ended up dating two of them at one time or other. With the band of mostly other women, we had our issues with each other but there was more this feeling of \"we're in this together\". We also worked more on actually writing songs than the other band. My great-aunt was born in 1904. She was a piano teacher all her life and died in 2000 at the age of 96. I always hated playing the piano for her when she came to visit because she was very critical and slap at my hands if I made a mistake. But she loved the piano and loved teaching and I see that in myself now. But in her era, it was probably more acceptable for a woman to be a piano teacher than to be a performer. I have a close friend , Tina Chancey, who is a successfull folk/early music performer who is in her early 60s, and she has also been a mentor to me lately as I figure out how I relate to music as I get older. I think it's incredibly important for young women musicians to have older mentors. \"Speaking of mentors, I would not have started writing my own music if Jenny Toomey had not pushed me to do it! At the time, I was playing with her band Tsunami and also working on her solo stuff. Why don't you write your own record?, she said. And I saw her example and didn't see why not. I had gone to college for classical cello, I had been playing in many different bands playing many different types of music, it was finally time. I would tell any young (or older!) woman starting out in the music world to seek out any opportunity to play your music, whether it seems worth it or not. Forge relationships with real people, and be suspicious of anyone who you get a funny feeling about. It helps to keep up with people who come to see you play. Start an e-mail list or website so people can be up to date on your shows. In these days, you have to be your own PR and website person as well as a musician. You have to wear many hats. Also, the most important: NEVER DOUBT YOURSELF! This can be hard. And you may get bad reviews and snarky comments once in a while but keep reminding yourself that this is your music and it is sacred. I've found that the self-confidence thing among women musicians is a big difference between the guys I've worked with in music. But this is also the case accross the board, not just in music fields. \" I have been in love with the cello since age nine when I started playing in elementary school. I studied it in college and got my degree in it. I knew I had to use it in a different way, not just in the symphony or string quartet. It is my other voice besides my voice, and it can say so much more! - Instruments: Nancy Falkow, Sunflow, The Dirty Triplets(defunct), Slo-Mo, Fran King - Years playing: vox, keys, guitar, bass \"Lead singer/songwriter Usually totally in control of everything\" \"1950 Gibson LG 1 Fender Pro Junior Amp Ibanez bass Crappy yamaha keyboard Shure Beta 58a Shure 58 \" \"I worked in recording studios for 10 years and it was always very clear to me that I was usually the only girl around. Sometimes worked to my advantage as I got to do lots of vocal sessions and didn't have a lot of competition. But it would have been nice to have had more women around. The best experience I ever had was playing in The Dirty Triplets an all girl band. I never laughed more, we had the most creative rehearsals, we advanced so quickly as a group, played the most prestigious gigs, and was a joy in every sense. It broke my heart when the band broke up for personal reasons of our lead singer. But i think being the only girl in many bands, as well as at the studios made me very much a \"\"guys girl\"\" I never felt that being a girl was ever a hindrance. I never felt that i didnt get something because i was female. i never felt left out. maybe i'm lucky. but i always felt wanted and indispensable in any project because of my voice and my ability to harmonize (never because of my instrument playing, that was always secondary to my voice)\" \"I'm quite out of the loop right now, not gigging a lot, so i couldn't really tell you. But I can tell you there was a point where i started feeling, yeah, they're getting younger and prettier all the time.\" \"Just be good at what you do. Practice your instruments til your fingers bleed. Find good sounding boards that will give you constructive criticism if you're a songwriter, not just someone who tells you everything is great. Listen to music and your mother.\" \"Forced into piano lessons and thanked my mother many times Guitar - because you can't really take a piano from dorm room to dorm room Bass - because i felt like something new in my mid early 30's and it's awesome\" - Instruments: Morrison Family Choir, Tri-Area Community Choir, Royal Ensemble - Years playing: Vocals/sing I'm the singer in my one woman band... I write and sing in the studio... and I trust my team with the marketing... with my input of course! :) My vocals & and microphone Yes, as a woman, I feel that at times you're treated as just a pretty face... or not taken as serious and expected to go along with the flow. Not really, just as the times have changed, so has the sound of music... but it all comes back full-circle. Yes, I've been told that God has given me a gift and that that gift is suppose to shared with the world. My advice to other women musicians is to make sure that you are passionate about what you're doing and that regardless of the fame or fortune, or the lack thereof, be confident in fulfilling your God-given purpose in life. God blessed me with it! :) - Instruments: ... lol! this is gonna take a bit of time ... - Years playing: voice lead vocalist - and as an \"independent artist\" - I have to wear many hats CEO, head of PR, secretary, chauffeur, ...lol! ... have mic - will travel! lol! oh yes! in general, we still live in an age that can be sexist/gender biased. have I had challenging/negative experiences? yes of course, who hasn't? but at the end of the day, it's a privilege and a gift to be a musician! and I find that focusing on the joy/magic of my job eases tensions that might arise from situations that aren't so fun! yes and no. ... yes we live in a more \"modern\" age. but, women are still faced with sexist challenges and gender biases. sometimes it just feels like we have \"more freedom/rights\" to march in the same place. \"oh yes!!! :) what a blessing to get advice from folks who have been in it for awhile! Here's my humble advice: :) 1) ALWAYS be on time and prepared. ... never give anyone a reason to judge you except for the quality of your work! 2) Remember, at the end of the day - this is a job/business. There will be times that are challenging. Don't involve yourself with gossip and negative activity. ... \"\"Smile and get your paycheck\"\" 3) Follow your heart and you'll always make the best choice for yourself! .... sending love and support! ~Alisa :) xox\" ... there's nothing more joyful, and so completely fulfilling than feeling your voice resonate with a beautiful melody. - how cool is that .... and earn a living doing it? :) - Instruments: just my own - Years playing: vocals, autoharp, marxophone I write, produce, and sing all of my songs. I have an incredible band that creates the sound I hear in my head. As far as business decisions, I do it all myself. Upright Steinway piano from the 1800's. Autoharp from the 1940's. Marxophone from the 1920's. Kay Kraft guitar from the 1930's. I am grateful to the strong, talented and inspiring women before me that have given my generation a level playing field. I think man or woman there are the same struggles, highs and lows. The male musicians in my life go through the same exact things I do. At the end of the day, everyone has to work hard What is happening in the world will always affect our work as artists. Stories will always be changing but themes will forever be the same. That's the magic of music to me. I can hear music that was made seventy years before I was alive and still feel and understand what was being communicated. It still carries the same message and power in the present time as it did when it was first created. It all come down to making the kind of music you want to make. Create the music that makes your heart beat, that plays in your dreams. I always tell myself that my music may not be for everyone, but that's OK. You can't make everyone happy. Any instrument that completely haunts me I am drawn to. I love unique sounds that you don't hear everyday which is why I started to play the autoharp. It evokes so much to me and I just adore it. I love the marxophone for the same reasons. It's just so strange and beautiful. - Instruments: Regularly and most notably: Fetus Farm, Daisy's Compact Mice, Baby Guts - Years playing: Guitar, vocals, bass guitar I write the songs in Cadette and co-write them in Kitten Forever. All decisions in both bands are discussed and decided between all the members. I generally don't invest a ton of money into nice equipment and a lot of gear I use is shared among friends in other bands. In Cadette I have a Palamino tube amp and a sparkly black Squire Stratocaster guitar. In Kitten Forever I use whatever bass guitar and amp is lying around the basement, along with a Boss Overdrive/Distortion guitar pedal. \"God, sometimes it feels like there are a million things. Major publications still focus more on what a woman is wearing than the music she is creating. Women are still questioned about songwriting credits on their own albums. Bands with all female members are labeled as a \"\"shtick.\"\" I have, unfortunately, been \"\"reminded\"\" on multiple occasions that I would at some point need to \"\"choose\"\" between 1. being a woman musician who focuses on music and ignores the fact that she is indeed female, and 2. being a woman musician who embraces the uniqueness (or not) of being a girl in a band. These are choices that (with perhaps the exception of trans musicians) male musicians do not have to think about. The former may ostracize you from other female musicians, even to be deemed a \"\"traitor,\"\" while the latter may cause you to be pigeon-holed into one of the many stereotypes of being a woman in music (angry chick rocker, etc.). I mean, the fact that the question of differences in gender still exists just proves it itself. \" I do think it's probably a lot easier now to be a girl in a band than in the past. There are still flaws and backlashes but you do see a lot more acceptance of females playing guitar than you did even back in the 90's; if you look at what Kathleen Hanna and all those girls dealt with during riot grrrl, I can't even imagine a world like that. They had beer glasses thrown at them, were called sluts and whores, had their clothes torn. Now we have rock camps for girls, more female-centered punk festivals. In Minneapolis, it feels like there are more girls in bands than I have ever experienced here, and the college radio station recently started a specialty show called \"Girl Germs\" where they have female musicians in-studio performances and interviews, and play music from female artists of various genres. \"The best advice I've gotten was in the form of a (literal) slap in the face. The first time I ever recorded vocals separately from the music tracks, I was so afraid of my own voice that I was working myself into a real bad place; I had tons of anxiety about it and couldn't do it. A friend (Corrie Harrigan, now the drummer in Kitten Forever) grabbed me by the shoulders and gave me a pretty serious smack- no words were said but I instantly got it- chill out, you have this power in you, this is something you know you can do and do well. Don't question it, seize this, it's yours. Advice I would give- Don't be afraid to bust it out as hard and real as you can. Be passionate and sincere about what you are creating. Don't hold yourself to a lower standard because it's what's expected. Support other female musicians; don't play into that \"\"girl versus girl\"\"/ingrained hostility/jealousy garbage. Love yourself first and always, duh. \" I was mad at the boys at school that thought they were hot shit because they could play a Green Day song. I am the band leader and make all the business and marketing decisions. Usually I use a Shure Beta microphone and a AER acoustic guitar amp to amplify my vocals. There is an assumption that if you're a female vocalist, you have no idea what you're talking about when discussing music. The first time this became clear was when I was asked to sing a song at a friend's party. I went to the band leader, told him what song I was going to sing and what key to play it in. He refused to believe that the key I had chosen was correct. He kept insisting that other keys would work better. I finally convinced him to play it in the key I had requested. I studied classical piano and the cello while growing up and have studied jazz piano and theory as an adult. One thing I know is how to select the right keys for myself! I'm not sure a lot has changed for vocalists. However, I think female instrumentalists (at least in the jazz field) are more readily accepted than they were a generation ago. One of my mentors is Sheila Jordan. She has always been incredibly generous with all of her students. I've tried to follow her example and be as helpful as possible to other singers. It's a much more pleasant way to navigate the music world. I've loved singing since I was a child. - Instruments: 4 serious ones,two cover bands - Years playing: Bass/Vocals I play bass and sing in Grass Widow. Grass widow has a triangularly equal way of doing everything, from song-writing to business. We collaborate on songs, each writing parts and all singing. We have band meetings where we make decisions together. We don't have a band leader. It's a very empowering project and it takes a lot of work. I play a shitty Ibanez Bass that is the only Bass I have ever owned. I've been wanting to upgrade for the past 7 years. I play an Ampeg combo amp that I love, which I bought for $80 at a flea market 6 years ago. Being a female musician means that when people describe us-they often call us a girl band, or identify us as that before recognizing anything else about us. That can be very frustrating since we spend so much time conceptually and musically making challenging music. It's a bit reductive and insulting when gender is the first thing people comment on. It's unfortunate that a lot of women feel that they need to assume men's roles to feel empowered about what they are doing. I would like to think that we as women can help foster new positive female identities that don't rely on dusty gender stereotypes. We are very focused on a non rock star approach to our performance and general attitude in the way we put ourselves out there in the world, putting the emphasis on song writing. I don't think there was really a defining moment when all this became clear to me. Anything we ever do is being done within a patriarchal context,using a patriarchal language to create context-so in that sense i feel that we as a band of female musicians we have an opportunity to create a new context for experiencing and discussing music. In terms of being a female performer,specifically- I feel that we are constantly confronting the way that people use our image-discuss it. We spend a lot more time working on songs than we do working on our appearance, and it does bother me when people objectify us in the spirit of centuries of patriarchy. This is not to say that performing in front of an audience isn't part of what we do and I feel aware of how our image as three young women plays into that. Women shouldn't have to hide their confidence and celebration of themselves because men can't control themselves. That attitude seems to be in the service of men-excluding women from the audience. Well in terms of women performers- it seems that early female punk bands ,riot grrls, had the position of reaction in a feminist context, and at this point- since there are so many female bands- we are functioning in a sort of in a post- feminism context, where we don't really need to complain about how everything is misogynistic, and react- we can instead act in a feminist realm, past a struggle,utilizing a female language and a context for women in bands that is outside of image or representation, and based in talent and integrity. If is weren't for the riot grrl scene paving this path-we wouldn't be in the position we are in now. I'm not saying we don't have tons of shit to be pissed off about, but I am saying that I feel we have the opportunity to decide what context we want to thrive within. We're really glad to be aligned with the woman run Kill Rock Stars, and their dedication to politically consciousness. I had very few role models to tell you the truth. My advice to a woman starting out would be to find friends who have a similar belief system as you and just play! Ability has very little to do with being in a band. Everyone gets good at their instruments by playing with other people. Most of what being in a band is functioning on pure belief and genuine love for what you are making,outside of any external influence. Also I would say that we as women have the opportunity to represent ourselves with artistic dignity and manufacture personal confidence not in relation to our appearance. We have the opportunity to thrive in our community first as musicians, then as women. Well In my first band-The Insides -I was the only girl. I didn't play any instruments, besides Moog on some songs. I mostly just sang and jumped around a lot. I really didn't feel very empowered to play any instruments. Then years later I moved back to SF from the east coast and met up with Frankie Rose. She and I were in a similar place of jadedness and depression and decided to start a band,although neither one of us could play any instruments. We convinced our friend Wu, who knew how to play guitar- to jam with us. We really had no pre-conceived notions. The three of us got together and I decided, pretty arbitrarily, to play the bass. It just kind of stuck. - Instruments: 2: Melting Hopefuls & currently in Elk City - Years playing: Vocals, piano, keys, fender rhodes piano bass, drums (drums, not played well!) I'm the main song writer. I also work closely with Ray Ketchem, Elk City's drummer and producer, on song production and mixes. Band decisions are usually democratic. An upright piano, an old Casio keyboard from the 80s, a Fender Rhodes piano bass (that used to belong to Tom Verlaine of the amazing band, Television) and boxes of broken analog tape recorders that I keep replacing due to too much songwriting!(I've tried to get into digital recording - I even purchased an M-Box and Protools, but can't get into it.) I love writing onto tape recorders that much. \"My initial response is to say somewhat. I say somewhat because after being in bands for 20 years it's still about \"\"Dudedom\"\". It's my experience that men in bands still communicate with the silent-secret handshake. For example, Ray and the other guys in Elk City can talk for hours (amongst themselves and with other guys in bands) about recording and engineering.-How am I supposed to chime in?-\"\"Hey, I've got a box of broken tape recorders and I just got the most awesome new lipstick!?!\"\"....But there's more to it: The way men and women are communicated with by people in the music industry still differs: We were at South by Southwest in March and had to meet some industry people working with our label, Friendly Fire. We were hanging out at a bar in Austin, TX and this guy (who shall remain nameless) is talking to Ray and I, but offers Ray a handshake and offers Ray his card and I'm there holding my purse thinking...um, I write all the songs. Ok, I'm sure many women in music would disagree with me, but it's my experience that men in bands are still thought of as the decision makers.\" Many, but my first thought is that now a woman has to be good looking and talented, not just talented. Could Janis Joplin or Mama Cass have been successful today? I think not, which is sad, because they're still two of my favorite female musicians. C'mon people. No one ever gave me valuable advice about making music. I had to learn the valuable lesson that you make music because you love it, and if you don't love it, don't do it, because it's the making of music (which, to me is always the purest part being in a band) that will always bring you back to, well, making music. Vocals chose me. It just seemed like the thing to do - to sing. I never took voice lessons. I feel like a better version of myself when I sing. As for piano and keys, I play them as a means to write songs, I'm not really a good player. I'd like to think of myself as an audio painter. I don't want to know the technicalities of how the paint is made, I just want to paint. - Instruments: 2 - Les Saucy Pants and Lick Lick - Years playing: vox and boobs We all work hard at other things - jobs and other bands or theater. We do it to have fun. I guess I'm the band sister. Here to support and be protected and provide a different POV. We collaborate on everything in the studio, but I front the money for big projects. We don't do a lot of marketing. I book many of the gigs we play, but that's not too hard here in Austin. I have a Shure Beta 58 mic, and a cord, and boobs. Yes. I tend to get more attention than my male band mates, whether I deserve it or not. I feel coddled and rarefied by my band mates, but I also feel alone and bored sometimes. The gender ratio is skewed, especially in the louder rock scene. There are few women left to talk to by the end of the night. I see that there are lots more women in bands than ever before. Maybe that means they are more courageous? Randy Biscuit Turner always ended his shows by saying, \"Now go form your own band!\" You need to make sure it's fun, whatever you do. Because my band mates were willing to back me up. - Instruments: One, called \"Marzuki\" - Years playing: Vocals, guitar I'm a solo artist, so although I invite and respect the opinions of my band, I make all the final decisions. I also make the decisions in the studio, since I haven't worked with a producer in years. I steer clear of controlling personalities in general. Same is true with business and marketing: my friends at Asthmatic Kitty Records give me a lot of freedom to direct the way things go. I play an Edwinson guitar, handmade in Seattle from local trees. And I have a voice. My band consists of a guitar/banjo player, a pianist and a bassist, plus drums when I can afford them. Male musicians tend to get a lot more attention: more press, and more validation. Female musicians can get ahead much faster if they are willing to assume the image of a sex-starved teenager on crack. I was recently flipping through a Rolling Stone magazine featuring the cover story \"The New Girl Power: Women Take Over The Pop Charts\". I kept looking and looking for that article, and was amused that all I was finding were articles about men, peppered with the occasional chick. The Girl Power article was exactly one page long. There was a lot of cleavage on that page. One huge difference I see is that SEX was not nearly the selling point it is today. The famous female singer/songwriters of the 50s, 60s and 70s did not stalk around half-dressed and half-crazed. I think back to Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Judy Collins, Joan Baez... Although they probably fought hard for their chance on the stage, once they got there they kept their clothes on. They weren't expected to be sex objects: they were expected to sing. I've gotten plenty of advice, mostly bad. All of the bad advice I've received can be summed up in the statement, \"You must kill your own soul to achieve success.\" The good advice has come from my own gut. I refuse to kill my soul, to harm myself, to harm my child or my marriage, to achieve success. I refuse to quit everything else that gives me hope and enjoyment. Music is a part of my life because it's a part of me, but it's not the only part of me. I do it for the joy of it, and if success comes from that, I will be glad about it. If not, I'm free to continue making music or try something new. To a woman musician starting out, I would say: Make sure you're taking voice lessons from someone good, and singing every day. Work hard to stay in tune. Practice your instrument at least a half hour a day (this will sound lazy to some). Warm up before shows!!! Learn to be a savvy businesswoman as well as an accomplished artist. And don't harm yourself for success. See yourself as a whole person. Do music not because you need validation from \"The Industry\", but because you love it. I started out playing piano as a kid, and I complained a lot about it. So my Dad promised me that if I persevered for a few more months with the piano, he would buy me a guitar. He did buy me a student-sized guitar, and it just seemed the perfect thing to accompany my songs. It was portable, all-purpose, and lovely on its own. No wonder so many people play it. - Instruments: 3, Lindsay Wells - Years playing: Vocalist \"Vocalist/Songwriter/Band leader Vocalist/Co-producer Business Owner\" Microphone, and rockin' stand! Yes. I have encountered situations where the focus was more on my looks rather than my ability. There have been several moments, and I still encounter it. Yes. You've seen more women take control of their careers. Yes. I would not be where I am if it weren't for the advice given to me. Some advice I would give is to find someone you can trust to help you get organized because there is a lot of work involved and organization is key. Also, find our who you are as an Artist, what your voice is, and how it is different from anyone else's. Never stop trying!!! At age 4, the church choir director noticed my voice, and gave me my first solo singin' at church. - Instruments: Many in many different towns. The list would very long. I have at least two bands that are 'mine' and then I play with so many people in their bands. - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, types of violins I'm writer, arranger, band leader, performer, the producer or the co-producer. I decide who I am going to do business with, whether its a lawyer, a manager, a drummer, or a label. I leave marketing decisions to people who know the market, and I make all my own artistic decisions. I generally play instruments that are about 50 years old. I have 3 amps, 2 usable acoustic guitars I mostly use to write on, a sparkly gold electric guitar I never play, 2 great guitars (each other's back-up) that I play on stage. That's the flat-black (pre-Gibson) Epiphone from 1948, restored by Keith Cary, and the Guild with the P-90 pickups from the early 50's, which is a truly sweet guitar. I have a Krakauer piano from the 1940s, ebony--shining gorgeous thing, needs new bass strings which is an expensive job. I have an erhu from China with a (farmed) pythonskin drumhead. I have a violin made in one day on a dare by my friend who had never made a violin, Stefan Jecusco. He makes really magical instruments. I have a museum quality Stroviol from 1905, made by Stroh, my 'nicest' instrument. It sounds like a crazy dream. I have a sweet old Cohn cornet I can barely play. I have a banjo I hardly play. I have a cute old autoharp, and god knows how many other instruments. I loaned out a pack of ukuleles that may never come home to roost. I never got any encouragement or support from my family. I just got some occasional shreds of support from older musicians and strangers. I've seen young male musicians get a lot of support from strangers and their parents. But I've also heard a lot of male musicians talking about pressure from their families to leave music behind and go into fields where there is more sure money. Women are less expected to make money in any area, so there is less family pressure to 'get serious' about making money, and burying their musical aspirations. I don't know--people are all so specific--and I haven't worked with enough older female musicians to be able to make any sort of general comment. I sang with a big band a few nights ago, with a great female saxophonist, who's maybe old enough to be a young aunt of mine. All I can say is, she's great, and super friendly, like all the guys in the band. I've worked with Mary Margaret O'Hara and Lucinda Williams, both great singers of the previous generation. But I can't generalize a thing about them versus women musicians my age. \"Nobody's ever given me any good advice--I've mostly just watched people make egregious mistakes, and then I've tried to avoid them. I don't give advice in a general way. Advice is so specific to each person, and I only give advice if asked specifically. This is about as general as I can get--I'd say get a good copy of the I-Ching and learn how to use it, also, always do your best to surround yourself with people you can trust. \" I play a lot of stringed instruments, and the piano. I basically started to play instruments that were available, anything I could get my hands on when I was younger. It didn't really seem like a choice at the time. I was just reaching for tools, and found these. - Instruments: Bunches, including Angels of Epistemology, Dish, Shark Quest, Dem Chocklodytes, Shark Quest, Regina Hexaphone, backup musician for Tres Chicas, Jeffrey Dean Foster and the Birds of Prey, Lud, Dana & Karen Kletter, Anders Parker... - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, banjo, mandolin, bass I play with so many different bands so I have probably taken on every possible role at various times. With Regina Hexaphone I sing and write the songs, so I tend to have the last word in that band. Our drummer has a recording studio and we usually produce our records together. I have been the business manager for several of the bands I play in, doing payroll, taxes, etc. I'm terrible at marketing and promotion so I usually let someone else take over those tasks. I have a Yamaha studio upright piano and a Wurlitzer electric piano at home, but use a Nord Electro for playing out. I usually play a Fender Jazzmaster but sometimes use a Gretsch Rock Jet for electric guitars, and have a Gibson J-45 acoustic that sounds great but is fragile so for shows I play an old Takamine that has a bridge pickup. For electric guitar I have a pretty simple rig: Boss Overdrive Pedal, Rat Fuzz Pedal, and a Danelectro Digital Delay through a Fender Princeton amp. My bass is a Gibson EB-2, and I am looking for an Acoustic B200 bass head to replace one that was lost... I have a Deering 5-string banjo, a mandolin custom made in the mountains of North Carolina by Paul Graybeal to emulate a Gibson F-5, and and a tenor banjo from probably the 1920s of unknown provenance! The acoustic instruments all have Sunrise pickups, and sometimes I play them through a Fender Twin Reverb amplifer. When I was younger, in the mid-eighties, the chasm was fairly vast, but it seems that it has closed up quite a bit over the years, though young women who play today do report some of the same kinds of challenges. The most obvious difference is that there continues to be a disproportionate number of men who play music compared to women. I think some of the differences that fall under an emotional category can be attributed to gendered socialized behaviors--like being intimidated in music stores (where in lots of places men still treat you as if you are waiting for your boyfriend than as a customer, especially if you are young). I don't see it as often as I used to, but the music business, especially as you lean toward the harder end of the spectrum, has a very old-boy code of ethics and behaviors that are (or were) very sexist. This kind of thing causes women, especially if they are not incredibly confident to begin with, to retreat from asserting their opinions in the studio and in business environments where they should feel free to have an equal voice. HOWEVER, I must say that in my personal experience I had nothing but encouragement and support from the male musicians who befriended me and played in bands with me. This was in the post-punk underground music scene of Raleigh and Chapel Hill so it was a pretty progressive atmosphere to grow up in. I had a lot of confidence issues (or lack of) when I was younger that severely affected how much I asserted myself in the business world of music. That's not something you can attribute to women in general, of course, but it was certainly affected by growing up in the atmosphere of second wave feminism in America. Absolutely. I love seeing young women songwriters and musicians today being tough and vulnerable in equal measure, being more emotionally honest and feminine and less likely to feel the need to adopt masculine postures to prove they can play on equal footing with the boys. There didn't seem to be so many choices in the eighties--you were either a super-feminine front person or an androgynous tough chick or a sensitive folkie. There are always exceptions of course, but it seems to me that everything exploded in the early '90s with Riot Grrls and Ani Di Franco and the Breeders and other popular and underground bands who came out of the 80s music scenes kind of shattering those old images and demanding more freedom for women playing now. Lots of people. Make sure you own your own songs. Educate yourself about your gear and about the business. Educate yourself about the history of the music you love and follow its trails. Always be true to yourself, your own voice is the best one there is, and if you listen to your heart and translate it into music everyone else will want to listen too. My mom played the piano and so it was the first instrument I learned to play. She became interested in learning tenor banjo when I was about five years old, so I started to pluck around on that when I was a teenager and listening to a lot of Irish music, and I loved old-time American music and got a 5-string banjo and a mandolin when I was about 18. I wanted to learn to play guitar when I was 11 or 12, so my mom's boyfriend helped me pick out the Takamine that I still play at a pawn shop. - Instruments: my jazz group, the Chill Factor, Broken Reed Sax Quartet, Denis Leary Rescue Me Comedy Tour (2009 and 2010) Easy Star All-Stars, Hair band on Broadway show - Years playing: soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxes, flute, piccolo, clarinet, penny whistle,some piano I compose, perform, improvise, and do arranging. I book some of my own gigs. I did spend some money on publicizing my last CD, the Chill Factor. Selmer Mark VI, Yamaha, and Yanagasawa saxophones, Miramatsu flute, Haynes piccolo, Buffet clarinet, custom-made mouthpieces by Francois Louis. Not musically, just business-wise. At first, it was harder to get gigs because of the net-working issues; guys tended to call each other for the best recording work and insider gigs. Later in my career I was able to establish my reputation as a good horn player and started getting the calls. Now I feel there is a bit of age discrimination creeping in--e.g. I almost lost a big-paying tour this year because they wanted younger \"girls\" in the horn section (the guys in the band are all in their 50's). Yes--the original vanguard was the group of jazz women instrumentalists from the 1940's and 50's. They had a tough time making careers out of jazz. Later generations owe them a big debt. My college experience in 1978 was also not fun--the men in the jazz dept. were definately discriminating against us. Now I have friends in their 20's who seem to feel that it is an even playing field in college and in gigs. I had much valuable advice from my saxophone teachers (all men) who mentored me. Find a good mentor when you are just learning how to play, and follow their advice. When I was 9, I chose the flute because it was shiny. When I was 16, I learned the tenor sax to join the pep band, and jazz band in high school. - Years playing: guitar, vocals, national slide, mandolin leader, boss lady:) I built my acoustic guitar with luthier Don Musser and I play a National Estralita resonator guitar. \"Absolutely. Mostly you're not taken seriously until you blow someone away or are given major kudos by someone famous.. and even then you're still considered second class. For example, most people don't seem to want to believe that I built my guitar.\" Yes. Equality is becoming more real in everyway not just professionally. Iris Dement told me years ago that the only way to go is your own way. To be yourself and that way you can't have any regrets. Because I made it and it's amazing. - Instruments: multiple chamber groups - Years playing: piano. organ Self-employed / free-lance no gear Yes, when I was in graduate school, I was clearly treated differently than the men. For example, one of my piano professors asked if I needed help with birth control. (I was pregnant at the time, maintaining a 4.0 average and giving concerts) No. Be aggressive and promote yourself. Do not allow anyone to belittle or intimidate you. I love piano. - Instruments: Many! The Elgin Symphony, the Chicago Sinfonietta, the Joffrey Ballet Orchestra, ESQ, the Lyra String Quartet, and several more - Years playing: violin Being self-employed, I am solely responsible for marketing my business. With regards to the orchestras I play in, these organizations have marketing departments so I am not really involved in decisions for those groups. I currently own two violins, the one I mainly use and a back-up. I also own three violin bows, again one I mainly use and a backup plus an extra. I own a few violin cases and a bow case, as well as several music stands, stand lights, and various other paraphanalia. My music cabinet, like most other classical musicians, is pretty full... :) Yes, I think being a woman in this industry has not always been easy. I clearly remember one occasion when a male colleague tried to convince an orchestra to hire himself instead of me, telling the management that they should \"hire a real man for the job.\" I also feel I am not as respected in some academic circles as a male teacher would be. When I was growing up, my (male) teacher clearly expected more from his male students, and to this day he is always a little surprised when I remind him that I make my living as a musician (i.e. I have a career in addition to being a wife). I see some subtle differences, but those may be attributed to the attitudes of others, not the women themselves. My mother was a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra for three seasons before resigning to move back north, get married and start a family. I'm not sure I (and my female colleagues) would make that same choice. The best advice I've gotten is to learn your music ahead of time, show up early, be responsible and reliable, be pleasant to work with, and try not to be too high-maintenance. This is, of course, in addition to the most important piece of advice: Practice! This is what I tell all my students, regardless of gender. My parents are both musicians, so I was exposed to instrumental music from an early age. My mother is a cellist and I suppose I saw her carrying around that big, heavy instrument and decided I would play something that was easier to carry! - Instruments: Jesters of Jive, Joe Battaglia and the New York Big Band, High Society Rhythm - Years playing: vocals/leader I'm the leader so most all of the business and marketing fall to me I own a Makie 16 channel mixer, and full PA Yes, there are a lot fewer female leaders No \"If you are the type of personality that needs security like to make plans for the future than this is not the business for you. But If you thrive on the adventure of not knowing what is around the next corner than go for it. Just know what you need to be happy and understand the reality of the business and its built in ups and downs.\" - Instruments: I perform under my own name - Years playing: piano, vocals I have my own trio so since I hold down two instruments I really have the freedom to do whatever material I want in any way I want. That's really freeing, since I've done and continue to do a lot of gigs (mostly singles) where the type of material I do is dictated by the venue, e.g. hotels and restaurants. Casio Privia 88 key keyboard, Alesis Nano Piano module, Yamaha Stagepas 300 P.A., Shure SM58 mic It used to be. When I was young the message I got was that women musicians (other than vocalists) were a novelty, and not always a welcome one, that jazz was a language spoken among men and that women were outsiders. In the last 20 years or so solid women jazz musicians have become more visible and attitudes have changed for the better. My mother sang and played piano and wrote tunes which she performed. My parents were both jazz musicians, so growing up I heard a lot of good piano players (both live and recorded) in my house. - Instruments: Several when I was a teenager, but billed as Brigitte London for 15 years. - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar At this point, I have moved into producing my own records and records for others, but it took me a long time to understand the studio process and not be intimidated. After several managers/agents/deals/etc., this is the only way I can do it now. I would be open to a producer who was willing to work with me (i've had several great ones in the past including Richie Albright (waylon jennings) who has done so, but lately its evolved to doing it myself. I make all the decisions now. In the past, I put it in someone else's hands (even 'well known' people) who I thought I could trust, but I learned that even though its a million times more work it is best to handle things myself. If things go wrong, I have myself to blame and can learn from it. There is a fine line between being open to grow musically, and not letting someone conform you to their idea of what you should be. Martin D28, Fender Acoustic Amp, Tele, Shure 58 mic and whatever else I may need. Absolutely. I always felt it, but during the recording process of my second album, i grew up fast, and realized that you have to almost shout for the respect. And it is a boys club still to this day, but it is not as bad as it once was. the hard part is having all men work for you, you have to be very careful in how you deal with them because most of them resent it (talking about the sidemen here). Other Male artists, though, can be wonderful, and respect what you go through (because they know how hard it is) for the most part are very supportive and respectful. Booking is also a tricky thing. I actually brought in a Male agent to help book this year, as being a man he gets in doors quicker. I hate this fact and would rather not say its true, but it is and due to economic situations this year, I need the bookings, and am grateful for his contributions. A lot of the younger women in country music seem to feel they need to use their sexuality more than ever, first before talent, and that makes me sad because hey- its great to be sexy - but show your talent FIRST, use that as your platform, not your ass. The visual commercialism has been bred into them by VIDEOS and the media. I mentor a lot of young artists, and they feel frightened they aren't attractive enough. (I am considered OLD in this business at 40 LOL). But I love performing with women of all ages. Have always done \"Women Songwriting Shows.\" for years. Supporting each other is SO necessary. And some of the young talent just makes me proud. All those women who came before us who opened the doors...Bonnie Raitt, Chrissy Hynde, Loretta Lynn, Heart, Joni Mitchell, etc..... so much is owed to them. \"The best advice I ever got was from my sister, who told me to stick to my guns. The things I tell my female pickin' friends --- KNOW WHO YOU ARE. ALL THE WAY THROUGH. What your values are. Be Authentic. And get behind yourself before you let anyone else get behind you. Trust your gut over your head, keep out the shoulds and go with what feels best for you. and just Create. that is what matters! . of course, my advice may not get you the most money - or any money for that matter, keep that in mind ;) But its best for avoiding feeling used, powerless, and creatively bereft... Thanks for being interested in the women's journey in music. Sincerely, Brigitte\" I fell in love with the guitar as a child, starting taking classical lessons at age 6 but switched to writing songs and playing \"chords\" ( a definite no-no to my classical teacher) at age 11. I also play piano but only for writing and bass only if needed for something. - Instruments: was in a cappella group in high school; choir in college. bands: sang with friends, \"The Jupiters,\" in college, afterwards founded the Popsicles with four other ladies. We were a band for about a year; Kate and I have been performing at Gracious Calamity ever since. Have also been add-on to Manners and Peace, Loving - Years playing: ukulele and vocals Kate and I have an equal partnership. The general rule is, whomever cares more about a decision makes that decision. Usually we agree. Gracious Calamity = uke + guitar +vox. Sometimes other things. Yes. I have a lot to say about gender. Contact me directly for fully ramblings and/or small soundbites. Hard to say. Everyone's doing something different. Do It Yourself. So portable! - Instruments: Indepently team up with about 3-4 musicians. Nothing permant - Years playing: Vocals/guitar Independent singer/songwriter. I Like to collaborate, but found little success with bands or formal groups. Generally, past associations always reached a point of struggle for power and the direction the of the band. Because I my musical skills (reading, writing, etc.) were weak (although I have a great ear & very resourceful), I had less impact on group decisions. My first cd was not up to my expectation because I left the interpretation of my original songs in the hands of the musicians. They were wonderful, but heard their own interpretation of my music rather than what I had in mind. I took creative control of the second cd and turned out a better product. I have not taken on the business of marketing yet because I don't have the product I'm truly satisfied with yet. Guitar/amp/microphones. Also have a Boss digital recorder & professional mics Regarding jazz performances: In the past, men in my area worried more about women dominating the presentation - the issue of voice preference over musicianship. Particularly in jazz singing. I was literally told that featuring a vocalist meant that all the attention would go to the singer - not the band. Therefore, when I performed, I would make sure the band opened and closed each set with an instrumental. However, it only bought me so much mileage. Because I wasn't accomplished in reading & writing music, I was seldom invited to participate in gigs. When locals performed with me, it was because I as an independent artist, invited them to do so - well paid private engagements. Regarding the acoustic/folk world: No such barrier exists. I'm invited to participate in harmonious singing; I can't keep up with the offers! There is no obvious male/female divide; folks are generous with time and energy and creativity. I see young women today as being more proficient with musical technique and training. I don't see the hesitancy and insecurity that women my age had. In regard to insecurity, in this area, accomplished and recognized jazz singers still worry about competition. This, I believe, is totally unnecessary. Build a strong sense of self; don't personalize discouragement. Learn to recognize and distinguish between a 'put down' and 'critical' feedback. Learn about the business first (internet, reading, etc.), have the motivation for improving skills, and know the audience you want to reach. It's portable and I love the sound. I'm a moderate player who used guitar to primarily create songs. Taking my playing more seriously now and learning more. - Instruments: There aren't any regulars, every time I do a gig I meet new people thats what I love about it. Everytime you meet someone new you don't believe there will be any more people out there trying to achieve the same as you. There are so many people with big dreams! - Years playing: Vocals In the studio when I co write my role is the lyric side of things. I used to sing songs where people had written the lyrics and I was singing about things that had no relevance in my life or that a 17 year old girl couldn't relate to. I like to give ideas on what the song should be about, and also there are things that a 40 year old man would say but that I really wouldn't! It's cool to keep the cheese factor down! I also help with a few melodies but lyrics is the main thing. I think it is hard for both. Being a woman I know that if you have blonde hair and some one else out there has blonde hair then you get compared and it is so about a certain look. Whether a man gets these problems I don't know? What I do think is that there are so many more women performers out there that all wanna do the same thing, along my journey I haven't seen as many male performers. Obviously different musical styles, but I would say that there are far more around these days. Loads of people ask me for advice in starting out and and getting into the music industry, but the truth is I don't know what to say because I just fell into it, and I don't think that what happened to me is very normal! I wanted to record some tracks and the person I met happened to be up and coming and we wrote together and everything just went from there. But what I would say is take every opportunity that there is to perform and seize it because you never know who is watching. - Instruments: Always performed as \"Catie Curtis\" - Years playing: Guitar and Vocals I have always worked collaboratively with my manager, Tim Bernett, to make business decisions. Recently, I've created an Advisory Team, made up of 6 women and 2 men, who are CEOs and visionary thinkers, to help me succeed in the new frontier of artist promotion. This time feels very exciting, fresh, and ripe with opportunity. \"I play a Martin 000-28 guitar, and a Gibson LG2 (1947) I use Boss tuning pedals, I use Elixir Strings. I have a home-made foot stomping board with a Fishman pick-up in it for creating a kick-drum sound while playing solo. \" \"Most men say they learned to play guitar to attract the opposite sex. I personally learned to play in order to avoid the opposite sex. Early on, men like to show what they can do, whereas women want to show who they are. Women always have to prove themselves. The first time I realized it was going in to a music store to buy a wah wah pedal. The sales guy asked if it was for my boyfriend. \" \"There's so many more of us now. You can't really generalize about women in music anymore because there's so much diversity. Women (and men) no longer need to be \"\"chosen\"\" by labels, by the industry. We make our own paths now, using the internet and social media. That gives us the latitude to really be ourselves. \" \"My fans give me advice. I talk to them every night after the shows, while signing CDs. From the beginning, they have always been clear: stay true to yourself, don't let the business make you over. Now my advice to emerging artists is this: find a way to make your career meaningful. Connect with groups of people who resonate with you philosophically and politically. Play benefit concerts, take a stand, be a leader. \" I was given a guitar as a teenager, by a woman artist/neighbor who said \"you can have this as long as you promise me you learn to play it.\" I have since started an online endowment called Inspire to Aspire (link to photo in Billboard: http://www.catiecurtis.com/index.php?page=press&display=1817&from=) to give guitars away to kids. - Instruments: Self in concert, also with Jitano & The Desert Prophets, Luna Morena and various string quartet ensembles - Years playing: opera singer \"I am not in a band nor do I do studio recordings nor do I deal with business of music. Nor sure if this is relevant but I am often the organizer of the ensembles for various pieces, I find the venues, etc.\" I am an opera singer. \"I don't know what it's like to be a man so I don't really know how to answer this question. But I think that as a (classical) singer it's easier for a woman to express one self in song in this society than a man because men are taught to be interested in other things not dealing with feelings. You always find many women and few male classical singers almost anywhere. Also, it's harder to train tenors because their voices change at puberty and not women's and this is a very delicate type of voice, a more exposed instrument and it's often difficult for a man to want to deal with the training of allowing the voice to crack at first. Just what I have heard men say and what I have heard in practice rooms myself while they perfect their craft.\" Yes. In classical music I think women opera singers had less school training and got more of their knowledge at home and with private teachers. I think now it's sort of a mass comsumtion type of thing of turning out generic material in classical music because it lacks individuality and the attention that one teacher would give a person, now it's multiple students per one teacher and not enough time to perform and get the real experience classical singers need. \"I never had any real support for my craft, probably why I'm working a day job that is non music related. However, I still take my craft very seriously and work hard at getting better and performing any chance I get. Advice for a woman musician starting out, let's say she is young: learn piano and solfeg so that you can sigh reade very well, learn to improvise musically, take dance classes for physical coordination and intergration, learn as many languages as you can but consentrate on German, Italian, French, English and some other romance language like Spanish, Portuguese. Learn now to study an operative role on your own and learn to KNOW when you are ready to seek out a voice techer, a vocal coach, repetituer for help and when you can still do the work yourself to save time, effort and money. Get as many full roles under your belt that are right for your voice type. Lean what you sound like objectively. Always record yourself when you can and listen to it afterwards privately and then after maybe with a teacher or very good friend. Have a network of supporters (singer and non singer friends). Learn now to network with everyone! Keep business cards and always have some of your own with you. Always carry a pen. Last but not least - remember that it's supposed to be FUN for you too! :)\" My grandmother taught me how to sing since I was 3 years old (she was a pianist and singer herself). Always loved the sound of the human voice. - Years playing: guitar/keys/vocals \"It's my band, I'm writer, booker, manager, CEO... all of it. \" \"Acoustic Taylor guitar Les Paul Gibson electric guitar TC Helicon (vocal processor) Nord Electro Fender Blues Jr. some cool pedals (delay, phaser, tremelo and tube screamer) Jamman (used as a playback station for programmed beats)\" For so many years it was a male dominated field, and I feel like there's still some inequalities on the business side of things. But I believe that the internet has equalized lots of factors in the industry. On the promotional side of things, I've seen a definite difference b/w how women and men musicians are treated. A band that I'm in called Dirty Martini is fronted by 3 women. We were coined as a 'girl band' no matter how hard we tried to change that. \"Definitely, I think that the paradigm for women has changed and that includes the music industry as well. There are so many role models of women who run their own show from top to bottom. From Madonna to Imogen Heap... There are more female musicains out there as drummers, bassists, guitarists. I think there's a still long way to go but there's a big difference already. \" \"I would say the same advice to anyone, female or male. Surround yourself with musicians that are better than you. Be sincere and be persistent. \" Grew up on piano, picked up guitar when I started writing back in college. - Instruments: composer of opera, theater, film, and song - Years playing: guitar/piano/composer Self-directed, composer, publisher Pencil and Paper, Sibelius music notation, m-audio midi keyboard, various instruments, garage band Yes. Men get more breaks, preferential treatment and respect, especially from other men, they get more jobs, they get higher pay, they get more recognition, they get the majority of grants and commissions. Somewhat, women are becoming more centered and powerfully female, less having to act and sound like a man to get a job. If there is anything else you can do, do it. If not, work your butt off, hold onto your dreams and find your voice. I must make music to maintain my health and well-being. - Instruments: Crittenden Opera, Redwoods Opera,Washington Music Ensemble, Church choirs, Washing chamber music, - Years playing: singer Artistic director of the Redwoods Opera Workshop and Associate Director of Crittenden Opera. Make all personnel and artistic decisions. No. Music is the one venue in which I believe both male and female are needed equally. The only criteria is excellence. The women musicians in this generation are better trained and more savvy about the business of music. Have a goal, strategy, and work harder than you ever have to make it. Make friends with everyone, because that is where your next job will come from. The love of it. - Instruments: Currently just Jets Overhead - Years playing: Bass & Guitar We all take creative roles in our band as well as have a hand in the business side as we run our own label in Canada. My strength lies in my musical background, having played many different styles of music in the past I can bring a new perspective. \"1978 Rickenbacker 4001 Bass Ampeg SVT classic cab A couple of cool pedals\" As far as making music and being creative no I don't think there is a difference. As far as how you are perceived by press, fans, etc then yes there is. Show business can have it's shallow sides! Whether it's a flattering comment or a criticism due to the fact you're a women both feel a bit unnerving and should probably be ignore. Not really. Obviously the ability for women to have a louder voice and be recognized professionally has greatly improved but I think the women themselves hold the same key qualities that comes out in their music. I think the best advice I have gotten and can give is just be yourself...that will always lead to success. Don't type cast yourself into what people expect, don't do anything you don't feel fits and don't be afraid to go for it. I studied classical guitar because I love the instrument then I fell into playing bass originally due to a lack of bass players. I love the sound and what you can do both rhythmically and tonally with bass. - Instruments: The Whispering Tree and The Random Spike - Years playing: vocals, keyboard \"I am the songwriter along with my partner, Elie. Our music is very much a co-creation but we each have strong ideas and concepts for every song that we work on. In business and marketing decisions it is a 50/50 split with Elie in every way. We have been completely responsible for everything we have created so far and made sure that when we signed our record deal we would remain in control and keep our copyrights and masters. \" Casio px210 keyboard and Ibanez acoustic guitar \"On some level there is a difference. I try not to dwell on that difference because it only makes it more apparent to me. I have always felt that there is a difference in what is expected and what is \"\"acceptable\"\" for male and female musicians, but great things always happen when musicians of either gender disregard those norms and be whatever they want to be. I think the gender roles we are born into create great contrast and many unique points of view - and great songs! \" \" It seems like in mainstream music there has been a shift away from substance and towards image - especially for women. There was a time when major labels would get behind great female artists - regardless of how they looked. But 'mainstream' is pretty irrelevant nowadays anyway. So, while the majors have pretty much bailed on worthwhile female artists, there is now a plethora of women who are making the music they want on their own terms. This has created an abundance and a great variety of female musicians who don't have to compromise their vision in any way. \" Don't compare yourself and your progress in this industry to anyone else's. Instead, celebrate each and every artist who has the courage and conviction to share their music with the world. See every victory of every artist as proof that your dreams are possible. \"Singing was not really a choice so much as something I have always loved to do. Singing is the most intimate and direct way for me to communicate. I feel like while performing a song there are things being communicated on two different levels; one has to do with the words and imagery of the song and the other is completely ineffable and more of a communion with the audience and not beholden to the 'subject' of which I'm singing. I started playing keyboard and guitar in order to help my songwriting. Piano is such a rich and rewarding instrument. Its also such a friendly and inclusive instrument and even without great technical knowledge can be very effective.\" - Years playing: I'm a composer of concert music na Tho this is geared to popular music, I hope you'll consider including writing about ALL genres of music and how women figure in them. I compose computer music using various software and often using source material from everyday sounds and speech). I synthesize sounds at the computer. I compose for acoustic instruments in a chamber music setting and I compose for instruments with computer music. My latest DVD listed above published by Everglade is a compilation with 6 women composers on it entitled Sounding Out. All the composers are lesbians. It's a typical format for classical music to have several composers on one CD or DVD. Sure. There is an established tradition that men just assume is theirs to draw from and react to. Women of my generation had to knock down the doors to get in. We've created some of our own institutions, publications and outlets to get our voices heard. I avoided professors and other musicians who were clearly biased against women. Young classical women composers seem to be more at ease and don't assume their work is not valid though this can vary widely from institution to institution. Get a good support system, know something about other women in music, and know that you'll need as much creativity in the business side of music as in the making of it. I would answer this with the answer -- the computer -- because of its flexibility and range of possibilies. - Instruments: So many! Currently, I play with my own groups, it depends how much money the gig pays for. I have several gigs booked now with theAmy London Quartet. We will be a the Blue Note in NYC on 5/30, I'll be at the Blue Wisp in Cincinnati, Ohio aftr that with a local trio quartet of excellent Cincinnati jazz musicians, then off to Europe for the summer, Italy and France. - Years playing: vocals/piano \"I am the leader of my groups in general, both onstage and in the studio. I have worked many years at my solo jazz career, and with the recent acquisition of the long awaited 'record deal', I now have the support behind me to pursue my career at the level of which I have always dreamed. I make my own business decisions, but now also have the help of the wonderful staff at Motema, headed by Jana Herzen, the hardest working gal in show biz! On the other hand, in the course of my career, I have been a 'sideman' or 'sidewoman', as the case may be, with groups led by other people. I have sung with many big bands, including touring internationally with Larry Elgart in the late 80's as the featured vocalist, and with Charles Aznavour as a back-up singer. I am also an accomplished vocal group singer, which won me the part of the lead singer in the vocal jazz quartet in City of Angels on Broadway, which won 6 Tonys and was nominated for a Grammy. I also was hired as the 5th singer in a recording called 'Ancient Tower' with the Grammy winning New York Voices.\" I travel with a small sound system, a four channel Sunn amp with PeeVee speakers, plus I have used Electro Voice microphones since my senior year in college, 32 years ago. \"As a female vocalist, I am probably in the most expected role for women in the music world. I see many of my friends who are female instrumentalists, and I know that some of their struggles have been different than mine. Trying to make it in a 'man's world,' and jazz is that, is definitely hardest for female instrumentalists. As a jazz educator at the New School BFA program in NYC for more than 25 years, I have seen many female instrumentalist students gain more and more appreciation and respect, and graduate into successful careers. It is definitely more commonplace to see female players now than it was twenty years ago. As a jazz educator, I have been on the warpath for 25 years to conquer the 'chick singer mentality'. When I arrived in NYC as a very young singer, thanks to my piano and choral singing background, my musicianship skills were at a very high level, and I immediately gained respect on the bandstand from my fellow male bandmates, and fellow singers as well. On the same hand, I sometimes observed these same very talented and highly regarded musicians frown upon other female vocalists who didn't have musicianship skills, and treat them with disrespect because of their lack of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. It was at this point that I decided to become a jazz educator, in order to help other singers, both male and female, prepare themselves for lives as respected professionals. I have taught hundreds of singers by now. I am also the mother of two tweenaged girls, 12 and 14 years old. I always wanted to marry and have children and make a home, and this has certainly eaten into my career, for many years, but I don't regret a second of it. It has definitely taken longer for me to achieve some of my goals, such as a record deal, than other people, but I have also lived a balanced life, and all of life's experiences feed into one's art. Now that my children are older and gaining independence, I am enjoying a newfound freedom and a little more time to pursue my career. It has been a long haul, though! My husband is also a jazz musician and educator, renowned jazz guitarist Roni Ben-Hur. The juggling act of two freelance artists trying to both 'make it' and raise a family can sometimes be daunting.\" \"Absolutely! Speaking for myself, my parents were very 1950's/60's, kind of the Jewish version of Mad Men, minus the affairs. My Dad was a businessman, and my Mom was a real character, a talented pianist and actress, but as a role model was that of the happy housewife, who lived to take care of other people, so I have struggled all of my adult life to truly feel like a professional, and at times I tend to hide in my house, cook dinner and decorate a little bit too much! For at least the last ten years of teaching, I see young women raised by Baby Boomer moms, the first results of the feminist movement, who had to struggle and make their way in the business and working world, and created a new role model for their daughters. So many of these young women have no problem with assertiveness or taking care of business. And certainly, they do not place accomodating others as their priority in life as I was raised to do.\" \"Nobody ever really gave me advice, I figured most of my career out on my own, learning through successes and failures. I had a wonderful voice teacher at SU, operatic bass baritone Donald Miller, who warned me about the 'K-mart-ization' of our culture. I have always set my sights artistically at a high level, which can sometimes lead to disappointment, but is the best place that I know of to live one's life as artist. It is the way I am, and I'm happy with that. Please feel free to contact me for more information, I LOVE NPR, I've been listening daily for decades, and regularly contribute to my local station, WNYC. Thank you for so many years of the best information available in the media.\" \"I have played the piano since I was a toddler. I have a picture of myself in diapers at the piano in our home. My Mom played, I was always drawn to it, and I took lessons all throughout my childhood and teen years. I always sang along with the radio, I was weaned on girl groups and Motown. My sister played guitar, and at a very young age (I was 6, she was 12) We were harmonizing together. When I was 12, I heard Laura Nyro for the first time and fell in love with her music. I bought the Laura Nyro songbook in my teen years, and spent many years playing and singing her material. I discovered jazz in high school, through the excellent big band at my high school, and also at local jazz clubs. I studied opera in college, but really wanted to sing jazz. I listened to lots of Ella Fitzgerald at that time, got the gig as the Syracuse University Big Band vocalist for three years, and sang in other bands in college as well. I also studied musical theatre, had a few roles in college, and after graduating from college, played Hodel in Fiddler on the Roof at an Equity dinner theatre for four months, worked in Florida singing at a night club for 6 months, then moved to New York to begin pursuing my dreams in the Big Apple. I found work as a singer immediately, and have worked in a large variety of setting ever since, from church choirs to cantorial work in synagogue to jazz clubs to TV commercials to film scores to Broadway. Sorry, I went off on a tangent! I love to sing, I always have and always will. It is the ultimate expression of freedom and individuality, and when you sing with a group and the music works as a whole, it is an exhilarating experience.\" - Years playing: flute and piccolo I share a sole or large role in the development and decisions of the performing groups. If I am working with any of the ensembles it seems like a group effort and all ideas are welcomed. Powell Boston Conservatory Flute, Jupiter di Medici Piccolo, Finale 2009, Digi ProTools \"So far I feel that it hasn't mattered. I did notice I was mostly the only woman in a room of composers starting from college on, but it doesn't seem to bother anyone. I encountered more problems in gender bias in the corporate world than I have in the music world. I seem to only have success submitting my scores to all women competitions though. I have a hard time getting accepted in non gender based competitions, but so does my husband. It seems incredibly competitive.\" I haven't seen much difference. It seems we're all just trying to get the next and hopefully better gig. The more I meet, the more I realize how similar we are. \"The problem with a fall back is that you will fall back\". For years I tried to support my music habit as a graphic designer, and then I realized I was only a graphic designer because I was too afraid to try and support myself through music. Once I put my music career as my main career I found I was able to support myself and I am alot happier for it. A steady paycheck may be a sane decision but it doesn't always equate happiness. I was fascinated by how the flute produced sound. I originally started on clarinet but kept breaking reeds and was at the mercy of my parents to get me more reeds. The flute was not only appealing but more practical. - Instruments: 2 - the New Drifts, and now solo as Catherine MacLellan - Years playing: vocals, guitar I'm the leader. They are my songs, my records. I make all creative decisions. Marketing and business decisions are made between me and the record label. I play a vintage gibson j45 acoustic guitar. that's about it. \"At times there is no difference. But sometimes is is clear that we aren't regarded with the same respect as men. Often, even though I'm the leader, soundguys and promoters automatically ask my band members (all men) where we want things, how we want things, etc. It makes me feel like they think I have no voice. I've been in this situation countless times, I can't remember the very first time. Also, there is often a pay difference between me and my male peers. And they always ask me first if I'll change my set time or whatever if something unexpected comes up. Perhaps because, as a women, they think I might mind less than the men. It's very strange.\" \"The best advice I've ever been given is just to be myself and to remain myself. Don't let the music business change you. I would pass that on to anyone. For women in particular, I would say learn everything you can about the creative and business sides of music. The more you know, the less people can get away with or push you around. Also, as a band leader it is important to learn the language of music and sound technicians so that you can lead your players and and be the person who directs the soundperson. Then you get what you want, not what others think you want.\" It was the most appealing to me when I was 14 and I learned all my first songs on the guitar. - Instruments: Earplay New Music Ensemble, Sonoma City Opera - Years playing: conductor, ondes martenot Conductor for rehearsals and concerts. My ensemble has a great administrator and we work together with marketing choices. conducting baton, ondes martenot \"Yes. When I was in grad school I enrolled in the master's conducting class and the professor attempted to keep me out. Only 4 students were accepted every year and that year there were 5 of us, 4 men and myself. The professor informed me I was not allowed to take the class because he was under the mistaken impression I had not fulfilled anundergraduate class he cited that was a prerequisite. I found it amusing that with the first class he claimed was a requirements I informed him I had, indeed, not only taken that class but also received highest grades. He then proceeded to cite another class and I had the same response. He then proceeded with another, and so on and so on with the same response. Finally he ran out of core classes to refer to and out of desperation to keep me out, he said his conducting students had to have played in his orchestra for 2 semesters before being considered for the conducting class. I had, in fact, not only played 2 semesters but 4 semesters. Alas, he was forced to admit me. However, none of the 4 men were grilled about any of the same \"\"prerequisites\"\". That year's class consisted of 5 students.\" Yes. Interestingly enough, in the classical world I see the younger generation of women much more inclined to use their sex to advance their careers. A reflection of today's culture which is so visually-driven, perhaps? \"No, but I wish someone had! Practice, persevere, develop a strategic plan and keep growing your skills and artistry.\" My older sister was denied piano lessons as a child in China due to economics and when I was growing up in U.S. our family was a little better off. So she signed me up for piano lessons. - Instruments: 1- \"Captured\" (college band) - Years playing: vocal, guitar \"As I am a solo artist, but often perform my original works with a band. So while I'm always seeking players that bring their own personality and styles to the table, I fill the role of translating the final vision of any particular song or set list. In the studio, it's much the same path. While I prefer to have a producer guide the project, the better that relationship is, the more freedom I have in spending time communicating the vision to the team creating the recordings. By independently releasing my latest record, I'm ultimately responsible for funding the entire project and like to know where ever dollar is going. But there's a lot of work to do, and each role needs to be filled by people I trust, admire and have the skill set required for what I'm asking. In general, I'm very vocal in the larger business picture. Marketing is not my forte, so lean heavily on the experience of others in our team. In the end, the full impact of how being a public artist comes directly out of my flesh, so being attentive to the larger scope of how the entire machine operates is a must for me.\" \"Currently running lean.

Calton Road case custom made for my acoustic, as well as Mono case gig bag that is a champ! Shub capos.\" I've never been a man, so it's hard to say decidedly. :-) But there are significant indicators throughout my career that have always made me aware that I am 'living in a man's world'. Anywhere from subtle comments like when, unfamiliar with my music, the assumption that I'm a woman with an acoustic guitar that I will need a stool to sit on for a quiet night of parlor music...or men who think I'll need help tuning my guitar, or treating me as if I am grossly incompetent in regards to the technical aspects of my job...to the more obvious financial differences to my equivalent male counterparts. I could go on, but it's a little box :) I can certainly say, that I feel the impact of other women musicians who have gone before me. Particularly in terms of women who have supported themselves throughout their live performances while playing guitar. There is rarely a day that goes by that I don't think upon artist's like Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Dolly Parton, Janis Joplin, Madonna to name just a few, that have brought a significant impact in their role as creators and shapers music culture. For me, I would say that as an artist today, it is in the generations before me that allow me, without embarrassment or undue force, to fully embrace the unique experience I have to share my music as a woman. \"Many along the way have offered excellent advice as well as useless, self-serving dribble...it can get overwhelming! There's a big difference between those who think they know something that can help you and those who are passionate about what they've learned. Learn to the discern the difference and you'll have gained some valuable friends indeed....don't forget to trust your gut. If it looks like a duck...\" Initially, it was a rather innocent attempt to learn a stringed instrument. But later it evolved into a physical experience, the resonating wood, the shape, the freedom that guitar gives me to have instant access to a song, wherever I find myself. With a band, without a band, at home alone...My guitar is the wellspring of my musical joy. - Instruments: David and Nicole Binion - Years playing: vocal \"Lead vocal Worship Pastor with my husband at Covenant Church in Dallas, TX\" Travel with my husband, but just recorded my first solo project. Travel with tracks or full band and bgv's Not necessarlly. Women are more respected in the music world more so in other kinds of business Absolutely. Each generation brings it's own style and preference. But basically we are all the same I have had great opportunity, but I believe it's because I have learned to stay true to myself, and try not to become what I thought people were wanting me to be N/A - Instruments: Worked/recorded with jazz great Frank Wess, Ruaaell Renee rosnes, Warren Vache, Howard Alden - Years playing: vocalist Band Leader, Record producer, CEO,CFO, Marketing director, Costume designer,booking agent. Shure SM58 Mike, Audio Technica Artist Elite 3300 Mike \"Absolutely. Being a band leader in the heavily male dominated world of jazz is a challenge every time I'm on the bandstand. I must attempt to be clear, direct and friendly while always being mindful of the tender male artistic ego, under a variety of conditions depending on the venue. (My husband's my drummer..lots of stories there!) Overcoming the stereotype of being a \"\"chic singer\"\" demands that I be even more on top of things than other band members. Since I'm also their employer, there's a balancing act to be fair, even tempered, and still deliver the goods musically to the audience.\" Not sure things have improved all that much.Still a tough business for a woman. \"Pianist Dollar Brand(Abdullah Ibrahim) told me early on that \"\"if you just keep doing what you're doing long enough, sooner or later someone's gonna take notice.\"\" Also the great Abbey Lincoln encouraged me to give the lyric its due and don't worry about scatting. \"\"Why should I try to sound like a horn....the horns are trying to sound like me.\"\" For woman musicians starting out, I would say be as versatile as possible to increase your chances of working, keep a tough skin, and only do it if you can't not do it.\" I feel my voice is a gift I was given. I've worked hard to develop it and learn my craft, but the instrument was given to me. - Years playing: Soprano - Opera I just sing. My husband is my business manager and I have 5 agents aroudn the world as well as a publicist, Amanda Ameer. Yes and no. I think, in my division of music, that the Three Tenors really cemented the male dominance int he operatic world. But now I think that since they are either mostly retired or dead that the dominance is shifting to women a bit more, like with Renee Fleming, Anna Netrebko, etc. But int he conducting world, it is still almost entirely male dominated. Unfortunately, not too much in the operatic world. Men still make more $$ than the women, etc. My old voice teacher once told me that to be a female singer you have to be ther VERY best in your speciality, such as a Verdi Soprano...be ther very best...and it stuck with me. Average is not enough as a woman. My advice to the younger generation would be to find your OWN voice, figurativley and literally. Find what makes you special and stick with it becasue if you hate singing something, the audience will know it and feel it too. Loved singing from an early age and always wanted to sing. Plus, if I can make $$ doing what I love, then it must be right. - Instruments: I used to always play solo (acoustic), but for the past year or two I have been playing with a band. Collectively, we go by Hailey Wojcik and Her Imaginary Friends - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, strumstick, ukulele I am the singer and songwriter... I played most of the instruments on the record, and found other musicians I play with now afterward. As for business/marketing decisions these are all made by me and my manager. I play a Gibson SG (which I love!), through an Ampeg Jet II amp. I only have a few pedals so far (until about a year and a half ago I was all acoustic), but I currently use a Way Huge Swollen Pickle fuzz pedal, a Digitech Whammy pedal, and I am currently trying to master the Boss Loop station well enough to use at live shows. I also sometimes play ukulele (mine is in a sad state right now, after having been partly smashed on tour, I'm guessing by someone's foot or hindquarters. Its intonation is...charming). I also play a strumstick, which is one of the most fun instruments I've ever played. I encourage everyone to try one out. I know a lot of people are tired of hearing about this, but I definitely think it (obviously) needs to be addressed. While I think the situation is getting better, there are still many subtle (and not-so-subtle) reminders of inequity--little comments people make all the time, etc. You don't see many female guitarists or drummers featured in mainstream Guitar and Drum magazines. And growing up in a small town I never even KNEW any girls in rock bands; it was always guys getting up there and playing classic rock covers while their girlfriends took pictures or clapped or something. There is a really amazing book called Cinderella's Big Score about this subject, and namely the issue of women's discrimination even in the \"progressive\" indie scene. Yes, although I must admit I'm pretty insulated in a world of fellow musicians my own age. But I do think girls who are in high school now, seeing people like MIA and St. Vincent and Marnie Stern... it will hopefully have an effect on them. It is less ghettoized now than it was in the Riot Grrrl days. People love to give advice; I'm not sure what has been valuable and what hasn't really, but if I were to advise a woman embarking on a musical career, I would say to try and surround yourself with people who are not going to be too negatively critical at the start...it is really important to be willing to make mistakes and take risks, and not be shot down too early. I think a lot of women are afraid of this (more afraid than men), which is probably also why less girls raise their hands in class when they're not 100% sure of an answer, for instance. Be willing to write some terrible music and play some terrible shows while you're on your way to writing/playing good ones. I played piano before guitar, and I still do, but somehow it never clicked with me the way the guitar does. I find the guitar really lends itself to songwriting for me. Plus, not to state the obvious here, but there is just something really inherently cool about guitars... especially when you watch someone like Jack White or Annie Clark (two of my favorites) play--who wouldn't want to play guitar? - Instruments: I have only performed wit Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band - Years playing: Keyboard, Back-up Vocalist I do not write any of the music we play. I concentrate my efforts on giving Benjamin suggestions for arranging songs, and how to release information about the band. We always have new, creative ways of engaging fans. I use a Frafisa Combo Compact, the same keyboard Ray Manzarek and Richard Wright used. I think being a woman and a musician is wildly different than being a man and a musician. First of all, men dominate the industry. I was at the Deck the Hall Ball here in Seattle several years ago and out of the 5 bands that played (Keane, The Shins, Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, and the Killers) there was not one woman performing. When woman are in bands I think they are judged on very different terms than men (What is she wearing? Is she skinny? Can she play her instrument well?). Second, there is more pressure on woman to be sexually alluring than men. The most famous women pop stars are perfect examples of this (B. Spears, GaGa, Shakira). Men, of course, do have sexual appeal but do not have as much pressure to conform to the culture's idea of masculine sexuality. The best advice I was ever given was from Nick Harmer from Death Cab for Cutie. He told me, \"No matter what happens, just stick together as a band.\" If I ever get frustrated with \"the industry\" or touring or criticism I just remind myself that breaking up would only alleviate a temporary frustration. It will not further our cause in the long run. I play keyboards more out of necessity than a personal passion. I have always wanted to play drums but our drummer is extremely talented and it wouldn't have made sense to compete for the role. - Instruments: probably about 8... the Mammals, Underbelly, Golem, Girls in Trouble, and a bunch more ... - Years playing: vocals, violin, viola, ukulele, guitar I'm the bandleader, and I produced our first record (with some help from the engineer). I head the business and marketing decisions. I wish I had someone to help me. the same violin i've played since i was 15; an array of pedals (loop, octave, delay); Kay acoustic guitars (i have an abiding love for them); an old Martin soprano uke; a few electric guitars (fender bronco, most recently); a red amp a friend built for me; a little vox amp my sister gave me. I can't tell, since I've never been a man. I like to think it's not so different, but I don't know. I do know that the idea of having a kid feels pretty different in terms of the ability to tour. We shall see. Hard to say. I'm glad there's more intellectual and compositional presence of women now - still not enough, but more - as opposed to just vocalists or pop songwriters. \"I guess I'd say to trust your instinct and not sell yourself short. Don't trust record labels. And know that everyone always says what they think you want to hear. It's a weird, speculative business and it's OK, probably imperative, to learn how to do that (estimate on the larger end of the draw you think you'll get, etc.) I heard an interview (on NPR, actually - WNYC) recently about how women are less likely to brag, to promote themselves, to be pushy. Learning to do this has been really crucial for me, even though I still find it kind of painful. But for any artist it's really important, because you are running your own business. And if women are naturally or culturally less inclined to trumpet our talents and abilities, it puts us at a disadvantage - we have to really consciously make sure we promote ourselves and don't be afraid to take up space and go get what you want, to say \"\"I'm what you need, and this is why.\"\" Of course, some women are naturals at being pushy, and to them I tip my hat. I kinda wish I were one of them. \" my mom was watching the phil donahue show when i was 3 and saw a special on suzuki violin! so she brought me down to the local suzuki school, and that was that. i dont think she intended it to be a career....oops. - Instruments: 5 : growler, marvey king, soma for kinder, old man river, sherlock's daughter and solo - Years playing: vocals/guitar/drums/keys/glock I write a lot of songs in the band, we do write as a band as well, however the band mainly started as a solo project, but then once we all started playing together it naturally developed into something resembling a dysfunctional family, where we couldn't live without each other, in the studio we all take an equal role and business decisions as well, we work on a voting system, so being 5 of us, it always sways one way or the other, marketing for our ep was mainly myself and our designer lani, however for album i feel it will be a full band decision i play a gretsch guitar, play a casio keyboard, own a juno 60 but to fragile to lug around for live, have a fender pro junior amp, use a line 6, reverb, pog 2, rich blues drive guitar pedal. \"I do think it's different being a woman in music. It is mainly a boy driven industry, I see a lot of boy bands and very rarely girl bands, if I do see girl bands most people have the ' wow it's all girls' attitude, which i don't really like... however i love seeing girls as front people, it's awesome, I think one of the defining moments was when a guy came up to me and said 'you play guitar really well...for a girl' ass. I do think there needs to be more woman in music, however i think there needs to be more woman in politics in well.. just as a general actually!\" \"I don't really .... I see the same drive and passion with woman that i've always seen, read about throughout history. I guess now our voice can stand on it's own, of course thanks to the woman of the past.\" \"The best advice i've ever had was from an old boss, who said to me ' if you believe in what you're doing never give up.' It's true, never give up, never surrender!!\" It seemed the easiest instrument to play whilst traveling, my dad also played guitar and when i moved away from home and overseas, i missed my family and that instrument made me feel close to home. - Instruments: 1, Dark Dark Dark - Years playing: accordion, piano, vocals I sing and write many of our songs. I don't make many of the decisions regarding booking, business, marketing, etc. But I speak up if I feel strongly about something. I like to keep my focus on singing and performing well and I try not to get bogged down with every decision that has to be made for the band. I have a Technics keyboard that is full-size and has weighted keys. I have a nice Silvio Soprani 120-Bass accordion that I mic with AKG condensor mics. Find your own voice. It might take a few years and lot of performing, but find it and don't lose it. My mom had me take piano lessons when I was 7. I never really liked the piano. So I learned a bunch of different instruments - guitar, ukulele, bass, omnichord, melodica - until I played my friend's accordion and fell in love. After that I started playing the piano to write music and it spoke to me more as an adult. I do almost all of my writing on the piano now. - Instruments: This week: Lyric Fury Orchestra, Compared to that big band, Swing Era Big Band, Larry Siegal (party band), a Duo of improvised music, Audrarox (kids band) - Years playing: Saxophones, flute, piano chief cook, and bottle washer. 3 saxophones, a flute, a clarinet, keyboards, microphones, stands, reeds, other instruments for rehearsals.... Jazz musicians (male) were notoriously maladjusted in the past. Jazz has traditionally been dominated by homophobic, and sometimes, misogynist boys. That has changed a bit, both with the emergence of new and talented international musicians, and with a new generation of American musicians. For me personally, it was always important for me to find people to play with that didn't have a lot of hang-ups about women--Ones that could deal with me and not be obsessed with sleeping with me. About ten years ago, I visited the first music store in Naperville, Illinois, where my mom bought me my first alto. I was in Chicago playing with the back-up band for Jay McShann and picking up some reeds while on the way to visit my parents. At the counter, a young girl came in with her mother and was also buying saxophone reeds. She looked to be about 12 or 13. I thought I should introduce myself to her--to show her the \"positive role model\" that was me. I smiled at her and asked her which horn she played and whether or not she improvised. Then, I told her that I was a professional jazz musician, and that I had bought my first horn there at that store 26 years ago. The look she gave me said, 'Yeah. So?' Clearly, she was just interested in purchasing her reeds and getting out of there, and had no need for any kind of encouragement from the likes of me. This is, ultimately, the way it should be. I got some really stupid advice along the way, and so, I hesitate to give any stupid advice out of my own. However, I would say this: Stay true to the music, be original, have a great time! If it starts being no fun--get out. Recently, I have been focusing less on music and more on creative writing. I have a story being published in Brevity in January, 2011. It was cool, and a boy I liked played it in the 6th grade - Instruments: 6 - Agent 99, Rock band. Maniacal Choir - World music. Concert Choir - classical music. Javanese Gamelan. Flute/Harp duo - classical music. Chamber Orquestra - Classical Music. - Years playing: Flute/voice I am not currently in a band, but in the next band I have, I will be the leader. I usually record my own music myself in the studio. I also make my own business and marketing decisions. Sonar\u00e9 flute, Novation ReMOTE keyboard controller, AKAI EWI, MacBook Apogee, Yamaha SY77 and TG77 keyboard/module, flutes and percussion from various cultures, didgeridoo, tamboura I have been very fortunate in that, for the most part, my gender has not affected how I grew and grow as a musician. I have seen a lot of bias against women, however, and I also have noticed that the world over, men are the majority in most university courses. I think that today's women have many, many more opportunities, but still have a long ways to go. I can think specifically of the practices in Vienna of excluding women in their orchestras until very recently, it is a great advance that we women have that option if we choose that route. However, Marion Alsap's post as conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, was hard-fought, and she was almost rejected. This shows how much more we have to go to get more balance in all of our musical areas. As a college-educated musician, I received a lot of advice. I would say to any young musician, regardless of their gender that they study music from various angles, really get to know, intimately, a large amount of scores and recordings from all parts of the world. I would also say to compose, even if at a rudimentary level. I prefer not to give gender-specific advice, instead focusing on getting more women into higher-level music programs, and changing men-driven music hierarchies. When I was a child, I always had an affinity towards music, and one day as a 7-year-old, I picked up my mom's flute and taught myself how to play. When I started to learn how to sing, I was in choir in junior-high, and I enjoyed it so much, I decided to continue. - Instruments: 5+: Difference Engine, String Builder, Alec K Redfearn and the Eyesores, Fern Knight, The Valerie Project - Years playing: cello, guitar, vocals I write all of the music and lyrics, and consider myself the band leader, but everyone is pretty independent musically in my band. Everyone has a lot of freedom to try new ideas and sounds. In the studio, I voice my opinions and ideas about how I want the songs to sound and the orchestrations, but again, everybody brings something to the table in the studio and live. We're a democracy in how we make business/marketing decisions, but we've really not had many to make. Baggs DI for my Martin acoustic guitar with an I Beam pickup, my cello has a David Gage realist pickup. I think there are more women in rock and folk now than when I started playing indie rock 20 years ago. When I toured our country in 1995, it was rare to share the bill with any other women in bands. It is much different now and more balanced. It's been gradual, but I definitely have noticed more and more women on bills between 1995 and now. My roots are in the DIY indie rock early 90s era, back when indie labels were all still independent and not owned by majors. It is a different world now, but my advice would be to make your online presence strong through social networking sites. Try digitally releasing singles and turn those singles into videos with your talented friends. The CD format just isn't selling these days like it used to, so then releasing an LP and/or a 7\" as well as digital might be a better second step, either releasing them yourself or finding a small label who can help you get started. Own your own masters and keep your publishing rights! I came from playing the electric and upright bass to cello and guitar because of the versatility and songwriting ease they bring; plus, they're smaller. - Instruments: As a solo artist, Fat Bottom Girls, Gravity - Years playing: vocals, guitar, bass, tuba I wear all hats though I would love to not have to wear the booking hat. That's a tough job... And really needs someone who can be specifically devoted to it. Fender precision bass, SWR jr goliath cab/GK bass head, King BBb Tuba, Washburn Acoustic Electric guitar. I have an all woman band. Probably most bands are all male. When women choose all women, that seems to be an issue or a novelty. People have low expectations of women and what we call women's music. Industry wise, there are expectations of how a woman should present. Guys can wear anything from a 3 piece suit to ripped up jeans... women are expected to look \"hot\"... So its often not about the music as much as the look for ALOT of people when it comes to women. The younger the more freely expressive... I think that's true anyway. It's exciting to hear. Young women have it a little easier these days. And anyone independent has it easier. You can make a CD on your laptop now. It's not like years ago when you had to come up with tens of thousands of dollars. Learn your craft. There is always room for improvement. Play with people that are better than you as much as you can. Ask questions. Put yourself out there. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable and honest in your music. That's where your greatest strength is... and the music, is more important than your fears! I think in terms of bass mostly though I play guitar more than anything these days. The guitar allows for a little more independence... I can cover chords and bass lines. - Instruments: Miss Murgatroid & Petra Haden, solo and currently in a new band called White Widow - Years playing: accordion, drums, vocals equal partner, sometimes main songwriter. producer in the studio, key in bus/marketing decisions for solo and group projects. 1920's bejeweled dallape accordion, vintage drums, lots of effect pedals I get less dates, that's for sure. I have always somehow enjoyed the difference and the presumed \"novelty\" factor of being a woman in the biz. Its never held me back per se, but it seems to matter less these days than ever before, especially in portland, where skillset and talent rule all. girls are starting out younger with more intent and willingness to experiment. there are so many female musicians to look to now - both old and young, and they are being influenced be the rest of us. \"hmmm...well, the best advice i ever held onto was to be myself, and let my art and music reflect that. i would give the same to any woman starting out. that and - DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE WEIRD. it worked for me. xxx alicia rose aka miss murgatroid ajr@aliciajrosephotography.com\" i am a rhythm slut. both the accordion and the drums appeal to this. i think in patterns, and with song write with them. before i started learning the drums, i called myself an accordion player that plays like a drummer, now i call myself a drummer that plays like an accordionist. the bass keys and the drums are the same to me. - Instruments: just mine! - Years playing: vocals \"I am the artist/lead singer in the band and on stage. I am the co-writer and singer in the studio but I would say I also make a lot of musical decisions beyond the lyrics. In marketing, I have to be able to sell it, so it essentially has to agree with who I am! I have a very in-depth role in all three. \" I am plain jane--boring! I have KSM 9 and 57! That's all I need! Oh ya, and I started running Pro-Tools when I was 12. I got my own Mbox and Expert Mouse when i was 14. I haven't noticed it as much in my case as an artist just yet. I haven't felt treated differently. But then again, I am in pop. In country music, I have noticed a lot more of a MAN's World. There are a few women that rise to the top but for the most part, the men rule the radio waves and the charts. I've also noticed it in management. I'm sure I'll come across it more in the future, but as of now, I feel pretty equal. \"I think women were more masculine in a sense back then. The Runaways, Janis, Pat, etc. They had a strength about them...yet still feminine. Now if you are like that, you are considered \"\"punkish\"\" rather than just strong. Then you have the other side--straight up girly: dresses and accentuated chests and lots of makeup and high heels. \" \"My dad Dann gave me a lot. He didn't say much about man vs woman though, probably because he didn't want me to see it that way. He told me that I needed to have something to say, that I was always a work in progress no matter what part of the business I took part in, to make myself indispensable to everyone I worked with, to give those you work with gratitude that they can feel. Be yourself and go with your gut instincts. Women have killer intuition! \" I chose to sing because I write and I love to sing my own words. - Instruments: Mostly my own (I am a solo artist), but I have also performed in Mascott - Years playing: guitar, vocals, piano, bass I write the songs and sing and play guitar. I pretty much make the business and marketing decisions for now too as I am not with a label at the moment! I have a Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar. A Guild T-100 electric guitar, and a small Fender princeton amp. Yes definitely. You are represented as a woman in the press first and a musician second. Men don't have to deal with that. I think that is the biggest difference that still exists today and probably always will. I think it has gotten a bit easier for younger women musicians to make their way in the industry because I think there are more opportunities for women. But I think women of all generations still face sexism in the way they are marketed and promoted. \"No, not really. The same advice I would give to anyone - make or female. Just do what you do and be who you are and keep going. \" I think because most of my favorite music was guitar based. - Instruments: too many to count. Some: Texas Sheiks; Del Rey & Suzy Thompson; California playing: fiddle, vocals, Cajun accordion, guitar Depends on the band. In the Texas Sheiks, I play fiddle but I also have been the major person coming up with the band's repertoire. I am not the leader of that band. But usually, I have either been the leader or shared leadership in the bands I've been. In the studio, I just play; I am not a good producer or mixer -- I need all my focus for playing. In most of my bands, I've taken a leadership role in business and marketing. I have also done a lot of booking and managing. Fiddle (1920s Italian); bow (Glasser carbon fiber); old Gibson acoustic guitar (probably 1940s); 2 Cajun accordions made by Marc Savoy. \"Yes -- it is different. There are exceptions to this, of course, but I find that women musicians tend to be more empathetic, and tend to like to work cooperatively (vs. one person being the boss). This became clear to me in 1978 when I left a very successful West Coast all-woman band (Any Old Time) to join a string band in the east where I was the only woman and the youngest musician (the oldest was nearly a generation older than 24-year-old me). I was used to being in a group where decisions were made by consensus and totally did not realize that I was going to be in a band where one person would be making decisions and I would not have an equal voice. My mother, who is in her 80s now, is a doctor - a rheumatologist specializing in lupus. She was a feminist in the 1950s and I heard plenty of tales from her about what it was like to be a pioneering woman in her medical field. She has always inspired me and encouraged me to follow my muse and to not let being female stand in my way. The other thing - I don't know if this is about being a woman or about being a parent - but having children has altered my projectory considerably because my first child is severely developmentally disabled (she was born with a rare form of epilepsy called Lennox Gastaut syndrome) and taking care of her meant that both my husband and I stopped being able to tour. He is a musician too and we mostly work together (both in bands and as a duo). I have many more thoughts about this whole \"\"being a musician and raising a family\"\" thing, but for sure, having a disabled kid threw a major monkey wrench into the works. A year ago, we moved Corrina into a nearby group home where she is doing very well (she is 24 now) and so we have been able to start traveling again and I love it!\" \"The music scene has changed a tremendous amount since I started playing the fiddle which is about 35 years ago now. When I started, there were hardly any women instrumentalists and being a \"\"girl fiddler\"\" was a big deal. There definitely was some sexism but in general, I'd say that the musicians of stature (people like Dewey Balfa, Tommy Jarrell, Mike Seeger to name a few) always treated me like a person and not like some kind of cute girl fiddler. Of course I was never a \"\"babe,\"\" not conventionally pretty (in fact kind of homely) and that probably was a help in a certain way. In the east, where I grew up, there were very very few women fiddlers when I started playing. Maria Muldaur was the first one I saw! But, in the Bay Area (always ahead of the pack) there were quite a few great players: Sue Draheim, Laurie Lewis, Cathie Whitesides, Irene Herrmann, to name just a few. In those days, for example, in fiddle contests there would often be a \"\"best woman fiddler\"\" prize. Things are completely different now, nobody would dream of calling Alison Krauss or Natalie MacMaster or Rayna Gellert a \"\"girl fiddler.\"\" There are tons of great women fiddlers now. One thing hasn't changed, though: it's still way more important for a female musician to be thin and conventionally good-looking than for a male musician.\" Advice: play from the heart; listen to and learn from older musicians (especially the very old ones - their life lessons inform their music - and yours will too, eventually); be pleasant and nice and friendly (but stay true to yourself); eat well (stop and snack before going into a hypoglycemic tailspin); take every opportunity to play with the best musicians that you can; cultivate the friendship of other women musicians (it is a life-saver); be humble AND have confidence. You can play any type of music on the fiddle, and I had a head start with my classical lessons as a child. With guitar, at age 10 saw another kid playing and asked my parents to get me one, my mom showed me a few chords and I was off and running, never had any lessons. With Cajun accordion, I had been playing Cajun fiddle for over 20 years with a great accordion player (Danny Poullard) in the California Cajun Orchestra; when my fiddle mentor, Dewey Balfa, passed on, I decided to take up the accordion and learned from Danny. - Instruments: Corrina's Dreamland Band, Vivace Duo, The Original Recipe Band - Years playing: Rhythm guitar and vocals Band leader-- all booking, promotions, PR, etc. Find and hire musicians, call and lead rehearsals, provide chart books. All business and marketing decisions, design for posters/flyers, website, and associated costs for all. \"De Armond X-155 Hollow Body Electric Guitar TraceElliot Acoustic, amplifer for guitar and vocals EKG C-535 Vocal Condenser Mic Fender Passport 6-channel PA System with 2 Speakers\" Yes-- people seem more skeptical of females in a band-leading and booking role. I feel that I am not taken seriously and sometimes that I'm being judged by my appearance and even hair color (I'm a tall blonde). There have been a few moments in particular that I've felt disadvantaged by being a woman. It also seems that my requests (esp. regarding payment) are not taken as seriously as my male friends in the same situations. Not especially, only the differences of age and wisdom that apply to males and females. The best advice I've received is to be persistent, I would pass that advice along although it seems pretty obvious. Based on my experience, I would tell a woman who was just starting out to reach out to everyone she meets and to focus on forging relationships with people. I have been singing since childhood and have played several instruments over the years including saxophone and piano. I ultimately decided on guitar because it is a good accompaniment instrument for vocals, it lends itself to songwriting and bandleading as well. - Instruments: I am a composer. - Years playing: piano, voice, recorder \"This survey is about women in music, not women in bands. I write the music. Sometimes I hire musicians and sometimes musicians hire me. In the studio I try to get the best performance and mix possible but I am only an advisor regarding my own compositions. I make all my own business and marketing decisions.\" I write music using Finale on my computer and send it to people who perform it. Yes. I don't have a wife. On many music festivals and concerts there are fewer than 5% women composers. There are still professors in music schools telling their students that \"only the male bird sings.\" Men often network and help each other. Women mostly don't have the power to help themselves, much less other women and when they do, they often seem to go in the other direction so that the men will see them as even-handed. I talked to the agent for a woman conductor who had recently gotten a significant orchestral position and asked if she would consider performing my music. I was told that it would ruin the conductor's career if she started conducting women's music! Yes. The young ones are very optimistic and unaware of barriers. The older ones remember the past vividly and see the barriers quite clearly. Yes I was told to either marry money, inherit money, write commercial music or learn to type/teach/nurse so that I could afford to be a composer. I would tell them the same thing. Then persist. And don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it if you really must compose. My grandmother had a piano and I used to try to play it when I was 4 and my mother and grandmother decided to give me lessons. I played flute in band because my mother thought it was a nice light instrument for a girl. I sing because that's what I do. I play recorder because I enjoy playing chamber music. I learned to play recorder because when I was in graduate school one of my teachers thought it would be useful to introduce young people to basic musical reading and ideas. - Instruments: Um, no way I'd remember this! WAY too many to list here - Years playing: Vocals, Bass, Guitar, Harmonica some keys and drums As a self employed musician. I have to do it all. Computer, websites, marketing, myspace, youtube, create and edit videos and songs, book the gigs, update the web calendars, call the clubs, get promo to the clubs and venues, harass the clubs mercilessly and convince them that I really am different from the other bazillion woman singer-songwriters, schedule rehearsals, pay for rehearsal rooms, learn another band's material for a show, go to their rehearsals, write the checks, write bios for promo packs, update EPK's, answer NPR surveys get the picture? Oh yeah, I almost forgot the most important part.....writing songs and practicing my instruments! And now they want me to Twitter! What? Hmmmm, this changes quite often as I play so many instruments. Fender basses, Larrivee and Alvarez and a very old Kay acoustic guitar, Ampeg, Bergantino, Ashdown amps and speakers for bass. Tons of PA gear depending on the type of gig I'm going to do. EV mics. \"It is very different. We have to work way way harder. If I'm on bass with a band on and there is a bad note by the guitar player. It will always be assumed it was the woman's mistake. Also, women almost always need a team mate to be successful I've observed. Some of the best bands that I've had I've been dating or friends with another \"\"leader\"\" type. I think this leader type definitely needs to be a male. It makes kind of a \"\"good cop/bad cop\"\" situation that comes out much better. I've mostly worked with men and some of them cannot relate to a woman leader. If there is another male co-leader there that supports me and they respect him - there are usually NO problems! On the other hand, if it's just me calling all the shots - 99% of the time there are going to be problems when I have to stand my ground about something. Then they relate to me like I'm their wife/girlfriend who won't stop telling them what to do. Maybe because they just left home to come to rehearsal and there was a woman there telling them what to do? I'm not sure. I'd love to find a male bandleader that wants to work as much as I do and join forces. A girl can dream. Meanwhile - I plan to do this the rest of my life so I power on alone no doubt! Funny, after typing that! I just described a husband, but I don't really care so much if I have one of those. I'd rather have a hot band, lol!\" I have not seen much of that. Really good female musicians that intend to do this their whole life are focused and work harder than most males because they have to. When I first started I was told I'd never \"make it\" (whatever that means) if I continued to wear Converse All Stars instead of high heels. But I'm still here and I'm still wearing combat boots and All Stars alot! Although I will rock some heels for private parties! I consider \"making it\" to mean \"getting the bills paid doing what I love\". I'm not sure I'd want to be Taylor Swift (ugh!) or any of these other girls they trot out who look like marionettes on a string. Better to make it on your own terms. \"My main instrument, bass, chose me. I struggled for years with guitar. Became an excellent rhythm guitar player. But lead always evaded me and when rehearsing it I was always bored and frustrated. One day a friend of mine, Buddy Flett (recently toured with Hubert Sumlin and Kenny Wayne Sheppard) handed me a bass to borrow and said - \"\"you need to be playing this\"\". I ignored the bass, it sat in my house for about a year untouched and I continued on as a guitarist but I was on guitar synth playing lots of bass parts. When that broke down I started playing a real bass on the stage one night - and I was hooked. I will say that now I'm starting to want to get back on guitar again because I've been inspired by some \"\"delta blues\"\" flavored solo performers who incorporate bass notes with picking patterns. We'll see!\" - Instruments: The Postmarks - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, keys, accordion My role is vocalist and instrumentalist. In the studio I write songs and lyrics. I am part owner of our band's business, so I have to be consulted regarding major decisions and have to approve decisions with my business partners. We make marketing decisions with our label. Fender Jazzmaster guitar, Vox amps, various effects pedals, Roland synth, tambourine, melodica, toy echo-phone Just purely in the sense of being a musician, no I don't think there is a difference. Each musician is unique, regardless of gender. As far as how musicians are marketed, I'm not sure if there is much difference there, either. Sex appeal sells for both, talent sells for both, innovation sells for both. If you consider the Ying and Yang of it in terms of masculine and feminine, with the feminine being considered more reserved or moody and the masculine more flashy and assertive, there are some differences between musicians, but I think both genders can fall into either role. Even each species of animal has the more brightly colored gender, the protectors and the nurturers, but I'm not sure it is as clear cut with humans. It is still a male dominated world, which considers modesty boring, shyness a flaw and authority, power and ambition the highest qualities, which I think is the reason that musicians of either gender with outgoing, in-your-face, peacock attitudes get pushed to the forefront. I do appreciate the boldness of the Madonnas, Princes, Bjorks and Flaming Lips' of this world. Then there have been the quieter, more reserved, emotive and even timid presences in music, which you could say are more feminine, like Astrud Gilberto, Francoise Hardy, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Hope Sandoval, Nick Drake, Donovan, Kings of Convenience and Sondre Lerche to name a few. I tend to lean toward that 'femine' side as far as my personal style, because I have a soft voice and I'm not really an exhibitionist. It's harder these days to be a quieter musician, because attention spans in general are very short, so unless you're doing something brash or shocking, the greater public will not notice you as quickly. On the business side of things there are some differences. For awhile it was just men running the record companies, managing bands, acting as tour agents and promoters around the world. It's still a man's world, but women are becoming more empowered. Sylvia Rhone heads Motown Records and Julie Greenwald is the head of Atlantic Records. I think female artists are also becoming more empowered. Fiona Apple is a great example. From my own experience, I am included in business decisions and even though the men generally take a dominant role, I feel that the men I work with in the music industry do have respect for what I bring to the table. Then there's the revival of the Lilith Fair, a female-driven event, which shows women are becoming more involved on the touring side of things. It's probably a long way off from equality, but at least there are signs of this generation having more female empowerment. I tend to do the opposite of any advice people me, so I'm probably not the one to ask! Or maybe that's the answer, that you have to trust your own gut and intuition, and find your own path. My advice would be, it's not all about talent. You need talent but you also need luck, to be in the right place at the right time, and to find the right people to work with. So maybe I would wish them lots of good luck instead of my advice! \"I chose to play guitar because my mother always had one lying around and I liked learning chords and writing songs. I pined for a piano and the family finally got one, but I didn't have the patience for formal lessons and taught myself by ear and gleaned what I could from anyone who would show me anything. Received an accordion as a present and fell in love. \" - Instruments: Lou Hickey (Solo) and Codeine Velvet Club. I used to sing for a Jazz band as well - Years playing: Vocals, piano \"In Codeine Velvet Club, there are two members including myself. The rest of the band are session musicians. I am the joint lead singer and song writer with my band mate Jon. In the studio, as Jon has been producing the albums etc he takes on a more dominant role than myself. Im fairly happy with this, as having always produced my solo material, its a welcomed break and lets me learn and observe. In business and marketing, the record label etc deal more with Jon, despite my efforts to be more included in these decisions. Its incredibly frustrating. I do feel this is because I am female. My suggestions often get ignore, then revisited 3 months later when the men think its their idea! haha With my solo work, I am the sole song writer, producer, manager. I deal with everything from arrangements to finances. \" \"For Codeine Velvet Club, I mostly sing, and occasionally play percussion. For my solo work, I play a Roland RD 300GX I also have a piano in my house I've also got in-ear monitors. \" \"Yes, I do think there is a difference. But I also think it depends which area of music you are in and what kind of people you are working with. As I have said, often my ideas get ignored, then a few months later one of then men will bring it up saying its their idea. When my band signed, I realized that everyone would approach my band mate Jon with ideas for approval and not myself. I am constantly having to ask for information. I feel like I have to prove my intelligence a little and work a lot harder than a lot of men I know in the business.\" \"I think the 70's saw the start of a big change with punk, DIY, etc, and I think there has been a constant progression from this. Women are using music to voice their opinions and concerns, as well as making a career for themselves. I released my first two records myself. More and more women are doing this and learning more about the business. They are also becoming more business minded. More and more women have active roles in this industry. Not so much that it is perfectly even, but its an improvement. \" \"I was just told it was hard, and that I would need to toughen up. You have to put yourself out there and give it everything you've got. It is hard being a female working in the music business. To someone starting out, I would say, keep your head down, work hard, and if people choose not to see your intelligence and talent, then more fool them. Sometimes playing up on their pre-conceptions of women is the very thing that can outsmart them the most. You can use it to your advantage. \" \"I have been singing as long as I can remember. I started learning piano when I was 6. We had a piano in my house, and my sister used to go for lessons, and listening to her made me want to play. At primary I learned the clarinet, and in high school I took up the cornet and trombone. At University I moved my focus to vocals. \" - Instruments: 4 or 5 - Years playing: vocals \"My band, The Tierney Sutton Band, has been for the last 5 years an incorporated unit. I am the \"\"CEO\"\" or our corporation \"\"Hollow Reed Inc.\"\" All decisions are made by the 4 partners. One of my bandmates serves as our CFO and does the bookkeeping, writes us checks etc. Our model is highly unusual, but then again, it's highly unusual to have a band of this caliber together for 17 years. This type of relationship also applies to the musical decisions of the band. We do all our arranging collaboratively as well. In fact, that process had been in place for almost a decade before we incorporated.\" Neumann KMS 105 mic. \"For many years I didn't feel sexism per se and honestly, it's been a rare sense. A few times, when dealing with large university systems, or decision-making with male musicians, I have sensed that I was undervalued---but again, that has been fairly rare in an institutional sense. But I think there are many many many subtle and sometimes corrosive ways that men and women interact inefficiently (to say it in a balanced and unincendiary way...) Sometimes this is just personality types. In my experience, I'm a very expressive person so often male musicians who are having a conflict with one another will voice it to me rather that directly to one another. They are more comfortable entering into conflict with a woman---that gets a bit tiresome. One HUGE difference I see between women and men musicians is that, of the serious ones, I would submit a far higher percentage of the women are childless. This says a lot about where we are still at in our culture. In my case, I have a son, but if not for my music career, I would, I think, have had more children. This is a very big deal and we don't talk about it---virtually ever.\" I'm really not sure about this... \"I tell my students : 1. don't sleep with him if you want him (or her) long term in your band and 2. don't forget to have kids\" - Instruments: Just my own really, I've done various string session work for Carla Bozulich, Rilo Kiley, and Electrelane among several others. - Years playing: viola, keyboards and vocals I am a solo artist, so I am responsible for the final say in all of these things. I have a viola which I play as a rhythm/lead guitar most of the time. I have 2 pickups on the instrument, one electric guitar pickup and one string pickup. I usually play the viola through a fender twin or a silvertone amp. I also use analogue synthesizers - the rogue moog and a juno. I am a very direct communicator. It can be difficult to not fulfill the unaware, flighty and quirky expectations the music industry and press often have of an artist like me . Male solo artists and bands face this too, but my instincts tell me it's slightly more ingrained to expect this from the \"female solo artist type\". The younger women I know tend to be pursuing their own solo artist career or band while the older women are working behind the scenes in production, specifically high end pop production for other artists. Unfortunately, I don't know many women in the music industry over the age of 40. The women I know who have sustained themselves for a number of years have filled multiple musical roles over the course of their career. As a young musician looking to the experienced generation's successes and struggles, I would feel like I hit the jackpot if I was able to continue presenting and developing my own artistic ideas full time for the long term. \"Get as much experience as you can, quit your day job so your back is up against the wall and also learn how to sing in tune before you decide it's not your thing. Give yourself enough room to understand what kind of artist/musician you are and keep low expectations and an open mind about where you might be in the months or years to come. \" My mom got some wrong info when she signed me up for a community ed class when I was 3. We showed up expecting a group music class for toddlers, but when we showed up it turned out I was signed up for private violin lessons. We just rolled with it. Violin lessons eventually turned into piano lessons and I ended up with a viola for chamber music in high school. i started writing songs when i was 10 and have been focusing on my own songs and solo stuff for about 6 years. - Instruments: Ive been in probably half a dozen bands.I was singer for the northwest grand old opry first then a background singer for an elvis impersonator then I was in a series of bands \"the shed\" \"carolina haze\" some punky side project stuff and ultimately went solo as they say,but I would always consider me and the twins more of a band than anything else - Years playing: guitar/piano \"my role is more facilitator than the final word.

I love Yamaha pianos.\" \"Its different because it has had certain limitations in the past that carry over through in the form of road blocks from the industry. art has had something to prove since the beginning of time and in that sense I believe that great art isnt possible without something to struggle against. Its empowering to look at it that way...Weve all seen how bad things can get when they are easy...look at the rise and fall of every frat boy band to ever grace TRL The moment that made this clear to me was my first lilith fair I wasnt the only 17 year old to hear that women couldnt be rock stars....Yet here they were on the radio,selling out sheds,blowing my mind.\" \"I see the evidence of struggle when I remember the artists that influenced me who arent on the radio anymore or arent touring...bands broken up because they were tired of the fight or it was made impossible for them to make a living,While their male counter parts are considered \"\"legacy artists\"\" and flying around in private jets. I look at those women as the people that paved the way for girls like us,and we have a lightness to the way we walk in the world because someone before us made sure we could....Its important to remember that and to enjoy it because not to would be disrespect to the women that wanted us to. seeing loretta lynn,emmylou harris,and bonnie rait play a show is incredibly inspiring those women and many more are ten feet tall to me.\" \"The best thing that ever happened to women in music in my opinion is a sense of community. surround yourself with people who teach and inspire you and you might find the power in numbers. Women can sell tickets,records,and being a rockstar is not a boys game\" \"because it was mobile piano was my first love but i couldnt carry it with me to lilith fair when I was 17 so i learned to play guitar.\" - Instruments: work with major opera companies - Years playing: piano No band or studio. For years I also worked in administration, identifying emerging young singer talent and assisting in casting and season planning, as well as assembling estimates of future seasonal needs. I coach singers, accompany rehearsals, take notes at orchestra sessions, play in the orchestra pit, conduct backstage and cover the conductor in case of illness. I accompany recitals and auditions. Gear? I'm a professional pianist, working with national opera companies as an assistant conductor preparing opera productions and coaching singers. Gear is piano, music, pencil, and metronome. Plus opera scores, recordings, dictionaries, highliters, post-its \"I run up against the family issue quite a lot. Some companies and organizations are understanding of family needs; some aren't.

Also being a straight woman in my profession has had some glass ceilings, but I'm loathe to speak publicly about that. I was told once by a male supervisor that women could never be as good pianists as men, because \"\"they lack the requisite upper body strength\"\". Word. Also was told by gay colleague that \"\"once you have children, your career is over.\"\" Have proved him wrong. Heard once that I was turned down for a job because of my family, although of course that wasn't the official reason, since it is highly illegal. Have to do an inordinate amount of travel between opera companies, which strains my time with my kids. Mercifully they understand and are opera fans and because of my travel they have been able to visit me in places we might never have gone. A gig in Arizona last fall led to a family visit to the Grand Canyon and Sedona, for example. Trying to make the best of it. Have also seen that to object or complain to things is handled differently when it is done by a woman - there is still a tendency to label women \"\"difficult\"\" or \"\"oversensitive\"\", which is less frequently applied to men who take strong positions on issues.\" There were virtually no female conductors until recently, led by the late Sarah Caldwell. The Berlin Philharmonic until relatively recently was all-male. Now \"blind\" orchestra auditions have taken away gender as a hiring issue. For opera singers, size is back to being an issue again. The Fat Lady doesn't get as many jobs as the buff one, thanks in part to the HD broadcasts that now show every last detail. You have people like Miuccia Prada designing opera costumes for svelte figures; never mind how those figures can actually sing. Be as well prepared as you possibly can be. Your competition is hard on your heels. Every day that you don't hone your knowledge and skills is a day you backslide in some way. Stay strong and develop a thick skin. Be persistent - much of success depends on sheer tenacity. If you really love what you do, make it happen somehow, in some way. Don't let ANYBODY tell you that choosing to have a family is the end of your career. Started studying piano when I was 4. Don't even remember choosing to study. Has just always been part of my life. - Instruments: I've only ever been in Grace Potter & the Nocturnals, but we had several names before we settled on GPN. \"Nocturnal Grace\" but we had to change it when we found out there was a Christian rock band with the same name. - Years playing: I sing and play the Hammond B-3 organ and guitar. We are definitely a team; from each band member to our management/booking agent. I like to be as involved as possible with business decisions, but at a certain point, it's important to me to step aside and let the professionals do their thing. When push comes to shove, I would say that I'm the de facto leader of the band. I write a majority of the songs and I get the final say on everything from set lists to the record cover graphics. I'm collaborative to a point, but just ask The Eagles, full-on democracies rarely work! My Hammond B-3 organ was built in 1961. I had it overhauled 5 years ago to fit my style of playing, giving it a very smooth low-end crunch. It's loud! Gibson just gave me an incredible chestnut 70's SG with a whammy bar and all kinds of magic tricks. It's one of a kind. In my case, being a woman has done nothing but help me. A few years ago, I started noticing that people would go out of their way to help me off stage, have a coat waiting if it was a cold evening show, and, for the most part, people treat me like a real musician, not just a Vegas Showgirl. I mean, sure there are moments where I'm singing a soulful a cappella song and there's the dude in the back going \"I wanna marry you!!\" But that's just someone feelin' the love and beer. Now keep in mind, I'm not a \"Woe is Me\" kinda girl, so I don't spend a lot of time sitting around thinking about how repressed I am, I'm sure if I peeled back a few layers, I could find some things to cry about. But I won't. I see musicians like Bonnie Raitt and Emmylou Harris as more than just musical icons, they are planets, with a gravitational pull - from how they flip their hair just-so when they bow, right down to their hearty backstage banter. It takes decades to learn the innuendos of being gracious and genuine all at once. I'm not sure that I - or any other female musicians of my generation will ever quite do it with such effortless mystique. Taj Mahal told my guitarist Scott a very cool thing one night when we were on tour with him. We'd had a so-so show, the crowd wasn't that into it and Taj said \"That's why they call it fishin! If you got 'em every time, they'd call it catchin.\" As for the woman thing, there are plenty of advantages and disadvantages to being a woman in rock &roll, but the thing I've found to matter much more than all of that is weather you've got the stomach for it. You've either got it or you don't. Gender only gets in the way if you let it. Don't act like you're oppressed and you won't be. I always loved the piano because it's just a bunch of buttons. I like to push buttons. Playing the organ came later, suggested by my band mates, who thought I needed to play an instrument that can match my loud voice! I picked up the guitar because I wanted to use a different instrument to write songs, hoping that it shed new light on my technique and song styling. - Instruments: 1 band, \"Ruby Blue\" now I am a solo artist - Years playing: vocals, guitar \"I am a solo artist and so I'm the writer and lead singer. I do have a band that I regularly play with, who back me up. They are fantastic. I play acoustic guitar, and I have a lead guitarist on electric guitar, a drummer and a bass player. In the studio I work closely with a producer. I work closely with my manager, publicist and publisher in business and marketing decisions.\" I have two Collings acoustic guitars and a neuman mic I think one big difference is of course that women have babies, and are usually the primary care parent of the family. This means that a woman must stay much closer to home for a good chunk of time, and might not have the same freedom to tour etc, that their male counterparts have. A life on the road and raising a family don't mix. \"I think that of course there are differences in style between the generations of women musicians. Songwriting changes as perspective does. I think the younger generation of women are not carrying the torch of feminism quite so prominently, simply because they just expect more equality that has already been won for them by the older generation. In a business sense, now that the music industry is changing so much, I think artists both male and female are expecting to be much more involved in the business of making, owning and marketing their material. Artists are being forced to be more independent, and more inventive about how to get their music out there. It's much harder to get a record deal for example, but much easier to make your own record, and there's always a chance it will catch on on the internet.\" I don't think I heard any more valuable advice than persistence is all. Stick with it, even when you don't feel like it, and something (even the unexpected) will come of it. I chose to play the guitar because it was the instrument that seemed easiest to write on. At the time I was writing with another musician who played the guitar, and I did not. My then boyfriend bought me a guitar of my own, and so I started to learn. I am self-taught. One of these days I'm thinking of taking lessons! - Instruments: 2: Elgin Symphony & Milwaukee Symphony Orchestras - Years playing: flute & piccolo To play my part (flute/piccolo) in the orchestra professional quality flute & piccolo no yes. Quite a few women wait until they can get an orchestra job somewhere before getting married and starting a family. Advice would be to be open & able to move anywhere (different cities, etc.) to build experience as an orchestral musician. Band instrument demonstrations - Instruments: Andy Williams 16 years , the rest on and off - Years playing: drums I lead with the drums Pearl Drums , Zildjian Cymbals , Evans drumheads , Vic Firth Sticks , Impact cases .... I am endorsed by all these companies ;-) I never really thought about it until it was made aware to me that for example the drums are supposed to be a \"male \" instrument .... I really have no idea why , I just don't see it , never did , and as I said I was always a rebel I guess, so I just didn't care ;-) I started playing in Mexico and well in the 80's especially I guess it was extremely male oriented and yes I had to prove myself I guess much more than maybe here in the US .... But I really don't see the difference especially now a days. But still in some circles , if I walk in , some people still think , oh she must be the singer , or the dancer or whatever, some people never guess , the drummer . But now a days nobody questions you if you are a woman or man , it's all about , can you play? .... the end....of course this is especially here in NY ;-) We really don't get the \"Oh look its a girl , I wonder if she can play\" thing anymore at all . Yeah I guess so ..... maybe 20 or 30 years ago , we maybe got questioned , but not now at all .... And I guess we are still a minority , especially in terms of playing drums. I say go for it , whatever your dream is ..... don't let anyone tell you , you 're not supposed to play that or that instrument ;-) My parents are both classical musicians , my father is a symphony conductor and my mother is a classical concert pianist , so there was always music around and I wanted to be a musician , I kinda didn't have a choice haha but i didn't want to do what my parents did , so call it rebellion but I had a chance encounter with drumsticks at age 11 or so , and fell in love , I tried playing all the instruments at home , and never felt comfortable with any of them , so I knew that I was very happy with sticks in my hands , and i thought , ooohhh that'll piss the parents off hahahahaa and it did for a while , but once they realized I was in it for real , they understood and are my biggest fans ;-) - Instruments: Old bands: The Flys, The Mugshots - Years playing: guitar, vocals I am co founder of the band. I write the music and lyrics along with my creative partner (the other guitar player and singer). Decisions are mainly made by myself, Phillip and Carl. \"1989 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top, Custom made aluminum neck guitar by Electrical Guitar Co., Guild Polara S-100 Marshall JCM 800 100w master lead, Orange GH50 3 cabinets (Orange, Mesa Boogie, Krank) Fender Super Reverb Re-issue loads and loads of guitar effects pedals (delay, phaser, chorus, wah, flanger, etc)\" Absolutely. At least, in the metal / rock world. So many times I've been mistaken for the manager or the singer or bass player but never the guitar player (at least early on in our career). It became abundantly clear when I started seeing a lot of female fronted metal bands with women who played the part as sex symbol and not much else. The superficial nature of such bands on the cover of big rock magazines was a disappointment and a challenge. I feel like I have more to prove as a woman in heavy music. For sure. There could be no Janis Joplin today unless she maybe looked like Barbie. All female pop stars look the same to me and have very little identity. Hmmm. There could probably be a long answer to this one! \"I wish! I've learned a lot on my own! I would advise a woman to be herself and stick to her guns. Don't let the snide comments get you down but, rather, let them be a challenge for you to rise above people's misconceptions and ignorance. Take pride in what you do and work hard. The music industry is a tough ride. \" I liked the sonic quality of the guitar the best. And it looked the coolest. - Instruments: probably 30 - Years playing: Piano, vocal & string producer I am pianist, composer, singer/producer. www.bianchimusica.com or www.myspace.com/bianchimusica & www.myspace.com/pilleybianchi Lots of keyboard & recording gear. Now, most events I play rent a grand piano. Absolutely. As a sideman, I was featured as a keyboardist on MTV's TURN IT UP with an all male band. The guys had no respect for me. Then I did a show with Denis Learly and all male band and got respect but also envy because I was featured on camera because I was prettier than they were. I also got rock/pop gigs simply because I was a woman. Not really. Times don't really change, just our perception. \"Amazing pianist Lee Luvisi (I studied with him at Aspen Music Festival) He said \"\"the only secret is, there is no secret, you just have to work hard and practice.\"\" Pianist Ivan Davis. \"\"you can do it, I believe in you.\"\" \" Always loved the piano and knew it was what I wanted to do, since I was 4. - Instruments: Zanana - Years playing: trombone I'm the composer/performer, retaining all control over my music and its release and my engagements.

For live processing: MacBook Pro with Max/MSP, Max for Live, and interface see http://www.buzzarte.org/interface.html; 4 custom built spherical speakers, For some, yes. For others, no. For me, that I'm a woman (and a lesbian) is a part of me, and so part of my music, but I couldn't exactly say how. How could it NOT be a part of me? More differences between people than between generations. Follow your hearts (and your ears). I loved the sound. Back in those days, girls weren't \"supposed\" to play trombone, and I was told I couldn't... - Instruments: Emm Gryner, David Bowie, A Camp, The Cardigans, Hot One - Years playing: bass, piano, vocals, guitar Leader, songwriter, producer, president of my own label! Yamaha P-90 in a custom built cherry piano shell, Hagstrom bass, Fender musicmaster '77, Seagull guitars (several). I always see myself as a musician first and a female musician second. But I quickly learned this was my perception and not others'. I rolled into a radio station in Pennsylvania some years ago and they had artists divided up on their bulletin board under various genres. I was under the genre \"Lilith Rock\". I couldn't believe it! There is a tendency to group all women together as though we are the same kind of music when nothing could be further from the truth! With the onslaught of the internet and this fascination with celebrity, there seems to be a bit of homogenization in the pop world - musically and in terms of fashion too. It must have to do with having to dig deeper to find the true female rockers. We see Miley Cyrus everywhere instead of Emily Haines, for example. I think back in the day (or maybe it's just my opinion) it was easier to find Chrissie Hynde, Stevie Nicks, Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell in the mainstream - real musicians who put music before fame. \"No one ever taught me that good songs don't always equate to success. I thought that was all I ever needed to do, was write a good song. Turns out there are so many factors that contribute to \"\"making it\"\". My career has been glorious trial and error, but it's still a career. You can't always be what someone is looking for, but you can be what a few people are looking for, and if you're doing what you love, who the hell cares about anything else? Things can go wrong, but as Anvil said, \"\"at least there was a tour for it to go wrong on!\"\" Advice to a woman musician starting out? There's something to be said for being creative and interesting before being just a pretty thing. \" I was forced at gunpoint by parents to learn piano at age 5. I picked up bass at age 14 after a whirlwind trip to California in an RV. I played clarinet briefly with David Bowie (I wanted to play flute but my music teachers said i had \"the wrong lip shape\"). - Instruments: my own touring quarter or quintet, Norman Hedman's Tropique - Years playing: Vocals, Flutes In all of my endeavors I have performed, written, arranged and produced. In Tropique I performed, wrote and arranged. I have been on the albums of other Jazz artists and they always perform my compositions and ask me to arrange and do the copy work for the project. My charts are clearer, and more easily readable than almost anyone's. For the most part I have done my own manging and business decisions, and have also managed several of the Jazz artists I have worked with - including doing the booking (although I use a pseudonym to book nationally). It doesn't help to have the venue think that no one else will put any effort into your career. It is easier to pretend that you are someone else, and then show up to the gig as yourself. It is very effective. I also get a lot of feedback that I would never get as the artist. Evidently I am much more organized than my musician friends, and they are always asking me to pick up the slack. There isn't enough money in Jazz to maintain outside management unless you have a deal on one of the larger labels. When I was on Arabesque I successfully toured the country, and also arranged two national tours for Tropique while playing with the band. Recently I have relocated to Richmond, VA and I am just getting the lay of the land in the Mid-Atlantic. There is a great deal of demand for my composing here, and I have not toured in a while. Touring will follow the next CD that gets major radio play - although the economy may take care of that for me for a while. Sealos, Sterling Silver Open Hole C Flute (with B foot) - this is hand made by Goerge Karegalos in Oakland, CA. Sankyo Prima, Sterling Silver Open Hole C Flute (with B foot.) Gemeinhardt Alto Flute(this is a wonderful older instrument). Microphones, Full arrangements of original music (with as much music as I write it has become gear). It is very different, and yet to be successful you have to pretend that it isn't. There is still a large stigma over female instrumentalists in Jazz, and you really have to bring it - especially in the studio. The guys are just convinced that you will not play with fire and they treat you very sceptically until you prove yourself. Once you have proven that you can stand toe to toe with them, then you are treated like one of the guys. In my case I have always been treated more graciously as I write a lot of the music and do the arranging, but even with that expertise they are surprised that I can cut it as a player. Then when I turn it on in front of a large audience and really command the stage, there is another layer of surprise. If you are not extremely famous people are a little shocked to find that you are at that level of accomplishment. For women the focus on youth and looks has become so severe that ability has very little to do with it. The best musicians are not given the focus on what limited Jazz radio there is, and that is just amplified by how young the new girls are comin' up. Unfortunately the bar has been lowered quite a bit by this focus, but labels don't seem to mind as long as they have their marketable commodity. There are some younger musicians that are wonderful, but mostly I do not see the level of maturity that is really the cornerstone of great Jazz. The majority of the performances are quite derivative, and in Jazz that is very sad indeed. I'm in a weird age range. There were no videos when I was younger and quite cute. Now that I am the more mature Jazz Mama the look is what is important. There is a whole generation of us who had the criterion change right around us as we became very fluid at our art. There is a wellspring of great music coming out of us, but very few ways to get it out to the public at large. Hopefully the internet will change that, but Jazz is a little more problematic than Pop and R&B. The younger people, who don't listen to Jazz, are more adept at accepting music from alternate sources. The generally older Jazz audience is not as open to new ways of hearing music, and don't find their way to music unless it is getting a lot of radio play. These problems are endemic in Jazz, however, and are not limited to women. The focus on looks is definately a female problem. The fact of the matter is that if Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgeral were coming up right now they wouldn't have a snow ball's chance in hell. They weren't cute enough. Flora Purim gave me the best advice I ever got. Never make a record deal yourself. Let them think you are not savy enough to figure it out, and let the lawyers handle everything. The men in the music business are so intimidated by strong women that you have to back off somewhere, as not to immasculate them, and it's never a good idea to back off on the music! I would advise young women to become better musicians, and to write their own music. There is no reason to sell yourself short. Our perspective needs to be heard. This is being done in Pop, but I'm afraid most of the young singers coming up in Jazz are quite happy to do the same standards that everyone else has done a thousand times. They don't realize that it condemns the music to a historical reference which, for an extemporaneous art form, is death. Also, don't sleep with any of them. Let your music speak for you, not your sexuality. I started flute when I was 9 years old, in public school - the 4th grade. I wanted to play violin, but my father had played violin in high school and said he would rather die than listen to me screech as I learned, and that I could play any other instrument. I chose flute which was next on the list. He made me a deal. If I could play \"The Swingin' Shepard's Blues\" in three months he would buy the rented flute. If not I had to quit and never mention an instrument again. So, of course, three months to the day I stood in front of him and played \"The Swingin' Shepard's Blues.\" He was furious because he had to borrow the money to buy the flute. I was very happy, as I immediately loved the flute. - Instruments: Usually just my band, Ruth Gerson, but I've also played in Gloria Gaynor's band. - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Piano I often play solo, but when i play with a band, though it's a very collaborative setting, i would say I'm the MD, I have produced many EPs for others, but in the studio for my own music, I usually will have someone else produce. \"This Can't Be My Life,\" was produced by Daniel Wise, and \"Deceived\" coming out in 2011 was produced by Rick Chertoff and William Wittman (Cyndi Lauper, Joan Osborne). I make all the business and marketing decisions even with my label. I am hands on. \"I play a Guild. And if a venue is without a piano, I use a Roland Juno. Often will bring a beta 58. And I created and use the Singingbelt, http://www.Singingbelt.com - it's a device that trains singers in diaphragmatic breath support.\" I can only speak for myself, and my experience as they kind of woman I am. I was brought up in a male dominated household, my father was a marine, and my brothers in the army. My mother went to Juilliard and became a stay at home mom - the word feminist was a dirty word in our house. I was definitely trained to be submissive, although no one who knows me would say that's my nature - so - my experience as a young woman in the music business was very difficult. I was a constant target, either in the band (one well known guitarist dominated my band and destroyed it, he said I'm a misogynist, if you can't deal with that then you can't have me in your band), and then there were the \"music businessmen\" who expected sex from you - this was the 90s - but, it was everywhere I turned. Also when I was on a major label at 21, they kept sticking me with songwriters, who were guys in their fifties to write songs, and I wanted to write about very different things, then what the company wanted. I finally did find musicians to play with who were like brothers. As far as the music business goes, I completely went around it and became an independent artist. I developed on my own as a writer by listening and digging into music. Now, I am in a different place in life. Not only as a critically acclaimed artist, but as a successful vocal coach (I created the Singingbelt, which is a device that trains singers in diaphragmatic breath support) - and also, simply because I'm older, somewhere I crossed that line form girl to woman, people treat me differently. I run into less sexism, because in someway I am less my \"sex\" and more who I am. It's hard to separate the generations by sex alone. What was going on in the 60s and 70s culturally affected many women artists. The songs I've Got The Pill, D-I-V-O-R-C-E - those were giant brave, feminist statements. Patti Smith through the 80s. Women were singing out loud and letting it rip. Culturally, the female music that sells right now, I would say is less feminist. It's about being pretty, pretty voices, pretty faces - for commercial music. HOWEVER, if you want to find radical females, the beauty of our current time - is that everyone can be heard and everyone can be found. You can't shut anyone up based on the economics of the music business. So the difference now, is there is the opportunity for every woman to have a voice. \"Yes. Don Dixon said even if ten million people in America buy your record because they like you, that means 240 million people in America didn't buy it, because they don't like you, don't know who you are or don't care! In other words, how popular you are is pretty meaningless. You need make what you do have meaning for you. Bob Dylan told me - don't let people call you a songwriter. You don't write the songs, so they sit on the page, you write them to play them. You are a song performer. What I took that to mean is, a song is a song being sung to somebody in the moment. The meaning of it is in the moment it is song, it is in the air between or among people - in other words, you're irreplaceable, so are the people listening to you. I have so much advice. I will put an article on my myspace blog, now that you've got me started. I'll try to be brief here. Define success for yourself, and make your goals accordingly. Make a 5 yr goal, 1 yr gold, 6 month, 3 month, this week and today. I'll write a song today. I'll book these gigs. I'll record this EP. Etc. Get specific. Write it down. If success for you is fame and fortune, think about what kind of music your making, and how it will get you from here to there. If success for you is making a living expressing something that isn't \"\"commercial\"\" figure out how to make a living at it, one day it may be commercial and make you millions, otherwise, you may make a million over the long haul. If success for you is helping others with your music, don't wait to be famous for it, do it now. Be creative and think outside the box about making a living making music. Don't wait for people to do things for you. Do things for yourself. Appreciate your life, don't get so caught up in \"\"making-it,\"\" you lose perspective - it's a blessing to be able to talk, let alone sing. Improve your skills. Learn to sing better, play better. Listen to great music, listen to all kinds of music. That's probably enough for now. OH - wait, this took me til I was thirty-five. Don't care what other people think of you. It helps to make it not about you. It helps, right, if you believe in a higher power, to not let others have power over you. But, if you don't believe in God, it's a little harder to have that kind of self-propriety. So, don't care what other people think. Care what you think, care what your trusted friends think, and especially as a woman, though it can be hard, force yourself to believe in yourself in this one way. Every note you sing or play is a beautiful note, because it came from you. And that's true. \" I grew up with a piano in my room, so I started there. Growing up, I would shut the door and write songs for hours. I didn't get a guitar until my last year of college, and I chose to learn it, because it made traveling/gigging easier. (I din't know how to drive, so i always had to use public transport to get to shows, I knew learning the guitar woudl get me mobile - I ended up loving it, and it changed how I wrote music.) - Instruments: Mainly BERETTA76, have done the occasional back up vocals with other bands and contributed vocals on others albums - Years playing: guitar, vocals, songwriter My role is the founder of BERETTA76, El Capitan, The Decider. Right now my set up is a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop played through a Marshall 50 watt '77 JMP 2204 2x12 combo. I had a moment once where my band played a room in D.C. To save time while I was handling business with the club, one of my band mates took it upon himself to help me out and set up my gear for me. After I got on stage for soundcheck, I distinctly remember a jackass from another band who we happen to be sharing the bill with that night making rude comments about whether my band mate was going to play my guitar for me and sing for me too. I wonder if that would have happened if I were a man? I think later that night that same jackass was informed by someone else that I was the founder and songwriter for the band as well. His response? \"OH. I didn't know.\" Apparently in his eyes I was just some \"piece\" yet another decoration for the stage whose main purpose was to make the band seem more appealing with my boobs and really just a great gimmick - a chick in the band. Does chauvinism still rear its ugly head? Yes. In music? Yes. \"I was given the advice of just to always be prepared for anything at any time. When you're starting out play anywhere to anyone - never turn down a gig. And as a songwriter you have to be willing to fight for your choices, for what you truly believe will work. As far as my advice for a woman just starting out? Write good material and they will come. That having a point of view and making sure to stand your ground is really REALLY important. Also, take advantage of the network of musicians around you and ask questions. If you don't already, go to shows, go to shows, go to shows and get to know the players. Most importantly be confident and completely FEARLESS. I was recently interviewed for the Rock and Roll Report. If you would like to know more about my views on women in rock you can find them here: http://rockandrollreport.com/women-who-rock-the-triple-r-girl-for-october-is-camille-escobedo-of-beretta76/\" I have always been a singer and graduated with a degree in music with concentration in voice. I chose the guitar because I felt that in order to write my own music and be able to collaborate with anyone or bring my original material to a band that I would at the very least need a vehicle for me to do it with. So I taught myself to play guitar. The rest I learned along the way...and still am learning. - Instruments: 1 - this one - Years playing: drums drummer / organizer / producer - we both control the creative descisions in our band.

If they don't know you, they will assume you can't play well, and will choose a male player most often, if given a choice. -Unless of course it's an all- female group, or when looks are more important than musicianship. I recently had an incident where I was in an excellent all-female horn section with a well known act. Musically, the band was very happy with the horns. There is a tour this summer I was supposed to be on, and then 'got the call' that the management wanted to use younger (sexier) women instead... The rest of the band is male, and the same age as me. They still have their job. Luckily, I am very well respected in the Biz, and I play with many groups that truly appreciate my musicality. So most often, for me, being a Woman does not normally make a difference. I feel like 'one of the guys'.\" Music education has gotten better and better, and there are so many more talented female musicians out there now than ever before, which is great to see - especially in the jazz world. As a trumpet player, it used to be a rare thing to see another female trumpet player- now it is much more common. (I've just never seen so many horn players in high heels and mini-skirts!- That's a generational difference!) \"My advice: Stay with it if you feel music is your calling. Be prepared, listen, and always keep learning. You can learn from all kinds of musicians- what TO Do and also what NOT To Do! Don't compromise your integrity. Learn the art of negotiating. Say something meaningful with your musical voice.\" Gut reaction as a child, and I wanted to play a 'boys' instrument. - Instruments: a bunch. they were all pretty bad. - Years playing: vocal/guitar/keyboard \"in the band, i'd say i have a musical partner (kyle ryan) that i trust implicitly and that we go head to head 50/50 on every and all decisions. it helps. on the business side, between my manager ty and i, we front the whole shabang and toss marketing back and forth. it works. it's a lot of work....and it works!\" various...mostly my acoustic guitar and a tiny keyboard of some sort....like an old casio with hot beats on it...my vocal chords...hand clappin and finger snappin...the usual... \"that's hard. i'm sure it's VERY different being a woman in the industry but i never really think about it as something that i need to overcome. i hang out with a bunch of dudes all the time so i guess if i was always thinking about being a woman/the odd one out/the different one, i'd be trying to prove something else other than what i'm trying to prove in my music. the biggest difference might be that i can't naturally pee into a bottle while we're all in a tour van. \" \"oh surely! i'm forever greatful to the women who spearheaded the women's rights movement to lead our gender to a place where i could feel that it is entirely possible to succeed on every level in my career. back then it just wasn't done. not really even thought of. women put on aprons and waited for their bread winners to come home and eat their dinners and watch their evening programs. there were fewer women leaving the homestead to go out and do things for themselves. being the minority always means you have to work harder than everyone else in order to open the door a little wider for everyone waiting behind you. that is surely the gift that those women gave to the generations that followed and that will continue to follow.\" \"my dad always told me that there was always going to be somebody better, so ever don't stop. ever. my advice would be much of the same. there are millions of people with dreams, the difference is between those who can ruthlessly chase them and those who don't. \" i can carry it with me wherever i go! - Instruments: Effervescent, Freeze Baby, The Deaf, Finger Pressure, Cadette - Years playing: Bass, vocals Equal with my two band members. \"fender jazz bass, kustom amp head and cab\" Of course there are differences but not particularly negative. When I was younger, I was often assumed to be the girlfriend of my bandmates. Most of the time, however, people are excited to see a woman musician so it makes playing all the more fun. I have played in an all girl band, all boy bands and combinations of girls and boys. Every experience has been different. Not really. There are many personality types of women musicians through out the years. Don't feel intimated if you are just starting out. I think girls/women are scared when they don't completely know what they are doing. But hey, we all have to start somewhere! Just get out there and play and don't be afraid to play a wrong note once in awhile. My best friend played guitar. His brother played drums. They needed a bass so I bought one at a musican's flea market sale. - Instruments: 2. My primary band for which I write songs for is called The Lightning Bugs. The band that I play the keyboard for is called A Pascal Circus. - Years playing: guitar, drums, vocals, piano I write songs, and sing them while i play guitar. I also play drums for songs that my boyfriend/band mate writes and sings. we switch on and off. also, I play some songs that i write for the keyboard. I make posters for our shows. I book shows sometimes. WELL...my first guitar got stolen by this kid named brian scatturo when I was seventeen. what a rotten jerk! I made do with an old acoustic that my grandpa gave me until a couple years ago. The action on most acoustics is too high for my hands, so it sucks playing them. The drum set and the electric guitar that i play now are technically my boyfriends, but he shares my keyboard, so all is fair. The electric is a fender jagstang in a cool blue that absolutely embodies the 90s. god, it's such a heart breaker. My keyboard is a yamaha P-120. basically, that means it has a real genuine piano sound and 88 weighted keys. i wish i could lug a real piano around with me, but i've moved like six times in four years. our drum set is a piece of shit, but the ride still rides, and when i want it to, it can crash like a magnificent garbage can lid being thrown down the stairs. I do. I mean, there have been a lot of female musicians, but a lot of women who have expressed themselves musically automatically got put into this Girl Rock category, and it seems like they did not get taken as seriously for a long time. It's like, unless you were a pop vocalist or a pianist, you were a threat to this boys club that ran rock n roll for a while. also, female musicians tend to get objectified because it's part of our culture to objectify women. for example, there is a band in our town with six men and one woman. that one woman is THE GIRL in their band. in our mainstream culture, women are still not expected to be in bands, so when a woman is in one, she automatically becomes this exotic Thing in a way. well, i see differences and similarities. patti smith and tori amos, for instance, are from two different generations, but are both passionate and poetic, and write songs about a wide array of subject matter. the birth of mtv and the subsequent popularity of madonna in the eighties was what really made image and beauty a more important part of music: it became a business. more importantly, bands like the x-ray spex, the slits, and the runaways set an early stage for women in punk rock. However, even though they wrote some songs about liberation and sexuality, their approach was more naive than the woman in the riot grrrl movement. I think punk rock so quickly went from being exciting and inclusive to violent and alienating. the women of the riot grrrl movement were more aware of what they were doing. that's why it's called riot grrrl, and not just punk rock. women right now in rock n roll seem so clueless and passive to me. so many of them play the synthesizer, and either play in a band with all men, or sing tame songs with mediocre messages. that's one difference! courtney love, for instance, refuses to sing like a little girl! she growls like a man, and it is very clear what her songs are about. girls right now are growing up listening to female musicians like hannah montana, for instance, who doesn't even write her own songs, which makes her a product in the role of a role-model. it's sick. i would say: have fun! be honest. pay attention to what you like and what you don't like about songs, musicians, and performers, and let those things influence you. always remember: the two kims, kim deal and kim gordon, made a life out of rock n roll, and didn't have to compromise their integrity! i chose to play the guitar and sing because it's fun, and it rocks, and it's a powerful form of expression. - Instruments: 3 - 8 Inch Betsy (2 versions and the Inpatients) - Years playing: Bass guitar I am the Bass player, back up vocalist, main contact and I book all the tours. Squier Bullet Bass and a Peavey TNT 130 \"Yes. I think it can be both more difficult and easier in different ways. Rock music tends to have a \"\"boys club\"\" feel. It can be difficult to gain respect and be taken seriously. We also tend to be promoted as a \"\"girl band\"\" or a \"\"chick band\"\" as if our gender is a gimmick. On the other hand, I think it can set you apart from the countless numbers of male bands. \" I think the women in music now (not all) tend to use sex appeal, especially in Top 40 music. I would say when starting out the most important thing you can do is play as many shows as you can for a diverse variety of people and not be intimidated by men....they can actually be your biggest fans. At the time a friend needed a bass player so I gave it a shot. - Instruments: Just me. - Years playing: Vocals/Guitar/Bass/Trumpet I am the ultimate decision on all the music/creative/business/mareting, however I do have a manager and agent who help me. I tour with Collings acoustic guitars, a pendulum parametric EQ/DI, a Sennheiser 855 microphone, a tuner pedal, an EQ pedal, and an octave pedal. Yes. It is different because of many reasons.. There are so many inherent differences between men and women. I think women run off emotion and instinct more so than men. Add a creative craft/full time job (like musician) to that woman and you have, well, even more emotions. 95% of the time when I am at a soundcheck, I feel like I am under a microscope of the venue staff. I am challenged by sound men in ways that men aren't. My requests are not taken seriously. I feel forced to choose to either \"act like one of the guys\" or be seen as a bitch with too much ego. This remains true in much of the music industry.. Radio, Music Conferences, Festivals, daily life on the road, truck stops, hotels, etc.. Some days I feel that as a female musician I have to be prepared to qualify my existence and your validity at every turn. \"I see more of an interest in women helping other women rather than a competing attitude. I remember a particular meeting i had in 1993 with a William Morris agent where he asked me if I could open for anyone, who would it be. I said \"Annie Lennox\" and he laughed and said a woman artist would never be an opener for another woman fronted act.. Four years later Lilith happened, so i guess he was wrong. And besides I think Annie would have said yes :) I also believe, especially amongst queer female artists, that there has been a huge evolution in generosity. I think Ferron paved the way as well as Janis Ian, The Runaways, and Fanny. Back when they started out you wouldn't have seen them on the same bill with another woman like you do now.\" \"Many people. My lyric writing teacher at Berklee College, Pat Pattison, was critical in my ability to believe in myself and my gift. Jodi Goodman (at the time a young promoter in Boston) connected me to Morrissey which essentially launched my career.. They gave me a chance and LISTENED to me. Ahmet Ertigen at Atlantic was kind and complemented my songwriting in a conference room filled with executives. Val Azoli at Atlantic pulled down a map of the US and said, \"Where are you selling records? In the Northeast. I will write you checks to tour there until you think you can't tour anymore, and then you WILL tour more.\" MANY other songwriters who I have opened for from John Gorka squeezing my neck saying \"keep going kid, you're good\" to John Hiatt smiling in the wings during my opening set to more recently Ani DiFranco telling me I \"killed it tonight\". Every small encounter of praise and encouragement to keep going.. Every bar tender who said they had never heard me before and they loved it.. Every record I have given away for free to the sound men who challenged me.. Every one of them has inspired and pushed me to keep making music. The advice I would give would be to never doubt what you know you are good at. Always trust your inner most instincts. Always believe that YOU know what's best for your music. I would advise any young musician to be versed in the business of music and to work with people they love first not necessarily people they think can \"get\" some THING. Things break.. Things gets lost.. Things fills holes. I think the job of the artist is to fill their own holes with songs and in return we get the pleasure of helping the listener realize and fill in their own.\" \"I think it really chose me. I bought my first acoustic the day I started at Berklee and haven't put it down since.\" - Instruments: 10? Played in 3 in highschool with friends (mainly just singing, my girl band was called Cookie Cutter Wet Dream Fantasy!) then in \"adulthood\" I played in Hem, The Bandana Splits, occasionally with Doveman, The King of France, PoinsonTree, Ben Weaver, Felix McTeigue - Years playing: guitar/vocals/keys/samples Sovereign, Band Leader, Diplomat, Peace Keeper. In the studio I can be part elementary school art teacher, part tyrant. In business I'm learning how to hold my own and in marketing I know what I don't like ... I hate self-promotion, I try to make it all into art but you can't always do that. It's really all about the people you surround yourself with in all of these situations. Live I play a BlueRidge Acoustic (w distortion pedals) Guild Starfire with flat wound strings through a Blues Jr. (with a Rvb pedal and occasional Distortion) and have a Boss Loop Station with pre-loaded samples. Sometimes I sample live too, if I'm feeling like it. I have a microkorg that I sometimes play and my drummer runs his vocals through a Kaoss pad to add effects. In the studio I work with all kinds of things. We have a Hammond x66 organ that sounds like it descended from outer space. A ludwig kit, a danelectro bass, I like to use M-tron plug ins for melotron samples and things. We have a rhodes and a wurlitzer, an accordion and a banjo. A few stringed instruments I cant even identify but have picked up in my travels and used in obscure ways on records. \"I think being a woman who is a TOURING musician is a completely different experience than being a man. At least in my genre of music. I'm so excited when I get to tour with other ladies, it's so rare. My husband is a musician too and it's impossible to imagine his life on the road surrounded by 98% women. When I'm out there touring I'm almost always surrounded by guys. I guess I didn't really think about it until that contrast was so close to me. Also, working for years in NYC recording studios, there were countless \"\"Ah ha\"\" moments. Mostly involving the toilet seat and penis drawings... There's a HUGE lack of women working in the tech roles (sound girls - I've been one myself), booking shows, running clubs, promoting shows, Managing Artists, rock critics. I really do wish there were more women in all these roles.\" I don't really know any older women in the music business. I wish I did. I'd love to see someone show me how it's done. I toured with Suzanne Vega when I was first starting out and I remember her laughing at me as I got a little car sick on a ride to a venue. She gave me this look like \"get ready... this is what the rest of your life's gonna be like:)\" I have a feeling it hasn't really changed much, although on the technical side I see more and more women interning in studios and running sound and lights at clubs... so that's exciting. I worked at a music festival for 2 summers when I first moved to New York and I asked all the performers for advice. Jonathan Richman said something I'll never forget...\"Play as much as possible. Play your aunts birthday party, play your friends porch, play as much as you can.\" I think that's good advice for any musician out there, boy or girl. A guitar is the easiest thing to carry around to gigs. If I could I'd bring my whole studio to the stage, the 1,000 pound organ and the delicate Optigan! I just don't have the resources to do something like that...yet, anyway. - Instruments: I have recorded with three bands: Nights of Key Largo, with Kenny Werner (piano), Billy Drummond (drums), Joel Frahm (sax), Jay Leonhart (bass), Romero Lubambo (guitar); Listen Freddie Bryant (guitar), Essiet Essiet (bass), Chembo Corniel (percussion) and Miles Okazaki (guitar); with Jason Ennis (guitar), Gary Wang (bass), Conor Meehan (drums), Victor Prieto (accordion), Todd Reynolds (violin), Ansel Matthews (backing vocals). I have performed live with many great musicians including Howard Johnson (tuba), Gene Bertoncini (guitar), Don Braden (sax), Kahlil Kwame Bell (percussion), Joe La Barbera (drums) and many others.... - Years playing: Vocals I am the band leader and the musical director. I am also a song writer and lyricist and arrange most of the music -- whether composed by me or not. In the studio I produced my first CD, Listen Love, I was produced by Todd Barkan and Tetsuo Hara for my second CD, Nights of Key Largo (Venus) and I co-produced my recent CD, Obsession (Motema) with Sue Edwards. I have a say in the business and marketing decisions of my career because I am lucky enough to be signed to a sensitive label who values my input. Mackie mini mixer. Digitech RV stereo reverb unit. AKH 535 microphone. Leads. I think being a woman, you are often judged on your appearance. Howard Johnson once told me about a band leader turning to him on a gig and saying they were going to call up a singer. He said his first thought was \"Oh dear!\" When the woman came on stage and was also beautiful. His second thought was \"This is going to be bad!\" But she kicked all their butts with her amazing singing. He said he learned his lesson then. When I was a journalist people who met me always assumed I wrote about fashion -- even though I actually wrote about serious issues like embyro adoption, the fur industry, and interviewed some really interesting figures like Elisabeth Kubler Ross and Jessica Mitford. As a singer I notice that other musicians (both men and women) often assume your arrangements are made by your band -- even though I arrange 90 per cent of what we do. So there's definitely a bit of a credibility gap to be bridged. That element of having to prove yourself is always a bit more daunting when you are starting out. But you get used to it, and it's fun to surprise musicians or people in the business who have never heard you before. There has definitely been a huge increase in women instrumentalists. Nowadays when I tell people I am a musician, they ask \"What instrument do you play?\" But the assumption only five years ago was always \"Are you a singer?\" Having said that, there's still room for improvement: Carla Bley, the amazing American composer, bandleader and pianist who has been absolutely gigantic in Europe since the 1960s was billed in a serious newspaper that should have known better as \"the singer Carla Bley\" the last time she performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London in 2009. Which isn't to say there's anything wrong with being a singer, of course, just that although they remain an important part of the jazz scene, they aren't the only thing. Jazz vocal legend Mark Murphy, my mentor for four years, used to say, he was always doing it for the love of it, not for any other reason. I think that is great advice. Imagine if Vincent Van Gogh were doing it only for the glory. There would be no Vincent. My advice to a woman musician would be the same as to any musician: Music is a means to expression, it isn't the thing itself. Life experience is what feeds and inspires the music. Otherwise you're like a kind of whirlpool spiraling inwards with nothing to say, except perhaps to other musicians. I think it has to be broader than that. As another of my musical mentors (Sheila Jordan) likes to say: \"You are the messenger, not the message.\" When young journalists used to come to me for advice when I was a journalist, I would always show them the big pile of rejection letters that I'd had before I became successful, and tell them to just keep going. Being a professional musician is the same. It's a marathon, not a sprint. There are times when you feel totally inspired and as if you could run forever. Sometimes you are ahead, sometimes behind. Just when you are so exhausted you're not sure if you can carry on, someone from the sidelines will cheer you on. Slow down for a while if you have to, but keep putting one foot in front of the other. And when it seems really tough, remember that's all grist for the mill and embrace it, if you can. My mother taught me to sing when I was three. One of my earliest memories is of performing grown up songs for her friends. I learned the piano from the age of eight until I was eleven or twelve, when my piano teacher suggested I focused on singing, because she loved my voice (and ...er ... also, I never practiced the piano). At twelve I taught myself to play the guitar to accompany myself singing and pretty much everyone I knew thought I would become a professional musician. However, at 15 I ran away from home and had a baby (and got married), which put a damper on my musical ambitions and I left my guitar at home. But I never gave up singing. All the years I was a journalist for UK publications (Times, Guardian, Elle, Vogue), I sang at home and sometimes for friends. Years later someone heard me singing in a gay karaoke bar in San Francisco and made it their mission to get me to become a professional singer. Three years later (in 1999) I had my first ever professional gig and now, three CDs and a lot of gigs later, here I am. - Instruments: Here Comes Everybody 25+ years, Sophia Starlight 1+ year, freelance drummer for Lea Kruger, Nicole Campbell, Currently I'm the new director of the Rex Putnam High School Kingsmen Thunder Drumline - Years playing: Piano, keys, drums, vocals I am the main music writer, manager, booker, PR person, backup singer, keyboardist/piano player and occasionally play drums (but since my husband is also a drummer and lead singer, he does the main drumming). When there are two drummers, someone (ME) has to write the songs. In the studio, Michael does the engineering. We make decisions together since we're married, but I do the lion's share of the business part. Keys: Korg Triton, Alesis QS8 keyboard, grand. Drumsets: (2) DW 5-piece drum kits, one is a cocktail kit, (1) Ludwig 4-piece kit, several snares (Tama, Yamaha, DW, Ludwig). (1) and a whole boatload of small percussion. Studio: Protools and an assortments of high end microphones. We record ourselves and others (Funny Farm Studios). Little Martin Guitar. I teach full time private lessons as well as do clinics in the schools, so I have a full drum studio. We rehearse a band so we have a complete mid-size PA. \"I hate to say it but yes. It's much more common now to see women in the music biz. In the 70's and 80's when I was young, it was much more competitive. I got alot of recognition for actually being good AND being a girl. Gender shouldn't have mattered, but it did. I've won contests by not only being good and being able to play, but it helped that I was a cute girl. Males used to and sometimes still seems surprised that I was a good drummer, because drumming is typically a more male arena. It's physical demanding and very outgoing. When I was in high school, the guys in the drum section always went off to get stoned in the \"\"scrounge lounge\"\" behind the school and left the work of putting away the drum set to me. I also was clearly better than one of the drummers who made it into Jazz Band in High School. There was an outcry from the rest of the females in the Jazz Band and I was let in. It shouldn't have been necessary, but the other guy did really suck. So, I had to be better than all the boys in order to ensure I didn't get left behind or left out. I think the earliest I noticed the \"\"novelty\"\" of being a girl drummer was in grade school. I was better than most of the boys to begin with, but seemed receive alot of extra attention because of it. I liked the attention, but I also just loved drumming. Still, though, when I tell people I'm in a band they perk up and ask \"\"Oh, do you sing?\"\".\" Definitely. In the 70's and 80's ya gotta remember that only recently the ERA movement happened and women could finally vote. So females were encouraged to branch out and be more brave. Burning bras was only the first step. Women in the 80's and beyond had to constantly challenge the norm. I guess we could technically go much farther back of course, but women as musicians are definitely having more opportunities to get good and get heard. But true musicianship isn't limited to gender. If you have the chops, you have the chops. \"Well, we paid dues and continue to pay dues and learn. Along my career, there have been too many experiences, too many different people to name who've helped (and disappointed) me. I think the most valuable lesson I've learned wasn't any one thing that someone said to me, but a continual learning experience. Advice to a woman starting out: Sometimes being a woman will work for you, but not all the time. Don't play the gender game. Become a really great musician, practice. Don't rely on being a girl and being simply \"\"OK\"\" to carry you. I get so tired of hearing how someone heard a fabulous female drummer (for example) and then finding out that she is not really that good. It gives us a bad name! But people seemed charmed by the fact that she was a she. Do you homework and BE NICE to people. Be professional....don't be a diva or princess. That shit gets around and you'll find that no one wants to do shows with you. More advice: If you take anything too seriously, especially music, it can eat you up. Find some balance. Don't lead the \"\"pain-is-good-for-art\"\" musician's life. I know both men and women who live in a studio apartment hovel and have no dental/health insurance or even a signficant relationship and are sad and bitter their more mature years because they didn't have something else besides music to keep them healthy and balanced. Last but not least advance: Enjoy music. Have fun. Make good music and make it the best you can in the moment. \" When I was in 5th grade (back when the music programs were actually strong) they came around the class and asked what we wanted to play. I spoke right up and said \"Drums!\". I have a degree from Lewis & Clark College and have studied with some of Oregon's top teachers (Don Worth Sr, Alan Jones, Mark Goodenberger, and Brett Paschal). For piano, I've always played and experimented since I was 4. Studied with Arlene Zeller and Lee Fricke (LC College). Drums are visceral. Piano is a melodic way to be percussive, only you have the entire orchestra right there so you can write songs! They go hand in hand. I still take advanced lessons in percussion. - Instruments: Timbuk3, Barbara K with various musicians - Years playing: i love to play guitar, bouzuki, and i sing Singer, songwriter, guitar player, leader, producer, engineer, mixer, owner of record and publishing company, founder and director of A4MD.org \"Guitars: Gibson Chet Atkins (2), Gibson Howard Roberts, Gibson Nighthawk, Martin Acoustic, Alvarez Yairi Acoustic, McGill Acoustic, Greek Bazouki, German fiddle, Studio: Soundcraft Spirit Genelecs, Yamaha eq, Various effects, ADAT multitracks, Neumann microphones.

Lead parts in SYmphonies and other works for SOlo SOprano and Orchestra\" \"lives in my body the voice I was born with the body that houses it\" \"Absolutely First of all there are less men so they get more work and are better paid. I don't know for sure but I bet they are not as harassed about their body weight, and I bet they are not as upset about getting older as women.

I write the songs, record them (the last record with the help of Richard Swift and some other dear friends), work with the label (Saddle Creek) on marketing decisions, and call all the business shots. This comes pretty naturally as the first two solo records I made (pre-Georgie James) came out on a record label I started, Laboratory Records. I'm used to having my hands in everything. I like it. I was definitely inspired by stories of women wronged by the industry -- and women who made their own rules and became incredibly successful (Nina Simone, Buffy Sainte Marie, Ani Difranco, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos). I'm not a gear head or a very technically savvy person. If I could single-handedly carry an old upright piano or fender rhodes everywhere I go, I would. But I'm not gonna win any strongman competitions anytime soon. So I play a Nord Electro through a Fender Twin amp. I've tried vintage-electric-guitar-up my sound as much as possible -- with the least amount of technical wizardry possible. I recently invested in a Neumann stage mic, but it doesn't do so well in most loud venues. Absolutely. I didn't used to think that way. In fact, I shied away from the \"feminist\" moniker for years, probably because I was hopeful that we'd already come a long way -- hey, everyone's equal now, right? But of course women still suffer from inequities -- pay inequities on down. In Georgie James, I started to get a real sense of some of the inequalities in the music industry. Things as simple as outsiders looking to John when asking a question (even though he and I were equal partners in the band, splitting songwriting and all other duties right down the middle) -- those were indicative of disparate treatment. I've been hit on, I've been asked really inappropriate questions. Thankfully it's the exception to the rule. And when things like that happen, I think, \"You wouldn't go there if I was a man.\" I think the indie side of the industry doesn't suffer as much at all. But the pop world? Wow. Thankfully there are ladies in all pockets of the industry who've been blazing trails for decades. So for us ladies making music today, it's probably /not/ that different from being a man. I definitely think there are generational differences between women musicians -- women who came up in the 60s definitely faced different pressures than I have. And the women musicians of the 80s and 90s have made it easier for me, I'm sure. If you look back historically, though, I'd say the women who have done what they've done -- not because of their sex, but because it's just who they are and what they do -- those are the types of women that are successful in every generation. Patti Smith, Carrie Brownstein, MIA -- brilliant ladies who put their brains into their music and look damn sexy doing it. My mom, who's got her MBA and doesn't work as a musician (except to accompany her gospel choir on Sunday mornings), has always encouraged me to be as creative and outspoken as I want to be -- but to do it with an eye for the business side of things. I think that's the best advice I've gotten. It's important to do your art. But if you want to make a living doing it, it's important to read the fine print, to know what the contracts say that you're signing, to think about investment and return. You're your own best advocate and protector, so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself -- or to say \"no\" when it's not in your best interest. And, as a woman, don't be afraid to put on some lipstick (literal or figurative) and flaunt what you've got. The world will love you for it. My mom is the daughter of a Methodist minister. She grew up playing piano in her dad's church -- hymns, spirituals and the like. We had a piano in our house when I was growing up and I started taking lessons from a friend's mom who also helped clean our house. I've tried my hand at guitar and violin over the years, but i like the linear design of the piano (all that math), and the percussive element, too -- all those hammers striking strings. My first job ever was reconditioning old pianos. I still haven't learned how to tune my own. I'll leave that up to the professionals. - Instruments: 4- Human Cock, The Look Ahead, Teith, Let's Pet - Years playing: Drums, keyboard, flute, guitar, vocals \"Band- Keeping the band productive. Scheduling practices. Socializing with other bands. Finding natural sounds and recording them to use in the studio. Studio- Keeping the band productive. Having a good ear and listening. Business- Getting shows. Keeping up myspace and facebook. \" \"4 piece Slingerland Drumkit, Chimes, Flute, Roland TR-505 Drum Machine, Singing Bowl Martin acoustic guitar\" Yes. I think that in many bands it is hard to be heard as a woman. There seems to be doubt once and awhile that what I have to say is good for the band. I attribute it to being a woman. However, as the drummer, I think i get a double whammy- See- the guys can tune turning practice- but drummers should do that before. and drummers should just know what they are gonna play rather than play around while writing a song to find the sounds they want to make. When I was a vocalist I found it very frustrating that I was not allowed to make decisions, or so I felt. We had two female vocalists (Human Cock) and the instruments were played by boys. The band eventually broke up over the feeling of sexism. We felt like the boys did not respect our opinions and often talked over us. \"I am not sure since I am stuck at age 33- in the middle now. I see more women playing istruments. I find it easier for myself to be in a band with others. When I was younger and wanted to play, I was often denied access by the guys in my social scene. They would tell me that I did not have stage presence. This was strange to me since I was an actress and vocal performer through out my school years. \" When I was learning to drive, my father told me to not worry about the cars around me. I would say the same thing to the other ladies. Don't worry about what people are doing, just do what you want to do. Grab and instrument and play. Grab a mic and sing. It is your life and if you have an inclination to share yourself through music or have a song in your head that is screaming to get out, you have to nurture it. I love the drums because it is fully interactive and loud. I aspire to make the drums an instrument that can carry a song and become a song within its own right rather than being a simple metronome. - Instruments: 1- Bari Koral Family Rock Band- also play solo - Years playing: vocal and guitar \"I'm the band leader- I make most of the decisions certainly from a business and marketing position. I do rely on my bandmates a lot for their musical input- how songs should go, which songs they prefer, that sort of thing. But mostly I have a pretty clear vision of what I want us to sound like. In the studio, which is a whole other animal, my bandmates have a lot of say- especially my bass player-who's first instrument is piano. he is brillant at that- a brilliant musician really so I rely on him a lot as a producer and music maker.\" gibson and martin acoustic guitar, jay turser electric guitar, fender amp i've been a professional now for about 20 years, and have been leading bands. Very recently I decided to get very serious about my guitar playing and take lessons and practice many hours a day. My guitar teacher also insists I be able to write out my own charts (which I have never done before) and basically encourages woman to not just be the \"chick singer leading the band\". since this experience I'm more saavy to that. I used to not mind- I relied on the men for so much. but now I really want to be a true leader in every sense. that means knowing what keys we are playing in, talking in the musical language that they and all their buddies know. also as a girl I had MANY relationships with the men in my bands. it does blur a lot of lines. now it's very professional and i'm glad about that. \"on some level I feel that some of the earlier generations were almost more empowered because they were writers: carly simon, carole king, join mitchell. I'm sure t hey had plenty to contend with being woman- but they could write and put together a whole song. some of these \"\"artists\"\" if you can call it that- springing from american idol who are not writers must be whole heartedly dependant on others, namely men, to put together thier look and sound. of course any artists that is empowered, be in man or woman can write their own destiny I think. i'm thinking madonna or lady gaga or Pink. not sure what happens behind the scenes but these woman seem like very take charge kind of artists. maybe that is easier for my generation then it was for the joni, carly generation.\" \"one person said that I was very talented and I needed to stay in the game because just by attitrition (i.e. others dropping away while I stuck with it and got better), I would make it. I see that happening- never thought it would be in family music because I used to just sing for adults- but here I am having a pretty rosy career at 41. also read an interview with tom petty recently who reinforced the idea that when you write- the verse and the chorus need to be equally good, as well as the bridge. so just aspiring high. I think if you work really hard at anything you can succeed. I'm 41 and I'm just really learning so much know about music and the guitar. sometimes I wonder if I applied this at 20, where I'd be- but who cares. just work hard- aspire-compete, in a great way with your best work, and with others best works. i'd tell anyone to work and just enjoy life. also there is life and there is our life's work. separating the two is a good thing. because at times your life works may not be going so well, but your life can still be going great. I think people really suffer when they can't separate the two.\" \"it kind of chose me. We were in canada in a mall with my dad and on an impulse i bought a nylon string guitar which basically sat under my bed for 2 years. then my senior year of college a roomate had a boyfriend who would come around and play guitar- and I said \"\"hey, I have one of those\"\". I dusted it off, he showed me some chords, and once I knew a little about how to play I was off and running. I always sang, even semi professionally so finally I had a way to accompany myself.\" - Instruments: The Nudes, Dar Williams Band, Richie Havens Trio and many others - Years playing: cello I started out with my own group called The Nudes and toured for 8 years and released three CDs. Then I became a sideman playing with Dar Williams, Richie Havens and other folk style songwriters. Now I am focusing on my solo career which is spoken word and cello. Finally - the focus is on finding my solo music. A 18th century Italian cello my grandfather bought for me 30 years ago, a newly minted carbon fiber cello made in Arizona that I amplify , and a cello from 2001 made in Chicago. A beautiful modern Beglian french bow for my Italian cello, a carbon fiber bow for my carbon fiber cello, and a french made baroque-style bow for my Chicago cello that is set up Baroque style. Various amplification and selection of cello cases and other gear. \"I was playing a festival in France a couple of years ago with Richie Havens - the folk singer. This was a major festival, there were scores of people around doing different jobs - mixing sound, moving gear, sound checking and I was the only woman in sight. If fact I think I was the only woman on stage that night despite there being multiple bands. Even the catering was all men, the drivers... It always strikes me how dominated touring is by men. If there are women they are headling their own band or they are a singer. To be blunt - if you are the hired gun and a woman (not a headliner) it's very difficult to have a family and tour. The headliner can take their kids with them and have a nanny, but for the person who is the hired gun - if you choose to play music it is impossible to have \"\"normal\"\" family life because you are gone for weeks or months straight and often on weekends and holidays.\" Like I said I hardly encounter other woman on the road so it's hard to speak to this. I quit my touring gig a year ago and I am focusing now on playing solo. A solo career at 50 for an alternative cellist? Believe it or not, it seems to be working. David Darling was my cello teacher (he just won a Grammy). He told me to play music with love. I have followed this advice and it has served me well. If you play music as a way of connecting to something large and wonderful - the rewards are inherent and it nourishes you internally. I am not rich or famous, but I have no regrets as I followed what I loved to do and I am proud of the music I have made. Gardiners Avenue Elementary School orchestra needed cellists and I was tall for my age (still am) so the cello was a fit - 39 years later and the cello is still the center of my life. - Instruments: 4 - Kitty Litter, The Last Forever, The English System, She Keeps Bees - Years playing: vocals, guitar, drums I am the songwriter - we are a two piece... Andy my drummer supports me without ego. it's a shared experience in the studio and in business - we have a deep trust in each other's ear and how we want to market ourselves. we got each other's back always. \"1979 American Strat - Antigua Hardtail 4X10 Hot Rod Fender Deville Tube Combo Amp Maxwin by Pearl set\" \"Yes, I think so, but it should be getting better... dear GAD i hope so! when i was in my bands in college very often we would load in and someone would direct the comment about the merch table to me. like there was no way i could be in the band. ALSO when at instrument/music stores... STILL to this DAY questions will not be directed at me... only to my father or my boyfriend ... anyone but the female. they also very often will not give me any credit for actually knowing what the hell i'm talking about. IT DRIVES ME INSANE! this past tour in Europe over the winter, i could name 4 maybe 5 shows where we saw other female musicians.. we played about 30 shows.\" \"I found my own way. i loved with all my heart the female musicians that inspired me. I tried to read and support and buy everything they did. I never really had one woman who told me anything. To other women musicians i say .. RIGHT ON SISTERS!!! .. keep going and keep doing what makes your heart sing. forget the bullshit... the selling yourself.. the sexiness or whatever they say is the right path... continue to stay heart centered and connected to the healing music gives. rock the fuck out sisters! hellyeah!\" i wanted to sing live...i didn't think back in 1994 i could play drums and sing... i thought only phil collins could pull that shit off. i was wrong. i felt like i sold out learning guitar - i liked being a girl who played drums. i almost felt like picking up a guitar would lead me to folk songs... a typical thing girl musicians were doing. i stayed with electric to set myself apart. i found bands in college.. all boys - i was always the only girl in our indie rock scene. then i left those bands to start a solo thing in NY... almost folk/country still with electric guitar. it wasn't until i found my now drummer that i allowed myself to just BE - stopped \"trying\" and let a natural process of songwriting happen.. leading to more aggressive/rock. - Instruments: I've performed with all majhor symphonies, practically, chamber music groups and my own show and band. - Years playing: Used to play violin, piano,the term \"vocals\" is a pop term only. We classical/oriented and theater and pop people prefer \"voice\" rather than \"vocals. What band? I am a singer and I have agents and representatives who present me in concert and I provid them with notes, translations, programming, advice about venues, timing, PR and tyr to get advice from the best there is to help me--as any manager should. Gear for what? Appearing on stage, concert, cabaret, personal appearances? It souds like whoever wrote this is 24 years old with NO background into music of any kind other than rock....Sorry to be so persnickety, but if you want \"class\" better get into the terminlology of a performing, theatrical, concert, operatic soloist. I think gender plays a part differently in many people. Some just \"are\" the way they are. Some flaut it when they prepare what they are going to perform, some just are comfortable with themselves and just are. In classical music there are first-person poems sung by a man and sung by a woman. One presents them in different ways to make it personable to the performer. When you perform one picks songs that fit personally, and integrally. Sometimes that in itself is a statement--but art and music is more universal and breaks down more barriers than that. Sometimes the barriers have to be spoiken of, or be aware of, or sometimes, one ignores and just proceeds and \"is.\" Depends on the marketing of yourself, and your material and the venue and timing of presentation, right? All of the above are similiaities and differences to some people. I think you mean to ask, if \"younger\" people are more aware of the depth and position of themselves in the bigger scheme and broader scope of things, and are aware of the past and where they fit into it. Of course if one is to be successful one has to know the past, good and bad, to be entiirely yourself and unique. Otherwise one can dillude onsself into thinking you are unique, when its been done and said long ago and maybe by better people...maybe not, in which case be AWARE of it all and where you stand in the midst of it, creatively and actively. \"A woman musician, is a musician who may happen to be a woman. That doesn't mean there is a sexual-bending nature of it necessarily, or a lesbian \"\"slant.\"\" any more than there is a homosexual slant to to male musicians. Music is music, musicians are musicians, each according to their own talent and perception and profesionalism and skill..creative or performing-wise those are all divisions that don't need to be divisive, nor even dwelt upon. We are HUMAN BEINGS, male and female with all the diferenes we have inherent and all the similiariities inherent in our particular human soul,with possiblily different points of view and slants. Some are things we would want and find it worthwhile to program on one given program and sometimes we don't need to dwell on that aspect of programming at all. One chooses to market those possiblities to whatever audience one chooses. Sometimes there is no difference in marketing \"\"female material\"\" than there is \"\"male material\"\" at all. Above all I do not want to see Androgenous. And a muddied outlook of the material I choose to sing or hear. That goes for keys, subject matter, presentaion, and so much more, right? I like to choose material on its own merit and to suit the theme of the program. Anyway, advice? Be as deeply routed in the appreciations and techniques of the past and present that or any matierial as deeply insightfully as you can. Have fun with it. If you truly apreciate it and comprehend the music you are performing you will find a way to make it be heard in the best way..whether it's you own music or someone else's. Practical advice, make sure you can proceed constantly, even if it is stop and go at times. Just keep at it and don't cut yourself off from loiving you life. Music is a refletion of LIFE for heaen's sake It's also to be a part of each other and to heal ourselves and others by being the way you are and letting and helping it to SHINE, for heavens' sakes. Do the making of it all your life.\" I am a singer..that is my instrument. I studied instrumentally, but my instrument has me by the throat.... - Instruments: far too many to name over the years - Years playing: voice I am getting a PhD in early music performance. not an issue for classical musicians Not really, in the opera world, you have more luck as a female musician. However, I have a very low voice and sing in the Baritone range. I also sing Bass in an all-female choir, so I have faced some prejudice there. People are much more willing to accept higher voiced male singers, than they will low voice female ones. It's hard to say... I don't think my advice would be much different than that I would give to a young man, at this point. It chose me : ) I came out of the womb singing, just about. - Instruments: Many - classical, jazz and world music alike. I currently tour with my own bands (The Biddies and Hey Sailor!) as well as with kids music star Dan Zanes & Friends. I perform in the NYC area with various other groups. - Years playing: double bass \"My own bands are set up democratically, all of us owning an equal share. I have a strong voice when it comes to the studio, hearing things in a particular way and enjoy both the push and the compromise it takes to make a record. In terms of the business side, I have a major role since I have past work experience in marketing. \" I play on an upright Pollman bass, use a realist pickup and a GK amp. I also play electric bass, using an old 60s Hofner. \"Yes, definitely. In many ways, it is impossible to get away from being a woman bass player since it is a rarity. So that alone brings a differetn kind of attention. I think it's interesting that when I tell people I perform in an all-girl quartet people respond with \"\"oh wow\"\" and what not, but never have I heard someone say \"\"oh wow, you perform in an all-man band!\"\" And that's just the start of it. When loading into a theater with gear women are treated very differently. There is a chivalrous aspect that includes helping with the load-in and then a very condescending and sexist aspect of \"\"let me show you how to plug in an amp\"\" type thing. Very frustrating! Lastly, there is the woman musician as sex object discussion which one could write a novel about (and probably has) so I will just mention it and leave it at that.\" Yes, I think the younger generations don't see obstacles in the same way. There is an assumed equality which might be post-feminist but I see it as a good thing. the result of all the women who fought and spoke up before us. Follow your heart and the rest will come. I was told that girls told play the bass when I was eleven years old and curious about the instrument, that sealed the deal! I also thought I would continue growing but alas, I am a mere 5 \"1 and a 1/2! - Instruments: This is the first group that I have ever performed with regularly. (outside of chorus in school.) - Years playing: Background vocals and percussion I try to take a really active role in most of the marketing decisions. With our band, if anyone wants to put their two cents in and make the effort to reach out and be involved, they absolutely are encouraged to do so. I was raised in a very business oriented family, not so much music (my parents are Persian restaurant owners) and I majored in business in college so I obviously have an interest in that side of it. I hope one day to continue my music career in music management or A&R. Something along those lines. Well, obviously, my main instrument is my voice. You can't buy that anywhere. I also play a variety of percussion instruments, such as the tambourine, and the cowbell. I'm hoping to work the triangle in there somewhere. I absolutely think that it's different being a man and a woman in the music industry. With our band, it's especially unique because we have 6 boys and 2 girls. It's a constant struggle to win over the crowd from a ladies perspective. Unfortunately, a lot of girls come to shows interested in cute boys on stage. I've been there. I'm not gonna lie. There's something sexy about anyone rocking out on stage, pouring their heart and soul out and revealing what I think is their true self. I remember the first time I saw Elijah, our lead singer, playing with his old band. There was definitely something about his stage presence that grabbed me. However, I think that it's important to recognize every person on stage for the music, regardless of whether or not you think they're sexy. Also I think the industry, as most do, treat aging very different for men and women. How many women have had their career take off past 30? Sure there are artists, god bless them, that manage to sustain it after that, but they almost always broke through and gained a fan base when they were younger. Again, absolutely. We live in an auto-tune, American idol world. There was a time when female artists were not neccessarily thought of as the most attractive to society, but had some of the most amazing voices heard to this day. You look at Patsy Cline, Aretha Franklin, Etta James... None of those women on paper are what our generation considers sexy. But every one of them has the ability to move you with their voices. You can feel the raw emotion that they put out with every note that they sing, and that's sexy and beautiful to me. \"I've defintely recieved some advice. Everyone has their two cents to put in. I haven't been fortunate enough yet to come into contact with many other female artists that have been succesful. I met a young girl last night in High Wycombe, UK, who asked if she could sing a few bars for me. Of course I said yes and she blew me away. She sang a verse of a John Legend song and it was beautiful. I told her then, just keep singing. I think that advice is universal, whether it's men or women. It's very easy to get discouraged in this industry. Most people would just as soon have you quit and work in an office somewhere, and you can never give into that. If you believe in something, go out and get it. End of story. \" I don't know if you could say that I chose it. I think that vocals are such an important part of music. In my situation there was a need for more vocals so I was lucky enough to fill the position. I would love to eventually play more instruments though. What I really want is to learn how to play a horn instrument. - Instruments: various Jazz ensembles, let by pianist Charles Sibirsky, guitarist Mike Gellar - Years playing: vocals I'm the leader when it comes to getting bookings and doing business. The buck stops with me. However, developing our artistic material, we're in a very collaborative and supportive working mode. Mackie 808S head, EV speakers, my old trusty Bayer mic, a Sennheiser mic for backup. Also a smaller, one-unit head and speaker that I take for small-room gigs and duo concerts, was sold by Sam Ash, a no-name Chinese product that serves me well. \"I've been raised by my single Mom to always feel confident and to know that I can do anything that any guy could do. However, I had to find out the hard way and to negotiate for myself, that being a young woman in the performing arts field comes with its special set of hazards and stumbling stones. \"\"Baby, I'm gonna make you a star...\"\" As a woman vocalist in the field of Jazz, I feel blessed by the fact that I can grow older and better, and nobody is going to hold it against me if I don't have the youthful looks of a Britney Spears -- or that I refuse to wear such wardrobe. Thank goodness, we have the great old dames of Jazz as role models throughout a whole century! I still find it difficult, though, making initial contacts with (almost always) male club owners and bookers. The sexism that's inherent in these unequal negotiation situations always seeps through. Also, I think a lot of instrumental Jazz groups, even the young turks coming out of the college scene have a \"\"dude kingdom\"\" aura about them that makes it difficult for women (instrumentalists even more so) to operate on equal terms, artistically and economically.\" Not that I'm aware of. I think, women always had to be fighters in the entertainment world. But I also experience a deeper sense of sharing and mutual support amont women musicians. \"Yes, I liked the indiebiz.com newsletters, blogs and publications by Dave Hooper. My advice: be consistent; organize your business end of your art; spend regular time on promotion and follow up. You'll be learning on the job and you'll be more in tune with what a venue needs from you, how to match your pull with your audience with the right-size venue; how to grow a following, how to establish good relationships and get repeat gigs, and grow and prosper with your music. Most important: I'm very much hoping for the long-awaited breakthroughs in health insurance reform. We artists need affordable health insurance for ourselves and our families. If we're no longer yoked to a day job for the sake of health insurance, we can free up more time for our artistic growth, and leave the existential dread of being ruined by an accident or illness, behind. \" I've sung all my life, remembering songs from all the way back when I was in diapers. - Instruments: too many to list -- a few NYC rock bands: Unisex Salon, Les Fleurs Tragiques, Laptop, Imaginary Johnny, The Countess & the C.U.N.T. Revolution - Years playing: drums, vocals, guitar, harmonica \"Now, leader. I make all the decisions, I front all the money. I gather the troops. I apply to festivals & book the gigs. Go over licensing opportunities & send out packages to labels. I write all the songs & am the \"\"star\"\" of the show. I do work very hard, however, to try to the musical performance a collaborative, both in terms of how we let songs evolve & come up with their sound & arrangement & also in giving everyone in the show moments to shine. I feel very adamant about making it collective in that sense.\" \"Drumset-- old silver sparkle Slingerland I inherited from my uncle, 1969 vintage Guitar-- acoustic is a rosewood Guild made in China; small bodied to fit me bought on Matt Umanov guitars in NYC Electric guitar-- red hot, small bodied music man guitar; purchased at an auction at the Goodwill near my house in Austin for $60\" \"Yes. My family has always been pretty supportive. But the current music industry makes the model: if you want to really do it, you have to essentially give up everything (money, stable jobs), get in a van, be broke & often smelly & sometimes inebriated & just keep playing 'til it starts catching on. That is much harder for women to do. They tend to be more responsible. And so having no money, no job, no plan, and doing something which is both hard on your family (if your parents still clean up your messes), or very hard on a boyfriend/girlfriend, it's just not that common. Women are better at accommodating than putting people out.\" \"Younger women are more fearless. But older women are tougher.\" \"Find a mentor. Lots of them. First, find a great teacher or soulmate who will help you develop as an artist. Who you are willing to take their advice & critique & change things around just to see who it works. This is the only way to get great. You can't be attached to keeping everything just as it was when it burst out of you. You have to be attached to being great. Second, the music business is more fragmented than ever & it's really hard to find people who will give you honest answers about how it works. Find someone who runs a successful label, or PR firm for bands, or booking agent, and get them to sit down with you & lay out how musicians in 2010 rise to the level of having a career. Call them up once a month to ask your questions. Be relentless. Know that some of these people will depress the shit of you, but others will give you a list of really valuable things you could be doing that most other bands aren't doing. Think of yourself as an entrepreneur & this as a business. (Hint: you got to sink money in at the beginning.) If you've made a great record, hire someone who can help you get it heard. I recommend an indie publicist. They won't break the band. But you could consider a radio campaign, an internet marketing campaign, or agent as well. Also, try to be friends with artists who a few steps ahead that might show you the way, let you open for them occasionally, and give your truest glimpse into how it works. Above all, educate yourself. But have your bullshit-o-meter on high. (A lot of people are clueless themselves & give bad advice, which keep you busy and focused in all the wrong directions.) Everyone who's ever worked with you on recording, performing, or promoting your music... make them your ally. And stay in touch!\" \"It chose me. I played other things when I was younger... suzuki piano lessons, then clarinet & saxophone in school band. Drums was the first thing that stuck. Either it becomes me, or 14 just is the age when I was ready to actually practice & not just play. After college, I became a closet songwriter. It took me many years to both get the courage to sing (to really develop my voice, unlock it physically & learn how to sing)-- and also realize that if I didn't perform my songs, they would never see the light of day. I was 31 when I recorded *my* first album. It just came out last year. It is good though. I fancy myself a late bloomer. Though I'd been playing music all my life, I didn't really give myself permission to do it 100% 'til now.\" - Instruments: 2 new music ensembles - Years playing: piano/ composition I compose and produce my own music. NA. Yes. During my schooling I was usually the only woman composer in the program. When applying for a doctorate program at one major university, I was instructed by the person in charge of the admission to apply for school of education rather than for a program in composition within a school of arts and sciences. The most important thing to keep in mind is perseverance! Believe in yourself and do (write, compose) what you and only you want to do. My family owned a piano and I just started to play. - Instruments: founding member of Togetherness, played a few shows with Young Dudes, All Strings University Orchestra at UW-Madison, orchestras at St Paul Central High and Ramsey Jr High, solo piano concerts (but haven't in a while) - Years playing: keyboards, vocals, piano, viola In Togetherness, I co-wrote much of the music. It started out as a 3-piece, which expanded to 5 people, but the later two people seemed to defer to the original three pretty often. We all collaborated, though, to create songs and come up with ideas about our shows and music videos. One guitarist, who also composed a lot of our (non-synth) electronic backing music, did a lot more for the band - he filmed and edited our music videos, recorded our CD, did all of the electronic backing tracks, and often was the point-person for booking shows, but other than that, I'd say we were pretty equal. Part of it was that he had more experience in the local music scene than the rest of us, and partly it was because he had a lot of energy to devote to it. Sequential Circuits Six-Trak, a vintage synth that my siblings and I got for Christmas in the mid-80s. I also have a mediocre viola for when I play in orchestras. \"Yes! I think that the assumption, when a woman is in a band, is that the men in the band added her because she's cute, or for sex appeal. Our musicianship is questioned, in that it is actually discussed, whereas most people don't talk about how well men play - it's generally assumed that if they sound a certain way, it's because they intend to sound that way, not that they're limited by technical abilities. It also seems like there are more female \"\"joke bands,\"\" which Togetherness was initially begun as. Even though we recorded a full length album and music videos to go along with the songs, people still considered us to be a joke band, and didn't take us seriously. I have a few friends who run record labels, and they never even talked to us about putting out a record, whereas it seems like a lot of \"\"dude\"\" bands start recording within the first 6 months of playing together. We didn't intend to go on tour or sell tons of CDs, because we all had day jobs that were more important, but we still didn't get much respect from the community for what we were doing. (Other than the ladies in the community, who were all very supportive.) When I talk with men about women musicians, they don't seem to think it's a big deal that the local music scene is almost entirely made up of men; they just see it as normal. Also, on a side note, guys in bands get chicks. Chicks in bands, from what I've seen... do not get guys (or any more guys than they would if they weren't in a band). I don't know if that reflects on women (being drawn to male musicians) or on men (possibly being intimidated by female musicians, or wanting to be the center of attention themselves).\" I don't have much exposure to other generations of women musicians. My band had three women and two men at the end, and I thought it was very helpful to have other women in the band. We talked about feminism and music and commiserated at times, and it was nice to be able to let off steam. A couple times, we've gotten together with more of the women in our music community, who are more involved, in more bands, and it is great to talk about music and our role in the community with them. There's less pressure, like you don't have to prove anything to hang out with them, and there's a camaraderie that comes with being a minority group within a sub-culture. I would advise other women to create friendships with other women musicians, and to try to have a band with at least one other woman. I think there may be less pressure if you're not the only woman in the band, and it also makes it seem more normal to have women in bands. Also, it's really important not to change how you act or who you are to fit in more with men musicians. If you want to look good on stage, you should go for it, wear something interesting, be engaging - you don't have to be another shoe-gazer who purposely looks like he doesn't care what he looks like. It's silly, and it shouldn't have any bearing on the quality of your music. I think it's always more interesting to watch performers who really put on a show, and if part of that is being feminine, so be it - it's not a cop out, or trying to up the sex appeal, it's just a woman doing what she loves to do. I was three and a half, and everyone else in my family played the piano. I was at a recital for my older brother and sister, and their piano teacher asked at the end if she had missed anyone who wanted to play. I marched up to the front and she led my fingers through something simple (Mary had a Little Lamb?) while I beamed at the audience. My parents decided soon after to start me on piano lessons. I picked up the viola in 4th grade because we had the option of starting an instrument at school, and I thought the violin was too screechy, but the cello was too big. I might have been influenced by the fact that my brother played violin. - Instruments: I've been in one other band called Skort, and done some minor collaborarations - Years playing: Keyboards and vocals For decisions, the band runs on consensus, or when that's impossible, by majority-rules. I personally handle a lot of the business aspect. We have a full team (manager, label, publicist, agent, etc) but we remain very involved in the business and marketing side of the band. I write music and on occasion lyrics, and in the studio I record everything myself. I play a Roland JX-3P and a Super Jupiter. I use a Roland Jazz Chorus amp. Only in the ways that anything is different between being a woman or a man. People will approach and react to women and men differently, and that happens in the music industry too. The best thing you can do is know your stuff. Know your gear, know your instrument, know what you want in business, know what's important to you and what your values are. I've always felt like older, analog gear is much more authentic sounding for the type of music we play. I am not interested in having a laptop on stage (not to discredit anyone who does, because for some kinds of music it makes sense). I also prefer to not have too many things going on at once, so that I'm not totally distracted with the technical aspect of performing and can fully engage with the crowd and my bandmates and enjoy the music we're making. - Instruments: Just in War Tapes - Years playing: bass and vocals I am a co-writer, musician, and we all split business/creative decisions equally \"1967 Fender Mustang Bass 2009 Fender Mustang Bass Reissue Ashdown Amp\" I do think that people assume you won't be good at your instrument when you are a female. I get a lot of guys coming up to me after shows saying \"wow you really know how to play bass\" like they were shocked or something. I think it's funny. Music should be fun. It choose me - Instruments: Mirinesse Women's Choir, Community Chorus of Port Townsend,WA, RainShadow - Years playing: choral conductor choral directors choose all the music, figure out how to teach and present it and 'market' it women have to be at least twice as good in choral conducting to be recognized I was a singer who always sang in choirs and the role of conductor naturally evolved - Instruments: I was in Slot with my late husband, Billy Rivkin, and am now in Luder. - Years playing: \"Vocals and bass\" We are all on equal footing. Nobody fights for a greater percentage of the credit. We all have something to bring to every song. There is no 'head songwriter'. Additionally, we have very talented and experienced friends in the studio side of the business and had a fantastic experience recording Luder's debut release, Sonoluminescence. Small Stone Records does a lot of marketing for our release, as any label should, but we get a lot of support from my business partner and significant other in the realm of marketing, in our web presence, in the ever-increasingly important use of social media. We also have a decent fan base from our old bands who have come to follow our latest endeavor closely. There's a lot of history here. Multiple bass guitars, a giant speaker cabinet, a head, a compression pedal and a tuner. I don't place a great deal of importance on gear like lots of rock guitarists do. Their effects pedals and toys seem to be such a distraction. I go simple. My basement contains the equipment of several bands on the Small Stone Records label, but we're the only ones who rehearse and compose there. I don't know that I've thought of things that way at all. I don't feel that anybody has an ounce of credibility as a musician if they don't bring something valuable and unique to the process. There's the stereotype out there that girls can't rock. Whatever. Listen to us or watch us, THEN pass your judgement. Different generations are different. No mystery there. I'm not interested in the 60s in America, either as an era or as a culture, but there are some things everybody goes through. We all have personal lives with tragedies and victories. Things go right, things go wrong, we all get older, and we all try to live through it. People make music along the way, women and men. I might be able to give you an example or two, but I have to say no. Slot was aggressively courted by some major labels. All of them sat at their conference room tables with us looking for a way to market the pretty rock chick. They wanted to know if I'd ever been raped, if we had drug problems, tattoos, abusive family lives, broken homes...they wanted to find a hard-knocks story to frame us for the music market. We didn't lie to them. We all had families who loved us, no tattoos, no violence, no rehab, nothing the major labels could exploit like they did with someone like, say, Fiona Apple, the molestation victim. So no, nobody in the industry had much of anything valuable to contribute at all. We made our own way and did just fine. Nobody tells us what to do, and we enjoy that freedom. \"I am a multi-instrumentalist, since childhood, but bass has been the way I fit into a rock group. I have a great deal of control over what I want to accomplish that way, and in my vocals, I can push a song even further. People are not singing to music that sounds like ours in the way that I sing.\" - Instruments: Judy Niemack Band, Peter Duchin Orchestra, Larry Elgart Orchestra, Various big bands and small jazz groups. - Years playing: vocal Leader, producer, manager Neumann 105 microphone, Lexicon jam-man It's different for every individual. Perhaps it is easier in some ways as a woman because most of the people in power positions in the industry are men, who basically want to impress, protect or exploit women rather than compete with them. This can be an initial advantage, but it always has to be followed up with genuine talent and skill. The disadvantages are in dealing with occasional assumptions that you won't be as skilled as a man, or that if you try to lead a group or take control that you're not feminine, but that old stuff comes up in any job. In a big band, there is a bus-full of men, and one or two women, and there you'll see the difference in the jokes, card-playing, and drinking habits, but fellow musicians in jazz respect the most important thing: musical skill. due to being a woman. And in the last 20 years I've seen a big change taking place in jazz big bands. Women don't have the same doubts and fears that were there in my generation, they're educated (thanks to programs at the university level which are now available, because of teachers like me who developed them), and many more are playing sax, drums, trumpet (Ingrid Jensen is a great role model) and the traditionally male instruments. In the vocal jazz world the development of singers as composers and improvisers is also strong. It's exciting! Study hard and practice so that you are on an equal level with any male musician, be prepared to prove yourself, and enjoy it, and take your talent seriously. I was gifted musically, and always sang. I decided to focus on singing professionally at age 17, and studied to be a classical singer before focusing on jazz and improvisation. - Instruments: Coosh, Slow River School, The Cookers, and many more loose amalgamations - Years playing: keyboards and vocals \"my band is quite democratic, we all have the chance to take part in all decisions, though as in any any group of people there are some strong personalities that dont always agree and that can be quite hard to negotiate. Im in a band with three men and our manager is also male. my role in the band: in the studio: i am very involved in the creative process, we each write what we play but we write together, which is important for me as i need to be expressing myself within the music, not just playing what someone else has written, this is particularly important for me as i dont want to feel like i am just there for decoration. in business and marketing: I am less active in this side of things, we are consulted and our views are valued, but i dont at the moment creatively contribute much to this side of things.\" three Synthesizers: MicroKorg, Roland 201, Korg Prophesy. \"Yes i definitely do. Its something I am thinkging about more and more. I feel a constant battle to be valued on the same terms. Because of commodification of the female body in contemporary culture, how a woman looks seems to be an integral part of how they are valued, i personally find this very difficult. I am still trying to figure out what to do about it, how to be a performer without playing into that but playing with it, and trying to break new ground, trying to provide an alternative, something I am only newly getting a handle on. Bork is definintley my hero in that respect. At a Yo La Tengo gig this year i over heard a guy saying female drummers are so sexy, it really annoyed me. It is part of a more universal issue, the interpretation of the world from the male perspective. I think it is changing but slowly. While female musicians are more and more common, the music world is still primarily male in my experience. I don't how many times i have been the only girl in room full of bands. Also just recently in this years SXSW, my band was being introduced in a circle of people, i had to actively include myself in the introduction as the people who we were being introduced to just presumed it was only the guys. i saw very few female musicians at that festival and any that i did, i felt that we should be playing in a band together, expressing ourselves, strengthening the female perspective, but then that is a difficult task because of the patriarchal framework surrounding it all. (sorry if its a bit rambling, I just got back form SXSW and am quite jet lagged!)\" this is something i need to think about a bit more, be fearless in your own self expression it was an organic thing, my mum is a piano teacher and while i have never been classically trained, i have always tinkered around on the piano, one night when i was 18 my friend Terri asked me to come and rehearse with his band the next day, they were looking for a keyboard player, for some reason i said yes and that was the beginning! - Instruments: a few, but mostly Earlimart, and now Admiral Radley - Years playing: bass, piano/keys, voice \"My role in Admiral Radley is just being a quarter of a fun group of awesome people. We all really do everything equally. My role in Earlimart evolved over the years - became increasingly larger as I started writing and contributing more and more. Now we're partners in that musical endeavor. Studio-wise, I'm co-producing the songs with Aaron - but he's pretty much turning all the knobs. I've picked up a lot over the years, like editing, etc, but technically, it's his world. Business decisions are democratic.\" Fender p-bass, Yamaha Motif keyboard, various other keyboards, ampeg amp, etcetc \"Maybe that was the case at one time, but I don't think it's that much of an issue now. Other than some good healthy PMS possibly getting in the way of a good day, girls and boys both have the equal challenge of writing good songs and playing well/creatively. If you're a girl and you feel that you've not been received well by people because you are a girl, I highly suggest either surrounding yourself with a different crowd, or considering that it might not be your gender that is the problem.\" I guess it might have been difficult to sing in a corset at one time. \"No one ever gave me any advice about the music industry per se, but my parents always told me to work hard at whatever i decide to do. I would say to another woman to find a way to do as much as you can on your own and don't wait for someone to come along and solve all your problems for you... but I would say that to a boy too. I guess, just to the ladies: drink lots and lots of water. And if you're touring with a bunch of boys, be their sister. Don't demand special treatment. But don't lift anything heavier than you are... I learned that one the hard way.\" \"As far as piano, my mom's a piano teacher, so that one's no surprise. As far as bass, the guy that played bass in the band i was in way back when left town, so i picked it up.\" - Instruments: played with several bands around home from high school on through my early 20's, my 7th year with DBT's - Years playing: Bass and vocals We work as a democracy in every aspect. We really do work together to make decisions about our work. We all have free creative range when it comes to studio as well. No one tells anyone of us what to play or how to write or sing. It's very close to us all being able to do whatever we want, and it actually works. All of our opinions count equally. I play a Fender Precision bass through an Ampeg SVT/4-10 cabinet combo at our live shows these days. I love Fender and Ampeg! I don't believe that there is a difference. When I was a teenager, I felt like maybe I had to work a little harder to prove that I was a real player. I knew I could play, I just had to convince the dudes to give me a chance. Once I got past this, I did have a ton of support back home though. I was lucky to have some pretty incredible mentors. Mostly men, a few women. The beautiful part of making music, is that it does not matter if you're a man or a woman, a kid or an adult, what color or race you are...it's truly the Universal language. \"I don't know if there are more women musicians today or not, but I do think that maybe there are more ways of knowing about them. Television, internet, etc. I guess it seems more acceptable today. Maybe this means that women feel more confident and comfortable doing what they do. It's ok to be talented! As the years go by, becomes more and more ok for women to be independent and hold careers of their own and this includes musicians. \" My dear friend Spooner told me once two very important things.... \"The more stuff you have, the less you need\" and \"take more pictures\". I would pass this along to anyone just starting their journey in the music world. And to just always do what you do the way you do it. Don't be confined to one style or sound, but don't lose who you are. Always study, practice and go see as many live shows as you can. And learn to say \"thank you\". The feel of the bass has always caught my attention. When I was a kid learning how to make chords on the guitar, I would always throw the pick down and play bass lines. (Mostly playing along with Creedence Clearwater Revival cassettes) I don't even think it was the bass line itself that grabbed my attention, just the way it made me feel. Luckily, my Daddy recognized this and got me a bass for my 12th birthday. - Instruments: I am mostly a solo-artist. - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, drums I am a solo artist, mostly, although sometimes I play with a wonderfull drummer, in which case I mostly write the songs and he makes inspired beats around / within them. I've recorded most of my albums at home, on my own. Whenever I've worked with someone in the capacity of engineer, mixing or mastering, I've always sat in and had final say over how things will sound. I am the sole proprietress of my music-making as a small business. This evolved out of years of playing music as a hobby while maintaining a day-job. The stress was too much. It was like living two lives. I've been playing mostly the same Seagull guitar for about nine years. I've enjoyed using BPM microphones. That's about it. I now have an electric piano, mostly for home-use, that replaced the Kranich & Bach spinnet I played for five years and could no longer move with. I don't feel a difference within myself. The main difference I've felt is that when I travel, so many other traveling musicians and promoters are men. Sometimes I don't want to be around so many men; it feels unbalanced. Maybe the men feel the same way. I've received a lot of crappy advice about navigating the music industry. People get really tense around that stuff; there's an idea that there's this narrow opening to squeeze through if you're lucky but I don't feel it like that. Creativity is a continuum and worry is its adversary. My advice to a woman musician would be, don't worry about being a woman. Focus on being a person. Find your grounding and learn how to maintain it. Don't let others with more 'experience' bowl over your own intuition when it comes to expression. Don't worry about others' timelines when it comes to your version of success. I conclude by saying -- I do not authorize anything I've written here to be published / spoken over the air in conjunction with my name. If I can be of any help in person, please let me know. I ask that my reponses are not edited in any way for content. Please inform me as to when this program will air in respect for the time I've taken to reply. Thank you. Singing feels good vibrating through my body; guitar-playing feels good vibrating against my body. I feel the instruments have chosen me. I never felt built to play wind instruments. - Instruments: Rhett Miller, Glenn Patscha, Ocean Carolina - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica I despise the business aspect, so I let my partner do that. I schedule all rehearsals, pay for the band space, and book gigs. I write the songs ( with an assist here and there ). I run rehearsals for the most part, with lots of input from my band. Gibson J-185, Takamine acoustic, Fender '52 re-issue Matchless amp, Hoehner harps, Steinway M class baby grand Yes , it is. You are expected to know less about gear and studio knobs ( guilty ). People are shocked to hear I write the songs myself, as my band is made up of males ( although at one point I had an all-female rhythm section). I do have a band of male musicians who are better instumentalists than I am ( fairly typical, Im ashamed to say)The boys see me as talented and competent, but talk bands and gear and basically leave me out of the conversation. I hump the majority of the gear to gigs on my own ( even theirs ) and pay for all expenses, but that's a function of trying to maintain control of my band, and my music. I notice it the most in the studio, where I know very little about the recording/production process. I would behoove me and other female musicians to learn more- you want to have that knowledge in the studio to get what you want. Knowledge is power. well, certainly the trailblazors made it easier on the rest of us. And now, aside from what I describe above, it seems to be a fairly level playing field, in terms of being able to achieve notoriety and success. \"yes, many. Mostly misguided, and mostly people in the business. Just be authentic. Trust your instincts. Be honest and who you are, and your audience will know.\" was forced to learn piano as a kid, learned to play guitar because... well, all the musicians were doing it, and it was easier than carrying a piano around. Harp because it can really flesh you out when you are playing solo. - Instruments: Musique Noire, several community orchestras, Detroit Jazz Orchestra with Strings - Years playing: violin and flute I am the bandleader, manager and publicist. In the studio, I am executive producer and producer/arranger/writer. I make about 90% of the business and marketing decisions for the band. Violin is a 100-year old \"step-up\" student instrument. Flute (which I don't play as often anymore) is an Armstrong 800B. I use Fishman pickups and pre amps and I have a Kustom brand acoustic amp. Definitely. It became really clear when I started Musique Noire. I was noticing that men in the jazz/world genre seem to be less comfortable (not all of them, of course) working with women--particularly as leader. I've had some issues with men taking direction from me. I did not notice this as much when playing classical music. No, I think each generation of women musicians are striving for the same goal. We all want our unique voice to be heard. The advice I received would be the advice I would give: study your craft, learn about the music business, be open to others and ready for new opportunities. Be able to articulate your vision, but it's o.k. if that vision is flexible. Be a lifelong learner. Be careful to whom you give your trust because there are many, many people out there that are jealous and do not have your best interests at heart. Meditate and pray before making any decisions. \"Piano: I started taking lessons with my mother, Mary Walton, when I was very young. Violin: a teacher came to our classroom in elementary school and stated she was going to start string classes. I was intrigued. Flute: I had an intense love affair with the Jackson 5-- and in particular, Michael Jackson. Berry Gordy, then president of Motown records, lived exactly two blocks over on the same street that I did in Detroit's Boston-Edison Historic neighborhood. I was determined I was going to meet my husband, Michael, some kind of way. I heard the song \"\"Never Can Say Goodbye\"\" and there was a flute on it. Somehow I thought I had my ticket to meeting the boy of my dreams. True story.\" - Instruments: solo artist - Years playing: vocals and acoustic guitar I am the songwriter/ singer/ booking agent/ co producer/ manager/ I am doing it all myself at the moment and ... I need help!!!!! I have an Australian guitar, Maton acoustic. It is a fantastic sounding guitar . Yes i do think it is very different. People are generally more agest and I think it is just harder for woman in the music business. Dealing with a male dominated business being a woman is a challenge in its self. You have to be very resilient determined to keep afloat in the music business. Also most the men that want to help you 99% of the time want to sleep with you! I am noticing that the younger woman coming up in the business are more independent and have good management skills.. They are not relying on record labels and people to make it happen for them. I think this is mainly to do with the massive change in the music business. I think it is a very good thing and give you more control of your career. Yes i have been given lots of good advice. I would say write, write write, play as much as possable. Do it yourself and don't wait for someone else. I say that from experience I think I would be more successful if i had known how important it was to build your fanbase and from the ground up. I was signed with major labels just before the change and I as advised to not play and let radio do the work.. but radio ever picked me up so I am still building my fan base. Once you have an audience you have a career! I first learnt guitar at school when I was only 8 years old, then got into piano but once i left home and only had my guitar to travel with, guitar became my main instrument. - Instruments: 1 (solo singer-songwriter) - Years playing: voice, guitar Like so many indie singer-songwriters, I'm secretary and CEO - and everything in between. It's an enormous amount of work, but it's also so incredibly satisfying to know how every facet of my career works. I have worked with great managers, booking agents, publicists, and interns - but no matter who comes and goes, it feels so grounding to know that noone can take away the knowledge and skills I have learned over the past 10 years of doing this. My career truly feels like it's mine - from top to bottom. I am not much of a gear \"nerd.\" People in airports (99% of them men who are clearly so passionate about guitar) always ask me what model I play. I tell them that I have a small-body Martin 000-16 acoustic, and then they tell me what they play, and I nod and smile, but I truly have no idea what the model numbers mean. I also have a great Larivee guitar (don't know the model - typical :) - that my friend Melissa Ferrick gave me. It has a big crack down the front which is probably bad, but it looks badass. It's become my writing guitar since I stopped touring by car and started flying out for weekends, and therefore couldn't bring 2 guitars anymore. I think it feels dejected that I don't take it on tour with me anymore. It stares at me when I come home. As far as electrical gear, special pedals etc...I am pretty simple. I have a tuning pedal, and that's pretty much it. I think I have always been pretty intimidated by \"gear.\" I'd love to get over that. When I walk into a music store as a pretty preppy looking woman to buy strings, picks, anything for my guitar, they usually always assume that I am a soccer mom buying stuff for my son's guitar lesson. It's hard not to feel like I don't belong in there. \"Not necessarily. I think women have enjoyed an enormous amount of success over the past number of years. In fact, I think before John Mayer came onto the scene, women singer-songwriters were faring much better than men. Men seemed to do great in bands, but they seemed to have a harder time making it work than solo female singer-songwriters. Now the playing field seems far more level to me. I think that if you are good at what you do, gender doesn't seem to play much of a role any more (except when you are buying guitar strings on a Wednesday afternoon in Tempe and they expect you to know nothing about music :)\" I play a lot of women's festivals and get to see a number of crazily talented artists who are from the 1970's women's music movement (Kris Williamson, Tret Fure, Ferron). Of course, that world was far from the mainstream back then (just like much of the indie scene is now), but I think those women were a HUGE reason that artists like me have the audience that we do. I have no doubt that so many of those women experienced so many more closed doors than so many of my peers and I do - and as a result, it's no wonder that these artists are still playing primarily at women's festivals even though I think their music would be so well-received by men and women alike. A manager I met with once when I was first getting started told me that no matter what you do to \"network\" - whatever connections you make in the music world are really of no consequence if you don't do you work. We have so many tasks to take care of in this job - mailing out press kits, updating Facebook, emailing fans, trekking to the post office 3 times a day sometimes, recording albums...but the MOST IMPORTANT thing is that we write GOOD SONGS! I think I would pass along that same exact advice. Writing good songs is really our only crucial job. Everything else is ancillary. I had always been a singer in a cappella groups, high school bands, etc, but I never played an instrument. I studied classical voice from when I was 9 until I was 19. When I quit, I went out a lweeke later and bought an acoustic. I wanted to be able to make music even when there was noone there to play for me. I loved the sound of guitar - and I loved that it would grant me the autonomy that I was craving. Plus, it was a heck of a lot more portable than a piano. - Instruments: I have been in 6 bands. None are really worth mentioning except Pistolera which has been the most successful. - Years playing: lead vocals, band leader, songwriter, guitar, guiro, jarana I am the founder, leader, songwriter, musical director, guitarist, singer, and cheerleader of the band. My husband is our producer and recording engineer. I used to be our booking agent and manager as well,but when I got pregnant I got people to take over those positions so I wouldn't have to wear all the hats. I play a small mexican guitar called a Jarana that is from Veracruz, Mexico. It uses fishing line as stings. I play guiro which is a gourd and rake set used in a lot of merengue music. I play a gibson standard electric guitar. I sing lead vocals and write all the songs. I am left-handed. \"YES. In Pistolera in particular because we are 3 women in the band. There are too many stories to recount, but the one that sticks out is once after soundcheck we were outside the club and when we tried to get back in the bouncer did not believe that our drummer was the ACTUAL drummer of the band. When we said, \"\"didn't you just see her soundcheck with us?\"\" He replied, \"\"yeah, but I thought she was just joking around.\"\" The funny part is that it happened to be a battle of the bands show and we won. We have encountered many a stage hand or sound man that think we don't know about how gear or PA systems work. Then the show starts and our music and professionalism speak for themselves. \" There are as many differences between generations of women musicians as there are in other areas. 20 years ago, there weren't that many female drummers. Now there are more. \"I have been lucky to work with and meet many great people in the industry who have given me some invaluable advice. 1) Follow the love. In otherwords, play where people invite you and want you. If you are not having success in Boston, don't force it. Follow your success. (Pistolera has been on tour to Belgium more times that it has played New Jersey) 2) Every overnight success is 10 years in the making. Keep at it. 3) Every shot you don't take is a shot you miss. 4) Don't ever give up 5) Don't pay no mind to no haters\" I was forced to play the piano at age 5 and begged to take guitar lessons. My dad bought me my first electric guitar at 13. It was right handed. I strung it upside down and haven't turned back since. - Instruments: Amanda Monaco Quartet (aka Deathblow), Playdate, Numinous - Years playing: guitar I am the bandleader and main composer in my quartet; my quintet, Playdate, is a communal effort. I make all of the business and marketing decisions for my quartet, and for Playdate we collaborate on all business- and marketing-related issues. My main guitar is a Brian Moore DC-1 thin-line Hollow Body guitar, which I play through a Fender Vibrolux or Princeton amp. I use an Ernie Ball volume pedal, a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler, and an Ibanez Tube Screamer distortion pedal (on occasion). I think there are definitely differences in gender when it comes to music; however, I have felt it more in the straight-ahead jazz scene than in the avant-garde jazz scene. For some reason, straight-ahead jazz still has a vibe of being a \"boys club\" when it comes to female instrumentalists, almost as if to imply that in that world, only vocalists are female. I have had more straight ahead male jazz musicians make inappropriate gestures towards me than avant-garde. It also might have something to do with the fact that I play guitar, where the ratio of male guitarists to female guitarists is quite high, and misogynist comments still work their way into the guitar magazines on a regular basis. It just seems that the younger generations have more women jazz musicians, which is great news. \"My college guitar teacher, Ted Dunbar, always said to \"\"keep on going, straight ahead\"\" - words that have stayed with me through the years that inform all that I do in this crazy business of music. The advice I would give to a woman musician just starting out (aside from what Ted told me) is to make sure not to get frustrated by male peers who may be bullying out of jealousy. Sexism hasn't disappeared, to be sure, and it can be so damaging to a young woman, especially one that's heading off to music school which can be stressful regardless of gender.\" My father was a guitarist and he inspired me to pick up the instrument. - Instruments: Roscoe Freund Art of Swing, Rebecca Carlson Trio - currently - Years playing: piano & vocals Pianist, arranger, producer, composer, lyricist, agent, publisher, promoter Yamaha YPG 625, Fender Passport PA, Shure 57 mic, cords, etc. Sexism is alive and well everywhere, no matter how much the media scream that \"you can have it all\" to women. Men have a built-in support system and a tradition of excluding women from better positions in orchestras, bands, studio recordings and just \"hanging out\", which is where a lot of decisions are made concerning employment. Many older bandleaders are just more comfortable hiring other men and don't even consider a woman to fill a chair, even if she's a superior player to a man. It's still generally accepted thought that women have other (higher) priorities with their family than their careers, and that they don't \"need\" the paycheck the way a man might (to support his family). Younger women ARE being more accepted in the musical workplace, altho it's still an uphill battle to be recognized and hired. Younger musicians in general are not as capable or well-schooled as older, more experienced musicians, and this is as true for women as for men. Ageism is hitting my female colleagues MUCH worse than my male musician friends. My college professor told me to retain my copyrights as much as I possibly could - this prevented me from making deals that would probably have led to much heartbreak ultimately. Given the current state of the music industry, there isn't much I feel qualified to give as advice to young women starting musical careers, and when I've tried to show support and give feedback to my juniors, I've felt dismissed and devalued by them. The only valid advice I can give anyone at this point is: \"take care of your teeth - you're going to need them your whole life!\" always loved the piano, which I first encountered at my grandma's house - saved my allowance for 5 years to buy my first upright at age 10 - Instruments: My band has had at least 12 iterations and members over the years - Years playing: guitar, vocals, keys, percussion \"I am the singer/songwriter/guitarist and arranger in the band. In the studio i currently co produce and in a few songs am sole producer and engineer as well.\" Guitar(s), cables, effects box for guitar, microphones and mic stands, bass, shekere, often a cellist and keyboard also accompany Being a woman musician is different. First of all, men see women musicians as the lead singer who is interchangeable. Not in all cases, but in many, men also have less of a feeling of bringing out the song than in featuring themselves within (sometimes on top of) the song. I enjoy having an all female band. Our decision making about arrangements takes in points of view. Also it is nearly impossible to explain a \"female\" dynamic of the flow of a song when that one song varies back and forth between introspective and subtle to full blown rocking expression, back to subtle. Let's just say men are physically programmed to start out slow (or fast) and get faster and louder until a crescendo is reached which is the end of the song. Women experience a much fuller range of emotion and intensity and our musical progressions and intricacies reflect that. This generation as in every generation there are the cover girl pop stars who are created and marketed by men (expect in the case of the fab Madonna who NEVER had a middle man and acted as her own pimp). There are also those women who break that mold and show the good bad and ugly or the beauty and the beast in who they are (and we all are). These women have less money behind them in marketing dollars and their reign is shorter, but their following is strong for the rest of their lives from female fans who understand the risk these women took in telling it like it really was in their lives through music. Here are just a few of my favorite women who inspire me to keep on writing and performing: Joni Mitchel, Joan Armatrading, Chrissie Heinz, Phoebe Snow, Alanis Morissette, Beyonce, yes even Lady Gaga Always practice and perform standing up. Put your whole body mind and soul into every single song. Be as vulnerable, furious, ecstatic, turned on (etc) when performing as you were when you wrote the piece. Name names and be true to what you believe in. The guitar can be played in a highly emotive way. It's a great portable, light weight instrument that can be strummed, picked, banged and electronically enhanced for many different sounds. i like to vary the dynamics within a show so that the listener is not bored with too much of the same. Singer songwriters need to be sure they stay strong on their instrument or the listener will start to only hear the similarities in their pieces. - Instruments: Two bands, Night Winds & Helix, both of which folded. Mostly I've worked solo. - Years playing: vocals, keyboard, guitar Since I'm a solo act, I'm the leader, the agent, the publicist, etc. My husband, Andy Murphy, is a recording engineer and a great producer. He produced my first two CDs. The third one is self-produced, and we're still making decisions about how the fourth one will come about. Taylor guitar (410 CE), Kurzweill K 1000 keyboard. Absolutely, there's a difference, though I'm going to have to fumble through the explanation. I think that there is more expectation that a woman will choose between her art and, for example, family, in much the same way as there used to be an expectation that a woman would choose between career of any sort and family. That seems to be far less true for me. Also, there is a difference in the degree of acceptance. The moment for me was when I read that both male and female audiences overwhelmingly preferred male music performers. Many of my songs are directed at women, so that was a bit of a blow. My take is that the younger generation isn't afraid of being flamboyant, exuberant, sexy. My generation was far more subdued. I think the difference began with the punk rockers. In my generation the model was Joni Mitchell, who though brilliant, was subdued and \"feminine\". Now that model is Lady Gaga and Beyonce. In between was Tina Turner, Chrissie Hynde and Patti Smith . \"Oh yes. That advice was to do my homework before doing any deals. Don't shirk finding out as much as you can about the situation, and if you don't understand it, ask questions. Or pay someone to take that responsibility, if you can't. As far as advice about making music, the best advice I've gotten is to remember that it's about the audience, not about you. Try to be a blessing to your audience. \" Piano was where I started as a small child and is the most intuitive for me. I took up guitar in my teens, mostly because it's portable, but also because I loved the sound. Now I've been playing long enough that I'm almost as familiar with a guitar neck as I am with a keyboard. - Years playing: vocals, guitar, keys \"lead singer, acoustic guitarist. have been a back up singer and keyboardist in a second band.\" acoustic guitar with pick-up and vocal effects board \"i feel like the bar is lower for women, to be honest. i am not that great of a guitarist, but i play an interesting way (flat on my lap) and i get a lot of positive feedback that i don't feel i would get if i were a man. i used to feel there was more pressure to dress and act a certain way, but in my 30s i don't feel that's as much of an issue anymore.\" i believe people should not conform to fit the trends... if you keep doing what you feel is natural and honest for you, at some point in time that will be relevant and you won't have to make any big compromises. i love the piano, but guitars are easier to transport. and it's nice to write in the bedroom - Instruments: Beyond Words, Love Riot, Milkshake. Before that, some fun cover bands - Years playing: voice, electric guitar & uke \"Band leader, songwriter, lead singer, guide. Same, although I have learned that opinions of my band are to be listened to and valued -- especially in the studio. When making business/marketing decisions it's still primarily me, although I confer with my partner acoustic guitarist Mikel Gehl for the big stuff. I also do all the creative upkeep behind our online and in-concert presence, creating and maintaining our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/milkshakeband); website (www.milkshakemusic.com).\" I play a 1980 Ibanez guitar I call Creampuff. A black hardshell case covered in bumper stickers from places Milkshake has played keeps Creampuff safe when I travel. My ukelele is a bright green Makala I received as a gift from fellow woman musicians Cathy Fink and Marcy Marxer. I also have a Sony wireless hand held microphone which allows me to move freely on stage and off into the kiddie mosh pit that seems to be a fixture at a Milkshake show. Good question. One fun fact is that women musicians of the fifties weren't allowed to join the musicians union, so early on, there was a bit of inequality going on, I guess. But I think the genre of music you play has something to do with how you are received, perceived and expected to act. I've played in rock bands most of my life. And I have found the male musicians are mostly predatory but not to the woman musician in the band. I have always felt like the leader in the band, and respected as such. On the road, there's no mincing of words and monitoring of language within the band, which almost makes me \"one of the boys.\" But it's truly impossible for that to be 100%, simply because women and men are different. Now, as far as a woman who is a musician who can play well, it's always \"Wow...that girl can play\" from the male-counterparts. That's nice but what matters to me is reaching the girls in my audience and making them think \"Hey--you can play guitar and be just as cool as the guys that do if you want to do.\" It's liberating. So in a way, playing music is a great equalizer. Again, I think it's based on musical genre. Take country music in the fifties and sixties vs. rock. I think the country music women played it safe and fit into a mold expected by their audience longer than the women in rock. Change was really evident in rock women musicians of the fifties (Shirley Bassey), sixties (Janis Joplin), seventies (Fiona Apple, Alanis Morrisette). With each generation, women have grown more fearless, outspoken and as blatantly sexual as they might want to be. \"No. Be true to yourself. Don't sign anything just because you're desperate or there's nothing else going on. Think. Make connections with good people. Be ready to be your best at all times -- even if it's just busking in a subway. Don't follow trends. Be persistent. Be flexible. Listen. Always think of the next project and don't wait to do it. Follow your muse. Write what you know and experience (ie it always amazes me there are kid music artist without kids!). Be on top of changing technology and if you can't do something that needs doing to better your career, hire someone who can (Milkshake employs a booking agent, and publicist, for instance). If you've run out of worthwhile things to sing/write about, do something different with your life (I'm prepared to go dig dinosaur bones in the desert when that time comes, and I'm excited about it :) \" There's something incredibly empowering about putting on a guitar and letting it rip. I feel strong and invincible without having to become one of the boys. - Instruments: Sincola/Scarlitt/Lucille/Rebecca Cannon and Thor/The Texas Sapphires - Years playing: Vocals and Guitar but for my band I am a lead vocalist only \"In The Texas Sapphires: 1) I am the lead vocalist. 2) I make sure our web presence stays up to date and captivating. 3) I sell the Merchandise at shows, and on-line. 4) My band partner, Billy Brent Malkus, who I formed the band with, makes most of the fiscal business decisions. He is the band leader, and I'm like the diplomat. We do decide on personnel issues together, and we discuss all aspects of the band on a weekly basis. We brainstorm together. We write, and rehearse together. We definitely make a good team, and are strictly on a plutonic basis, like a brother and sister relationship.\" My vocal chords, a 58 Shure mic, my dance moves, my merch, my personality, my BOSE PA. Of Course, being a woman and a musician is different from being a male musician, however, I love the differences. I love being the only woman in a band. I play a genre of music, that is dominated by men, but that inspires me to do my best, and keeps me on my toes. Honestly, I prefer to play with men, and be the only female in the band. The whole experience has given me a deeper understanding of men, and I feel like I know the man's mind a little better than the average woman, having traveled in such close quarters for long periods of time. Yes, I do. I think women are way more powerful now, than they were in the past. After all, at least in America, there are Rock Camps for Girls, which proves a greater acceptance of females playing instruments in rock bands. Females are dominating the world wide pop charts, like Lady Gaga. And yes, women are using their sexuality to sell their music, but i don't think that is anything new. I think if you are talented, and you want to use your sexuality to help sell your music, then more power to you. However, if you have no talent, and you try and use your sex to sell your music, I think your career will be short lived or ridiculed. Brittany Spears may not have the greatest voice, but she's a fabulous dancer, and entertainer, and her lifestyle keeps us interested! I think one of the most important pieces of advice i have gained over the years is to remain humble. After this, everything else I have learned is through experience. You will find as quickly as people praise you, and tell you how fantastic you are, including fans and critics, they can as quickly turn on you, and want to see you fail. So, you have to have a strong sense of self, and be able to put up with criticism. Absolutely, do not play music to be famous; play music, because you do not have a choice, and it's the love of your life.The musical ground upon which you stand, will be shallow and break, if you only want fame and fortune. Play any genre, any instrument that you desire, but you absolutely have to love it, and good things will follow, especially if you stick with it. I have been performing in front of an imaginary audience since I was real little. I love making people smile, laugh, cry, dance. I want to move people, and I can do this with my emotive vocals. I want people to feel the song, and listen to the stories. That's why I chose to front bands and sing lead vocals. I am in charge of and responsible for the career I have developed although my collaboration with my guitarist husband has helped direct the shape and quality of the music greatly. larynx and other vocal paraphernalia I think men just tend to DO more, produce more, as artists. They are less conflicted about moving forward in the business then women in general. It seems to be simpler for them. In jazz, we have some very tough shoes to fill - Artists like Sarah Vaughn, Ella, Carmen McRae, Betty Carter and Nina Simone just aren't to be found anymore in this genre. It does seem that genres have their hey day and then lulls.. don't you think? The challenge for us today is to be totally fluent and steeped in the tradition that these great women created for us but to keep moving forward and express in ways that are relevant to us now, not try to recreate anything from the past. I have received a lot of help in my life - support from people who understood and valued what I was creating and wanted to make it a little easier - to these people I am eternally grateful. I can't say I've gotten much advice from folks though..I think they are stumped as we all are, by this strange behemoth of a business. In general I have found that there is an inner GPS that keeps me moving in the direction that I need to go in, and my trust is growing that the desire to share love and emotion and create community through music is at the helm and knows how best to proceed. just how it went down - Instruments: International opera houses, concert and recital halls - Years playing: Voice - dramatic soprano (operatic) I'm almost always the lead soprano in any opera I sing. I'm fully involved with management and business decisions. Where I noticed the difference most, was when I was much heavier than I am now: overweight men in opera, who sang lead roles, could pretty much expect to be judged on their voice and their acting, with no mention of their size. But a large woman would always be criticized for her size, often before any comment was made about her voice or acting. My voice - I could sing, it more or less chose me. - Instruments: I have been performing my own songs in various formats/band changes through the last ten years - Years playing: Guitar, piano, vocals and just about anything that makes noise \"I'm in a band with three other musicians that are also in their own lead bands. Therefore we share a lot in terms of collaboration and promotion of the band. In the studio I take a rather leading role. I record a lot at home and so when I'm in the studio I get really excited about the resources and possibilities. I play with a guitarist, Naim Amor, and a violin player, Vicki Brown. We co-write a lot of the songs and I work very closely with them on melodies and solo parts. It's a pretty egalitarian process but in the end it also comes down to defending the choice you make in the production and songwriting process. That can cause some tension but since we're all artists for other bands, there is a lot of respect for personal choice and innovation. As far as marketing goes, I'm in it alone. I book tours without a booking agent. I do all my own art work for posters and my cds (I silk screen everything and make most cds short run projects). I've been to Europe twice recently on tours I booked myself (which in itself is a part time job!). I also have a group of Italians I collaborate with when there. \" I play both electric and acoustic guitars. I started out playing bluegrass and country on a Taylor acoustic dread-knot guitar. I also have a 1956 Gibson L-5 archtop guitar, an Airline archtop from the 1960s, a couple of old Silvertone cowboy guitars and a beloved Fender Telecaster that I play live a lot with. I collect other odds and ends--banjos, autoharps, toy pianos and any other noisemakers. I have an old spinet in my house that I love to play too. I use some pedals--a Boss distortion pedal, an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff, a reverb pedal and a Head Rush Looping and delay pedal. Mostly I use these at home for recording and messing around. \"Essentially, yes. I think that still people have certain assumptions they make about female musicians. For instance, I'm often referred to as a \"\"singer-songwriter\"\" when my male peers aren't usually called that. It doesn't bother me as I think of myself as a singer and a songwriter. However, over time that moniker has evoked a sort of tameness and emotionality I don't think I fit. I think that women might collaborate differently than men (sometimes) and I think that women have a different approach to their influences than men (sometimes). Lately I've been thinking a lot about how women age with their music. The recent film \"\"Crazy Heart\"\" and other retrospectives of aging male musicians popularize and romanticize the aging male musician. But if you look closer you can find women that never quit either--Elizabeth Cotten, Rosetta Tharpe, Odetta. Most of these artists had a very close spiritual connection with their music that did not rely on fame or sex appeal. I think that as I age, I want the same pure approach to the music. Growing up in the 1980s my models were Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Sheena Easton, Heart--these women exuded a kind of strength that I'm not sure I quite see in the made for teen cyclone of music these days. I know I was influenced by Cyndi Lauper early on and I wanted to be distinctive and creative like her. I didn't see her as a sexy kitten and I liked that. I liked that she hung around with wrestlers. \" \"As I described before, I think women musicians from the 1960s and prior were from a folk tradition. Therefore they were really making music because it was passed down, it was the fabric of their community and it was second nature to the rest of their lives--being mothers, teachers, civil rights activists, servants, etc. Today women (or at least my generation and in my circle) have even more opportunity--to have careers that matter, to make careers in art AND to be mothers. I think that there's a feeling among my female musician friends that if you become a mom it's like, \"\"well, that music thing is over I guess.\"\" I really respect women, say just slightly older than me, like Kristen Hersh, who did it anyway. She takes her kids on tour and her husband is her tour manager. I really respect that. \" \"I have received great advice from many women and men over the years. The best advice I ever received was from an artist who told me to take as long as I need to make the stage my home before I perform. That pause that I now make before playing has made all the difference for me in the world! My advice to anyone just starting out is: Learn an instrument or if you sing, really learn about singing. Learn how to dance. Collect records. Music doesn't have to be a geeky science. Always serve the song. You don't have to recite numbers and notes and memorize everything. You can be shy, bold, expert, novice or naive--just play! Music should be still a social tool. It's silly to have that reserved just for the \"\"Industry.\"\" The Industry is just a collection of people who care about art. If you're ambitious--that's great. However art is also about longevity and a certain aesthetic form. Learn about who came before you.\" I feel very strongly about my skills as a guitarist. I never wanted to be the \"girl with the tambourine.\" Some women are great at that and actually I admire that. But since I was young I always wanted to be someone who could dance with their guitar, use it as a tool for performance and really let it sing with me. I admired females musicians like Nancy Wilson (from Heart) as a kid--I think because a woman with guitar conjured up such an image of strength for me back then. When I was in high school I became more influenced by the leading and improvisational styles in bluegrass music and country and that's what ultimately drove me to learn guitar. Now I also teach guitar to girls. - Instruments: Red Aunts, The Screws, Beehive and the Barracudas, Two Tears - Years playing: guitar, vocals I write all the songs, book all the tours, make all the artwork and run it as my business. I need help. I play a 1964 Melody Maker modified with humbucking pickups and a Fender Super Reverb. \"YES! The moment is made clear to me every time I put on my guitar and must adjust my strap around my boobs. Also, when I was in Guitar Center in LA and the salesman asked if I was shopping for my boyfriend. Being heckled on stage by guys was shocking, then I just laughed at them because I was on stage and they were watching/paying to get in. The best thing about being a female musician is when a male asks if you need help loading in your amp-say yes! Don't be proud-those things are heavy.\" I came from the Riot Girl scene though I didn't participate in it , I see less girls picking up instruments and female musicians getting less exposure and it makes me sad. I'm hoping with Vivian Girls and Dum Dum Girls and other solo artists that \"trend\" will return. But we're raised to believe we're not \"allowed\" to be in bands. Some friends and record producers taught me about the business and it's important to understand it, but my advice is to play what makes you happy as this industry can be evil and the satisfaction of playing can never be taken away from you! \"My first band the Red Aunts was started by a group of friends, whichever instrument our boyfriends had determined what instrument we played. Free gear. I bought my own guitar shortly after.\" - Instruments: At least 5. Marcus Belgrave, Straight Ahead, The McKinFolk Project, Allen Barnes,(formailly of Donald Bryd & the Blackbyrds) The McKinney Zone, and who ever calls and needs me to play. :-) - Years playing: Drums I am band leader, in some cases song writer, arranger, producer, booking agent, pr person, and many other things. Soon, I will have help and delegate some of this responsibility. :-) I use Pearl Drums, Vic Firth Drum Sticks, Sabian Cymbals. \"It's a LOT better now because, there are so many women that play instruments, write music produce etc. However, there was a time when men felt that playing instruments and being in music period, was only for men to do. My instrument in particular used to raise many men's eyebrows. (How dare you play the drums!) was the look I felt I was getting. :-D LOL! As a kid I was always being challenged by boys because, they just couldn't believe that a girl played the drums. When I got older there was less verbal challenge from men and more of competitive playing. In other words, if I happen to play before a man, he would make sure he played everything he thought he knew, to show me up. Another experience I have had is, not getting hired on some gigs, I believe because, I was a girl. Men would hire the guys first. Over the years, that has changed. I don't have that problem anymore. Besides, that behavior forced me to be a band leader. :-) One last thing that I experienced, was the time I was playing with \"\"Straight Ahead,\"\" an all female jazz group. We were at sound check, and the sound guys where treating us with no respect. However, after we played our show, their whole attitude changed.(I guess we proved that we were actually serious musicians.) The girls and I, all laughed about it. \" Only that there are many more women that are being band leaders, making, playing, producing and writing music, It's wonderful! I am so happy to see that. :-) \"Luckily, I have had many great mentors in my life, women and men. My father, mother, uncle, and many of my father's musician friends mentored me. What I would say to a young women starting out is, make sure you have studied your craft well, and when you think you know everything, study some more. Try to erase that saying: \"\"She's good for a girl.\"\" Be strong, and don't let anyone discourage you from what you're trying to do. PLEASE STUDY THE BUSINESS OF MUSIC!!! That way know one can get over on you. Last but not least, I do music for fun but, it's the time that costs you. Remember that. :-) \" \"I really didn't choose it, it chose me. According to my mother, I was beating a rhythm before I was even born. My mother told me a story about the time when her and my father were sleeping in the spooning position, and my father woke up to a tapping in his back. He tried to wake my mother, and she was sound asleep. The tapping stopped so, he went back to sleep, only to be awakened again by more tapping. This time he was able to wake mom up, and she said \"\"What is it?' Dad said: \"\"Why are you tapping me?\"\" Mom said: (with irritation in her voice because, he woke her up) \"\"THAT'S NOT ME SILLY, THAT'S THE BABY!\"\" So, apparently, I knew what I wanted to do early on. :-D LOL!\" - Instruments: Drasco, Jed and Kelley, The Trishas - Years playing: Vocals, mandolin \"I am one of four girls, where we each have individual roles in the band. For example, I'm Finance Trish. So I handle the money. One of the other girls is Merch Trish, she handles the merchandise at the gigs and oversees the designs, etc. All four of us have an equal voice when making band decisions. We make them as a group. Its a Democracy! We are starting our debut studio project in April, so Ill have to get back to you on that! \" I play a Kentucky Mandolin F-style, with a Fishman pickup. I use a Boss stomp tuner and an LR Baggs Preamp. Vocal mikes vary depending on the gig. \"Well, I have had several experiences as a woman in the music business. One as part of a duo, and another as part of this all girl group I am currently in. As one half of a male/female duo, I definitely felt I was an equal partner. I was more the business side of things though, and relied on him for most of the creative stuff. Mainly because he was the songwriter...but there was still this thing kinda standing in my way of being creative and musically an equal in with him. Alot of that was relationship stuff I'm sure, but I was also not really pushed by him to break out of my shell and try different things. As part of this all girl group, it is such an empowering and different feeling. We are all really supportive of each other and push each other to break out of our comfort zones. Thus, forcing us to grow as musicians and as a band. That's what is special about us I think, it easier for us to put our egos aside and be a support for the others. Its a girl thing:) And its fun! I think men tend to get competitive and I don't blame em...heck, there are so many more men (especially in Texas) attempting a career in music than women. Thats another thing. There are so few women here in Texas playing music, that we all really support each other. It helps us all when one becomes successful or breaks out of the pack. Its really exciting to see attention being drawn to women in music these days. Im honored to be included in the group. But, I will say....its not as hard or suppressive as one might think. Generally, we are treated as equals and have alot of support from our male counterparts, friends and peers. I would even say that in some cases, it is easier to be a women in the music business. The other girls would kill me for say thing, and maybe thats not the angle you were going for here.......but, The Trishas have gotten some great opportunities lately, and I really think we can contribute some of that to the fact that we are 4 girls on stage together. Its different and hopefully inspiring to young women....and men!:) So, thats my moment. Getting on stage for the first time with these beautiful ladies, and feeling that sense of empowerment and gratitude for who I am and what I do for a living. And I'm so thankful to be doing it with four other women who, hopefully, feel the same way! www.thetrishas.com\" \"Definitely. I see women from generations back who had to really fight for their place in music, who had to really prove themselves as musicians in order to gain the respect of their male counterparts and peers. Women these days, in general, have a much easier road to walk. If you have the talent, the determination and the presence....you have just as much a shot at success as a man. Thats how I feel anyway. Maybe others feel differently, maybe its a genre thing or a regional thing. I don't know. But Im from Memphis and moved to Austin and in both places, I have felt great support and hardly any suppression. I can imagine if you were to ask Loretta, or Mavis or Kitty or Odetta these same questions, you would get much different answers. I admire those women so much because they had to fight for their place. And it shows in their music and in their presence and in their legacy. Women musicians these days could stand to fight a little harder in my opinion :) Makes you stronger and strengthens the soul..... you can see in those women I mentioned. \" \"You know, no one ever really gave me any advice or pushed me in any certain direction. I think for some musicians, especially for me, it was just something that I never lost sight of, even when I attempted to have a real job after college. Its kinda built-in for some of us I think. I have always wanted to be a performer, and cant remember a time when I ever thought that wouldn't be possible for me. It never seemed too far out of reach. Even if it meant just playing a weekly gig down the street for 50 bucks, I knew it was what I wanted to do. I think for women musicians my age, it is as possible to be successful in the music business for women as it is for men. Two things you need: Talent and Determination. My advice to women: There is nothing you can't do. Follow every avenue, you will grow with each opportunity. \" Well, I was initially interested in the banjo. I was in a duo at the time and wanted to learn an instrument that would accompany a guitar. I saw Terri Hendrix and Lloyd Maines play a show at a festival in Texas one summer and they were a duo, where she played mandolin on a few songs. After their show, I went up to Lloyd (whom I greatly looked up to) and mentioned I was interested in playing the Banjo. I asked him if he had any tips or pointers on which banjo to buy, etc. He said to me \" You shouldn't learn the banjo, you should play the mandolin.\" \"It will fit better with what you are doing, and plus...it's much easier to learn!\". So, I took his advice and went out the next week and bought a Weber mandolin. Im still learning how to play the thing! - Instruments: Gainesville Chamber Orchestra, accompanying various soloists - Years playing: piano \"As a classical musician in an orchestra, this question doesn't really apply. However, in chamber ensembles, I find myself leading rehearsals but also trying to get other players to work together. I am not very involved in the booking or marketing of the ensemble. \" I own a Kimball baby grand piano that was passed down from an aunt, a Yamaha P-200 and a Yamaha P-85. As I largely perform art music, I don't require much gear. I have not personally witnessed a difference. As a young woman in a music career, I think there may be less external pressure to get a \"real job\" than a man experiences, but I'm just speculating. I think my generation is blessed with the ability to assume that we'll be able to succeed if we work hard, whereas previous generations fought for acceptance in music programs and concert halls. No one specifically gave me advice about a music career, but I would encourage a young woman to work hard, have fun, and enjoy the roller coaster. I actually don't know. As a young child, I loved to sing and dance to music, and I grew up listening to classic rock, but especially works with piano (Billy Joel, Elton John, Bob Seeger, Yes, etc.). A neighbor could play piano and offered to teach me. Although I picked up other instruments in the public school band program, I always gravitated to the piano and found the greatest solace in it. Ultimately, I gave up playing the other instruments and focused solely on piano in college. It was what I loved the most. - Instruments: I usually perform under my own name - Years playing: voice and piano I am in charge of all of my decisions at the moment. I use the new compact Bose sound system and have a Yamaha electric full-size keyboard. We also have a recording studio on our property and have a beautiful Baldwin grand piano and work with Pro Tools. Yes, but not as much as it used to be. When I was learning jazz piano when I first fell in love with jazz when I was in my 20s, I used to play piano for some of the musicians I would sing with, and they would say \"you're not supposed to be able to do that!\" They were saying this because I was a \"chick singer\" and wasn't supposed to really know what was going on! I have always been very involved in music and very talented, and I make it very clear to my jazz vocal students that they are a musician as well as a vocalist, and make sure they know the ins and outs of being a musician, know the language, how to talk jazz, and always teach them basic theory as well as singing technique and history. I know in the early days women wrote a lot of songs. Men were away at war and there were all-female bands. Women have always written great blues tunes, starting way back in the beginning. I feel there is much less of a gap now between men and women musicians. I am happy for this time, and I am now beginning to nurture my piano playing. For a long time I would just sing and not play, but now I am playing more and more, and am determined to fulfill my deep desire to be a jazz piano player as well as a singer. This is just the way things have evolved for me. I have always been encouraged in my piano playing (as well as singing) by such jazz luminaries as Jack DeJohnette and most other people who hear me play. \"Be true to yourself and follow your own path. Don't be afraid to tell people what you want or expect out of them as musicians and collaborators. I have found that other musicians appreciate direction, and it took me a long time to learn that. Thank you for this opportunity! Peace and Blessings! TERI\" I started piano when I was five, and eventually became a church organist at age 13. I fell in love with jazz when I heard it in my late teens/early twenties, and never looked back. I started singing jazz when the legendary pianist (of the Garrison Keillor show) Butch Thompson heard me sing and told me I had something special. We worked together for awhile, and even toured Europe when I was in my 20s. I became a singer then and now I play and sing and record and write, and teach also! - Years playing: Flute/Piccolo/Alto Flute performer, artistic leader Flute, piccolo, alto flute, tuner and microphone, metronome, music, pencil Yes, in orchestra in grad school. Males where seen as better leaders for the principal parts and I tried to change that. I think I have more opportunities to become successful if I take advantage of the opportunities and that more women are being rewarded for their work. Joan Tower, Libby Larsen, Shulamit Ran and Cynthia Folio have. You have to be very passionate about what you want and what you after and go for it. Don't let anything or anyone get in your way. I had heard a recording of Doriot Dwyer play Afternoon of a Faun by Debussy - Instruments: one - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano & anything else i can get my hands on. i write all my own songs. i play by myself. sometimes i can conjure up enough spare time to practice and have a drummer play with me. just an audix mic & my parlor style pawn shop fender acoustic guitar. \" i'd have to say it depends on the person. some women can be really naive and some really strong and discerning. i have been in situations where a guy told me that he loved my music and wanted to help me in any way possible. i was cautious and upfront about my intentions in working with him musically and that i meant only to focus on my music. turned out the guy had an interest in ME, not to say that he didn't have a genuine interest in my music. but his motives were twisted. it is hard not to come off as suspicious sometimes. i feel like i have seen a lot of female musicians get away with having little to no talent because they play coy and cute or have sex appeal. i have seen some guys get away with this too. \" honestly, not really. we have more available to us then we ever did before so maybe i should be able to see some difference. toughen up! do what you feel compelled to do and don't let anyone pressure you into doing things their way. my parents got me a guitar for my 16th birthday. took me years to actually pick up the thing and play it. maybe i was a little bit compelled towards guitar? i love instruments in general. - Instruments: Two. Balmorhea and Alex Dupree & The Trapdoor Band - Years playing: violin \"I am the leader of our string section, which in a performance, makes me something like a liaison between the string trio and the rest of the group. They are watching me for cues and rhythm and I am typically watching the pianist to make sure we are together. In a broader sense, I'm responsible for writing my violin parts. In the studio, my job is to show up and perform well. I don't have a hand in production decisions, but I am always around during the mixing process to listen for any errors in the string parts. When it comes to all business aspects of the band, I am completely uninvolved. The two guys who lead the project deal with that on their own. \" My personal gear includes a violin, an L.R. Baggs pick up, an L.R. Baggs Direct Box and one pedal tuner. The difference for me is only evident in setting up for a show at a venue. Occasionally, there is a sound guy that assumes that because you are a woman (or perhaps because I look like quite a young woman) you don't really understand what's going on, or what equipment you really need. It is definitely a male dominated industry. In all realms of the process (studio recording, live shows, touring, management) we are out numbered for sure. I do not. But really I don't know enough older women musicians to make a good judgment. I never received any advice in particular. I sort of fell into this path more so than I deliberately sought it out. But to a woman musician just beginning in this industry, I would just emphasize how important it is to be confident. Don't let yourself be intimidated. It was actually a bit of a fluke. My best friend in the 5th grade joined our elementary school's string program and I thought she was the biggest nerd for choosing violin. Probably in an effort to validate my notion of how simple and boring it was, I picked it up to see what it was like. All of a sudden, I found myself having fun, and even taught myself a few simple songs. I joined the class shortly after that. She stopped playing that year and needless to say, I was pretty hooked. - Instruments: Cornelius Cardew Choir - Years playing: Piano, Composition, Vocals, Drums, Conducting In the Cardew Choir, we are essentially socialists, so we are all putting in our own contributions. In terms of my own work, my role is to be myself, and do my creative work. I'm not so much of a business or marketing person at this time, if ever, but I do make sure to send out emails about my concerts. MacBook Pro, Sibelius, Korg keyboard, Yamaha piano, pencils, manuscript paper. At this time, yes. I have seen and experienced much conscious and unconscious, overt and covert sexism. At the conservatory I attended I experienced some explicit sexism. I've heard about cases at Julliard, NY Phil, Vienna Philharmonic. There's still a bias for the privileged white man. Fortunately this does not occur everywhere, and we're seeing more advantage and inclusion of women, people of color, disabilities, you name it. But it's going slow, and music, classical in particular, is definitely behind the other arts. I think there are definite differences, as there are always differences between generations. As for women in particular, I'm not sure what the differences are yet. \"No one has ever given me USEFUL advice. I did hear that there was sexism, and found that true. I have been warned that composers can be scathing and prejudiced of each other, and have found that true. I have also found the opposite to be true. So the advice has been, \"\"watch out, be ready, don't be surprised, expect it,\"\" but that advice has not been useful. In terms of giving advice, I think each person is different, and no sure formula will work for getting into the music industry. I myself have not found a sure path, so I don't have any strong advice. However, the usual MUSTS are hard work, dedication, diligence. I also encourage artistic integrity, but have seen that's not always the most important thing for \"\"making it.\"\" In fact, sometimes \"\"selling out\"\" is hoe people are \"\"making it.\"\" Sad.\" My parents put me into piano lessons as a kid, and I chose everything else from there on. The music of Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Debussy, and Satie inspired me to become a composer when I was 18. - Instruments: none - Years playing: I am a composer None---I am a composer looking for an academic position and a chance to have works performed. I use an electronic keyboard or piano, paper and pencil or Finale software to compose \"The first time the difference was made clear was when I was looking for a more advanced composition teacher when I was 15 or 16. I met Anthony Hopkins (a British composer/BBC commentator/announcer) and he told me I needed to study with either Elizabeth Lutyens or Thea Musgrave as I should have a woman teacher. Being a woman composer is different from being a man composer. During my Masters' degree there was only one other woman composer and during my doctorate I was the only woman studying composition. I also had to deal with sexual inuendos from male instructors, and male instructors were not empathetic to raising a family while being a composer. There were no female role models to follow at that time as most female composers were unmarried.\" I see a lot more performers in orchestras. However there are still very few women composers and the number enrolled in composition courses does not seem to have increased. I would tell a woman just starting out to be the best she can be, to minimise gender issues, and to try to ignore sexism while finding her own voice. I would also tell her to find a good mentor male or female. I started composing when I was 9 or 10 but was told not to waste my time by my then piano teacher. When I changed piano teachers, my new teacher said that she did not care about my playing and that I should get composition instruction. I was lucky enough to get accepted as an external student at Trinity College of Music when I was 13 or 14 and started formal composition studies at that time. - Instruments: jazz singers work with many different \"groups\"-not Bands with names - Years playing: vocals-singer \"In a group I choose the songs I want to sing and count the tempo off. In the studio I choose songs, which cut, balance, everything along side the engineer. I decide where to spend money..if to spend money. Actually my husband (also a jazz musician) and I discuss what to do. It seems its becoming an area where the people hired to promote are making more money than the artists themselves.\" \"For a gig if I need my own equipment: EV microphone, yamaha self powered monitor, EV speakers, Mackie mixer, power amp, speaker stands, fold up music stand, cart (at times), music bag with charts, Alessis reverb unit, assorted cords and power strips, stand for monitor\" \"I do think in my area (jazz) men are more dominant. They are suspicious of women musicians and their abilities. Perhaps some women got where they are because they wear low cut necklines, and shorter hems on album overs/magazine pages. I think that is true too. My personal experience has been one that has been fair. I don't expect special treatment, I am a team (ensemble) player. I am not a diva. \" Yes, I think the younger women are better educated. \"I wasn't given any helpful advice. The one thing I tell musicians starting out is that they have to be honest-musically speaking. As long as one is honest, they will find people who appreciate it and are swept into the music because it is heartfelt. I think that's what makes one artist different from another.\" \"I loved singing and love lyrics. I played piano through college as well. I sang and played the guitar for a summer during college.\" - Instruments: only solo - Years playing: vocals, guitar, drums, violin, piano I am the band. I work with my producer in making all decisions regarding sound and marketing etc. A red Fender electric guitar and a Vox amp. I can't say. I've only ever been a woman. But I do think that women as performers can be easily patronized by others and that there are certain expectations of what a woman will and won't do on stage. Whereas men are much freer within our society to behave more outrageously and be excused for their actions. The most valuable advice I got was to find my own voice/sound and to experiment. Also, to not be afraid to take chances and make mistakes on stage. Advice I would give: study the greats that came before you and read great literature...and observe the world around you. Great song and story ideas come from the faces you see on the streets/subways and the lives you eavesdrop upon when eating out at a restaurant. Lastly, keep a notepad by your bed and write down songs that come to you in the middle of the night....you think you'll remember them in the morning, but you won't! I mainly play the guitar. I got interested in it when I was a teenager and continued from there. - Instruments: 2 - mine, and Shane Simpson - Years playing: vocals, guitar, six string banjo I'm the head honcho, maker of all decisions good and bad. Except in the studio. Where I'm smart enough to hire a producer who's able to be objective and knows WAY more about recording than I'll ever know so we get the best product possible. Oscar Graf guitar, Porchboard, Deering 6 string banjo, Woodskin (percussion instrument) Absolutely ... because the music industry is no different than any other sector. Women have had an uphill battle in the rest of the corporate world in terms of challenges to balance family and career, to be given equal footing with their male counterparts, and to be taken seriously. The music industry reflects this same bias. It's certainly gotten a lot better (as has been the case with the rest of society) but I think there are still some biases that make it more difficult for women to succeed. Yes I think there are differences, reflecting my comments from above. I think the women who are veterans in this industry, like in all other sectors, have opened doors for those that are coming up behind them. Yes ... to create the best art that I possibly can, to always be looking to improve my craft, and to know that I will always care the most about seeing my career advance. I'd give the same advice to a woman musician who was just starting out. the guitar is very portable, and is well suited to solo performance when bands are too expensive to take on the road - Instruments: Paul Winter Consort - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, piano, violin Engineer, Artist, Marketing Design etc... DIgital Performer. Mac We may have a slightly different perspective on sound at times. Have had to really work to get technical skill. Learned mush from my male friends. There are more women making a living as Musicians now I think. They are so inspiring to me. Odetta once told me.....always, take silent time before you make sound. And learn teh power of repetition...repetition, repetition, repetition! Hmmmm...everyone was playing the guitar. Came to piano much later. Violin was my elementary school choice...love the sound. conductor and musicologist baton \"Yes, absolutely. My experience as a woman is different because the culture recognizes a difference. I was at times steered in different paths because I was a woman and not a man; expectations of my educational level & working career were different. No simgle moment, but many different ones.\" Yes, today many women seem to think they will be treated equally with men and that decisions will be made on just they skill/talent/achievement, but unfortunately I do not think that is yet the case. Progress and more opportunities for women has occurred during my lifetime. Still bias is present, virtually everywhere. \"Minimal concrete advice about the practical realities. Work with other women; don't see them so much as competition. As Gerda Lerner said: \"\"Take someone with you.\"\"\" \"was a pianist & trombone player. Piano = ?. Trb = probably because it was a \"\"boy's instrument.\"\" also played a bit of cello in high school when there were no trb parts in orchestral pieces Conducting - probably as I liked to be in charge (smile).\" - Instruments: 2. I've had various wonderful musicians backing me up (as Amber Rubarth) and I now have a side project called The Paper Raincoat, which is a orchestral folk collaboration with Alex Wong. - Years playing: Hollow body guitar, piano, vocals, glockenspiel, drums, anything else I can find that makes sound... \"AMBER RUBARTH - Writer. Performer. Producer. Arranger. Some self-recording but I do a lot at the studio now as well. Self-manager. Self-releaser. Self-driver (or train ticket buyer). Besides my booking agent right now and the lovely musicians I get to perform with, I'm pretty much a one woman entity. THE PAPER RAINCOAT - Co-writer with Alex Wong. Lead and side vocalist. Keyboardist / Guitarist / Drummer / Glockenspieler / etc. In the studio Alex does most of the producing, I produced one of the songs on the record and helped with some of the other stuff but I love Alex's production. With business and marketing, Alex and I equally split everything and carve out our path together.\" \"Well, for AMBER RUBARTH shows I bring my hollow body HB-15 Washburn guitar and run it through an old Fender champ amp. I sing through a Blue Microphone Encore 100, just started using that and they're AMAZING. I play piano, my preference is an old upright. And I whistle. When I'm playing with my side project, THE PAPER RAINCOAT, I use a Nord Stage and play bass lines, organ, wurly, piano, etc. on it. I also play glockenspiel, vibratone, acoustic guitar, and drums, anything to serve the song. And lots of vocals of course, lead vocals or harmonizing with my partner-in-crime on the project, Alex Wong.\" \"I think it's been made to be different but in actuality is exactly the same. Women will of course have different tendencies just as different cultures and experiences will alter someone's approach to a song. I tend to avoid Women Musician nights when they're focusing on Girl power, etc. I think if it's joined together as a decision to have similar musical styles, etc. that's fine but when people act like women have had a harder time making music, don't have as much opportunities, I strongly disagree with that. If anything I think it may be easier to be a woman and a musician sometimes.... because there are things like Women Nights out there (there are no Men Nights or people would call it sexist). I like music. If it moves me, I'll listen, and if it doesn't, I won't. I can't imagine that anyone would be different from that part.\" Yes. Women have opened up from the time of Patsy Cline with her soft, pretty songs and conservative outfits, crossed legs.... to Janis Joplin and her forward and reckless music and attitude.... to someone like Ani DiFranco who showed the world that you can run your own empire as a woman. However I don't think it is only specific to women, I think the world in general has moved in these ways from acquiescence to a need to show individuality, to our need to be in charge of businesses and music and anything else. But in the end I think it is all just moving toward equality of everyone, our human-ness trumping any cultural or sex differences. \"Yes yes yes yes yes. Very valuable. When I was 17 I moved to Carson City, Nevada to become a wood sculptor. I worked with a chainsaw carving animals and sculptures seven days a week for 3 years in that apprenticeship program and I left because the head sculptor (who had also become a mentor to me) told me this: You will only be truly great if you follow your number one passion. If you don't, you're not only not going to be as great as you could be, but you will not serve the purpose you were put here on earth to do, there is something only you can do how you do it, and you're robbing the world of that if you decide to take the safe route and do what you're told rather than carving your own unique path out. Don't have a Plan B, once you decide what you will do, work hard and give it as a gift and the universe will come together to support you. I quit that day. I traded my chainsaw for a guitar and have never looked back. It is the best advice I've heard and I think of it often. It is easy to think when we're doing something that we are being selfish in choosing exactly what we love, I struggled with that for a long time. But when you recognize it as a gift, and give it as such to the world, that erases all self-consciousness you feel on stage, all worries about whether you are supposed to be doing that or getting a \"\"regular job,\"\" etc. Don't have a back up plan and give everything you have to giving to the world through the way that you love and only you can do.\" \"I chose to play guitar because the piano was too heavy for open mics. I traded my acoustic in for a hollow body electric Washburn through a Fender amp because I wanted the guitar to crunch and was inspired by Adam Levy's playing. I play piano because my favorite thing in life is watching the hammers hit the strings. I play glockenspiel and vibratone and melodica because they make the sounds that are in my head for those songs. And I play drums because drums are rad.\" - Instruments: just mine, The Franc Graham Band - Years playing: guitar, vocals i'm everything unfortunately. which is probably why i still play mostly locally. being songwriter and bandleader is a blessing, but the rest of the business is a challenge. hard to do it all and keep afloat... Fender Pro-reverb silver face amp, seafoam green Fender strat, tangled cords, a beer holder that clamps to the mic stand which i let my bass player use, boots. people are surprised that i can \"play\" and some, seemingly intelligent men, still think women can't rock. men would never get put on a bill w/other \"boy bands\". sexuality plays a bigger part for women in the music biz if you let it. men seem to \"wear better\" in our culture's eyes, just as they do in the film industry. but it's a blessing all in all, it's what you make it. yes! now it's about all kinds of other stuff and it's about being younger and younger. a lot of being a musician now is how you look -- and a lot of the work is more insipid in my opinion. i guess not enough. my advice would be to find your own voice -- that's all that's important really. it may not make you \"make it\" -- but it's what will fill you. if you got that and can't envision the business end, get someone to sell your work for you -- too tough to do it alone. older sister played the guitar and taught me some chords, loved the immediacy of it and being able to accompany myself. eccentric musician friend of my dad gave me untraditional (sometimes he just played the flute for me) but basically classical lessons and i found my niche in playing pick-free rock... - Instruments: A PERFECT CIRCLE TIL 2002- ZWAN TIL 2003- THE ENTRANCE BAND TIL PRESENT - Years playing: BASS 1/3/2010 '69 P BASS..I ALSO MADE MY OWN BASS CALL THE PAZ BASS..IT'S RAD..BUT I LOVE MY P BASS...I ALSO LOVE MY MESA BOOGIE COMBO WALK ABOUT..15\" SPEAKER..ALL I NEED REALLY..BUT I ALSO HAVE A CLASSIC AMPEG 8X10..BUT I GOT SICK OF LUGGING THAT THING AROUND..I USE AN OCTAVE PEDAL TURNED WAY DOWN FOR WHEN I PLAY REAL HIGH..WE ARE A 3 PEICE SO IT FILLS A GOOD SPACE...I'M GOING TO START USING A CHORUS PEDAL SOON...IF IT SOUNDS GOOD..I GOT A BUNCH OF RECORDING GEAR TOO..

On the business side, my husband and I own a musician contracting and booking company - BBA/Management and booking. So I assist Javier when I can in getting the band booked different places. currently, LP congas, DW snare, Bosphorus cymbals, tons of small hand percussion. Shure SM 58 vocal mic, mics, Korg MX50 keyboard/synth. Undeniably there are differences in the day to day business side. There are also distinct differences in our approaches to our respective instruments. We can meet those differences as possitive or negative, better or worse, right or wrong and get all hung up about it or we can focus on the music that comes out of us and whether or not the collaboration is working. Fortunately now, in this day and age, we can do that. On the business side yes. But mostly in the same respect as men from one generation to the next. The older women I've had the privilege to work with were strong, savvy and focused and went about their music making despite any gender issues. Today, the younger women are just as tenacious but have more business knowledge and more tools available to them so they, like young men in the business, don't have to lose their power so much to lawyers, accountants, record companies, managers, etc. \"To make it in the business - Take a \"\"basics in business\"\" class and pay attention. To make it as a respected professional musician - Hold on to your integrity at all cost (e.g. don't sleep with your band mates just cause you can). Never lose sight that your job here is that of a messenger with a most important message to deliver. To make it as a successful performer - When you sit in with a band remember - \"\"everybody's got something to say. Say what you need to say, then sit down and listen to the next guy.\"\"\" When I was 11 picking an instrument to play in the school band, my Dad really bought a tambourine and a set of brushes and taught me a few basics of playing drums - he needed a drummer for his dixieland jazz band. My sister played piano, my brother played bass so, of course, I picked drums. - Instruments: Cotton Jones & Page France - Years playing: Vocals and Keys \"Michael (Nau) and I share the vocal roles of the band. The role of the only female in a band with 5 to 6 guys has it's inevitable, obvious challenges. I'm usually the one to advance shows on the road and make sure our driving/stopping schedule stays on track with load in times etc, also handling merchandise and making sure interviews are taken care of. We have a home studio where we do all of our recording and post production. My role in the studio beyond tracking is basically being the second ear. The downside of doing your own studio work as a band is that you become far too involved and enveloped by your project. Two ears and minds make this process a little more manageable. Michael and I also have joint roles in the business oriented decisions, as well as the label. We tend to consider these decisions as a group along with the rest of our band. \" I play a Hammond Piper II Organ, xylaphone, and Omni Chord. I've never really felt much of a difference, I've been lucky to always feel a solid equal part of a great group of guys. Myself and our band have really just been taking everything as it comes. Learning as we go and hoping not to make the same mistakes twice. My best advice would be to make music that you know you can stand behind. I think this is the best way to keep a passion for what you're doing, and a willingness to stick it out through the moments that make you want to quit. I began taking piano lessons when I was about 15. Each of the instruments I play now take the same basic knowledge. I've just gradually adjusted to what was needed for each individual song and record. - Instruments: Solo artist - Years playing: piano, vocals though I try to surround myself with exceptional advisors, I am responsible for making all business and marketing decisions. In the studio, I prefer having a co-producer to working alone. 88-weighted keyboard; MacBook Pro; Garage Fire 610; M-Audio studio speakers; Various keyboard controllers; Several microphones of varying quality; acoustic guitar (occasionally); I have rewritten my answer to this question multiple times, as I'm having difficulty processing all of my thoughts on the subject. In my early days of staff writing, I found that most of my male co-writers were very confident in their ideas and would nearly always veto mine. I was not nearly as confident in my writing or performing as the males around me seemed to be, but this could have been due to my own challenges that had nothing to do with being a female. (When I had some success as an artist, most of the males changed their tune and began to listen to my ideas.) On the other hand, I've spent the past 12 years primarily dealing with men--on the road, in the studio, and at the co-writing table, and I've usually felt respected and accepted. (I am also totally blind and have always found the music industry to be more accepting of me than any other social or business circle I'm a part of.) This being said, I do not typically enjoy working with males in the music world who are younger than my generation. I usually find them to be overconfident and disrespectful. The younger female musicians I've worked with have been very talented, hard-working, and respectful, but I have had only a few opportunities to work with female musicians. My final thought is that it seems that the music-listening-buying audience is primarily female, and females typically love males. So I think it's easier for males to rise to the top--especially as artists--than it is for females. But in the studio or as part of a backing band, talent and proficiency matter more than gender. Based on my experiences teaching singer/songwriters at a university and watching singer/songwriters perform on the road, I would say that the younger generation is much more confident in their abilities and perhaps less aware of the needs and desires of their audience. And most young musicians I know think they are awesome, whether they are or not. I remember having a sense of awe when working with writers or musicians who had been in the \"business\" for awhile. I don't sense much of that sort of awe or respect from the younger generation. I was given a few pieces of great advice along the way; I sure wish I had given them more consideration. Based on my journey, here are the things I'd say to a young woman starting out: Before you embark on a career, make sure you know yourself and your art very well; otherwise these things will be defined for you. In order to survive this business, you must possess equal parts humility and confidence; don't sign a 360 deal with a company who doesn't have 360 capabilities; never underestimate the power of a song. There was a piano in our dining room. I fell in love with it when I was two and began plunking out songs by ear. - Instruments: Many - Years playing: saxophone, arranging, composing \"I like to lead a band and taking decision all over the steps.

Bass and Percussion for fun I am a solo artist and very much involved in the creative process. Every single song starts with me and thanks to the help of collaborators and producers makes it to the finish line. I love playing with other musicians and writing with other writers but the end product most always represent something that's very me. In the Studio I love to be hands on and oversee every little step from tracking, to mastering. As far as the business aspect of it I tend to be a little more laid back about it, it's definitely not my strongest suit. Nevertheless I am very careful to do only the things that won't jeopardize my integrity as an artist. \"Keys: In the Studio and on the Road Yamaha S90XS and MO6. At home Yamaha upright piano.

Electric: Danelectro.\" Yes I think it's different to be a woman musician than a man and a musician but it's not something dramatic, more like the subtle differences that naturally occur between males and females in general. I guess the only thing I've felt is that as a woman I've had to prove myself just a little more on the instrument. Most of the writers, musicians and producers that I've worked with have encouraged me to play as much as possible whether it be for recording the album or on stage, and in the cases that they saw me just as a singer I would just grab a guitar or sit on the keys and start playing. Nothing speaks louder than action. No specific instances recalled. Absolutely. I think women musicians in the new millennium can use the element of sexuality to their favor without jeopardizing their credibility as talented musicians. It seems like most of the female musician/artists in the nineties played down their sexuality a bit. Most of them wore oversized, manly clothes and didn't use much make-up. It was almost as though the less girly they looked the more people would respect their playing, with exceptions of course. Nowadays things are different, women are not afraid to embrace their sexual appeal and they actually use it to complement their playing. The 3 P's have always resonated with me: Patience, Practice and Perseverance. I'll add to that \"Believe in yourself\", \"Focus on the work\" and \"don't forget to enjoy it\". That's the best advice I've received and that's what i would tell any artist starting out. I didn't have much choice with the Piano... at 4 yrs old my mom had all do with it, but after years of torturous classical lessons I finally fell deeply in love with it. The guitar came almost as a rebellion to my classical piano education, I was dying to play rock and roll and play in bands; and the bass was solely because of Me'shell Ndegeocello. I remember listening to her album Peace Beyond Passion at 14 and thinking \"this is the coolest thing I wanna play bass\" - Instruments: two: Arum Rae and White Dress - Years playing: vox, guitar My role is the leader of White Dress. I write the music and bring it to the band, in the studio, because we don't have a producer, I do most of the producing or directing, with song selction/feel/arrangement/ etc... my guitars: a gold top Les Paul Re-issue through either a bassman amp or a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe \"Yes, being a woman and a musician differs from being a man. I think it's probably more fun for a woman than it is for a man. Most the time we always have help carrying our gear, we create greater mystery because we do not look like what we play so it's fun surprising an unexpected (new) audience of men and women. But I have also encountered COUNTLESS men on the business side who are very unprofessional and have bad motives... from producers to management to top songwriters in Nashville who have shown up with promises and compliments and then eventually tried to get me in bed. I had one producer bring me all the way out to Austin from Georgia to record with him for TWO months and then dropped the project once he realized I wasn't going to sleep/be with him. But now that I know how to spot a dishonest situation it has saved me a lot of heartache and precious time!\" \"\"\"you've just got to work hard and be good, which you are so keep doing what you're doing\"\" Britt Daniel from Spoon told me that. He has had a helping hand in my career. I would say to keep your head focused, extremely focused. Do everything in your capacity to do as much as you can on your own with out random music industry sharks getting in your way and distracting you. The fans/listeners are what matter, from 50 years ago to 50 from now, you have nothing if dont have any fans. \" I play guitar to accompany myself and it's the instrument i use to write music with - Instruments: Balmorhea, Alex Dupree and the Trapdoor Band, The Album Leaf, university orchestra - Years playing: Cello, Vocals Cellist, contributor of ideas, Tour Mom Cello, 2 bows, L.R. Baggs DI, Barcus-Berry pickup and preamp My bandmates treat myself and the other girl in the band as equals. The only thing that sets us apart is that they may carry the heavier gear now and then. I do not have a whole lot of experience with other females in bands. None of my close female friends are in bands and I do not know a lot of older female musicians. When I think about females in bands, bands of the 1960s and 70s pop in my head. Those women were not only pioneers in music, but also society. They were a sign of the times and I guess women aren't really looked at in that way anymore. I don't think it's that big of a deal to be a woman in a band anymore. Unless you're a female drummer. That usually gets some attention. Orchestra teachers and my parents encouraged me to stick with the cello. There was never really a time that I was consciously trying to \"break into\" the biz. It happened pretty organically- I made friends with Alex Dupree and said that I was interested in playing in his band. I had been playing with him for about a year when I was asked to join Balmorhea, which was already signed to Western Vinyl. I knew that I wanted to be in orchestra by age 9 and loved the cello's expressive, mid-range tone. Since it can make sounds that resemble violin, viola and bass, it was easy to reach a decision on which instrument to choose. - Instruments: 8 - ford, Sven Erik, Blank Pile, M. Alice Foster, The Wendy Kroys, Dog Rats, The WoMentors - Years playing: guitar, bass, drums I write songs, book shows, release records, make album covers, do publicity, whatever we need. \"gibson SG, marshall amp no-name fretless bass, peavey amp whatever drums I can borrow\" Yes. People seem to judge your musical ability more harshly. I always hear comments like not bad for a girl, they are a good girl band, etc. Just the general attitude. No. It is better (and now easier) to do things yourself. These days the music industry as such is inconsequential to playing music. Practice a lot and play out as much as possible. because I thought it would be fun. - Instruments: 1 myself plus the musicians that I choose to work with. - Years playing: singer - Instruments: \"Cockpit\" for the last 9 years - Years playing: Drums My band works really well together as a team. All decisions are communally made. We all have aspects of our business that each of us handles. Tama drum kit- 12\" & 13\" rack toms, 16\" 22\" kick drum. DW hardware including pedals. Zildjian cymbals that tend to vary on the larger side. \"There is a difference. It takes two of us to load a Marshall half stack. Also, our touring vehicle usually smells a lot better. We have to be very conscientious when traveling. Truck stops can be a little frightening in the middle of the night so we use the buddy system. Aside from small details, there really isn't that much of a difference. We all love music and choose to creatively express ourselves that way. Women have been allowed to vote, hold jobs, fly planes, perform operations etc for quite some time now. There's no reason why they can't play guitar too.\" I can only assume that previous generations of women had a lot more resistance as they blazed the trail. \"I have gotten amazing amounts of valuable advice over the years. Probably the most constructive was from Abe Laboriel Sr. who said \"\"half your audience is deaf and half your audience is blind\"\". As entertainers it is our job to entertain. People don't watch you play with their eyes closed. Producer and record label executive Ron Fair once said to me \"\"I've helped give you thick skin, it's good, you're gonna need it\"\". Boy was he right. You can't be too sensitive. Not everyone will love what you're doing. If you play from the heart with confidence, that's all that matters. My advice specifically directed at women seeking a career as a musician is this. A gimmick can only bypass hard work to a certain degree. Don't strive to be \"\"good for a girl\"\". Work on being a good musician across the board and you might have a good shot. \" I've been in love with rock & roll since I was a small child. I think I was sold on the drums when I went to my first concert and felt the kick drum in my chest. - Instruments: various orchestras, choral groups when they have a harp part...basically, I'm a solo artist - Years playing: harp I do everything along with my husband who helps produce and inspire the music. solo harp ;-) Since there aren't a lot of harpists who are male, I've never really felt any type of resistance or discrimination between the genders. All of my music teachers (in St. Louis and at Indiana University) have been older, gracious, 'ladies' who encouraged compassionate support and group experiences that helped each of their students grow. Several years ago, when I moved to a different city, I was surprised at the competitiveness and downright primal territorial protectiveness that each musician had for their 'turf'...and many of them were my age. I felt their uncertainty and fear under the surface of their 'masks' and, thanks to my husband's work situation, eventually moved back home to St. Louis. Was the uncertainty generational? I believe that there are a lot of factors that play into generational differences, not just with musicians but with people in general. I do believe that many musicians today view 'the industry' and 'professional musicians' from very different eyes...just as young football and baseball players view their sport. For my teachers, they played because they loved it, it came from their heart and they shared their gifts with their students. Today, many musicians play for the buck and market to the masses...music is 'produced' rather than 'created' and the outcome is a completely different experience for the listener. It's my hope and dream that all musicians remember the true value and purpose of their gift...for me, my music is the vibration of love that touches the soul. My advice to all my students is to play from your heart and 'share' the music...don't 'perform' it. When you share music from the inside, you're not dependent upon the response of the audience...there's no attachment to the outcome, thus there's no stress. You play because YOU love to play. When you 'perform,' you're always dependent on the audience's response, which is crazy since you have no control over how they'll respond. Thus, the tension and stress can become almost unbearable...and that energy is then flowing through the music...which, on an unconscious level, the audience is picking up. The bottom line for me is to play from the inside out...not 'for' the outside, hoping to fill up the inside. My father was the Administrator of Music in the Alton School system and there wasn't a harpist, so he asked me if I wanted to play and I said \"sure.\" front acoustic guitar, cable, headstock tuner, capo, strap, clogs. it is easier to get attention, harder to hold it. once a producer didnt introduce me to his wife and i later noted, it caused a lot of unnecessary trouble. once i watched a female musician backstage at the opry work to diffuse the tension b/t her and the women who were with the men she was working with. i think older women that are still surviving at it rely less on their sexuality. but they have more grace. yeah people told me to not change, but i've definitely changed. i would tell them its okay to change and its okay to let a man carry your gear. my mother played - Instruments: three - Years playing: drums in the band, we all kind of do our own thing and collectively make decisions that concern all of us. I write all of my own parts but I never write anyone else's. when we record, I record all of my parts first because that's usually how it works with drums, so I usually bang those out and then come back for mixing if I have time, but mixing can feel like too many cooks in the kitchen often and it's not necessarily my strongest suit, so...it kind of depends. business and marketing decisions...we have publicists so they help out a lot with that kind of stuff but for the most part we're all in the loop of making those decisions. I have an old Japanese drum kit. It's red and sparkly, pretty tiny, and doesn't even have a brand name on it. It's super easy to fit into a van (or SUV for that matter), and there was always one piece missing so someone had to make me a special custom part to connect my rack tom to the kick drum. it always impresses me, seriously, every time! YES! Where to even begin...in general, there is a certain natural confidence guys exude that girls just wouldn't necessarily have the balls to even think of. This is most prominent on stage but surely in recording sessions and maybe even practices as well. The ways guys treat you as a female musician, what they expect from you, their reaction to you once they see you play... I don't remember a moment in particular. I feel like I've always known. Actually, scratch that. Going to hardcore shows in high school and being one girl of a million boys in mosh pits, and my very favorite, going to watch my male friends at band practice in high school! Like, why would I have ever wanted to do that? I can only imagine anyone coming to a practice of mine now for pure entertainment. I remember one time in high school in particular where I grabbed the microphone and sang all practice long, but still, the one time I joined the band, I was the lead singer. Kind of telling... Sure. Women used to have songs written for them, dances choreographed...members selected and put together. They used to dress up in costumes that were super sexy and revealing to try to sell themselves. Many women do that now still, but clearly so much more is about taking it all back, making your own decisions, writing your own everything, picking out your own clothes, ones that you want to wear, etc. Hmm, not that I can think of? There must have been something along the way. Some advice that I really love in general is to think of your life like a movie and ask yourself what the character who plays you would do in certain situations. Or choose a character from a book you really love and when faced with tough decisions, ask yourself what would that person do and then follow that advice. That was kind of a tangent, huh? Advice, let's see...it takes at least twice as long to get really good at what you play. Patience is key when learning an instrument, but it totally pays off in the end. I have always known drums were for me. I was a tap dancer when I was little and really loved that. tap dancing and drumming always kind of felt like the same thing to me, and music was always a big passion...then it became an even biggen passion in my teen years and after, so it just seemed kind of obvious/logical. - Instruments: All current and active The Breeders, The Carrions, Tsk Tsk, Exene Cervenka - Years I try to be \"every role\" and sometimes that gets me into trouble.. a red 1960's modified Marshall Head, Hiwatt cabinet and a beautiful tobacco burst Gibson Les Paul.. The groupies are different! haha, no.. If you can play you can play..I've never felt any type of oppression.. no difference..We all try and make moving music to get our \"mating call\" out there.. Don't shit where you eat!! When listening to music, I have always been attracted to the sound of a guitar over anything else in a song..the guitar is the easiest way for me to communicate..Oh, plus when I was 12 years old, seeing Slash in the Paradise City video.. - Instruments: 2, solo project with 4 albums and a duo project as a teen - Years playing: vocals, guitar, songwriter I'm the band leader. I run the business and hire the band and work with various business partners on different releases. I'm the lead singer, composer and songwriter for most of the material we perform. I hire producers, direct the marketing and booking. At times, I'm sorta a one woman army with a lot of awesome angels around to help out. \"I own and play a Taylor 614 CE and on the road i travel with a telecaster and a CA guitar (Composite Acoustic) I also have an Ampeg Superjet Amplifier for the Tele\" In this day and age, it's challenging to survive in music for anyone. However, I do feel that being a woman can be limiting. Sadly, image can play a key role in a woman's success in music. Moreso than men. Men \"mature\" more gracefully in the public eye while women who grow older, gain weight or become mothers often lose their marketability. We also often don't get to join in the 'boys club' style networking that often happens and that sometimes can be a challenge. I have been inappropriately propositioned many times by club owners. I have been treated as property on several occasions and have often been patronized in business settings. However, I will say that we have a great opportunity to grow into even stronger, more amazing women in this process. Despite the odds, I do feel it is possible for a woman in the music business to defy the \"whore\" or \"bitch\" stereotype with steadfast dedication, boundaries, clear communication and confidence. It's just unfortunate that those stereotypes are often strikes against us before we begin. \"I think that all women who have made a career in music have made very hard decisions and sacrifices since the beginning of the entertainment industry. It's challenging to know that your career is likely to suffer or even end if you venture into motherhood. My grandmother was a singer in Trinidad in a troop who performed for the soldiers. They were a very well established act in the Islands and she had to retire in order to marry. There have been amazing examples of women musicians in my mother's generation who found a way to balance their business and families and they are an inspiration to me. Sarah McLaughlan and Ani Difranco were key mover in the generation of women before me, shifting the women in business/musician role paradigm. These women, their own ways were trail blazers for my generation. My generation of women musicians have the challenge of becoming creative in terms of not only musical content, but business. In a world where the music business is often referred to as \"\"in shambles,\"\" we have an opportunity to participate in an entirely new paradigm of distribution and access. \" \"I was signed at 19 to a label and had no clue what I was getting into. I wish there had been a mentor in my life at that time who could've shared with me the pros and cons and realities of having a career in music, but didn't. I have, though, over the years had some really amazing peers and mentors who have helped me to navigate through rough periods. Advice for a woman beginning her career. 1. Don't make any decisions based in fear 2. Don't make any decisions out of haste (also fear) 3. Embrace what feels natural, don't try to become something you are not able to fully embody 4. Stay focused. 5. Practice. 6. Get plenty of rest and exercise and do healthy things to de-stress. There's a LOT of booze in this business and it can really become a work hazard if you're not careful 7. Check in at each stage in the game and make sure this is a labor of love. . .\" It was portable. I wanted to bring music everywhere I went as a teen. Singing has been a passion since grade school, so it was a no brainer to begin composing on guitar. \" Me and the singer [ Rachel Nagy ] run the band by ourselves and with the help of some good friends. We are also responsible for all the material that gets recorded, and I have mostly mixed and mastered all our records. We have a great booking agent; Dave Kaplan, The Agency. Our marketing decision are few and usually I deal with them.\" \" Equipment changes constantly. On the road I use a trayner head [mach II] with a custom bottom. Right now i use a cheap reissue of a Les Paul jr. [ at least that's what it looks like], it has one P-90, one volume and one tone knob. Road gear has to be durable. Recording gear is another story all together. \" \" Of course there is! I don't even know how to begin. Everything from compliments to getting paid to to what they expect to from you. It works for you and against you. When those moments happen, you are sort of shocked and you have to chuckle and keep going on, for what's the point. You are usually dealing with a frustrated musician who hates being there. They are usually convince that you got to where you're at because you are female and lucky. If that was true, I don't understand why they want to be in this. Okay that's the road, there's another can of worms when it comes to running the band. Telling men what to do and how to do it, is another skill that has to be worked on. It's tough! It is probably here that I experience the most animosity, hostility, friction, call it what you will. Finding respect its almost never, regardless if you are the one that hires them. And its amazing to me that in the end they will stick together even if its detrimental to them! [maybe its the nature of being in a group and we are an identifiable target] Okay and now the studio. You are talking about having to attack someone's talent! When it comes to making a record, you have to get what you need and you can not compromise. I have had the pleasure of working with an amazing roster of musicians, known and unknown, and that's why the records sound great. Communicating in music is tough and can lead to many arguments and angry situations. All I can say is that the more talented the musician, the less he argues and understand that it is not an attack on him but a communicating problem. In my opinion men interaction with each other its different than ours and it gets in the way when we interpret each others actions and intentions\" \" when working with Jackie DeShannon, she told me that she also has the same problems when working with men when trying to get them to play a certain way. That this had been going on since the early days,[50's] and nothing has changed. You can compliment them and explain how you are not trampling on them and laid it all out and still.....\" \" Any advice I would have for any woman would probably the same as anything in any workplace. Don't try to be like men, be a woman, but don't hide behind it. \" \" Basically its the instrument I could get my hands on, that was hard enough.\" - Instruments: The Ettes, Aanchors Aaweigh - Years playing: Drums Aside from the beat keeper, I'm the default merchandise artist. I create t-shirts, buttons, posters, press photos, music videos, and anything else I can touch with my hands or my mac. \"Kirchoff Schlagwerk Drum kit in a cognac sparkle! 24\"\" floor Firth Sticks 5B Remo drum heads\" \"Well, there's less of us in rock n roll, that's for sure. I think I've experienced both sides of it. Sometimes I feel like things get handed over to me easier because I'm a woman and you see less of us on stage in general. But then I've been on the other half (many, many times) when not much was expected of us girls and the door prematurely slammed in our faces. Mostly, you deal with people saying things like, \"\"You know, I don't really like female drummers but you're alright!\"\". As if thats some sort of compliment and I should take comfort in their new found respect for a singular female artist. Good or bad, I don't recall a particular moment when the difference was made clear. I think I've always just known it's there. \" \"Not really. If anything, I usually sense a form of comradery amongst a group of female musicians regardless of age. We know the trials and triumphs of being a woman in this industry (of being a woman in general) and detect it in one another by sight. Like a secret handshake. Like a gang. \" \"Don't sell your publishing and don't choke your sticks (two seperate people and incidents).

I am very hands on with my business and marketing. I have a group of people i work with but act very much as a strong partner in all the things I put out and market. Yamaha keyboard, Neumann microphone, and sometimes an Alesis Keyboard. I bring out other players with me as well such as drums, bass, lap steel, guitar, violins, cellos, harp, other singers.... all depending on the tour/show. \"I think it can be if you initially let it. Especially as a writer - I have a tendency to not like most female singer/song writers (with exceptions of course). It's important not to make the material too precious and one dimensional. That's difficult for a lot of women - they want emotion and speak straight from their diaries a great deal - which unfortunately can get lost in the mix a lot. The most difficult part about being a woman is when it comes to business. Quite often it's not in our nature to make tough business-related assertive decisions. Confrontation can be difficult. Keeping emotion out of business (some of the times) is vital yet hard for women to do. I actually majored in music composition and was the only female out of 40 other students. It mentally forced me to work hard (nothing was imposed or presupposed by my male colleagues). I inflicted my own pressure and because of it, learned how to work hard.\" \"Not necessarily. In some ways, yes. In other ways, no. For example, if you go all the way back to the early 1000's you'll find people like Hildegard of Bingen making music and leaving their mark. Then later in the early 1800's there was Fanny Mendelssohn. And later on in 1942 there was Viola Smith making quite a splash as a consummate jazz drummer who could hold her own in any jam session. I see a common thread of women making their mark (albeit less common than men, of course) but a mark nonetheless. One difference in today's generation vs. yesteryear is how bold women have become - too bold. Women push their image and looks harder than they ever have. Sex is everywhere and it's greatly due to women. They play that card too often. All opportunity is there for women - we tend to create our own battles now a days... Women's lib is over and we now have women forfitting families for careers. It's being engrained in us at an early age - to find our dream and make it a reality. No one ever tells you about the part when you're 30, single, no children and your whole family is asking \"\"why?\"\" \"\"What happened?\"\" Sacrifices must be made. \" \"The advice I was given is to expect extreme highs and extreme lows. Balance will be hard to find. The rollercoaster is often exciting but commonly draining. Be prepared for that. My advice to women is to never let gender be a thing. Let go of any of that.

I noticed the difference right away, as soon as I was playing in bands. It was especially clear to me when playing shows. There were several instance where the venue wouldn't let me in because they didn't believe I was in the band and thought I was just someone's girlfriend trying to get in for free. I had to find one of my band mates to get me in. Also I've been denied drink tickets, free beverages, food, or what ever benefits bands get at shows for the same reason. Also if I bring my boyfriend with me to a show, they assume that he is the one in the band, not me. Also I know I need to play better that any other guy on my instrument in my genre to be taken seriously. I feel at this point I have achieved that respect.\" I can't think of any. \"Some older female musicians I've met have been very supportive. My advice to a woman just starting out is don't date anyone in your band- it's never good. Also demand equal say in any band decision- it's your music too.\" I started with guitar when I was 11 years old, in high school a band needed a bass player so I started playing bass.

We decide everything with the 3 of us, but I'm the one who speaks with our manager. \"I've got a philicora organ, a dutch electronic organ from the sixties. Also got a microkorg XL synthesizer.

Got a spanish guitar (which I can't play), and a ukelele (which I can play a little).\" For me there's not much difference. People treat you the same, when they know you're in the band. I only feel the difference when we just arrive somewhere. Im the only girl in the band with 2 guys with me. We have always a manly sound enigeer and manly light mixer with us. When we arrive at a venue or festival, first impression is that one of the crew is part of the band and that I'm just the \"girlfriend\" of one of them, but that miscommunication is pretty fast gone. I don't really know, don't know that many women musicians and espacially not in an earlier generation. Use the fact that you're a women. Play with the audiance, be the cute girl or be the bitch. Doesn't matter cause they will like you because you're a female. I didn't choose to play the keys. When we first started the band we felt that the combination of bass and drums was too minimal. The only option for us was not another bandmember but me learning keys. We didn't want a guitar in the band so the only option was keys. - Instruments: 2 (Panda Riot, architecture) - Years playing: Panda Riot- vocals, keys, tambourine \"In Panda Riot, my boyfriend and bandmate, Brian, makes the backbone of the songs with drums and guitar.

Of course the obvious difference is that there just aren't as many women musicians, especially women in bands (as opposed to solo artists or singer-songwriters). I think this is especially true in local music scenes. Because there are fewer women out there making music together, I think it is harder for young women to envision themselves growing up to be in bands. Of course, there are many many great women musicians playing in bands out there, but my sense is that they tend to be stereotyped much more than men (the singer, the chick bass player, the girl band, etc.). There is no one moment that I can name as making this clear, but I am again and again struck by the huge lack of female musicians in other bands that we play with. I can't really say due to my embarrassing lack of knowledge of a lot of music, but I think that there are a lot of women now that are breaking into and creating new genres, which is really exciting. I am thinking in particular of women like M.I.A, Victoria Legrand from Beach House, the women from Coco Rosie, Mary Timony, Joanna Newsom, and others. The music that they make defies generic categorization and, as a result, they give our culture new ideas of what it means to be a female musician. I can't think of any advice I received in particular, but the advice I would give would be to just be really determined and self-reliant. There are always reasons to give up, but you can't give in to that. If you don't know how to record, buy a manual and learn, if you don't have a drummer find one or make your own drum beats. You have to have the attitude that you will figure out a way to make it work, and a lot of times when you overcome those kinds of obstacles something really unexpected and creative comes out of it, like recording vocals in your shower or making a drum beat out of tape ripping, or something. It's all about just deciding to do it and then taking the necessary steps. I took piano lessons beginning when I was five, and I'm not sure I had a reason but I knew that I wanted to play music when I was very young. In high school I started playing the guitar because I wanted to be able to play the kind of music that I listened to. I have always wanted to play lots of different instruments. - Instruments: my band, The Ruby Jane Show, since I was 10 - Years playing: fiddle, vocals, guitar, mandolin, harmonica, some keyboards I am the bandleader and songwriter. Fiddle, guitar, mandolin. I need an electric guitar but cant afford one. mics, mic stands. Is that what you mean? I dont know, Im not a man. I am growing up in music. It is art. Art is for everyone. In my experience, the older generations have been very generous to me...sharing the music and helping me. I plan to also pass on my knowledge, experience, and music to the next generation. It is the only was for its survival. I've had good advice and bad advice. There are plenty of giving musicians and plenty of sharks in the biz too. I think just surrounding yourself with the loving ones is key. Stay away from the bottomfeeders. I asked my mama for a violin at age 2 because she wouldnt let me watch tv but put in a video of Itzhak Perlman and I fell in love with strings. - Instruments: 1 - The Lopez - Years playing: vocals / cowbell Personally, I just use a microphone and the cowbell. Our band also uses an electric guitar, a bass guitar, and a full drum kit. We aren't really about \"making our way\" in the music industry. Everyone in our band is totally in it for fun only - and that's what we do. We always have a blast playing shows, meeting and hearing other bands. Because it's all in FUN!!!!!!!!!!! - Instruments: Two - Years playing: Vocals, Guitars, Harmonica, Mandolin, I'm 100% independent. Back in 1997, I released a CD called \"Two Dollar Shoes.\" No one would sign me. I brought it out myself and made over twenty thousand dollars by the end of the summer. All the labels that turned me down are now out of business. \"No,\" was the best thing that ever happened to my career. That said, I have a team that helps me. Lloyd Maines is a business partner that helps make decisions. He also tours with me and helps me in the studio. It's a team effort here. \"Boss Tuner Baggs Preamp Volume Peddle Boss Chorus Peddle Special 20 Harps I collect vintage harmonicas from Germany (too many to count) Collings Guitar OM Tacoma Papoose Tacoma Mandolin Baritone Mandolin Tradition Electric Guitar Gibson Dreadnought Guitar Takamine 6 and 12 string Keyboard Sure Beta 57 and 58 \" Yes, I do. I think that as a woman, you can get away with far less on that stage as well as on a recording. I've seen and heard men that do not sing very well, and yet they do quite well here in Texas. It's all attitude. But for women, you have to be at this higher level. And even women that flat kill it on their instruments, are not written up for their prowess. A good example of this, would be the Dixie Chicks. That said, the new wave of women coming out of Texas are amazing. Look at Sarah Jaroz. When a level is set high, you must reach for it. This makes you a better musician. And yes, there was a moment that made a difference clear for me. Many years ago, I determined that I was going to not only play, but perform on the same stages as men and at the same level. I don't see race or genre. If folks who book me do, I can not help them. That's out of my control. To this day, there are a few women who book music in Texas that get on my nerves. We need more forward thinking women in the industry who are talent buyers who will book based on musicianship and not on gender. What is in my control is to lift up other women, and encourage them to play an instrument and not just sing. Dress for the stage but sell your art and not your gender and you will have a long career. I do. This \"gender\" thing will die off. As I write this to you, it is. The new generation is fearless. They are also fantastic. They keep me on my toes for sure. They will have my job if I don't practice. They seem to embrace musicianship. They seem more eager to learn to play. Let me add that women my age are coming back into the fold too. They are picking back up their instruments. I teach workshops. Attendance has more than doubled for women. Ten years ago, this was not the case. Yes, the most valuable advice I ever received was be aware that you are a woman. Dress for the job. Watch your pants when you bend over. Watch your pants when you sit down. Watch your shirt when you bend over. Watch your skirt if you have to sit on a stool. This stuff might sound stupid, but it's important. Play your instrument. Never quit practicing. Tolerate nothing less than respect. Give others nothing less than respect. Don't cuss on stage. Don't gossip. Never talk trash about another woman. Buy as much music as you can ... both men and women. Own your own universe. All of these things were told to me by a female guitarist named Marion Williamson who passed away in 1997. Mainly what was going to go over live. When I started playing, I was playing solo in redneck dancehalls. So, country blues like Mississippi John Hurt went over well. That was suited for acoustic guitar. Then, I fell for Sonny Terry and that brought on the harmonica. I like to shake it up live, so the different instruments add color to a show. - Instruments: Have worked as a session singer in live bands for Sandi Thom (current), Natasha Hamilton and Liz McClarnon (Atomic Kitten), as well as being an artist myself. - Years playing: Vocals \"My debut album was released in 2009, recorded at Abbey Road Studios and The Dairy Brixton. I raised \u00a312.5k through fans money by pioneering and setting up 'Pick an Orange Project' in 2008. Each song was called an 'orange' and each 'orange' had 10 'segments'. I sold these segments for \u00a3100 each and in under 5 months had raised \u00a312.5k towards the album. I co-wrote every track on the album and I co-produced the album and arranged the tracks. I sat in on mixing also. I hand picked the musicians. I book all my gigs, I act as my own manager. I set up my own label TLC Records, to release the album on. I often use my middle name and maiden name to make up Victoria Powling, Head of TLC Records, when making business calls. I do my own press plugging using this alias and have had success getting airplay and reviews globally. So, I make all the decisions basically! I'm hoping people will come on board along the way so I can concentrate on writing and performing more, but having said that I enjoy driving my career and think I will find it hard to release control!!!! \" Absolutely. Music is a mans world. On the tour bus, in the studio, in the business meeting; its all about the boys. I find it hard as a young, blonde girl to often get taken seriously especially in meetings and in the studio. On my album I had to fight to get musicians that were working for me to take my seriously at first and they kept looking to my co-producer Kevan. Eventually you get taken seriously but you have to prove yourself for a lot longer than a man would. The same is said for meetings with industry types. I have to prove myself to be intelligent and business minded. That is not taken for granted, even looking at my past with setting up the label, setting up Pick an Orange Project, raising \u00a312.5k and co-writing and co-producing the album. The impression I get is that they think all that has been worded well to look like I actually drove all that, instead of assuming that I actually did all that...by myself!! I think if you want to survive in the music industry as a woman you have to accept this is the way it is and be prepared to work hard and longer than the men often do to proove yourself. Not in my experience. \"My best advice was from my Dad who said don't believe the bad stuff they write about you and don't believe the good stuff. Don't let the good stuff swell your head, don't let the bad stuff bring you down. Instead know who you are, what you are about and stay steady. This life is such a rollercoaster that I almost daily remind myself of this! My advice to a woman musician starting out would be to do the best with what you've got. Don't try to be something you're not, as a musician, as a person, as an image. Just work hard at making the best out of what you've got. It's all about working hard. And sticking together as ladies and supporting each other, instead of comparing and bringing another girl down. Leave that to the men to do!! We need to be strong together I think. Its healthier all round.\" I was always the performer. Dancing, singing and making a show of myself. Singing was just natural. I later became a songwriter and found my passion for communicating through music. - Instruments: Jazz: Lea Delaria, many pick up groups. Contemporary: Mad Coyote Ensemble. Taiko Japanese Drums: Taikoza Classical: Queens Symphony, NYC public school outreach: Music Outreach. Many Broadway and touring companies including Cabaret revival with Joel Grey, Miss Saigon, Sunset Blvd.., CATS, Big, Mary Popins - Years playing: Drums Drummer or percussionist Drum sets of various sizes and woods, cymbals, Marimba, Chudaiko, congas, timbales, etc... things that make interesting sounds when hit, shaken or scraped Of course. Fraternity. Sexual harassment. Expectations. Yes. Many more doors open to them. They have more role models and less expectation that they 'can't' play whatever instrument - fill in the blank \"Not really. Just the - \"\"you have to be twice as good as a man\"\" - and \"\"play with more balls\"\" male teachers really said those things to me A couple of key people treated me as a fellow musician, which is the most valuable. To women starting out: Play what you love. Seek out those who support you. practice, stay healthy. It's not that easy, - for men or women - so just accept the challenges.\" It chose me. - Instruments: 3! = 1) Killola 2) Lola 3) playing: vocals Motivational Leader, keeper-in-checker, prankster, consummate friend-to-the-fans brain + lungs + microphone (sometimes) \"Boys have a free pass with crass.... as soon as a woman \"\"goes there\"\" or says something slightly edgy or \"\"ballsy\"\"... people are shocked. Women can 'have balls' too ya know, its not just a testicle thing. \" \"20 years ago, guys in suits decided everything in the music business. But things have totally leveled out. Women have so much power now, I'd even dare to say more power... mainly because female fans (which is a probably one of the biggest single demographics, second maybe to 'teens') have no reservations about declaring their adoration for a female musician. The female fans are honest, and loud about their favorites. The influence is very direct. Guys aren't AS eager to wear their favorite musician on their sleeve. After a certain age, boys seem less willing to evangelize about a male role-model... maybe its an ego thing.\" \"No. They didn't! ... Haha, that's a little sad now that I rack my brain for it... but I'm almost glad that no one did. I might have done something differently, and I'm not second guessing anything I've done. I guess the closest I can remember, is one of our first managers always telling us to \"\"write more songs\"\". ... Advice I'd give to a woman starting out: Do this for the person you look at in the mirror every morning. If you're doing this because you want a record deal, or because you desire monetary fortune... you might want to stop... and re-evaluate. I'd say write a bunch of songs, and have a blast playing them. If you get better, and get better, all the right things will happen.\" It feels good to tell stories, and singing is also a natural outlet for release. - Instruments: 3, Avenue in high school, Rachele Eve and Deanna Devore - Years playing: vocals, acoustic/electric guitar, songwriter I am the front-woman, songwriter and main vocalist of my band. In the studio, I allow a more organic process to take place, inviting in musicians to act like extensions of my body of work, bringing musical ideas to the table the stretch my overall vision. In business, I am my own manager, booking agent, bandmate babysitter and scheduler, accountant... In the words of David Lewis (Riot Act Media Founder), \"I am my own dirtbag.\" I have an Acoustic Taylor 110, Baby Taylor for travel, Boss RC-20XL Loop Station RC20X, Korg Chromatic Tuner Pedal, ProTools MBox, MXL Recording Condenser and Room Mic Set, and a Yamaha 6 Channel Mixer and Two Speaker/Monitors Surely. I'm a tomboy and it still isn't the same. The moment became clear early on because it wasn't too hard to figure out. Now especially, I look around and realize... I've worked with 4 other musicians that are women... the others are all men. 6 years, 4 women, the rest men... the math is pretty clear. Not really. However, I ripped my first electric guitar solo the other night and it didn't take much to impress people. \"Other than the givens- love what you do, don't quit, and work hard.... I would say to accept the pace in which opportunities come and don't rush into anything without being 100% sure it's what you want and more importantly, what you need for your music to live on. In the beginning, all you have to do is play out and get fans. That's the easy part. The rest will come in due time.\" Good question. Probably because I liked it over playing the piano. - Instruments: I've performed and recorded with 3 bands, Ettison Clio, gameboygirl, and Beekeeper - Years playing: vocals I like to be a leader, but I think that everyone in the band needs to put forth opinions and participate in all decisions. When it comes to writing, since I'm not playing an instrument, I usually sit in on practices while the other members jam and give my opinion on song structure. For example \"that part would be a really great verse, you should double it here\", etc. After the song is structurally laid out, we do a rough recording through garageband and then I write the vocals and lyrics at home. Once that is done I show the band what I came up with and we go from there. In the studio I definitely give my opinion but also respect what each musician really wants from their particular sound. When it comes to vocals, I definitely try any ideas the producer or my bandmates put forward, but ultimately I am the final say on how I want them to sound. As far as marketing decisions I am 100% involved. Being in a band requires a good business sense, and all members should again come to a decision mutually on how they want the group to be represented. I had an Audix Om 5 microphone with my past bands (I recently broke it and had to sell it). Other than that I have the standard PA system for practicing. I also have some other random instruments; a Fender strat guitar, a keyboard, tambourine, etc. that I use at home, but have not performed with them onstage. Most definitely. I think most people don't take me seriously when I tell them I am a musician. I think they assume I don't really know what I'm talking about. Women are definitely outnumbered in that field. It's a lot easier for men to find people to play with in that regard. I didn't really encounter much sexism in my most recent bands, but with my first it was unbelievable. I think it was because at that time, there weren't a lot of female fronted bands playing in that genre, so people didn't know how to react to it. A lot of people were into it, but others would get really aggressive and write me off as a marketing scheme or pick apart my appearance as opposed to my actual talent. There would be times when we would go to play a show, and the bouncers weren't going to let me in because they thought I was a groupie or a girlfriend. I'd say no, I'm in the band and they would look over me and turn to the guys in my band and say \"Is she in the band?\". That definitely made it clear to me that I wasn't being taken seriously, that is until I actually got on stage and performed. I think it's more about differences in experience regarding genre. For example it may be harder to be taken seriously as a female in rap than it is as a female in country music. Through the decades women in music have consistently struggled to be taken seriously. I can't remember specifics of advice given to me, but I've learned a lot going through it. I'd advise to have a thick skin when it comes to putting yourself out there. Persistence is key, and there are going to be people that will disregard you for no reason other than you being female, but if it's what you love keep pushing forward. I got involved with musical theater in the 8th grade and was extremely passionate about it. I spent my high school career singing in plays and taking voice lessons. When I went to college I realized that I was more interested in singing in bands than in plays and so went on from there. - Instruments: Airway - Years playing: Cello voice I sing in Airway. I sing and play cello with Joe Potts with his other group Extended Organ. Joe and the manager make business decisions. When I do solo work or produce myself I decide Voice,acustic cello An old violinist friend once told me there is an element of jealousy towards a female lead singer because as he said \"if there's a girl on stage the rest is pigs\"! I think it's harder to be taken seriously if you are a singer. I notice people'sreactions when I say I am also a cellist. I have serious classical and jazz training In both but get credibility bec ause I play an instrument. \"I don't know. I made up my mind a long time ago that no one could steal my unique expression. There was a lot of distrust towards other women about material and more than a case or two of a singer \"\"stealing\"\" away your band or a member of it when I was young. Even Lily Tomlin wanted my band without me once! Iam currently putting together a project of all women musicians. I enjoy hearing what's new. I notice ageism but hell, Im old AND still working so I get to be gracious. Life is good. \" Know you are in it for the long run. Continue to study your instrument. Be the best you can be. It's not about fame. It's about satisfaction and joy. No one gave me any advice except learn your instrument well. In5th grade I told my mother my elementary school was offering music training. I asked if I could play violin. I got a cello. I grew up thinking everybody sang because I heard my parents always sang - Instruments: 6. Of these the most important are Stripmall Architecture and Halou - Years playing: I sing \"I co-write all the songs with my husband, book and advance our live shows, deal with promotion and provide input on all our creative output, of which there is a ton. We *just* released our second album on April 20. Here are a few things we are working on now: TWITTERSONGS: We want our online presence to be more than a glorified mailing list. We wanted to find a way to engage our online \"\"friends\"\" and connect with them in a more meaningful way. One thing we have done is we've started recording short songs for random followers of ours on Twitter. 123Aminor: We picked a tempo and a key and are creating a pool of audio from which anyone is welcome to create music. We will be posting a bunch of loops and recordings of our own design as well as asking for contributions from anyone who wants to get involved. Our goal is to find ways of collaborating on actual music with our fans and listeners in new ways. LIVE PERFORMANCES: Our lives shows have been building into something quite extraordinary that we're really excited about, and we have been trying all sorts of new things onstage. A couple of weeks ago, we arranged several of our songs for strings and we performed half our set with a violin/viola/cello trio accompanying us which I thought was quite beautiful. During a lot of our set, it was hard not just stand there and listen to what was coming from the other side of the stage. Additionally, we have developed short films for each of our songs and we synchrnoize those films to our live perofrmance. Often times we will incorporate non-traditional instruments such as typewriters, crystal glasses, and choirs into our live shows. Along with these Stripmall Architecture live shows we've been doing, we've been working on some special unique performances. This past winter, we did an entire performance of the music of This Mortal Coil, which involved a 10-piece ensemble which included a string quartet and three vocalists. The show sold out quickly and generated one of the most emotional responses I've ever seen to a live performance I've done. People were coming up to us with tears in their eyes saying they never thought they'd hear that material live. It was a lot of work, but really rewarding. THE NEAR FUTURE: In June we will be releasing \"\"Pripyat and the Halcyon Versions\"\" which will be alternate versions of all the songs on Feathersongs for Factory Girls. On June 16 we are headlining the WomenROCK show at the Independent in San Francisco. This show is sponsored by the National Organization for Women (NOW) http://www.theindependentsf.com/calendar/event-detail/?tfly_event_id=8827 In July, we will be launching our 123Aminor project (described above) In August we will be doing a second tour of the Western states (we just finished one). We will be touring with The Frail, another great band from San Francisco. In the Fall (Septemberish?) Rebecca will be on the new UNKLE album. She sang a track with them for the Lumerians (yet another great SF band).\" \"On stage I use a mic and a kaoss pad to cut up my vocals and a bunch of percussion. In the studio, I have a fantastic super fancy mic and pre-amp. \" \"Someone who is in an influential position in the music industry told me once that if a man sings about a political topic, he sounds insightful and angry. If a woman sings about a political topic, she sounds whiney. Additionally no one has ever commented on my husband's physical appearance (we are both in the band) but I get unsolicited comments made at me *quite* frequently.\" Yes - women are more than just the siren or folk singer these days. Women are also in the band and not just singers. Be phenomenal. Because I love to sing and I stink at playing guitar or bass while I'm doing so. - Instruments: just one, Morningwood - Years playing: vocal chords In the band I cowrite all of the songs, Pedro our bass player is more the musical director, when it comes to lyrics I take charge. On stage I am the boss. In the studio, Pedro takes control of the logistical stuff, I go in and sing. In business and marketing decisions I work hand in hand with our manager to come up with ideas, that is probably my favorite AND least favorite part of the job, but I am very hands on when it comes to business and marketing and TRY to be as educated as possible about the decisions we need to make. I am currently taking a marketing class at UCLA to get a better understanding of how things work and so I can apply it to my career. A bedazzled microphone. I do think there is a difference being a female musician and being a male musician. To be honest I think women can get away with more than a man can. At the same time I think a woman is judged based on her looks and sexuality where as men are judged by the product they are making. But in the same vein a lot of girl musicians rely on the fact that they are girls to not be as good as men when it comes to playing their instruments or performing on stage. I know that there was a very clear difference between being a frontwoman rather than a frontman, when I bring a girl or boy, sometimes both, up on stage and make them strip for a song that we play, I do this almost every night, people come to expect it at our shows. I never take off any of my clothes, and I basically force the person to undress and sometimes make out with them. If a man EVER did anything CLOSE to what I do he would probably get lambasted and be in serious trouble. I find that incredibly interesting. Not really, I think girls are still playing the role of girls as being sexual objects, even I fall pray to that sometimes. I think everything is still the same. I do think at this very moment in time it is very acceptable to be a female singer. When we first started 8 years ago it was very out of style to be girl lead singer especially fronting a rock band. No females were played on the radio, or on rock radio, besides Evanescence. Now they play Paramore and Evenescence still so there is still a long way to go. The best advice I have received is \"don't count on anything happening until it has happened\". People make a lot of promises and whether or not their intentions are good a lot of things fall through, so don't get your hopes up too high until you are doing something. Also I would say learn to play your instruments and perform better than a man. You don't want to have to rely on the fact that you are a girl to get you through your career. You can be sexual but have your musicianship down first then you can do whatever you want. It is like learning your lines for a play before you can experiment. because I love to singa, about the moona and the juna and the springa, i love to singa, about a sky of blue and tea for two, anythinga with a swinga means i love you, cuz i love to singgggg! - Instruments: several: Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Opera Boston, Emmanuel Music, Apple Hill Center for Chamber Music etc - Years playing: Viola In addition to being a performing member of my ensemble am the Artistic Director of Firebird Ensemble which is a non-profit organization. In addition I am Executive Director and perform many roles including: administration, fund raising, board activities, grant writing, programming and general organization. I have administrative help from part time personnel. Not exactly sure what you mean. If recording gear: we hire a professional recording engineer for all our recordings. In the United States not really although I am aware that in Europe there are organizations which are still male dominated. I have not encountered gender in the classical field of music in my professional life since arriving in the US 12 years ago. Perhaps younger generations of women are more ambitious in general than they once were. I see more women taking entrepreneurial roles in the arts now than before. It is also possible that I notice it more than I did previously, because I am now in one of these roles myself. I was given wonderful advice from one of my teachers who said: If you can do something other than music, you probably should. If you can't live without it as your primary way of life then you will find a musical way to make a difference, to create something special to share with others. I was very drawn to the timbre of the viola when I first tried playing it in my late teens. Prior to that I studied piano, violin and oboe. - Instruments: 2- Detalles, Kate Simko - Years playing: Piano, composer, electronic music producer, DJ I am the producer, composer, performer, and business head. Everything. Roland Juno 106 keyboard, Dave Smith Poly Evolver keyboard, Roland TR-707 drum machine, Roland TR-505 drum machine, Elektron Machinedrum drum machine, MFB-522 drum machine, Logic Audio, MOTU 828 sound card, Mackie HR-824 monitors There are a lot of people who want to help take away the \"burden\" of doing all of the work along the way. People want to help you hook-up your cables, and maybe think it's not feminine to be holed up in a studio doing all of the intricate technical work. But, I really like to do it all myself, and I like to express myself as a woman through music. More women are producing their own music from start-to-finish in this generation, which is great! I was with my grandmother at a Turkish bath in Budapest and mentioned that I had been DJ'ing on the radio for a couple years. We're very close and she was shocked I'd never mentioned it. A lady in the pool overheard our conversation and said \"Don't Hide Your Light Under a Bushel!\" to me. I never forgot that. Definitely stay modest and don't make music for your ego. But that comment taught me that it's important to share your art with the world, not hide it. I've been playing piano since I was 5 years old.. it's my natural instrument. I use analog synthesizers because they sound better than the software instruments (digital). - Instruments: Only the Measure [sa], currently have a new band called Worrier - Years playing: guitar and vocals \"I'm the primary songwriter and share those duties with our other guitarist. We bring songs to rehearsal almost fully formed and work with our bandmates on the final arrangement. In the studio we all participate in deciding the final sounds on the record. We each care a great deal about our individual instruments and their role in the record. I do most of the promotional work for the band, have booked all of our tours, and create all of our record artwork, posters and other promo art.\" I play a '72 Fender Telecaster Reissue through a Vox AC30 head \"It's absolutely different. You automatically have to prove yourself far more than a man does and even though people may think they're not being sexist, most people will give guys the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether or not they're a serious musician. Most men assume I play bass instead of guitar and I still get asked if I'm actually IN the band and not just WITH the band. A lot of people are surprised when I say that we go on tour all the time and that I sing and play guitar. Once you're in a band and start playing shows, it's much easier to forget those sorts of things when people know about your band, but they're absolutely still there. I've read so many comments online about my appearance and whether or not men find me attractive. When people are still talking about \"\"girl bands\"\" or qualify their liking my music with whether or not they like \"\"female vocals\"\", you know that it's absolutely still making a difference that I'm a woman and not the expected male front person. When we go on tour and I'm regularly the only woman playing an instrument out of four or five bands, still, in 2010, it's glaringly obvious to me that there's something stopping most women from being in full-time touring bands. It's unfortunate but true.\" I don't think it's necessarily a generational difference but I do see more women today playing genres of music that are seen as more masculine like metal, noise, or guitar heavy rock. It's amazing and you see a lot more women taking the lead in those sorts of bands. I think the most important thing is to play what you love, don't compromise that to sound more attractive or accessible, and don't take any crap from anyone about it. No one wants to listen to music you're not passionate about and even if certain topics may be heavy or difficult to think about, that's when music gets really powerful. I think it's really important for women to not be afraid to write about what's really on their minds and affecting their scenes and communities. I wanted to write songs and it was the easiest for me to play and sing at the same time. I loved performing at open mic nights when I was a kid, and a guitar made the most sense. I'm a classically trained pianist and already knew a lot about music theory and song structure, so picking up a guitar was pretty easy for me when I started playing at age 14. - Instruments: 2: Slowgun, Picastro - Years playing: guitar, violin, piano, vocals I write the song, sometimes record the music, hire the mastering engineer, apply for grants, book shows and tours and coordinate all art work and posters. 2 acoustic Seagull guitars, an upright piano, a violin with Barcus Berry pick-up, a Music Man reverb amp, a loop station, reverb unit, Macbook with Garageband and Live software for recording, Shure mircrophone. \"Yes. I think people automatically assume a woman making music is auto-biographical or confessional. A lot of people assume that someone else writes the string arrangements or that I just sing and have nothing to do with writing the music! If it were a man making the kind of music I make, I think it would be more successul. People expect women to sing a certain way; overly emotional or hysterical. If you focus on the musical arrangements and/or a different approach, they assume you are being difficult to gauage and \"\"experimental\"\". I think seeing some of my male colleagues succeed with less interesting music made me realize that. It's less threatening when coming from a man.\" Not necessarily. I don't think a ton of people went to see Nico, Alice Coltrane or Diamanda Galas perform. I do think there are an incredible group of female musicians right now making interesting music with the same level of exposure (that is to say, little or none). I don't think Pitchfork is ever going to write about Diamanda Galas but I know a lot of people who will pay money to see her. In general, the approach that these women have towards creating music has not changed; they all have a very strong sense of what they're doing. I don't think it was popular to make experimental music for a while and it's certainly a lot easier now, regardless of gender. \"Not really. I did hear the singer of the Buzzcocks tell someone not to think about what people liked. That's pretty good. I don't think the music industry is very conducive to creativity so I try to stay out of it, to be honest. My advice for a woman would be to play with and tour with as many people as possible in order to determine what kind of musician you are. Some people really aren't suited to performing or improvising and it may take a while to figure out what you respond to most. \" It was the most accessible (cheap, easy to carry around). - Instruments: Anne's Cordial - Years playing: vocals, keyboard, organ, baroque recorder I am the main composer for my band, and also do the publicity for the band. I contact some potential venues, and for my private voice studio and my career as a composer, I am the executive director. I play a Yamaha YPG625 for my band. The first time I realized it was when I was being interviewed while in college. Before then, even though i had listened to many composers and was familiar with classical literature, it didn't occur to me that I was pursuing an unusual career path as a woman. I wasn't exposed to many young female composers my own age when I was growing up, and I believe it's a lot easier to belong to a network of composers these days. When I was an undergraduate, I was the only woman I knew who wrote music in a department of about 60. As a graduate student, I was pleased to see that there were almost an even number of graduate female and male composers. However, i went back to speak at the school three years after I graduated and discovered there was only one female composer and about 15 men. That was disappointing. You are only ever in competition with yourself. No one else writes the music that you write. Don't second guess your instincts and don't try to guess what other people want to hear. Certain people will always get attention due to gimmicks, but if you are true to yourself, you will earn the respect of your colleagues and musicians. I have a whole list for Tips for Composers on my website at www.evakendrick.com. I have always loved to sing. I actually started off on guitar because I wanted to be like Maria from \"The Sound of Music\" but didn't stay with it too long. I also liked piano because I thought it could tell stories very well. - Instruments: Transister, Dangerous Household Objects, The Saddle Soars, None If Any, Slaw - Years playing: guitar, etc. I am a one-woman operation. I do all the sound and music, and make most of the decisions. I collaborate primarily with visual artists - choreographers, animators, film-makers, video game producers. \"Electric and acoustic synthesizers, Waterphone, uke, Stylophone - and multiple other percussion instruments, noisemakers and the like. I own an operate a computer-based electro/acoustic music, sound and recording studio, which is also a project studio for my commercial work doing music and sound design for multimedia and performance.\" \"I do think it's different. I think the answer is fairly complex. As a female electronic musician, I do find some gender disparity. (May I climb up on my tiny soapbaox? OK.) Societal conditioning that women somehow can't grasp technology, eems to still persist. It does still seem as if music, especially electronic music, is a male-dominated field in every sense of the word... so many factors. As a sometime teacher, I've found women to be disproportionately shy about learning electronic music - but once encouraged, off and running like any creative person. So I do think many of the factors are external, at least to begin with. And to reference the thread on teaching, I absolutely feel that when I perform and/or teach, part of why I do it is to encourage others to create - and I consciously think of encouraging other women, especially younger women just starting out. There were no women doing this kind of music that I knew of when I was starting out. My own experience has been mixed. I have been doing electronic music since I was a teenager, and my male friends did not discourage me - in fact, they would actively encourage me, gladly showing me how to work a reel to reel, or create a patch on a synthesizer. So I experienced creative community early on, and my gender was not - or at least, not always - a factor. That said, as a musician and budding technician, I encountered a lot of negativity too. Things like playing music with a bunch of guys, leading to the inevitable \"\"Hey, you play pretty good for a girl!\"\" - or browsing a music store for a mixer or other piece of gear, and being roundly ignored by the (male) sales staff. Or, even worse, eyeing a guitar or synthesizer and having the salesman come up and ask if I was looking for a gift for my boyfriend. This is rare now, but still does happen. In the 90s, on (mostly male) digital audio listservs, I would sometimes tentatively call someone on their sexism (like the guy who wrote at length about why it was good to have female studio interns - don't ask) and get instantly called out as a humorless feminist. (The latter may be true, but the former is definitely not!) Or when I would write in to a music magazine about sexist gear ads, which seemed to assume that only sex-obsessed heterosexual men would consider buying a piece of audio gear - and then only if a female model was draped over it - and get slammed in print for the same. I don't carry a chip on my shoulder, but that kind of derivative stuff demeans both genders. But for me, none of that was really a deterrent. In fact, I think it may have spurred me on, having a rebel streak and all. As I grew as a composer, I continued to have mixed experiences. In graduate school I did find that the male students, who made up 90% of the classes, also dominated the discussions and critique sessions, and not just through strength of numbers. As a result, I missed out on a lot of give and take in grad school because the guys hogged the discussions. Overall, it was a fairly egalitarian environment, but it was dominated by the guys. It was not some grand scheme to shut out the women, it just seemed to flow that way. And, to be fair, the women would kind of give up and just go into the studio instead. So it does cut both ways. Another factor of social conditioning - men dominate, women acquiesce. Both parties have to play into that for it to work. So yeah - all of the above. For whatever reason, women are not encouraged to do electronic music. But maybe some of this lies in definition, and in exposure. There are many great composers and performers in this genre who are women: Pauline Oliveros, Laurie Anderson, Annea Lockwood, Maggi Payne, Pamela Z. I know once I hit \"\"send\"\" I will think of many more. And the underground and indie scenes yield some pretty exciting artists beyond these more established names. There are a ton here in Oregon alone. So, a thought - as true as all this is, I have to say I see more and more women doing electronic music, embracing the technical, each rocking it in her own way - viola and LoopStation, turntables and samplers, acoustic instruments driving Max patches, straight up Hip Hop. Oh, and as a side note, I have been producing the \"\"Electrogals\"\" series - concerts featuring women electronic music composers and performers - on and off for a few years. I'm working on another edition for 2010, here in Portland. I encourage others to do the same!\" \"I see younger women being a bit more free to express themselves musically, and also having more institutionalized support (e.g., Girls Rock Camp.) I think this is of mixed value. I also see a ton of the same old tired stereotypes - \"\"chick\"\" musicians have to be young and hot - so.... yeah. It's mixed.\" \"No one piece of advice stands out, but then I am making my own niche and making that work, rather than \"\"making it.\"\" Advice I would give is strictly the old cliches - be true to yourself, follow your dreams, don't let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do. As long as you have a passion and something to say, you will find a way.\" I play so many, they seem to choose me. - Instruments: No regulars; always variety of different groups in different occassions - Years playing: None \"I am songwriter, singer, and producer. I make final decisions.\" My gear? Sorry, I am not sure what you are asking. :-) \"In the world out there, a woman's body is used to add as a marketing tool for their CDs to be bought. But man does not have that extra advantage. :-) With the society today however, it will be good to have women that will rise to be stars without exposing their body so that new generation of women are raised which will value morale and integrity. You'll be amaze of the positive influence it will bring; decrease in rapes, decrease in pregnancy, decrease in failed marriages, and many more. :-) \" Of course! I do not see a popular woman singer out there anymore that dresses with simplicity. It seems like women now have to go beyond their ability to sing to make it in the music world. :-) \"Yes. A musician who worked with one a popular singer told me that I will need to expose my body to make it out there (not a valuable advice to me but am sure is valuable to others. :-). For a woman musician coming in, I would say that, she has to be herself, focused, and determined, and give all her best in singing. One \"\"okay\"\" singer can make it compared to a \"\"good singer\"\" who never tried to try her best!\" I do not play and instrument but I was taking a class one time how to play piano. I would really like to play keyboard because a keyboard cam have mix of instruments and it is more portable than a piano. - Instruments: Many groups have performed my music. - Years playing: Composer I am a one-person show. I do the grunt work and the creative work and make the financial decisions. An acoustic piano (several other instruments including a soprano saxophone, violin, etc.), a MIDI keyboard, a MacBook Pro computer with Finale notation software and Digital Performer recording/sequencing software. Assorted mics, MIDI interfaces, mixers, etc. for acoustic recording. In certain areas in music yes, it is very different. Being a composer or being a conductor is very different for men and women. It is painfully clear on a regular basis. One has to bury one's head in the sand and ignore it to a certain degree in order to keep on going. Yes. The generation before me \"had it really rough\" and began breaking ground. There were few women that were receiving advanced degrees in music. My generation had it a bit easier; I am the second woman to earn a doctoral degree in composition from Juilliard; the first was Ellen Zwilich. There are many more women writing music these days, and many more are earning advanced degrees. The quality of the music is amazing. Others have expressed confidence in me as a musician - that is better than any advice. I have tried to work very hard and be persistent and make and keep friends - that is very important. My advice would be to never give up. I guess composing chose me. . .it is a compulsion really. - Instruments: La Promessa, The East Side Trio, Many small opera companies, - Years playing: voice In my band I make all the decisions, hiring and scheduling. In the studio I hire a producer to make certain artistic/sound decisions. Just a Fender portable amp and mike if needed (and cable) Lots of music books! Lyrics! I guess I am my gear. I think being a vocalist is profoundly different than an instrumentalist. And a woman vocalist has to work with the kinds of projections an audience requires from any woman they are staring at. They want beauty and grace or a reason why you aren't these things. When I am a vocalist with a band - I feel often like the interface - between instrumentalists and the audience - because the singing feels less abstract than straight out instrumental music. Also - singing can be emotionally evocative, and people do associate that with a woman's role too. So, you have to hold your own above all those associations and go beyond that. I feel like I don't avoid the associations but build on them. I think women musicians are being trusted more than before. But it's still an uphill climb, particularly in jazz. Tenacity. Practice (seriously), keep a light heart about judgments and learn from every gig you do. It's about connection to music and people, not just impressing someone who has more power and status in the music industry. I hope you like to travel and creative lifestyles! People responded to my voice. I began to study. Actually, I believe I was making fun of an opera singer at the time and someone told me I should join the school chorus. - Instruments: National Chamber Choir of Ireland, Anuna, ChristChurch Cathedral Choir, - Years playing: lots of instruments including singing, producer, conductor, composer Decision maker on all musical issues. In all business and marketting decisions I take advice from some great people but ultimately make my own decisions. Full Protools system for studio. For live shows I either play with 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, or with full orchestra depending on the show. I re-orchestrate for the different numbers. \"Yes in many ways. As a woman you have to be careful not to get caught up in the issue and just make sure to get on with it. It could side track you. People will more than likely express surprise that self produce my music and self manage my career when they probably wouldn't say that if I was a guy.\" No. I can't remember any advice right now that I was given. My advice to anyone is to follow your nose and work really really really hard on every aspect of what you do. Don't expect any magic wand effect from anyone. You will need to do all of the ground work your self if you want to be prepared for 'take-off'. Never thought about it it just happened naturally. - Instruments: I've played with a ton of people. I've been with Asleep at the Wheel for almost 5 years. I have my own band, Elizabeth McQueen and the Firebrands. I sometimes play in a jazz group with Lauren Gurgiolo called the Bright Lights Society. I've sung backup for years with my friends the Brother's Lazaroff. I'll play and/or record with anyone who asks. I have that much fun. - Years playing: Vocals and Rhythm guitar In the Wheel I'm an employee, which means my role in anything outside the realm of live performance or studio recording is pretty limited. Within those realms I'm given pretty free reign to do what I feel. But I don't have any power over business decisions. In my own career, I'm in charge of everything from writing the songs, booking the gigs, marketing anything we do and leading the band. With the Wheel I play a Gibson J-150. It's actually my boss' guitar. I have a wireless rig for the guitar. On my own I play a Gibson LC-1. \"Being a woman musician is definitely different from being a male musician. First off, there seems to be major differences in the early life of male and female musicians. All the guys I know who are pros spent a fair amount of their adolescence ensconced in their rooms, woodshedding. The really got into their instruments during that time. I only know a few women who had the same experience. That time of their lives is usually spent concerned with more social things. Women tend to come to the game later and with less musical experience than men, which makes them very often dependent on men to create the actual music, talk to other musicians and generally navigate the musical landscape. And also, women have kids. Not that men don't have children, but let's face it, it's different when you gestate and birth another human being. Your priorities shift in a huge way, one that can make a career in music seem less important. My husband and I had our first child almost 15 months ago. And I'm extremely lucky, because my husband is the drummer for the Wheel, so we've both been able to stay on the road and continue playing music. We simply bought another vehicle and brought the baby along (she was 6 weeks old when we went on our first tour). It's been amazing, but pretty grueling. And the guys in the band think we're nuts. Because those of them who have kids, well it never occurred to them to bring their kids along on the road. They missed first steps and soccer games and recitals and pretty much everything, so they could continue playing music. Me, if I had to make a choice between my baby and the road, there would be no choice. I'd choose watching my daughter grow up, hands down. Luckily my husband and I have reached a compromise, but many women don't have such flexibility. So careers and creativity may veer off track during the childbearing years. \" I see the next generation of girls approaching music, especially tradtionally male instruments like guitar and drums, in a much less timid manner. Which makes my heart soar. The best advice I got was from my male musician friends, who encouraged me to learn as much as I could and become as capable as I could. Not having to be dependent on men to express my ideas or create is huge. I gravitated towards guitar because I wanted to be able to accompany myself. Also, I've learned the vocabulary of theory through guitar, which I think is crucial to making your own music and playing with other people. Being able to speak the same language as the people (mostly men) I play with is huge. Chick singers do not normally command a lot of respect in that area. Plus, you can get a lot more done. - Instruments: mostly just my own band - Years playing: Piano & Voice It's basically a one woman show! I pick the material, arrange the songs, set up the gigs, hire the musicians, promote the gig, run the gig, and perform. In the studio it's the same. I just released a new CD a few weeks ago (\"the breeze and I\") and I'm in the process of marketing it myself. I spend the day emailing and calling radio stations and journalists around the world, then the evening putting together press kits which I mail out the next day. It's very exhausting and there are alot of spreadsheets involved! It's alot of work, but so far I'm happy with the results. I think social media (like facebook and twitter) is a great resource, but sometimes I spend more time on it than I think I really should. Hmm....well I'm a straight-ahead Jazz musician so I don't have alot of \"gear\" in terms of electronics. I prefer to play on a piano (as opposed to a keyboard or electronic instrument) and when I sing I pretty much sing through whatever system is provided. I'm a pretty acoustic musician. At home I have an upright Sohmer piano on which to practice. \"Yes, I think it's absolutely different. In the Jazz world, it's basically a man's game. Male musicians look at you and judge you immediately because you're a woman. I would say 90% of the time I'm introduced to people they assume I sing and don't play an instrument. It's very frustrating. I think people automatically assume a woman doesn't know what she's doing in terms of the music or the business, especially in terms of money. I'm not sure there is a moment when that became clear per se, but here is one that stands out. When I was in college I had a boyfriend who was also a musician and studying in the same program. I was having some musical disagreements with my professors at the time, in terms of what I should be studying and what was important to my art etc, and my professor, who happened to be the dean of the program asked my boyfriend why I was such a \"\"bitch\"\" and couldn't my boyfriend keep me under control. I think that pretty much sums it up. \" I'm not able to answer because truthfully I don't know very many female musicians at all, let alone know them well enough to answer this question. My father is a musician and his advice has been numerous and valuable. He has always counseled me on being persistent and staying non-emotional about rejection and / or acceptance. Some people will be supportive, some people won't be supportive, and most won't care. I think as a musician in general, and even more so as a woman, you have to be able to count on yourself and only yourself. Be independent, be smart, and be proactive. I always loved to sing. I have been playing the piano since I could walk, but around the age of 8 I became more serious about it because I realized it was a way to work on my singing. Playing the piano while I sing gives me more control of the music and the bandstand. Once I began to truly study piano, around age 8, I just fell in love with it. Now I would consider myself more a pianist than a singer. - Instruments: 5-Sara Renner & the Elements, The Peder Eide Band, The dB Network Band, Jearlyn Steele, The ABC Youth Choir - Years playing: Vocals \"I am the leader of my band. The Elements exist as a whole to support my music. In the studio, I am the executive producer and the visionary and I hire a producer and musicians to interpret my vision for the record. In business and marketing I am the CEO. Basically, I do everything.\" I have recently acquired two Peavey PA speaker cabinets and rack mount case..so I guess i now have \"gear\". I'm trying to assemble a small PA for my smaller acoustic shows. Other than that, it's just my voice box and my body. :) My band members, officially called \"Elements\", are constantly talking about their \"gear\" so I feel like I know a lot about it. I can BS my way thru any gear conversation and manage to sound impressive. At least that's what I've been told. What a strange question! I think the difference is more of an issue of leadership than musicianship. Women are more and more being empowered to be leaders in our culture. The business of music is much like any other entreprenurial endeavor; you need a strong vision and strong leadership skills. Whether on-stage or off-stage you must carry yourself as a person with vision and inspire those you've got around you to support you and the vision you have. This is not something I was taught by my parents or schools as I grew up in the 70s & 80s. I realized I possessed the characteristics of a leader when I lead my first choir at the age of 22 and I've been learning \"on the job\" ever since. There have always been strong women in music for sure. But I do see women becoming more honest & real in their songwriting and performance and less dependent on their male counterparts as they build their audiences and tell their stories. Although you still see the extremes..those women who are still exploited for their sexuality and those whose message is controlled by forces other than themselves. The rise of independent artists & music in this generation is giving women a more independent and pure voice. I've received many tidbits of valuable advice from many different sources; male & female, artist or business person throughout my career. I've sat down for coffee and mentored many young women starting out in music. My advice: Define your vision, pour your heart into it and believe in yourself and push past the fear. Yes, seek mentorship and surround yourself with trustworthy and knowledgeable folks but remember that you are your number one advocate. You determine the direction of your art and your career. Singing is my way of communicating my heart and my thoughts to the world. Whether I am singing songs I have written or am interpreting other's songs, I feel like it is a way to share my spiritual and life experiences and also, in a way, leave a legacy in recorded form. - Instruments: laundry room squelchers, leslie keffer, indian jewelry, leslie keffer and scott martin(duo) - Years playing: radios, tapes, vocals, synth, drum machine \" I make the decisions fir my solo act but with the squelchers rat bastard makes those choices I just get to rock! \" \" 3 radio/tape walkmans, micro korg, drum machine/sampler, kaoss pad 2, mic....I make tons of cassette tapes with loops and make a composition with them by playing up to three at a time with my synth and live vocal loops\" \" I don't like to separate it. However there are fewer women then men in the noise scene but we are all tale ted and ambitious so we are even more noticed. I don't think any of us want to be known just for that though. We also are extremely supportive of each other maybe bc we are women or maybe bc we are just decent humans. \" I've never really thought abou it. The woman older and younger than me all treat me the same with love and support. We look out for each other on may different levels. \" Carly ptak told me to go by my real name.my advice would be: stay ambitious work hard tour and record your music. Party but don't black out. Don't do it for money or fame that will come if you are pure at heart and dedicated to your music.\" \" I started my solo stuff by tuning into different static stations on am and fm radios. I just though it sounded cool with all the textures when I layered it. Got the idea in the woods. I realized I couldn't play guitar or piano so I started this experimental stuff \" - Instruments: Marah, Jesse Malin, Crash Test Dummies, Ryan Adams, and many others you haven't heard of including my old band Alowicious! - Years playing: Piano, organ, drums and percussion, vocals, accordion, autoharp, guitar, bass, fiddle, xylphone, is keyboards/piano, background percussion, accordion & harmonica. Behind the scenes I co-write and co-produce with David Bielanko. I began working with band in 2005. It's important to note that Dave and his brother Serge led the band since 1998, and especially since Serge stepped away in 2008 to focus on fatherhood, my role in the band has grown even more. In the studio, I record a lot of different instruments. Dave and I are both multi-instrumentalists and if the rest of the band is not around (as was the case on our new record, \"\"Life is a Problem\"\"), we end up playing whatever is necessary to the project. I found myself playing drums and percussion on most of the record, as well as all the keyboards, organs, synths, background vocals, fiddle, accordion, some guitar, etc, etc. I'm essentially the musical director, and I do string, horn and vocal harmony arrangements too. We recorded and mixed most of this record in an old farmhouse in Central PA without the band or engineers around, so for the first time ever, Dave and I had to learn how to engineer and mix. The learning curve was hard for both of us, but once I got the hang of it I really enjoyed it. I'm very proud of both of us for that. For the last few years I've been handling most of the day to day management stuff, and although it's hard at times, I'm very glad to do it. However, I don't do anything without Dave's approval...although I have a lot to say and a lot invested in this record, this band, this new label of ours...Dave quite rightly has the final say because this band has been his baby from the very beginning and I respect that immensely. Luckily we agree on just about everything 99% of the time!\" Live I use a Roland RD700 keyboard, 88 weighted keys (a must). While playing that, I sing background vocals, add percussion by playing a tambourine on the floor with my foot, and I sometimes strap on a harmonica harness as well. Occasionally I step away from the keyboard and play the accordion. \"For me personally, there is no difference. I've been surrounded by mostly male musicians all my life, mostly awesome guys, and I absolutely feel like one of the guys. There are definitely people out there who see female musicians differently in a positive way, but there is definitely a negative side... I find that a small percentage of people (?) have pre-conceived ideas when they see there's a woman in a band. They sometimes think she's just there for decoration, perhaps just to add a tambourine and backing vocal. Basically, some people might not take her seriously as a musician. In my experience, for the most part, that all goes at the window the moment people see you do your thing on stage. Take that! I've been in bands since I was 14 and I've always been accused of being the girlfriend of someone, anyone of the guys in the band. At times, I have found that to be extremely insulting (wait, I'm in the band because I'm a great musician, not because I'm someone's girlfriend!). There have been times when I wish I was a guy (tragic, isn't it?) But the trick is, you can't let it get to you. And this, like everything else, gets easier with age. Be proud. Protect your reputation. Musicianship should transcend gender. In some ways, I think a female musician has more to prove than a male musician. But isn't that the case with most professions? I could write a book about it (and someday I might!). I believe that if you are professional, talented, respectful and cool, you will attract the same.\" I think the more things change, the more they stay the same. That goes for female and male musicians. There's always been good vs. bad, conservative vs. sexy, talent vs. gimmick, longevity vs. popularity, etc. Yes, a little. The advice I'd give to a woman musician (or any musician!) just starting out is...be strong, stay focused, be gracious, be kind, and have dignity. Be professional, be reliable, be on time. Do your homework. Be prepared. Be inventive. Set short term and long term goals, but be open to letting the river carry you where it may. Follow your heart. Don't be too trusting. Don't gossip. Be classy. Assert yourself when necessary. Keep your eyes and ears open all the time...there is so much to learn about the craft and the business from everyone and anyone you work with and encounter. Be cool. Be healthy. Look good. Have fun. And...honing your craft as a musician is a lifelong process...don't ever stop learning and exploring. \"Short answer: my parents brought a piano into our house when I was 4 and I immediately took to it. Long answer: My Mom had always asked her parents for a piano and lessons but they couldn't afford it. When I was 4, my parents heard there was a broken old player piano up for grabs at a nearby church (they were going to take a sledgehammer to it if nobody wanted it!) My parents said they'd take it, and I'll never forget the day they wheeled it down the street to our house. I started playing it right away, and when I got to Kindergarten, my teacher would play piano in class and we'd sing songs. I'd come home and figure them out. Eventually I'd be the one playing in class, and every school play or event in the years to come.\" - Instruments: Cadillac Ranch, Maree McRae Band - Years playing: keys, guitar, vocals I run my own label, Northwind Records, handle all aspects of the business. Digital keys, guitar, 8ch mixer,JBLS It's always tougher in a way, when I was younger it was always a struggle because I was a solid musician not just the chick singer that they always wanted front and center. I think women now have it easier as it's more accepted and they are starting at a very young age and writing also. Follow and listen to your heart and try to not get distracted by all the BS in the biz. Do it because you have a mission to share your songs. Keep that focus.

I used to play more keyboards but we all kind of found our perfect places in the band and stayed in that configuration. TIm Kasher rights the songs and I along with the rest of the band am there to help with the layering and completion of the songs. I of course right my bass parts. In the studio, I usually record my bass at the same time as the drums and than add on back up vocals later. I also give my input on the mixing of the songs. Some bands that I have recorded with I am a hired on bass player so I really just go in record my bass parts and than leave. TIn Kite is a new project that my husband and I have been working on. I am in the studio from start to finish with that band and my husband and I 50/50 all decisions. With The Good LIfe and Tin Kite we are all equal partners as far as business and marketing decisions go. I have two Aria Pro 2 basses. I am in love with them! They are the only basses I have ever played at a live show. They are both a shade of red and have long skinny necks which works great for my super small hands. My amp is the same amp I have had since high school. My band mates make fun of me for it. I have a Hartke head and an Ampeg cabinet. The cabinet is torn to shreds from traveling around the world on a Bright Eyes tour and the head is good as new because of a case I had made for it in Omaha. I'm not a very big gear head as you can tell. I don't think being a women and a musician is different from being a man and a musician but I do think women who are musicians are treated differently. One time The Good Life was playing a show with Rilo Kiley at a club in Brooklyn and the Security guard kept trying to kick me and Jenny Lewis out of the club before the show started. He kept saying \"band members only, you ladies have to leave!\" That was pretty annoying. Also, I can't tell you how many times I have been at the airport or a hotel with my boyfriend and some dude has said \"Hey man why is your girlfriend carrying your guitar?\". Thankfully all the male musicians I have ever worked with treat me as an equal. Don't give yourself a pass or set low standards for yourself because you are a women. You are capable of doing whatever a man can do so work hard, be confident and have fun! You are a musician. When I was 14 or 15 years old I went to see the band Fire Hose play with my brother and was completely mesmerized by Mike Watt. I couldn't believe how fast his fingers were moving! I also remember the thump of the bass and how you could feel it through your whole body. I decided then and there that I NEEDED a bass guitar. - Instruments: only The Handsome Family - Years playing: vocals, banjo, bass most-importantly I am the lyricist. I also work in the studio on recording and do most of the business/marketing. \"Gold Tone banjo Hofner bass guitar\" Yes, although over the years it's gotten less extreme. Twenty years ago men were very uncomfortable with women musicians. Sound engineers were all men and would sometimes not talk directly to or listen to me when I spoke to them. Men in the audience would routinely feel obliged to correct everything from how I played on stage to how I plugged in my cords. They tended to treat me like I was stupid or a child. Things have changed a lot. Yes, nowadays women are much more confident about their playing and writing of songs. Women used to not even tune their own instruments back then if they did play an instrument. Most women in indie rock back then were only vocalists. My advice would be to not rely on anyone (label, manager, band mates). Learn how to do everything yourself and be in charge. Don't take the easy road and allow yourself to be taken care of. Someone always will take advantage of you in the end. Take advice, but listen to your own heart. I love the 19th century sound of playing clawhammer banjo - Instruments: too many to count; most of the free-lance classical groups in NYC, and many odd new music ensembles - Years playing: composer, and play flute, shakuhachi, and theremin \"As a flutist, am an ensemble member in chamber ensembles and orchestras. I play all my instruments in my own chamber music. I play shakuhachi in traditional Japanese ensembles. I do all my own promoting and grant-writing.\" \"Flute, alto flute, piccolo shakuhachi - 1.8, 1.6, 1.9 Moog etherwave pro theremin\" \"While I don't feel discrimination personally, I do see it all around me. I'm always aware that had I been born any earlier (in the rural south, to a religious farm family), I wouldn't have had any of the career options I enjoy now. Classical music marketing photos still show women predominately in sexy outfits with lots of skin, and men in serious somber clothing. Why do women feel they need to look so standardly magazine-model-like in order to get concerts?\" \"Yes! Younger women take for granted many of the opportunities that older women had to fight for. In the classical freelance world, older women feel they should be hired because of their experience; younger (attractive) women often replace them, especially if the contractor is a man, and most are men. So there can be some bad feelings.\" Don't just try to conform by promoting yourself in standard ways! There are too many musicians for the dwindling amounts of rts funding. Think about what you individually have to offer musically, what your passion is, and create ways to make the best music you can. \"Have played classical flute since age 16. Heard shakuhachi while on an orchestra tour of Japan in early 1980's, and fell in love with the sound. Heard theremin in the 1993 documentary about the life of Leon Theremin, and fell in love with that sound.\" - Instruments: My main group is called Bomshel - Years playing: Vocals, Fiddle, Mandoline, Guitar, Viola, Piano, Steel Drums:) And a horrible cello. One of the songwriters, musician, harmonies... and in the business side of it, I'm involved in everything. Marketing and sales are one of the things I excel in and I absolutely love that side of the business. The music business has changed so much in the last decade, you kind of have to be completely hands on in every aspect. I play on a variety of fiddles, my main two were built by friends of mine, one in Idaho, the other here in Nashville. I am a huge fan of PRS guitars. I have two, one is the most incredible hollow body. There have only been twelve made. I am a very spoiled girl. (Actually, I've practiced hard.) And I have play an Epiphone acoustic that is my FAVORITE!!! I'm still saving for the amp that I want. It's a Bogner. I sing through a Crown mic, and I have all Sure wireless gear. I play exclusively on Glasser bows, my favorite are his carbon fiber braid. Shall I start on my pedels? My new favorite is this Alv I just had that moment tonight. I saw the first woman I have ever seen playing lead guitar down on Broadway. I have lived here in Nashville for eight years, and I have never seen a woman grabbing a slide and ripping a solo on an electric. I just recently switched to electric in the Bomshel shows, and it is amazing to see how it freaks people out. For some reason, we don't have very many women on the radio in country music, and we don't have hardly ANY female musicians. I can think of one female session bass player, and NO electric players, no drummers, no steel players, and only one or two fiddle players that are actually A session players. I don't know why this is, and I it is one of my missions in life to bring about a change and inspire little girls to PICK UP INSTRUMENTS!!!!! If I ever have a daughter, I want to be able to look at her and say, \"Baby girl, of COURSE you can be a rock star guitar player! Look at all these other girls who have done it... and I was one of em:)\" In all honesty, I think I have only met two female musicians here in Nashville, and they actually shared many similarities to myself. Practice. Every aspect of the business. Practice your craft. Your instruments, your song writing, your singing, your merchandising, your web design, your marketing... PRACTICE EVERYTHING EVERYDAY. The only reason I don't think as many women have made it, is because it has been easier for us to just be a pretty face, and skate by as a \"chick singer.\" Not many girls had to learn to play there instrument. Most of the women from the generation I grew up listening to, didn't write there songs,,, They didn't have too. They were hand picked by some guy in A & R, and told how to sing it, by some male producer. (I only know of one female producer other than myself in this town, and I don't know of ONE SINGLE FEMALE ENGINEER in Nashville. One other interesting statistic... as of six months ago, out of 134 reporting country radio stations in this country there are only FOUR female program directors. Read that sentence again...) I came to Nashville to make a change. This has been a good ol' boy's club for entirely too long. A lot of doors were opened for me early on, because I had two assets right in front of me. But a pretty face doesn't translate onto tape.... My first memory was of my grandmother playing the violin. She was a musical maverick. My second was from watching the group I grew up touring and playing with, called the Fiddler's Hatchery. I saw my first show at three and I never looked back. - Instruments: Amici String Quartet, Argenta Trio, The Cleveland Orchestra, San Antonio Symphony, St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Cactus Pear Music Festival - Years playing: violin & viola I'm now in a classical chamber music trio and I do most of our marketing myself with the help of the university where I am employed. I've never experienced any prejudism as a woman except for when I asked for a raise when I was Assistant Principal Second Violin of The Cleveland Orchestra and the ED refused me. I think it was because I was a single woman. I think that it's increasingly easier for women now than it was 2 generations ago. When my Dad joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra, there was only 1 women in the orchestra. That was difficult, I'm sure. Having good people skills is the most important element to a successful career. I love it and I'm good at it. - Instruments: Mascott, Juicy, Sparklehorse, The Spinanes, Helium, Jennifer O'Connor, Doug Keith - Years playing: sing, guitar, keyboard, a little bass I do everything. DIY by choice. \"Gibson ES 122 Wurlitzer Electric Student Piano Fender Deluxe Reverb amp\" When i first started playing in the '90s, it was a slightly heated time. We knew that we were doing something different by plugging in electric guitars. We never second guessed ourselves or compared ourselves to men. We just did what we did, confidently, and set our own course. Yes, I love walking around the East Village and see so many women with gig bags walking around. It fills me up. Nothing feels better than playing music, and it's amazing to see so many women having that experience. My sister always told me to hold on to my publishing. I almost signed a UK deal that would have taken almost all of my writer's share, worldwide, in perpetuity. She encouraged me not to take it, and it was the best move I ever made, thanks to her. I wanted to write songs, not shred. - Instruments: 3 main groups, 2 side projects - Years playing: guitar, vocals as a weapon Second banana. The note taker, peace maker, money holder, dirty laundry airer & folder. Hondo Formula One and a Peavy Bandit 65...My first and only guitar and amp. No foot pedals except for the built in distortion. They sound great so I stay loyal. I like sound not gear. Yes, the expectations are different. You either defy them or fulfill them. Boys are just boys. Girls are the girl(s) in the band. Right from the beginning, I noticed that engineers and sound men routinely lowered my guitar in the mix out of habit. I saw them do this not just to me a novice but to women who were experienced, accomplished players....didn't matter, they were put lower in the mix. If it was an all girl band, then the whole mix was lower....literally less loud than the male bands that normally played the clubs. Another great example is, if I went to play my guitar and no sound came out because let's say my amp was still on standby, I felt sheepish and humiliated. If a by made the same mistake, he wouldn't blink...just stride over and turn it on, no explanation needed. Right now, I am unimpressed. Up until now, there has been a steady trajectory of more women doing more interesting things. But to be fair, men aren't doing anything interesting either...there is a lull in music at the moment that makes it difficult to talk about the current generation of musicians, male or female. Be LOUD. Listen to records... it's a double edged sword. I now regret taking up an instrument completely in a musical vacuum. I think knowledge makes your music more interesting. BUT had I been listening to other people's music at the time, I probably wouldn't have had the arrogance to start a band in the first place. I didn't want to be the girl on bass. I thought they were lame. But I basically play bass lines on guitar so it is mainly just a conceit. - Instruments: mostly my own projects under my name- Mia Doi Todd - Years playing: vocals, guitar, ukulele, piano, drums, tampura, harmonium, tin whistle... I'm the singer, songwriter, rhythm guitar-player, boss, organizer. I'm the co-producer when recording. I try my best at business; it's not my forte. These days I book my own shows and make all the phone calls. I'm looking for a manager to take over some of these duties. I have not been very good with delegating responsibility and trusting others to do what they say they'll do. I put out my last 2 records on my own label, so at least I knew how much or little was being done. Mostly I play a 1969 Martin nylon string guitar. Live I sing into a Sure beta 58. I own a Neumann mic and Universal Audio preamp for recording. My ukulele was made in Java by a Hawaiian company called Pono. Tanpura by Rikhi Ram Music of Delhi. Yes, it's different. The whole thing seems to be geared towards men mostly, so as a woman you are challenging the norm. Looking beautiful and sexy is so much more important if you are a female musician. Guitar virtuosity seems to be more important and easy for men and their big hands. Women's voices are sometimes more quiet than men's so it's hard to hear yourself in the monitors oftentimes. Women are very sensitive and their songs can tend to be more fragile and personal than men's. Music venues are often bars which might not be the best medium for such expression. When I started playing in rock clubs, all my peers were male mostly. Now it has changed a bit, and there are lots more women leading groups. I got very discouraged at one point that all my peers were men and that I would never really be their friend, because in the end I am not one of the guys, even though I am as tough as them. It's good to have women on tour, van tours, bus tours. Women make it much nicer. We make sure there are good things to eat and it doesn't get too nasty and dirty everywhere. Women can be more moody than men though, and there's not much room for that on tour. I just watched the Patti Smith documentary and identified with her a lot. I identify with Nina Simone and Joni Mitchell as well. So there must be continuity. Now there is so much access to music and recording gear that every other person you meet in LA is in some band. That was not the case 40 years ago. That older generation of female musicians had to defy more odds than us today. Perhaps they had more classical training to support their craft. \"I had very little advice going into the music industry. One record exec told me to hurry and get myself together, because I was getting old. I was only 23. I was very creative as a young performer and I realized there would be very few roles available to me in acting because I didn't have a particular look and I didn't want to wait around forever for nothing, so I started writing songs out of a need for self-expression. I would say only do it if you really feel you HAVE to do it. It's not easy, nor very rewarding in many ways. But if you have to, start writing songs immediately and start performing them out live for an audience. You don't have to be a guitar virtuoso. Find your own personal voice. Do not imitate your favorite singer. I made a record with Mitchell Froom as the producer, and he taught me about making decisions and moving forward when recording. It's a good idea to decide which take or compilation of takes you are going to use before moving on to the next instrument. \" My mother had an old Martin nylon guitar that she bought new in the 60's, which I loved. I found a similar one and put a pickup in it. It is a very gentle, feminine guitar. - Instruments: I sing with a lot of people/friends from time to time. Sharon Van Etten, Anna Ternheim, Sufjan Stevens, Joseph Arthur, Mark Gardener (from Ride), Robin and Joe Bennett (Dreaming Spires/Truckfest), Hopewell, recently sang with Gary Louris (Jayhawks), Dive Index (regular electro collaborator). My specialty is harmonizing and blending voices. - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Pianos, Casio, Omnichord, Percussion \"It's pretty much me, myself and I right now. I write, book, decide, and collaborate on producing and recording. I have a lot of collaborators, I've been working a lot with friends, producer/multi-instrumentalist Jack Petruzzelli, and doing some recent recordings with Sufjan Stevens. All the musicians I work with are so wonderful, I am extremely grateful. But I'm the only one loosing sleep at night or making a deadline. Sometimes it makes it difficult when you don't have someone to hand in the proverbial homework to. I can do everything, I know how to run pro-tools and the 8 track reel to reel, I am a bit of a tech geek;).... But I really like the energy of a team as well. I can get really excited about doing something if it's fun and involves a human meeting. \" \"Lately I have been playing with my wurlitzer, guitars, and lucky loop pedals. On top of the wurlitzer lies Casio & Omnichord. I have a 1934 Martin Pre-War acoustic and a borrowed 1970's Gibson electric. Sometime all instruments are feeding into an 8 channel mixer, so I can feed through an aux channel which ones I want to loop or other effects for particular songs.\" \"Somehow it feels that being a woman musician you are expected to fit into a clear \"\"Women's Music\"\" Category. This girl is folk, another is rock, she has pretty songs while hers are aggressive, this one is electro, etc... I always feel uncomfortable being categorized or put into a box of any kind. I will usually crawl out and step on it. Really I am all these things. I might change from today to tomorrow. I make songs. It is all my voice. I still feel like a woman has to prove herself more. Some age old stereotypes can truly apply, like if your too sweet and laid back you might not be taken seriously, and if you stand up for yourself some man might be threatened by a strong woman. Oh yea, there have been moments, Ha! My first big national tour was opening up with Mark Gardener (from Ride) for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. I was the only woman on tour with 17 men. I was well respected musically, once they saw I knew my gear and could play, everyone was so kind. Except at the start, only one (I won't name names) had trouble figuring out just why I was there. In the morning he asked me for a massage, and if I'd make them all pancakes, and wasn't quite kidding. I think he thought I was supposed to be the groupie. But I learned to throw it back with humor. After one show he was like, what are you going to do now, and I said I was doing mouth exercises and waiting around for them all to finish loading out so all 17 of them could line up for me to give them BJ's. That was funny and shocked him. Then a couple days later, I was kicking his behind in a game of pool, and he came up to me and was like, \"\"Ohhhh, I get it, your like, Our Sister!!!!\"\" But I've always loved bein one of the boys, and doin it well, the thrill of being on the road and seeing the country. I give forever thanks to Mark Gardener and Robin and Joe Bennett (The Dreaming Spires/Truck Festival), and others who have believed so much in me!! Since then I've traveled with countless amazingly talented women as well! I was a real tomboy growing up, I was the only girl at lunch that was allowed to play soccer with the boys. But sometimes I like to clean up nice and play dressy up purty but feel, hey so what either way. We have different days, different moods.\" \"Yes of course, there is so much more available due to the women who paved the way! Patti, Joni, Dolly, Liz Phair. Even over the past few years, it is so much more common for a girl to learn guitar as their first instrument, where that felt more rare in the past. Those girls had to be pretty tough cookies. Someone like Annie Clark of St. Vincent is an obvious example of the newest generation of women that went to Berkeley Music school and can rock any male guitar player under the table, sing, write, record and mix alone digitally, WoW!..... But that is not to say I think that is the ultimate goal or always best results to do it all. Sometimes retaining a purity is nice. Meaning, all circumstances and using what you got are perfect. For example, my friend I sing with, Sharon Van Etten, her music would not be so real and human and as beautiful as it is if she had high class pro training. That is not to say she does not have mad skillz, but a lot of hers comes from instinct and doing and writing with pure heart.\" \"Recently a good friend has been sending me texts. They always arrive during some late-nite writing attempt, just when I think it's time to pack up and get a \"\"real job\"\". I save them, they say, \"\"Don't waste your time or unique genius\"\". Another says, \"\"F-U-N is number one on the priority to creating magic!\"\". I would and have said to young women (I have taught and mentored many), Just Go for it! Have fun! Don't get in your own way! You have everything you need to be a unique talent. Practice, learn, be curious, write, write, write. I especially tell them to learn about the business side early on, because that is empowering, and I am still catching up. I also tell them to learn another skill at a young age that is good flexible work when not touring (I would love to have web design or music/video editing skillz, that would help for pick up work. Bartending hours stink and get a singer sick to often). Being financially stable and independent is key and some clear and even tough advice at a young age in that direction would have been sweet. Who knows, maybe someone said it and I didn't listen;). It's too late for me now. Music is the only thing I can really do right or want to do. I am also good at doing other things, but it's challenging to keep another consistent job going when yr head heart and heels are in music.\" \"I have been singing my whole life, since before I could speak, it came very naturally. I took piano lessons as a child, and after several years became bored of the teaching style. But I am very grateful for that strong foundation in music/reading. I had a great school system where we had an all-star type Choir 5 days a week, which strongly developed my ear, and a high level musical theater program afterschool (this is so sadly unheard of in Music/Arts Education these days). I also sang in an experimental rock band in high school. Guitar came later, in college. I fell in love with Joni Mitchell. She taught me I could play guitar, because before I thought you needed tons of lessons to do it like some of the guys I knew who played in my band. But she made shapes, used instinct and ear. That was for me. Nick Drake, the Pixies, Velvet Underground, Patti Smith they were and are all heros.\" - Instruments: Only Dazzle Ships, unless you want to count middle school band - Years playing: Vocals, bass, keyboard, guitar, and cello My role in the band is cowriter, cofounder, I write everything I perform, my lyrics, my basslines, my guitar parts, everything. I play my own stuff when we record too, I'm still learning how to use the recording program that we use, its called Logic 9 for the mac. Most of the time Tyler sets everything up, drums beats, distortion, etc. I have though learned how to open my own certain recording slots, like for vocals and instruments, and learned how to put different effects on it. In our business decisions its half and half, between me and Tyler. I have a generic fender bronco bass that I got for xmas this year. It actually started my band because all the instruments I had beforehand were acoustic and you can't really rock out on acoustic intruments. I also use a novation xiosynth in the band, its a really overlooked keyboard, it has over 200 presets, and allows you to make you own sounds which I have already done for some of our songs. I like to make everything as personal as possible. I use a fender strat to play live as well but it belongs to another bandmate. I don't think it's different in talent or ability, but I have to say I feel like female musicians are usually overlooked on their talents, and only get attentions for their appearance. I could be wrong though, I just have a preset view of this because I've always heard from my male friends that girls are just prone to always being sub par when it comes to playing instruments. I remember always thinking to myself that one day I'd prove em wrong on that. I feel like after our first song Least Resistance was recorded and up on the internet, those comments from my male friends didn't even matter, only the music and how it made me feel was important. I do see a difference in the generations of women musicians. I feel like women play a bigger role in music now, like music made only by a female is more accepted and thought upon in a higher sense. Also I'm seeing a lot more females playing more than the instrument of their voice which I think is awesome. I feel more empowered as a female when I see a beautiful woman who is not only talented vocally, but can shred on a guitar, or can play the drums like a mad man. It gives me butterflies. I really can't wait to see where we take things next. I think some of the best advice I got was to be genuine, to be myself and not force it. Making songs that come naturally to me is just more fufilling, when I try to overthink parts or calculate everything out it usually doesn't work or flow as better as something that just comes natural. Its important to keep a real part of yourself in the music I think. My advice to a woman musician just astarting out is to not be afraid, I know its intimidating with so many male musicians who have been lead in this department for so long, and I know how its easy to lose yourself and just have someone just tell you what to do. I say don't be afraid to share your ideas, have confidence in your abilities, just because your a female doesn't mean anything, you're just as talented as any human being out there. It took me a while to realise this myself and it just made me feel so much better about myself, my confidence, and my abilities. In all honesty I didn't really choose, it was kind of my only option since bass was the only electric instrument I had, not to meantion that I was already familiar with the instrument from playing the cello. After I got more comfortable with my role in the band though the instruments I played become more broad and I'm glad I get to express myself with the guitar and keyboard. I have to say though, that singing has been my favorite part. I feel like people get a more personal view of me, they hear me, and not my fingers on an instrument. I feel more vulnerable with singing but it also gives me more of a rush. I'm truly addicted to performing live. - Instruments: Frente, Four Hours Sleep, Holidays On Ice, Splendid - Years playing: Vocals I am now a solo artist, so I guess I'm the band leader, both live and in the studio. I have a manager that I work closely with on all business and marketing decisions. I use the Garageband program to write on, I play a Maton acoustic. It's hard to say that being a woman has been the factor for any situation I've faced in my career. I think my musical style is quite feminine, which affects the subject matter I choose to tackle in my songs. This attracts a certain audience and determines the types of places I play and what kind of print and radio coverage I get. I'm pretty happy with how I'm perceived. As I get older, I see many other women my age and older, continuing to be treated as viable musicians that deserve respect and attention. I'm sure there are differences, but they are too subtle to lay claim to. \"As above, I look towards women who are my age and older. I see many of them starting later in their lives and succeeding in creating a career. I see them continue to receive the respect they deserve, This is heartening for me. As far as differences, I guess we cease to viable pop fodder, which is of no consequence to me. I cannot speak for all women, but the longer I make music, the less I care about such things and the more I care about making just good music. I am involved in a mentoring program, so I get to enjoy working with young women at the beginning of their careers. It's inspiring to see how much more confident and self-aware they are, than I was at their age. It's also satisfying, being a part of something I wish I'd had when I was starting out.\" \"As I said, I wish I had more role models and mentors around me when I started out. I didn't know many women artists who were at my same level of success. I could've used a little grounding there. I would say to young women to take a deep breath in confusing situations and use your intuition, when it comes to decisions involving the direction of your career. It will be right for you in the place that you are at. You will grow to want different things. Be the artist you would love to listen to. Most importantly, do music because you love it, not because you feel you should.\" It was a great way to express myself and I soon found it was something I was good at. - Instruments: many; see website - Years playing: vocals, guitar, fiddle, percussion I am the leader when I hire a band; I am the producer in the studio; when I work as a side musician, I defer to the band leader; as far as business, I do all my own although I have hired publicists, managers and booking agents in the past. I would like to have one or all three now but don't have the money to pay a PR person, and the booking agents in town all have full rosters. I don't feel at this point I need a manager but would like to be able to go to the next level and tour full time, even as a solo artist it's hard because I have expenses to cover and no partner. Collings acoustic guitars; Fender tuners, cords, mics, PA system. Percussion instruments (pro) Yes. In the early days, musicians would actually defy me (in rehearsals and on gigs) and do things like turn down my amp behind my back (being \"helpful\") etc. They were condescending and patronizing. Later as I became more confident that has stopped and I only work with players who treat me with respect. Socially, it is difficult; I have little in common with romantic partners (men in my case) who are not musicians since they don't understand my priorities; fellow musicians (male) (and female for that matter) often appear to feel threatened by my passion and/or abilities. Another thing I've noticed is that many women seem able to get men to support them financially and/or in other ways; I have usually ended up supporting men (fellow musicians) and being on my own. Yes, definitely. The younger generation of women are much more confident and take for granted that they can express themselves freely. When I was growing up, women were very much in a subservient role socially and although I was fiery and driven, I encountered obstacles including self-doubt and my family's intense disapproval, which made it hard at times to be as assertive (when I was younger) as I should have been. Yes, I've been encouraged to be true to myself and my upbringing; to take risks (e.g. contacting and following up with industry people despite fear of rejection); I've had a great example in a friend who was very driven and also would not kowtow to record companies even when that was \"risky.\" Young musicians (female) today seem to have few obstacles; confident young women -- literally the sky is the limit. I wish them well and I think they are doing fine without advice from me!! I was given the chance to study a string orchestral instrument in 4th grade through my public school; I chose violin. Later as a teenager I took up drums at school, and played in the concert and marching bands (as well as orchestra and string quartet on violin); I discovered guitar and started playing that as a teenager as well. I studied piano at a young age which gave me a grounding in music theory. I went on to play in symphonies in high school and college before dropping out and pursuing music full time. - Instruments: Samantha Crain, Samantha Crain and the Midnight Shivers, Zeb Dewar & the Fed - Years playing: vocals, electric and acoustic guitar, banjo, piano, drums \"I write the songs. I sing, play harmonica and kazoo, and play the guitar in the band in live performances. In the studio I do all of that but, additionally, I layer harmonies, play bass, percussion, keys, banjo, whatever I can get my hands on..... When it comes to business and marketing decisions, I'm pretty hands on. I have opinions about most things when it comes down to the ever-maddening process of existing in the music \"\"world\"\". I don't want to jump into any situations that might lack integrity in motivations.\" \"I play a Martin 00-18 through an SWR Strawberry Blonde amp and a Danelectro Convertible through an Orange Tiny Terror tube amp (using a Tube Screamer pedal whenever I can) I also have a Yamaha CP-70 (which is a type of electric piano that's also a small grand piano with actual hammers and strings) that was originally the piano used in my favorite band, Berry, but I bought it and, although its tough to travel with, I use it for recording.\" I'm not sure because I don't know what it is like to be a man and a musician; I've only ever been a woman and a musician. They were most accessible to me when I became interested in music. Its easy to find a guitar at someone's house or a piano in a church. - Instruments: Mostly I am a solo performer. I am a guest vocalist in a bunch of different bands, but my group's name is my name, Marissa Nadler. - Years playing: vocals, 12 string guitar, six string guitar, banjo, uke, appalachian dulcimer I control pretty much everything, because I am a solo artist on an independent label. I will take people's advice if I trust them (on production, etc), but the joy of being an independant artist is having artistic freedom. \"I have a Martin 12 string guitar dreadnought style. My prized possession is a handmade guitar a French Luthier named Florent made for me with a mother of pearl bird inlay on it's headstock. I also still play one of my first guitars, a really beat up and tinny sounding Tachamine that I have some Neil Young lines drawn on in sharpy. To be exact \"\"don't let it bring you down, its only castles burning.\"\" Mostly, I play a Taylor six string with lots of cracks in it from flying and having to glue it back together so many times. (Once, in Mallorca, I had to buy some woodglue and clamps and literally glued my broken guitar back together). I use Rare Earth Humbucker pickups that work on magnetic resonance because live, I find they give the most natural sound to the acoustic instruments. I have a Vintage Framus banjo on lone from guitar virtuous Glenn Jones that I have been playing a lot lately. Also, a baritone ukelele I bought at an antique shop, and a similarly purchased and beat up autoharp. I use a TC Helicon voice live unit so that I can control my own vocal reverb and delay on stage. I used to get in a lot of fights with soundmen (most of them are men) where they would tell me how my music should sound. I just decided to start controlling it myself. I am very happy with the TC and its pretty user friendly. I also use a ton of Boss Pedals for my guitars.\" \"Yes. It has been clear to me since I started out as a little girl. I used to go into the Guitar Center, because in the suburbs that was pretty much it for music stores, and get treated like I wanted the pink hello kitty guitar. As I got older, it was about having to listen to guitar tips from dudes that weren't even good guitar players, or gear talk as If I didn't know anything about gear. I still encounter a lot of sexism when I am on tour, and on blogs. I feel like if you get up there, and you a girl, and have a guitar, before you even open your mouth to play you are battling stereotypes. The most bothersome thing to me about being a women musician is that I truly believe you have to be twice as good a singer, twice as good a player, and twice as goodlooking as the man. The pressure to look good and thin runs deep even within the outsider and independent music circles. If you look at the extremely successful female indie songstresses, there is usually one pretty obvious thing in common. I don't see this as much with the men. Sometimes, when you have been on a tour van or driving for 14 hours to get to a gig, the last thing you want to worry about is what you look like. But, people expect the whole package. Lipstick and shredding. \" \"I think women today have a more DIY approach, with much of that due to the prevalence of technology. Women can book their own tours and build their own fanbases, as well as control their own images and imagery, from home. They don't necessarily need a record label and they don't need a label telling them how to dress or how to sound. It is a good step for young women especially starting out right now. The options are so much more open. \" Hard work pays off more than anything else. I truly believe that. You have to be good at what you do and love what you do, and that goes for men too. The industry itself is horrible, and chews people up and spits them out. Therefore, you truly have to find peace within and enjoy it. My older brother is a great guitar player and there was always a guitar in the house. I started playing right handed, even though I was a lefty. I didn't take any lessons, but it was something to play with. - Instruments: Too numerous to count - Years playing: piano I'm primarily a composer of acoustic live concert music. My stuff has been recorded, but studio time is a small percentage of my work life. Classical instruments, Chinese instruments, folkloric instruments of Latin America In the classical music world, composers (and conductors, too) are generally men. Things have changed a lot but we still have a ways to go, from within the profession and from the point of view of public perception. I have been blessed that any skepticism about my work because I was a woman was subtle. Yes -- There is much less fear nowadays among the younger women, which is awesome. The generation of women before me said the same thing about my generation. Yes, I had incredible mentors, both male and female. I would tell women musicians nowadays that they are very much needed, and they are needed at their most excellent. They must work hard, grab every opportunity to learn, be merciless in their self-scrutiny, and keep a sense of humor. I'm mainly a composer, so while I concertize as a pianist, composing is my main gig. The piano was what we had in the house, and I took to it quite well. - Instruments: nothing notable - Years playing: vox, guitar, bass, piano, percussion and random others \"i am a solo artist... i write, record and produce all of my own stuff.... andy partridge mixed my current album... he heads ape records in the UK... as far as business and marketing it is a partnership with ape records\" \"don musser custom made acoustic guitar - fretless bass manu katchu drums...small kit various percussion\" \"yes..VERY different the primary difference being that your looks are focused on first and you have to really prove yourself to be taken seriously... if you want real recognition... there were lots of moments... the first was when someone said...you play pretty good for having such tiny hands or... you should show your legs more... you'd have more fans... things like that\" \"yes.. i do i notice that younger girls now are not as locked out... they seem to be more accepted... there are a lot of female players, writers, etc... and not all dance stuff... when i was first starting it wasnt like that... seeing women i the forefront was not as common so i thnk girls today feel entitled to it, which is great... i think my generation was excluded from certain genres.. we had to fight to get in...\" \"well .. the same advice i would give to anyone which is... don;t lose your integrity. your vision for yourself as an artist is ALWAYS the right one.. that's what makes YOU the artist... and if you are a woman... don;t feel that it means you are obligated to put forward any particular perspective or viewpoint because of that. your perspective as a woman IS the female perspective... and whatever your take, it will bring strength to more people, not just women, to express their own views as well.\" well guitar is my primary instrument... and it just feels right - Instruments: I am a solo act mainly but am also in a band called Metasyn - Years playing: piano songwriter and the sparkle.Besides I look better than the boys in the band lol. \"yamaha Clavinove Pioneer - Pro DJ Division Logic Pro [and all the plugins within] Ableton Live All Spectrasonics Plugins Native Instruments PSP Audio Waves and a few random other companies/plugs/gear... but these are the big/main ones\" I was the first female dj to play in the main room with the boys and get equal pay, I did not know that and I was surprised no other woman had been as persistent as I. After all if we are all good we should get the same money as the guys. Yes, it is more accepted now and woman have embraced technology now more than ever All the guys around me were the ones I watched, I learned from the best and am proud to be considered on of the team players. That is my advice be a team player but always give 101 percent. My mother taught me and was my inspiration - Instruments: at least 10 - Years playing: classical singer Soloist, classical singer In everyday living, I would describe my look as classic-casual, with a twist of sophisticated funk. My performance wear is sometimes formal (i.e. dress or gown), or in constume if I am participating in a staged opera production. The technical training of male and female musicians is the same. The state of how we both are treated is different, in that men have a certain advantage (financially, image, etc.) in the music business simply because they run the majority of organizations. Also, women use sex to their advantage, since it sells well in the business. Public images have changed, levels of musicianship and skills have changed, and sexual imagery is more prominent. Yes, my former voice teacher back in Texas said \"The ones who are successful are the ones who stick with it.\" That is what I've lived by, through the rejections and successes I've experienced. I keep working on my craft as a musician, a singer, and never limit myself from my potential. I love what singing does for my mind, soul, and body. I also like that being a performing artist gives me the freedom of now, of being in the moment. - Instruments: Just one - True Womanhood - Years playing: Bass guitar \"Thomas tends to write the \"\"skeleton\"\" of a song. I will listen to a guitar riff/progression he comes up with and provide a melodic bassline. Sometimes the roles are reversed. Now that I'm better at my instruments, sometimes a song is created on a bass part I come up with. Both he and I are responsible for much of the pop elements of a song, although Noam is equally involved in the writing process. We are share pretty equal responsibilities/roles in the studio. We all write our own parts. If we don't like the way something is sounding in the studio, we will speak up. We've all known each other since middle school so we don't feel like we have to hide the way we're feeling too much. Thomas tends to seek my approval for his vocal parts just as much as I seek his approval for some bass parts I come up with. It's a pretty democratic environment. I'd say that Thomas and I are mostly responsible for making the business and marketing decisions (although he tends to make more of the business decisions while I 'sign off' on more of the marketing decisions.) I majored in communications, so I am particularly interested in promotion, PR, social networking and branding (in this case, creating a band image). If Thomas is making a business decision, he always consults with me first, but the band typically trusts my judgment when it comes to marketing. I have a lot of freedom in my band and feel that I have a lot of control behind the scenes, which I'm thankful for. \" \"BASS GUITARS: Fender American Deluxe Precision Bass Gibson SG Bass BASS AMPLIFIER: 1969 Blue Line Ampeg SVT PEDALS: Boss Delay; Boss by Audio Octave Clang pedal\" \"There is a stereotype that all females either sing, play tambourine or play the bass. When I tell some people that I play the bass, some think it's awesome - others say, \"\"Yeah, yeah. ALL female rockers play the bass.\"\" That's when I really realized I needed to prove myself. Because that opinion still exists, I feel an absolute need to be as proficient and creative at the bass guitar as possible. I practice nearly every day for at least two hours, so I have become a lot better at the bass in a short time. Mostly men will come up to me after a show and say, \"\"Wow, you are incredible at the bass. I was shocked when I heard you play!\"\" - or something to that degree. Of course, I am flattered by the first half of the compliment, but secretly annoyed that people are so surprised that a woman can be good at their instrument. I don't think men realize that they're being borderline offensive when they say those types of things. I also refuse to wear skirts or dresses on stage - which may just be a silly insecurity I have - but I do not want to be considered \"\"eye candy\"\" or a sex object while I'm playing. I mean, of course you can be an amazing musician while wearing a feminine outfit, but until I get really, really good, I will be fearful that wearing a dress will be considered a ploy to get people to pay attention to the only girl in the band. My female rock idol is Sleater-Kinney's Carrie Brownstein. One of the best guitarists I've ever heard. Confident on stage, extremely intelligent. Both men and women respected her. Though beautiful, she didn't feel the need to dress herself up to get attention - she is just a flat-out amazing musician. If I became half the musician Carrie is, I'd consider myself successful!\" \"I would suggest to other women that they practice as much as they can. Women can be just as technically proficient as men; women can write great songs. Don't dumb yourself down because you think fans will like you more. Down the road, I would encourage women to make sure they are financially stable before they decide to pursue music full-time. I worked a full-time, salary job and was able to save a good amount of money. I am about to leave my job to tour. I am in a position where I can do this for a few months and feel secure. Never rely on a man's bank account. \" The singer/guitarist of my band, Thomas, and I hung out nearly every day for a couple of years. He always had a guitar in his hands while we were watching TV, etc. It had always been a dream of his to form a band. For about a year straight, he begged me to learn how to play an instrument. He figured, \"We're hanging out enough. I know Melissa likes good music. Why not give it a shot?\" One day he randomly asked me what my favorite instrument was. That was his sneaky way of deciding what instrument he'd teach me how to play. I gave it some thought and concluded that the bass was probably my favorite instrument. It's versatile and it can completely change the mood and feel of any song. The bass is an integral part of some of my favorite music. The next day, I came over to his house. There was a bass on the bed. Thomas said to me, \"Here is a bass. You are going to sit here with me and I am going to teach you the basics of this instrument.\" I remember throwing my hands in the air and shouting quite a bit that day. I'd never even picked up a guitar in my life! I thought I was too old to learn and was resistant at first. But Thomas was an excellent teacher and I was able to pick up the instrument pretty quickly. It also helps to practice with other people. - Instruments: 3. High Places, Transformation Surprise (my solo project), The Bridge Over River Qua - Years playing: vocals, guitar, bassoon My band is a duo with my male best friend. We split all duties pretty evenly. We each record ourselves separately and I do a lot of the song construction. My band mate is more of the aesthetic expert and I am more in charge of pitch, organization, and structure. I handle most of the business and finances that come with the band. My band mate handles most of the art design for posters, album art, t-shirts, etc. We both make visual art, and I have made several music videos for us. Teisco guitar, Roland 404 sampler, Rat distortion pedal, Digiverb reverb pedal, Shure beta 57 vocal microphone, Roland keyboard amp, homemade telephone speaker microphone, effects rack, Fox Renard 220 bassoon. I did not think there was a difference when I was playing orchestral music. However, in rock music I think there is a big difference. Any write up about a female musician, or especially a group of female musicians, will mention gender right off the bat. My band is always referred to as a boy-girl duo, even though we don't both sing (and my 35 year old band mate is hardly a boy!). There are plenty of male front people who only sing in their bands, even though they are the band's mastermind and write all the songs. However, I have felt like, as a woman, if I only sing in my band, it will be assumed that my band mate writes all the music, and my only job is to sing it. Perhaps that is my own gender bias and insecurity, but I do feel like there is some truth to my fear. \"I think there is going to be a really strong new generation of women musicians. There are all of these rock camps for girls that are doing tremendous things to teach young girls about rock music and to give them the confidence and the drive to pursue playing in bands. \" \"My mother has always been very supportive of my pursuit of a music career. She studied music and taught it, as did her father. The advice I would give a woman musician just starting out would be to stay as hands on as possible with her career. The more you do for yourself, the more control you have, and the more you learn. \" \"I began playing bassoon at age 11 because I loved the role of Grandfather in Peter and the Wolf. I was also quite small at the time, and I was attracted to the idea of playing a large, low-pitched instrument. I considered the tuba, but I liked the melodic voice of the bassoon. It sounded to me like if a cello were a wind instrument. I recently started teaching myself to play guitar because it is such an important instrument in rock music. I was tired of only singing when my band performed live. As a wind player, I've always been a bit intimidated by string instruments, but I'm getting over that fear the more I play my guitar.\" - Instruments: John Ferrari and Friends, Allison Iraheta and the Gurus - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar I am an artist, musician, and entertainer. Besides my voice, I play a Gibson melody maker - Joan Jett, Les Paul, and Ovation. I really don't see much of a difference except for the fact that women always go crazier for the male musicians more than female musicians. I had the chance to experience that on American Idol..especially when it came down to me and the 3 other guys. Yes - I think compared to generations of women musicians in the past there has been many changes, especially with the overall music style and sound. Being on the show American Idol and getting judged every week, all I received was valuable advice for my career in the music industry. The one that always stuck out for me was \"Be true to yourself,\" which I still carry on. This is something I would tell anyone trying to make it in the music industry. The guitar is the easiest for me to play when singing and writing songs, not to mention it's a lot of fun! I also love the fact that you can make something sound extremely edgy, but can also make it sound soft and beautiful. - Instruments: as of the past 5 years, i only perform with PACIFIKA, but over the years i have performed with about 6 other acts... - Years playing: voice, cajon, tambourine, shakers, keys... i am 1/3 of PACIFIKA, and the only woman. we are all equally involved in the writing and recording process, as well as any creative/business decisions. it is a wonderful arrangement that enables us all to be informed and involved. we all have different strengths and over the years we have learned how to allow each person to shine in their own particular way. we are stronger together. \"i travel with my own microphone, a cajon, a tambourine and some shakers... my wardrobe is also gear, as i dance throughout most of the performance. \" i suppose it depends on the type of music one is making, and the type of statement one is interested in being a part of. for me, it is an honor to be a woman on stage, as most of our music is about honoring mother earth and women are great nurturers. i hope to inspire a positive feeling with our performances and being a woman is central to our theme. i am in a band with two men who are very much a part of my life, and feel that being the woman amongst them gives us great balance. there is as much of a difference as one wants to make on this issue. i feel that the industry has evolved greatly, as have world views on gender... a great thing for anyone pursuing their passion. \"absolutely. women's rights have made a significant difference to the opportunities that we have today. i am not sure what my life as a musician would've been like 50 yrs ago, but i am pretty sure that doing this as a living would not have been looked upon as positively as it is these days. i am grateful to all female artist who paved the way for us. i am sure that amongst all the great classical music composers, we would've also been exposed to many incredible women had they had the chance to study or be exposed to the arts the same way that men were. \" \"my family always encouraged me in my artistic journeying, and that was invaluable. i grew up understanding that being unique was a strength, thought not always the easiest route. as i grow and evolve i realize that what comes naturally to me is what i am best at... it's 'my thing' :) in this music industry, music is the easy part... it is important to have a great manager, a team that has the same vision and that can lead you in the right direction, so you can focus on the music and grow as an artist. it makes all the difference to have good people around with a common goal, people you like, people you trust. be open to life... it is a great muse... \" i studied violin and piano, but have always enjoyed using my voice the most... i can't help myself. - Years playing: Vocals, Guitar, Piano I am a one woman show. In the studio, I record, play all the instruments, self produce, and write the entire album. The last album Black Heart, was recorded this way. I do all my own booking and some of my own publishing. I rock an Italia Modulo Guitar into a Marshall Stack with an Acoustic Image head. My Pedals include: Boss DD-6 pedal, Boss CH1 Pedal, and few other fun ones that interchange. As far as keys, live I use the Micro Korg. I think in any industry you always bump into the pros and cons of that. Unfortunately, there were times I was mistreated, and luckily I have had my princess moments! I do. The woman who I respect - Marianne Faithful, Pj Harvey, Sandra Bernhard, and Stevie Nicks... are woman of substance. When I listen to their music or watch them perform I get a strong sense that they are the real deal. I think there are a lot of new great performers out there, but I think songwriting has changed. The way music is streamed online, and arenas are packed, it's less intimate. watch your back! (kidding). Well actually I did get that advice on many occasions. I would say the most valuable advice I've gotten is to stay true to your self and your music. It's sexy. - Instruments: several - Years playing: guitar/vocals leader guitar, pa \"No, except for the expectations and fears of my possessive family. Leading the band with a guitar in my hand...the difference was in immediate audience response\" \"Yes, as women earn more, and have less children, they record more.\" Sing, but don't sing drunk. Avoid the jitters by practicing. Remember people want to see and hear something different. Don't be trepidacious, because there is nothing wrong with what we do. Record it when it sounds good, and when the band sounds good...there might not be another chance. To lead the band Besides being a pianist, singer, songwriter, I am the sole decision maker regarding my music. \"Steinway 1903B Alesis \" I have definitely encountered scenarios where being female didn't work for me. In rock bands the guys lose their 'chic magnet vibe' if there is a female in the band. In Broadway pit orchestras, it is still definitely a boys club. Not necessarily. I have received a lot of good advice from many different people over the years. Basically you have to have a thick skin, don't give up, keep practicing, keep listening to what the latest music is, expand your horizons, don't let technology get you down/overwhelm you, ask for help when you need it, you can't do everything perfectly by yourself so delegate.....the list goes on and on. When I was 6 1/2 years old my parents bought a piano. I was trying to play a song but it wasn't going the way I thought it should or wanted it to. I asked my Mother what the problem was and she explained that I had to take piano lessons. My Father was a high school math teacher and asked his students if any of them had a piano teacher that they really liked. One girl told him that she had a piano teacher and she really liked her and that is how my parents found my piano teacher. After my first lesson I ran to the piano once we got home and tried to play the song. I exclaimed to my parents that the piano lesson didn't work. They told me I needed to take more than one lesson and so I kept going back. Four months later I gave my first recital (playing at a fourth year level, which I didn't know was a big deal at the time). After that performance I was on Cloud 9 and knew that a pianist/performer was what I would be 'when I grew up'. - Instruments: 3 total. Sestina, Jasmine Ash, The Very Foundation - Years playing: vocals/keyboard I am a paid player with the Very Foundation. They asked me to come in to the studio and sing back-up vocals on a few songs and a year later, I am still playing live with them at various shows. They make all of the studio/business/marketing decisions. As of now, I just use mics that the band already has and I borrow a Nord Electro 2 from one of 3 friends that have them. \"I've never really experienced much of anything that made a clear difference to me other than the way that men and women are treated differently in every day life. Both women and men use their assets to their advantage, it's just how far is each person willing to take it. That somewhat depends on their personalities more than whether or not they are man or woman. I feel that I know several well respected and extremely talented musicians of both genders.\" Just be who you are and don't try to be someone you are not. People will see right through it. I took piano lessons as a kid. - Instruments: Gary P. Nunn, Sara K. and the Boys Without Sleep, Harvey and the Prowlers,solo - Years playing: vocals, guitar I play out solo these days, occasionally duo. Am on a German label so play primarily overseas. I've never had a manager so have made all decisions and have artistic input on all the recordings. Have 13 CDs and a DVD to date. Custom made Manzanita guitar, Roland bass cube, Shure 58 mic I think we have conflicts sometimes because the music market is still male dominated and often times our opinions are ignored or heavily debated. Age is becoming a factor for me now. But, once I'm playing, I don't feel these things, because the audience is appreciative. My first record deal was sour and it was clear to me that once the contract was over, I was going to quit. Instead I met the German producer I'm with now on the last gig of what I thought was my final tour. Ended up signing and things went smooth for a change. Now the main hurdle is dealing with download sales versus CD sales. I rely alot upon CD sales because of my style and the recordings are Audiophile recordings ~ meant to be played from disc on high end equipment. The generations of women musicians varies so much. The younger ones now seem to be focusing more on dance routines and special effects than the actual songwriting. As a songwriter, I feel the songs themselves have really changed quite a bit with rap and hip hop. Videos really changed the art of music into performance and music being one thing. I come from a generation where singer/songwriters were just that. You take your instrument and go tour. Sit down and play. This generation seems to complicate music as an art form, at least in the singer/songwriter genre. It's hard to tell what's real and what's effects. So, as an older singer/songwriter, I feel a big difference between what I do and what the rap and hip hops are doing. \"People taught me things along the way. Learning the road and how to perform when you're tired. One person told me \"\"you have to eat beef and drink whiskey to stay aggressive in this business\"\". That didn't really work though. I would just say to listen to your inner voice, find the one thing that's never going to let you down and hang on to it. Surround yourself with people who can keep your Spirits up cause there will be tough times and they'll help you to make it through. The tough times make for a good story someday. If you're a singer/songwriter, spread it around to as many people as you can. Recordings, Internet, the road. Not everyone will get it but you can find your niche and the fans will stay loyal. Definitely take chances. And if you get a deal, ask around for a good lawyer. Most of the time, there's bad stuff in the fine print. There's a good website to sell CDs and downloads at www.cdbaby.com. It's for independents and a good way to distribute yourself.\" Taught myself at age 15 on a guitar that was missing some of the strings. Needed something to sing with and write on. Consequently play a custom made 4 string guitar - Instruments: Mostly solo. I've supported a group named Michaelangelo, Emily Schiavi, Annie Dressner, Vicky Emerson, and others. - Years playing: Guitar, Piano & Vocals I'm my own Independent Musician. I do all of my booking, make my business decisions, and anything that's primarily related to the marketing of my brand. In the studio, I would say that I am the artist and songwriter, with a vision that I entrust to my producer. I think it's important to let go of some of the reins in regards to your art, and allow another creative brain to figure out if you're truly pushing yourself to be the best you can be. When I go on my upcoming tour this fall, I plan to bring a simple PA system for house concerts (haven't bought it yet), My Martin D35 and Martin J15, and all of the lovely accessories to go along with them. I'm debating throwing my Roland EP9 in the car, but that might be more hassle than help. I think there are the obvious differences on a sexual level. I'm not one to use my sexuality to get ahead in any way, but I think that works for some. To be honest, this is the first time I've ever thought of this particular topic. I think the morphing of the music business in general - how it's shifting so quickly and with so much impact - is the main reason why there would be differences in the generations. I look to Shawn Colvin, and Patty Griffin......or Emmylou and so many others for inspiration and courage and as role models. So I guess there must be something to that as well. \"My mentor, Billy Barber, once said that it was a good thing that I didn't have any major neurosis and/or any drug problems. ;-) I think he was kidding around, but we both knew that was also very true. If I were to give anyone any advice, I would say to just create. Let yourself be vulnerable and observant and loved and hated. Then write about it. Don't worry too much about the end result. Don't worry about being \"\"famous\"\" or all of the other crap that comes along with that. If your music is good, and if you touch one persons heart with it, then I think you're doing your job and using your gifts to the fullest. \" I grew up singing. My voice is my primary instrument. The piano & guitar were means for me to have something to sing a long to. - Instruments: Crowd, Live Wire, Tx Ladybugs - Years playing: Bass, Keys, Vocals Handle finances for band - known as Queen B (bass and backups). Have 8 bass guitars - favorites Fender 60th anniversary P-Bass and Ibanez semi-hollow-body. Have several amps -- small Ampeg and small Peavey - large rig is Hartke head and cabinet. Depends on the circumstances. Playing in an all-girl band is awesome, though -- even though we are all very strong females, we respect and hear each other's ideas and thoughts. Not so easy if you're playing with guys (I was the only female musician in my last band - Live Wire - classic rock). Well, I think it's mainly a matter of maturity. Maturity for women brings with it a comfort in who you are. You don't worry about what everybody might be thinking, you just play and sing what feels good to you. That generally is the best way to do it anyway. Younger women I find are more concerned about being perfect and doing what they think (right or wrong) their buddies want to hear. Mature singer/songwriters just do what they feel, which is generally the right thing. Find your own \"voice\". What kind of music specifically speaks to you and just play it. Bass speaks to me! - Instruments: None - Years playing: I am a composer I write music, find performers, run rehearsals, and take care of tech needs. Basically I do everything short of programming the concert. My goal is always to make the experience pleasant and fulfilling for the musicians so that they will put forth their best efforts and will want to work with me in future. I use the notation program Sibalius to create all of my scores. Recently I have begin using the program SuperCollider to make my computer parts. Absolutely. I do not actually identify as a woman, rather as genderqueer or as a gender variant female bodies person. I responded to this survey anyway, because I think that in my experience of music (which is primarily the art music world) the difference is between men and everyone else. I notice it in the way people respond to me particularly when working with tech equipment, there is a definite sense that the men \"must know more about it.\" Overall the biggest thing that I notice is that I don't find that I really fit into musical communities which I find to be very male dominated and mode of production oriented. I just completed my masters thesis on queer and trans art musicians and one of the questions I asked the women was whether they felt their gender affected the perception of their music. Unanimously they felt that it did. Most of the women felt that their gender made more of a difference than their sexuality in the reception of their music and in their acceptance in musical communities. Not very much. One of my composition professors (female) told me to always do my research, that there are wonderful accepting environments out there and there are very isolating ones, but if you do your research and check things out in advance you will be able to find a place to thrive. I started experimenting with composition as soon as I started learning my first instrument (piano). It never made sense to me to be musician without writing music. I put on a senior recital in high school, which was the first time I presented any of my own work in public and directly led to me pursing composition in college and now graduate school. - Instruments: Mostly just stick with Clare and the Reasons, I do quite a bit of collaborating with Van Dyke Parks...But I sing on some sessions etc. as well. - Years playing: vocals, guitar, banjo, kazoo, washboard, foot tambourine A dictatorship of course! No... I co lead our band with my very French husband, Olivier. We have another main member names Bob who does some label related stuff with marketing us etc. We are like a family business really. In the studio Olivier and I have everything pretty much worked out. I have written the song and Olivier has done the arrangements and orchestrations. By the time we get to the studio, it's just a matter of laying things down with our spectacular musicians. In my experience, we don't have budgets to be writing or really questioning ourselves once in the studio. That's one of the main differences of today, a band used to really get to experiment with musical and sonic ideas in the studio, Abby Road wouldn't have happened without that long stretch of time and feeling free in the studio. I feel a lot of pressure in the studio and get frustrated about not being able to have much time to hang around and let ideas grow slowly, no time! No time! Triste! Oh! We use a deconstructed drum set for ages 2-4, the bass drum has \"kaboom\" written on it. I play a 1959 225 Gibson through a 1972 fender vibro champ. I also play a 1959 0018 Martin guitar that I inherited. Apparently, I have a connection with the year 1959... I also play a tambourine mounted onto a kick, so I can play it with my foot. My \"boys\" play cello, violin, clarinet, french horn, euphonium, keys, bass, percussion, and sing their hearts out. I prefer to sing through a beta 58, the bit of extra brightness makes my little voice cut more. I can't believe you asked about gear, what a fun question... I could go on and on. Yes, of course, a good thing to look at is Berklee College of Music, when I went there, it was 8-1 ratio (men-women) which was fun for me, but also concerning. I think once you get out of the classical world, there are for more men that delve into the music world and the life that brings with it. For example, if you want to have kids, which I would like... It means no touring for a while, but a man doesn't need to think that way, so the trajectory of his musical career never really needs to be broken up. I'm not resentful of this, and I'm lucky because my husband is in the band with me, so our babies are surely going to be touring nomadic babies. I need to break the news to my mom that in her new found retirement she'll likely be traveling the world with us as super grandma! Regarding a moment that maybe made a difference to me, being a woman in music, I don't know if there was one, because I don't approach life that way. I know I have something musical to offer the world that no one else had, and I know the guy standing next to me has something to offer too, although I do feel left out when all the boy member start playing Star Wars themes, they don't really include me... Well, I think woman who came before me have broken the stereotypes that woman are just chicks. My dad's first wife Maria Muldaur did so much for women in music, she started out as a demure \"chick\" upfront with a beautiful warbly voice and became really a powerhouse of a performer and quite the music historian. She broke the idea that if you don't have a male band member leading the way, you're not going to make it. She certainly made it without those men.. On her own. Bessie Smith, one of my favorite singers was a star, but she was payed less for performing than her pianist who accompanied her, which is mind boggling. I believe today, in the indie world at least, people do often listen before they look at the image of the woman. We are humans though, and clearly it helps in any area of music to be \"hot\" even in classical music, they so clearly market the woman as such. Noone ever really told me, although I watched family members struggle in different ways and I learned from watching them what not to go for, like major labels. I would say know exactly what you want musically and don't let any boy tell you how to think about music. Don't try to be too many different things all at once. Well, my main instrument is my voice, because that's what I was born with, or what my father gave me, depending on how you look at it. I studied voice at Berklee College of Music, but I regret not studying guitar, which is a secondary instrument for me. I wish I had been more booted in the booty to really learn reading and theory on guitar, would have been a great experience. I certainly work on guitar, but without the fundamentals of having studied it seriously, I have a strange relationship with it. I perceive the guitar to really be a tool to write and a tight connector to my singing, rather than an independent \"voice\" in the music I write... maybe someday! So, to answer your question, I didn't choose to sing, it chose me I suppose, and I really like to sing for people in an audience. - Instruments: 2 (see above) - Years playing: bassoon, clarinet, didgeridoo, hurdy gurdy, percussion, recorders \"In The Annoying Instrument Orchestra, I am pretty much just an instrumentalist (with some harmony vocals from time to time). Decisions are made as a group. In Heralds and Minstrels, I am also a multi-instrumentalist, but I am more active in promoting the band.\" I use an ancient Conn bassoon; a Buffet Crampon A Clarinet built in 1905; an old metal Bb clarinet. I use a cheap medieval hurdy gurdy and an expensive French style baroque hurdy gurdy built in Hungary. I play a custom made agave LOW Bb didgeridoo, a LOW B didgeridoo made from eucalyptus by an aboriginal artist, and a cheap plastic didj in the key of D. My recorders are mid to professional range. I have a Yamaha keyboard that I use for work at home, but I need a stage keyboard. I have a ceramic dumbek and an assortment of ethnic drums and percussion instruments. I make some of my own percussion instruments from bone and wood. I have an Eb sousaphone that I'm learning at the moment, but I haven't played it with the band yet. At the age of 60, things look a lot different than they did when I was 30. In my thirties (the 1980s), I felt I had to put my music on hold in order to raise my family. It was only after my children were grown that I felt free enough to do music again. Even today I think it would be difficult to try to balance children and the life of a musician. I think today's generation of women musicians are a lot more savvy than previous generations. There are more resources available to everyone, regardless of gender -- for example, classes on business strategies for artists, health support organizations for artists,etc. No one gave me any advice. I'm still re-inventing the wheel for myself, learning as I go. If I were to mentor a woman musician just starting out, I would ask her, \"is this something you HAVE to do?\" Because if it is, she'll know it. And if it is, then I would encourage her to put her work out there, to make as many contacts as she can, to set herself some concrete goals and to stay focused on them rather than all the distractions, promises and lies that will come her way. Playing a large number of instruments adds tonal color and variety to the music I play in my bands and also gives me a versatility that makes me hire-able for freelance projects. - Instruments: Lindsey Buckingham's (from Fleetwood Mac) solo band, Michelle Shocked, Meredith Brooks, Air Supply, Precious Metal (all girl rock band from way back) and my own solo project: Janet Robin - Years playing: vocals, guitar electric and acoustic I am now mostly a solo artist, though I occasionally do high profile guitar gigs. I write or co-write all my own songs and I'm in control of who plays with me, such as additional guitar players, drummer, bass player, etc.. Though I do have management, I make most final decisions and a lot of the marketing ideas come from me. It was my idea to raise the money this time to record the cd with John Carter Cash. I book most of my USA dates, however my label in Europe books me there for tours. I will actually be going soon for a 6 week tour in Czech Republic and Germany, UK, Denmark, opening for actor Kevin Bacon's band, The Bacon Bros. They are on the same label as me in Germany. My manager does help with some things, mostly administrative and organizational though. \"Ah, well I am known for my guitar playing, having had some high profile gigs. I use mainly my Taylor acoustic DCSM, Fender Tele, also I have a Fender Custom Strat, and a Custom Turner-Renaissance electric-acoustic that I co-designed. Turner makes all the guitars for Lindsey Buckingham. I have 17 other guitars. I play through a reissue Fender Blues Deluxe. And I have a custom pedal board that I built. I am endorsed by Fender Guitars, Taylor Guitars, Turner, Martin strings, DR Strings, Clayton picks, Seymour Duncan, Daisy Rock, and Sennheisser.\" \"Well, certainly it's gotten better for women in music, these days you see a lot more women out there playing and doing their own thing. Or, being hired as players in bands. When I started, it really was a novelty. When I was in my band in the 80's we had a major record deal (Polygram and Capitol), we were an all-girl band, (actually friends with some of The Runaways girls), and as we started promotion for our records, radio stations actually said to our faces that they could not add another band with a female singer. That their roster already had one (ala Pat Benatar or Heart) and that they only allowed for one female fronted band at a time on their playlist....Totally ridiculous, of course. We also had some guys come up after our shows and actually ask us if our \"\"boyfriends' were playing the instruments behind the curtain because \"\"girls can't play rock n' roll\"\" that was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Now, it's much better and the more women who get out there, learn and play their instrument proficiently, the better. When I got hired to play in Lindsey Buckingham's solo band, he specifically wanted a woman who could play guitar and sing background vocals. There were not very many at the audition, I can tell you that. He was extremely open to the idea and I'm sure all those years working with Stevie Nicks opened up his mind to even the concept of a women musician. People like Joni Mitchell, Heart, Runaways, Fanny, Suzi Quatro, Bonnie Raitt, even bassist Carol Kaye, all helped women get to where we are now. When there are even younger women players and musicians getting recognition now, I hope they remember where it originated from.\" \"Like I said above, I find that some of the younger women musicians may not know much of people like Joni Mitchell and Heart or even Bonnie Raitt. I have a few guitar students and I try to educate them. Fanny and The Runaways were some of the first all girl bands around, then came Go-Go's, Bangles, Girlschool from the UK, Vixen, (and my band, Precious Metal), during the glam rock days. We all knew each other, whether we were big and famous or not. It didn't matter, there was a comraderie. Now, there are girl bands everywhere, and a lot more girl musicians with companies making guitars for girls even- and really trying to promote playing an instrument to young girls. I think it's great. I just want to make sure that they know their history and know of some of these other women that came before. Even in the blues, there were incredible women guitarists such as Memphis Minnie and Sister Rosetta Thorpe. Most people don't even know who those people are, but for example, Memphis Minnie wrote \"\"When the levee breaks\"\" the song that Led Zeppelin made famous and basically doesn't give her any credit. She was also an amazing LEAD guitarist and her husband was the rhythm guitarist in the band. These are facts that not only women should know, but men too- and people of all ages. Someday I wish to put on a show that features women guitarists and pay homage to women guitarists from the past and present.\" \"Well, the best advice I received was of course \"\"never give up\"\" that is NUMBER 1, no matter what anyone tells you. Then, of course the rest is practice, practice, practice. Get good at all your skills as a singer, or musician. Whatever it is you do. Dedicate yourself to your craft. You may have to sacrifice some things in life, but if it is truly your passion, you will reach whatever goals you desire. I'd like to say: This is a great idea that NPR is doing. I would love to contribute more if you need any information, I have a lot, and have been in the business for many years. Please feel free to contact me at any time. I hope to hear a program like this soon on NPR. Best Regards, Janet Robin www.janetrobin.com\" When I was a young girl, my brother started playing guitar and I wanted to do everything he wanted to do. (now of course, he's a dentist! like my father!) Anyhow, I followed in his footsteps. I started with folk and classical, and eventually I moved into electric guitar like he did. We had the fortunate pleasure of being taught by Randy Rhoads, he was Ozzy Osbourne's famous guitarist (he eventually died tragically in an airplane crash). Randy was actually more of blues player then being confused with a heavy metal guitarist. I studied with Randy for 5 years and was his youngest and only girl student. Nevertheless, I got some great chops being taught by such a master. I was obsessed with the guitar and would practice all the time as a little girl, not what many girls did when they were young. I only had a few girl guitar players to look up too. As I grew up, I got into a neighborhood bands and just knew this was going to be my life. - Instruments: My own eponymous band has featured a rotating cast of supporting musicians and we've been playing around NYC since 2005. - Years playing: vocals, piano, guitar \"I am the primary songwriter, and collaborate on arrangements with my producers and the musical director of my band. In performance I definitely try to command the stage and own the spotlight but I owe so much to the contributions of my backing musicians. In the studio, I really try to be as open as possible and give the musicians I am recording with room to put their own stamp on their performances. I definitely trust my producers as architects of the sound. Although I write alone, the recording process is all about collaboration for me! The songs don't fully come to life until we're in the studio. I'm deeply involved in the business and marketing decisions. I understand that marketing can be just as important (if not more) than the actual music-making. I'm very aware of my target audience and constantly brainstorming ways to reach them. I personally choose the photographers, stlylists, designers, etc that I want to work with in creating the visual component of my art. I'm contributing to all my social networks every day. I do many of my own bookings. In time the 'team' behind me has certainly grown, but I still retain heavy involvement in pretty much every aspect of what we do. As much as I can with the day jobs, etc.\" I have a Korg keyboard that I bring to gigs but I prefer to write on my slightly out-of-tune old upright Lester spinet piano in my apartment. I also like to sit in my garden and play my acoustic guitar (an Olympia), armed with a stack of notebooks filled with lyrics and an old 8-track recorder to capture song ideas. I'm not really a digital girl- you won't find me creating loops on a laptop or anything like that. I guess my 'gear' also includes some very handsome guys with a proclivity for the technical and digital to help execute my recording ideas! Are fishnet stockings and stiletto heels considered 'gear'? Because I don't perform without them. \"I think being a woman in this industry is entirely different. I feel like there is a LOT more pressure for women in terms of maintaining an 'image' that's attractive. It's been more of a growing realization than a singular moment of awareness. I would cite the fact that pretty much every review or item of press that I've ever gotten mentions my appearance in some way, and I often feel if I were a guy the focus would be much more on the music that I'm creating. As a woman in a male-dominated industry, I've sadly learned that you have to be constantly on your guard against men that try to take advantage sexually. It's terrible that this still happens in this day and age. It can be hard to be taken seriously as a musician, and there have been moments when I've been trying to forge a professional relationship with certain men and on their end there's an unwelcome sexual undercurrent. I've been better able to navigate this treacherous ground as I've gained more industry experience but I'd guess men rarely have to deal with this. It's hard having to constantly look out and be on your guard! On the flip side, musically my songs have become much more about using sexuality and femininity as empowerment, just owning it. Many of the women who are successful in the industry (obviously Madonna being the Godmother of this) have been able to control the way their sexuality is represented and use it to their advantage. My sexuality is very much a part of my music and I'm not going to hide that.\" Our young generation is faced with a lot of challenges obviously, being the first to come up in the era of technology, blogs, myspace, twitter, youtube, and all of that. It's daunting trying to navigate it all! We won't be making most of our income from record sales, and have to constantly come up with ways to court the new media, keep it fresh for audiences that have almost unlimited access to music. The days of a record company controlling all the press on their artists are gone. Sometimes it seems like the music alone isn't enough- fans want more and more access via video blogs, social networks, etc. It's hard to imagine what Carly Simon or Joni Mitchell or Billie Holiday or Nina Simone would have done with Twitter at the beginning of their careers. I sometimes wish I was of the generation when a little mystery was an asset. \"It can be extremely overwhelming when starting out in music- trying to get your band together, creating your music, hustling for gigs, trying to create a following, doing all the internet marketing, etc- so great advice I have gotten is: choose just 3 music-related goals each day and do them. And don't forget to make some time to live your life and have experiences and adventures, this is the soul that you will bring to your art. I've been lucky to meet a few successful female musicians that I look up to (Renee Fleming, Roberta Flack, among others) and the universal advice has always been a simple 'keep going and don't give up on your dreams'. I hold that advice very close especially now that I'm at the point where I've been developing my artistry for a few years in New York and I'm gaining ground and at a certain 'breaking point' where I'm ready to launch it on a bigger level. It's difficult to take the 'starving artist' path of building from the ground up, rather than going on a reality show chasing the overnight success. So amidst my bartending and cocktail waitressing and random vocal session work and being a professional Doo-Wop Girl and all the other things I do to feed the dream and pay the rent- I often tell myself, 'just keep going'. Hopefully persistence will be rewarded in the end! That's what I would tell aspiring female musicians- keep your head up despite setbacks, celebrate every small victory- and just keep going.\" My primary instrument being vocals--- I really give all the credit to Judy Garland. My earliest memories of singing and the magic that the human voice can create were from watching The Wizard Of Oz as a very young girl. I would sing along to 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' over and over and over... I think of my voice honestly as a gift that I didn't necessarily choose; but Judy was probably what opened me up to using that voice for my own artistic expression. - Years playing: Vocal/guitar I play and sing. We share decision making evenly within the band. It's a democracy and everybody gets a vote on everything. That is why it takes us a while to make any decision. When it comes to writing, recording, marketing, and business... we all have a say. \"Fender twin amp, fender mustang guitar, tuner. The band consists of guitar, bass, keys, and drums.\" Not to sound weird but I've only ever been a woman musician so it's hard for me to say if it's different for a man. I love being a musician. I do think that sometimes people are rude and make snide comments to us in regards to our gender but from what I have gathered from male musicians people say rude things all the time. People that leave blog comments tend to be the most sexist. We got a comment one time that read,\"They are the reason women shouldn't be allowed to vote!\" I don't think an all male band would get that. Also we had an angry promoter blog \"They must have slept their way to where they are.\" But an all male band could get that too, right?? Maybe not... I think that the pioneering women of music had to fight for their place harder than we have. Even female musicians in the 1990's had to put up with a lot of harassment and cynicism. I feel that we have been lucky to receive harsh blog comments instead of spit and beer cans! \"To be true to who you are and always feel in control of your art. That mantra has helped us through a lot of freak-out moments! Advice for a woman starting out... Don't be scared or intimidated. And do your best! It's not that serious! It's fun! \" I had played acoustic guitar since 16 so playing the electric in the band was the obvious choice. - Years playing: Classical Guitar Leader, founder, composer, publisher, booker, manager and performer :) \"Classical Guitar, Shure 58 Mic, Boss RC 50 Loopstation, Petal Board, Band: Upright Bass, Drums, Keys Extra: Cello, Viola and Violin\" The first show of original music I did was a women only showcase and it was a positive experience for me. I honestly felt less pressure for this opportunitity because we all had a chance to share our songs with each other before hand and it was, to my surprise, a very uniting experience. No not really. I feel like I admire many generations... I just hope that those generations admire the emerging female artists as well! \"Don't write your music for anyone but yourself. It wasn't really advice from anyone, just something I say to myself. I get a lot of criticism about the sound of my voice. It is odd to some. Instead of being bothered or trying to change. I remember that this is the voice I was born with and I use it how I naturally would, so not everyone has to like it. It is unique to me and that won't change. \" Because I saw my uncle play the classical guitar badly and I wanted to get better than him. Then I fell in love with the instrument. - Years playing: keyboards, guitar, flute, clarinet \"I play a large part in creative brainstorming for live shows, and handle a lot of business, especially in the early days. Also, I'm the keyboard player. :)\" Korg Radias, Kurzweil KME 61, Epiphone Dot semi hollow body guitar, early 1970's Fender reverb deluxe amp, multiple effects pedals, 2 Roland JX3P Synths Of COURSE. Ask any woman who's toured as an equal member of a band. I guess it was first made clear to me when I showed up to a venue and was shown \"where to set up merch\". This has happened over and OVER. (my bandmates, who are all men, have never made me feel any different) Yes. This generation seems to reward superficial mediocrity in women. It seems as though women in music are given 2 options for success: be a sex symbol, or a crazy hardass. I think that my best advice would be to scrap these extremes, and just be really really good at what you do. Work on your musical prowess and stage presence. It's amazing how much respect you can gain just by being as good as the dude playing next to you. I was good at it - Instruments: solo artist - Years playing: Guitar, piano, vocals I write and record my own music as well as write songs with a local publishing company for and with other artists. My husband works in the industry as well and he manages my artist career. I normally travel with a Lowden acoustic guitar and a small Nord Keyboard. Occasionally I will bring along a cello player. \"I think that creative people are wired to be constantly searching. Searching for inspiration and insight, questions and answers, meaning and significance. It's like artists are able to create the beautiful things they do because they take the risk of diving beneath the surface of what our eyes see and bringing back what they find from below for everyone else to experience. This is an all-encompasing task and as a new mother, I am having a hard time diving beneath the surface with the great and exhausting privilege of loving and raising a little boy! I am aware that there are less successful women in music than men and I think part of that is because many woman become mothers and are not able to give their whole selves to music because their hearts are with their children. Not to mention they are just tired all the time! Some people manage to do both parenting and creating at the same time, but I can't think of any musical \"\"greats\"\" that have managed to do this well. I think being a mother is a creative and noble work and if I have to choose music or my family I will always choose my family. Somehow I don't think men who are fathers have to make the same choice, they seem able to separate themselves better. The fact that it is the mother who physically carries and births children is a picture of this I think. \" \"I have been given some great advice over the years. I had the privilege of meeting one of my musical heroes when I was 17 and at the time I was recording a record with the same label she was with. This may not sound like advice but I will never forget her whispering two words to me before we left her house. She said, \"\"it's hard...\"\" and I could tell she wanted to say more but she stopped herself. Looking back now I realize what she meant and I think I would say the same to any new musician. With the trailing train of thought and all. I had to find it all out for myself like most people do, and whatever this woman was thinking after she told me those two words I wouldn't have heard anyway. I had to try. I will be overjoyed if my children decide to become musicians, but I will tell them with certainty, \"\"it's hard\"\". from a practical standpoint I would tell any woman who desires to have children to work as hard as she can before that time comes so that when it does she can afford to step back for a bit. \" Although we had a piano in the house when I was growing up, I was more drawn to the $30 garage sale guitar that belonged to my brother. The musicians I was listening to all played the acoustic guitar and I wanted to to! Now I also play some piano and wish I would have taken piano lessons as well as guitar when I was younger. - Instruments: dozens and dozens - Years playing: conductor conductor, director of the organization \"Yes. Very different. Being in a leadership position, I feel I am treated quite differently than than my male counterparts. People often expect me to be accommodating, and then when they realize I have strong leadership capabilities, they are sometimes confused or tend behave as if they are uncomfortable. Also as a female musician it seems to be quite difficult to command equal fees to my male counterparts.\" Perhaps. No specific examples in my experience. \"More than one successful women musician have told me they don't think about the differences, they just do their work. A female role model (undergraduate teacher) told me that women have to work more than four times as hard as their male counterpart to attain equal recognition, and I see that as true and also good advice to live by.\" - Instruments: classical ensembles - Years playing: piano solo act or accompanist I play whatever piano is in the room. I don't think women are taken as seriously. not really - that is, no improvement. Don't listen to what anyone tells you. I loved it. - Instruments: N/A - Years playing: voice I own a publishing company which publishes my music and music by other Canadian classical composers. \"I am a classical composer, singing teacher. In my studio I have a grand piano, simple recording equipment, sheet music.\" Yes. My first composition teacher did not treat me as a serious composer, especially when I compared the opportunities given to a colleague and not to me. Yes. There are more opportunities for performances of composer's music. I notice in Western Canada that women composer's music is chosen just as often as men's for the limited performances available. \"No. Net work with performers and presentors. Find out what they need and wnat, offer to write music especially for them. Try for a commission.\" I love to sing. - Instruments: Three, Lubbock Street Band, Jenny & the Whalers, Leonhardt Band - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, piano, violin \"The one constant- I have collaborated with lots of different artists but all decisions about the music are mine. Amazing advisors by way of who I collaborate with, like producers and other songwriters and musicians. All marketing such as it is is also my arena.\" \"Composite Acoustics tube amp\" \"Only like day and night. Same as in life, there are the same things to prove or disprove or in my case ignore: the age question or the sexiness question or using some trickery to \"\"sell\"\" the music. I'm kind of anti-image, un-sell-y, about the music. I generally find that as far as managers, agents, PR people-they want something easily referential w women musicians that makes it a \"\"hot ticket\"\" and I feel like music speaks for itself and I don't need a reason or a selling point to put it over. The moment for me that I realized it was going to be very different as a woman (apart from a crazy amount of harrassment) was when I had booking people be all excited to book me until they discovered there was a couple songs on my first album that had\"\" language\"\" in them and suddenly they didn't want to book me in venues where families might attend or some such. You don't expect some white girl with an acoustic guitar to be saying F U C K like a rapper and know which shows not to sing that tune ;) Unless she's purring the word like the awesome tune by Jenny Owens Young. \" \"Of course stylistically influences of peer groups but mostly I find women musicians are looking to support each other and so go looking for commonality. I adore the themes of individuality that women from Laura Nyro to Feist and PJ Harvey to Peaches are encompassing. It's tough to insist on individuality in an industry that is meantime looking to pimp you out.\" \"Not per se, it was just always a domain people in my family belonged to, music. The industry was an outgrowth of that not the other way around. My parents just taught us to think critically and for ourselves. My advice would be to be completely committed to your own reality and your own perspective, and to be prepared to go it alone if need be.\" \"Just to accompany singing, and only got as good at instruments as was needed to accompany! \" - Instruments: The first band I ever joined was called \"The Doxies\" which was an all girl punk band I started when I was 16. Then I jumped from band to band for a while, started a solo project, and in the summer of 2008, I joined Freelance Whales. - Years playing: Bass, Glockenspiel, Harmonium, Synth, and vocals, drums, piano and guitar. My role is to be a dedicated member of our band. In the studio we work on our songs together, From a business stand point, we are fresh and we don't have that much money so on tour we all share tour managing responsibilities. One of my responsibilities is to advance shows. I play a Fender precision bass out of an Ampeg combo amp and sometimes run it through a Boss overdrive pedal. A Micro Korg synthesizer, a glockenspiel, harmonium and a Roland JP8000. In some respect I do think its different but in the same breath i believe that people are people and we should all be treated and viewed as equals. Being in a band is hard work and its not any easier or harder when there's a certain number of boys or girls evolved. It's like being in a relationship: it takes dedication, compromise, democracy, strength and confidence and I don't think any of these things are harder or easier for a male or female. I saw what it was like being in an all girl band, and I see what it is like being the only girl in a five piece. We deal with the same crises and situations because a good band is essentially a small business trying to survive off of their music, music that we -- as people and musicians believe in. Well I feel like before the 1960's it was more of a struggle for women to make it as a musicians, so there was a lot more dignity involved in the way they handled there persona's. Now, and I'm not speaking for every woman in the industry, but it seems as though certain women turn themselves into sex objects in order to push their career forward. Well I was once told by a good friend of mine, Natalie Sky, that at any given moment there can be something trying to get in the way of your dreams, and that I should practice patience in order to remain strong and move forward in my career. My advice to any female musician starting out is to always keep a pen and paper handy, and when an idea hits you don't be afraid to miss your train stop and if you don't have public transportation, pullover. I started singing in the third grade after my homeroom teacher gave me a solo part in our spring musical. When I realized how much I enjoyed performing, me and my best friend Nina started a duet called \"Double Diamond.\" Even though we were only 10 we were really serious about our project and even went as far as writing our own a cappella songs. When I entered high school I met a friend who let me practice on his drum set and when I got good enough to keep a steady beat and that's when I started \"The Doxies.\" At rehearsals I would tinker around with the guitar and bass and when the band broke up after 2 years of punk-rock mayhem, a friend of mine was kind enough to lend me her guitar. I began writing songs, and recording them on Garage band and before I knew it I had my own solo project going. After graduating high school I decided to go to college where I studied music theory and learned how to read and compose songs on piano. During the summer break of my Junior year I went on Craigslist.com in search of a new band and instantly clicked with lead singer/ song writer of \"Freelance Whales,\" Judah Dadone who was also looking to start a band. Shortly thereafter, Judah leant me some of his instruments and the glockenspiel and harmonium were soon added to the list of instruments I play to this day. - Instruments: too many to count- that list up top is a starter. i also recently filled in for the bass player of of montreal, and recorded with animal collective - Years playing: cello, bass, guitar, violin if i hold it like a tiny cello bass player, gnarls barkley. when writing my own music, i make most of the major aesthetic decisions, but i value the skills of my fellow music friends in performance and recording. cello, same one i have had since 6th grade, swr california blonde amp, lr baggs acoustic di w sweepable mid, music man ernie ball electric bass, american made from when i used to play punk rock stuff when i first got to college. borrowed upright bass, ampeg 60s b15 portaflex amp, i also play a small bodied guild acoustic guitar, and i recently acquired a girls gone wild electric guitar from my times with lil wayne. i feel like there is a bit of anxiety when you start working with a new group of people. you really want to make sure you can hold your own. costume fittings can be a bit unnerving as a girl, but i think that can be said for both sexes. there seem to be a lot more ladies making music these days, but there have been carol kayes, carla bleys, ruth crawford seegers, and alice coltranes paving the way for a while. not really, and any advice that i have received has not been gender specific. as long as you can surround yourself with great players, artists, and music you can be happy doing this for a long time. when i was a kid, i flipped out over the sound. the cello was also the biggest instrument i could choose in the string family when i was in fourth grade. - Instruments: Sidewalk Cafe - Years playing: vocals I am the vocalist/booker/leader/decision maker/ 2 PA systems, one portable Fender. Several microphones including one Elvis Mic and a Sure Beta 57. Baby grand at home. Yes. However, being a female and a vocalist is a double whammy as you really have to earn credibility as a musician Yes. I believe that the more mature female musicians give alot more deference to those that came before them. Play with the best musicians you possibly can and that will raise you up. Confidence is key. It chose me - Instruments: The Hundred in the Hand - Years playing: mainly vocals - also keys and guitar There are only two of us and we both write the songs so roles get a little muddy. I am more of the musically literate one so chord structures, time signatures, and hearing minor beat alignment things are more my area. We make all business and marketing decisions together with our manager and label. Very important to be deliberate about those things. All that stuff is half the battle in my experience. For live performance, my band has a lot of gear. We rely on samples and backing tracks so we bring a soundsystem with us that lives on stage. We think of it as our third band member. Our general ethos is that all the sound being made in the house should also be represented by the sound coming off the stage. In order to make that happen we have samplers, a pre-amp/audio interface with 8 channel output, a laptop, a mixer...etc and a bazillion cables to make it all link together. That of course is separate from the live instrumentation: vocals, one synth, and massive guitars (for which I am not responsible.) In the practice space we have other gear that we geek out with for recording purposes. An MPC for making beats, other synths, and just general noise making paraphernalia. I was never a gear head before this band. I still wouldn't call myself one, but I've had to give myself a fast education in order to keep up. A lot is still a mystery but as I learn I'm finding myself less intimidated and more excited by the things I don't know. I try to do my thing and not focus on how my experience might be different from a man's. There are clearly more men in the music industry but generally I find them to be pretty great men. Sometimes it gets a little \"laddish\" but there are benefits to being a woman in music so it seems like a fair trade. If I didn't love the music community I'd probably be doing something else. Yes and no. Of course there are period of adversity that women in all professions have had to endure. Those things can inform the way you interact with the world and so create your art. Music that attracts me generally is not politically driven so in the womens music that I like, I tend to find many more parallels in expression and shared experiences over the generations, than differences. Work hard. Learn from your failures but keep going. Work hard. I developed a weird compulsion to sing when I was 11. It never went away. Luckily I learned to control it in public. Guitar was the next instrument...I just had a major crush. Got the first one when I was 14. - Instruments: Two. Queensboro Orch. Unicorn Sound - Years playing: Cello guitar bass Backup. Mixing.PR My guitars are now landfill in Bonham Yeah. Hitting the road alone at fifty No Stay home They chosd me - Instruments: Rasputina, Van Gogh's Daughter, Alfred, Laughing Stock...also toured as accompanist with Amanda Palmer, Dresden Dolls, Imogen Heap, Paolo Nutini - Years playing: cello \"everything, I'm a one-\"\"man\"\" band: composing, recording, engineering, business...all of it. when I play with other arists, I'm just a rock cellist...but I always take responsibility for the technical engineering aspects of my tone.\" Cello + microphones + preamp + computer + midi foot controller \"I'm very tech-minded and know how to make an amplified or recorded cello sound good. However, most sound engineers (who tend to be men) will assume off the bat that I don't know anything and I have to work a little harder to gain their respect and let them know that I know what I'm doing. So, I've made it my thing to be super professional and really on top of my technical knowledge (i.e. live sound amplification, acoustics, computer tech, etc). This seems to be a common problem with other female musicians I've met...the need to continually prove yourself. I also feel like I can't make mistakes. Also, I remember when I was touring with Rasputina (a rock band consisting of 2 female cellists and a drummer) we would have the male member of the band advance the shows with promoters and venues and then settle afterwards...because not only would things run smoother when we arrived at the venue, we would also be less likely to be swindled. On the flip side, I played on a tour with a tour manager who saw being female as a definite benefit. She claimed that unzipping her (rather tight) sweater and leaning forward, as she and the promoter settled the show...helped the band walk out of the venue with more money. Another anecdote...the first band I ever played with in 1996 was an all girl power rock group called Van Gogh's Daughter. They were signed to Hollywood Records, and I joined them as a cellist in their final years. They complained that the record company wanted to \"\"doll them up\"\" and be more sexy, but they refused and it caused quite a bit of friction with the label who accused them of being \"\"difficult\"\". They were dropped in 1997. Lastly.... It does seem with men its less about looks and, as a result, they get a little more time. I know so many female musicians who feel like if they have to look perpetually young and pretty in order to keep their career going...or they have to do it all before they hit the might-as-well-be-dead age of 30. \" \"Yes. Women in their 20's seem just as aware of the gender differences as those of us in our 30's... but rather than be superwoman in order to conform to a male environment, they seem more comfortable with themselves. They seem to embrace the differences and expect everyone to just deal. I notice this the most with women musicians having kids. With other women in my age group, we've had conversations about how we can have a career, or children, not both. Or, you do them sequentially...career first, children later (if you can and haven't waited too long) then back to the career. Maybe its because I went to Sarah Lawrence College....but among my peers, having kids is sometimes looked down upon, like \"\"you're throwing away everything the feminists did for you!!\"\". I struggled with this myself, deciding my career was more important and if I never had kids, so be it. Music being such an unstable profession it wasn't until very recently that I felt professionally established and financially secure enough to have a baby...I'm about to have my 1st child in May. I don't think musicians are the only ones who experience this feeling. I contrast this with some women I've observed who are 10 or 15 years younger than me. They don't see having a baby and having a career as incompatible. They're just doing it, and demanding that the mostly male working environment change to accommodate them. Its exciting. Its the culmination of feminism I think.\" I see a lot of promising musicians give up too soon. It takes time, years of hard work to make it. Don't give up. a music teacher asked me when I was 8 if I would like to play the cello. I didn't know what a cello was, but I said yes. Been playing ever since - Instruments: Tone'X, Unity Klan, - Years playing: Rap Rap/ 1950's style dresses, Baby Doll dresses, Urban-Chic \"I think being a woman and a musician is different than being a man and a musician by our emotions and how we attract and engaged the listener- and also being looked as not being able to conduct business. I once heard a female music artist said she felt she needed to conduct business as a man in order to be taken seriously and not walked over. \" I believe a difference is the drive and the passion. \"yes/ I would say to women musicians embrace yourself and what makes your music unique and connect with listener/crowd. Don't lose sight on your passion. \" \"I chose to rap because someone believed in me and saw my real potential so then I knew my God- given voice would reach and empower a host of people,especially young girls. \" - Instruments: G&D - Years playing: VOCALS,DRUMS,GUITAR,BASS,PIANO..ETC.

Sometimes I choose to simply ignore it (wether it's a good or bad situation) and sometimes I'll call people on it if they are just saying something without paying attention and I want to make them realize it. i first realized it when I came to study in this country from Israel and saw how few women were in the jazz program at my school and how they were treated/ow they treated themselves. After becoming aware of that i made a conscious decision to not let it get in my way anywhere I go. as with women in general, women musicians are more open and daring nowadays than they used to be. there are also much more of us, at least in the jazz world. but speaking of the jazz world, I think women in that field have always been different-especially women instrumentalists-than other women musicians. the profession requires so much of you that not a lot of people (men and women alike) will be willing to devote their life to it, and that's what it means. so i think the women who have done it in the past were of the same kind they are now--only now it's a bit easier and so there are more of us. i have been given many valuable advices trying to make my may in the music industry, and had i not been given them i probably wouldn't have been where i am today (I consider it a pretty nice place). my advice for women musicians just starting out would be to forget they are women. and not to worry-they will be reminded of it enough not to REALLY forget it. so to devote their time, if they are serious about what they do, to the MUSIC and not to any nonsense around it. and also to not forget that nobody will do their work for them (and I am not just talking about the music itself, but about promoting, marketing and distributing their music) and that this aspect of it could even be fun (even if you think you hate doing it and don't know how). and last but not least-we almost never feel ready for things but they happen when we are, so to make sure we are always trying to meet a deadline we set for ourselves, so we can help them happen. i played piano growing up (classical) and got into jazz towards age 20. I just stuck with it. - Instruments: 13 years - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, keyboards, bass Along for the ride for current band, have had previous projects where I've done it all. Roland Jazz Chorus 120, Hartke amp w/SWR cab, Epiphone Les Paul, Fender Jazz master Not in the general sense bit there are definitely guys still out there that you run into that don't see you as quite equal, of course they're usually older. There's definitely guys that are surprised when you don't suck at your instrument! There's more female \"rock\" musicians now which is awesome. In the past all the way up to a decade or so ago there were less females in the scene, but the ones that we did have were amazingly talented, like Rosetta Tharpe. Most likely of course because they wouldn't have gotten any notoriety unless they were better than your average guy musician. Advice no. My advice, just do it and have fun! I like em all! - Instruments: HIldegard (Austin, 1990's) - Years playing: Guitar, Vocals, Heart \" I do everything myself. I hope to get more support, but I have just come off of a \"\"hiatus\"\" from performing because I have young children. Being a singer/songwriter is very entrepreneurial, and there are a dizzying number of hats to wear, between creating, performing, booking, producing recordings, marketing, etc.\" \" Acoustic/electric guitar, microphone, pick, capo, tuner.\" \" Many of my musical heroes--folks like Patti Griffin, Lucinda Williams, Nanci Griffith--do not have children. I imagine it is easier for a male musician who is a parent to tour than it is for a woman musician who is a parent. So I don't know about male vs. female, but I think children make it harder.\" \" Not sure.\" \" One thing I will say is that, when you're a woman doing music, everyone and their dog has advice for you! Bits and pieces everywhere, from pros and audience members, mostly well-intended, some valuable, some not. I'll tell just one of the \"\"not\"\" ones--the guy who offered to give me and my bandmate a \"\"cord clinic\"\" about how to properly wrap up our guitar cables after the gig. I cannot imagine that a male musician would ever be offered such a \"\"service\"\"! :) Sara Hickman is an artist who has mentored me and recorded two of my songs, and she is adamant about keeping one's own publishing and consulting with lawyers before signing contracts. RC Bannon is a #1 hit songwriter in Nashville. He told me that my best songs will come from what's true for me and not by trying to be \"\"commercial.\"\" Monte Warden is another hit writer who has given me a ton of helpful information (along with his wife and publisher, Brandi) about how to not have my CD tossed into the junk bin at the record label office--what to send, how to package it, etc. Because I'm resuming performing, and because I'm doing it on my own now, I feel like I am just starting out. The industry has changed so much, I don't know what to expect. But I just try to remain healthy and seek out support. This is my dream, I have done other things, and nothing else satisfies me the same way. I just try to follow the dream, take one step at a time, and do the best I can to make good choices.\" \" I like the way the guitar sounds. It's very portable. Twenty years ago, I thought it was easy to play, but I have since learned that I was mistaken. :)\" - Years playing: Guitar and vocals \"Im just getting started in this business. I've been singing in choirs or solo for weddings and corporate events for years. Now Im singing everywhere I can with my band or solo.I am the lead singer of the band. I write the songs and collaborate with the guitar player on some. I've been the lead in business and marketing and in the studio. We have a new drummer and have the new name \"\"On Edje\"\". So we are putting a website and recording a new demo soon. I have a single coming out soon that I am recording alone. its a song I wrote a long time ago and I feel the need to do something with it now. Don't know if that answers your questions. \" I have a cheap Ibanez acoustic electric guitar. Working on getting a nice Martin if I could ever get the money to buy it. I use a SM 58 mic. \"YES!!!!! I have a son that is 5, a full time job, and all the responsibilities of life. I think men have it easy because usually if men are in bands and have families its viewed as \"\"cool\"\" but when a woman does that then she isn't a good mother, wife, worker or whatever. I was in a latin rock band for a while before I started my own band while going through a divorce. The band and the practicing was totally used against me in court and I almost lost custody of my son. Even though, I was maintaining a FULL time job and working from home and taking care of my son and paying most of the bills. When my ex husband presented to the judge that fact that I was in a band that had 1 or 2 gigs a month and practiced every wednesday for 3 hours I had to fight to prove that I was responsible. I think if I were a man that subject wouldn't have even been discussed with the judge. But I am a woman so it \"\"looks bad\"\".

I have nothing to do with the music industry. Why don't you take a REAL survey where the questions are open ended and intelligent! I like it! - Instruments: recitalist of classical music and music by women composers - Years playing: voice I am the mistress of my fate. My body and my soul, plus years of study and teaching. \"Men have a societal advantage. Their music is performed more often in classical venues. Having been born a soprano, I had performing opportunities, but it is still a man's world, even in music.\" If young women will admit their feminism, they will make more progress. I see some movement. Years of teaching gave me the opportunity to help women musicians. To young women I say perform, audition, apply, advertise yourself in every way possible. Develop your talent and perform perform perform -- everywhere possible. I was born singing. - Instruments: Just Sick Puppies - Years playing: Bass / Vocals I'm in a 3 piece band, play bass and sing, I started the band with my singer and we all collaborate in the studio etc. In terms of business we have our manager Paul Stepanek. I play Warwick basses ( Streamer stage I play through Ampeg Amps ( SVT Classic through 8 x 10 Cabinets) Yes it's definitely different.Firstly it's not really expected for a woman to be in a band and play an instrument so when you go out there people always find it unusual.Secondly it's a mostly male environment and for a woman to be able to work and feel comfortable in that environment can be a challenge at times because being a touring musician isn't just a job it's a way of life, you're living on a bus (Very close quarters) with 7 or 8 other guys and that something you have to get used to in your own way.After touring for a couple of years you get to know yourself more and also the people around you and you learn your thresholds and limits and find a good balance, I found that because I am a woman I needed different things, I tend to need more time to myself so the bus bunk comes in very handy!! I'd say that women musicians these days (because of the economy and how the industry is in recent times) need to be more thick skinned and adaptable, you have to be cool with sharing buses, rooms etc and being able to think more like a guy to get by. \"Honestly there wasn't really one particular role model, however I did see lots of bands doing the hard yards and working their butts off to get their band heard and out there, that was inspiring.Our manager Paul Stepanek was also a person that helped us/me to not lose sight of what I was doing when things got tough, he inspired me to keep pushing forward.I also didn't pay much attention to the fact that I was a girl trying to make it in this industry that was mainly paved for guys. The one thing I never lost sight of was the dream, everyone has one and mine was to be successful in music and practicing the bass like there was no tomorrow so if that meant being the only girl, that was fine by me. The one thing I say to girls that ask me for advice when starting out is to NEVER listen to anyone telling you that you can't do it and always listen to your heart.\" \"I played guitar at first and learned the basics on it however when I met my singer in high school he actually played guitar as well so in order to start a band I moved over on to bass. It turned out to be the for the best! I love how bass is a mixture of drums and guitar, a mixture of rhythm and melody.\" - Instruments: Soft Location & Glass Rock - Years playing: Primarily:Vocals, Guitar Secondary: Keyboards, Drums \"I am the primary songwriter. After I write demos that include basic guitar and vocal melody and lyrics, we arrange the song as a band and all members write parts. In the studio I have opinions, but no technical ability. I don't have strong opinions or strategies about business or marketing decisions, and don't contribute. I have a low expectation of commercial success and its not in my primary reasons why I make music. That doesn't mean I wouldn't enjoy it!\" I play an acoustic Takamine guitar, and play whatever keyboards, synth or rhythm is around the studio or practice space. Yes I think so. I mean I know so. But its difficult for me to illustrate. I don't have any direct experience with that. My advice would be do it because you love it. and that there's a lot of assholes out there, but there's also a lot of amazing people out there too. So be patient and be persistent and have a good sense of humor. Success is personal. After playing simple casio keyboards for years, my close friend and music collaborator bought me an acoustic guitar for my 23rd birthday. It felt right and it just stuck. I still play the same guitar. I like the way it sounds with my voice. - Instruments: Concord Orchestra, and other community orchestras - Years playing: horn, piano, homemade percussion, voice I do most of my work solo and make all the decisions. I'm more a composer than a performer. I am also a recording engineer. Paxman French horn, Kurzweil 2000 synth, Digital Performer DAW, Sound Devices recorder, various microphones, various sound libraries, Sibelius music notation, Macintosh with OSX I mostly notice when conductors and ensembles who will consider programming my music immediately think - ok, this fits on a program of \"women composers\". I think the issues for younger composers are that the field is saturated and it's hard to get performances by top ensembles, for either women or men. For the women just out of school, there seems to be an egalitarian atmosphere of cooperation for self-produced concerts. Whether equal opportunity and cooperation will persist is an open question. I don't see a lot of progress in programming works by women in established ensembles. One piece per program is \"diversity\", and many ensembles don't have more than one piece by a woman per season. I haven't done a count, but that's how I perceive the concert programming in the Boston area. Promote yourself and talk about your work. Let people know what you do. But don't be pushy. Be helpful and cooperative and be someone people want to work with. - Instruments: I have played with other people's bands (Bob Dylan, for one) but have had this band since 1997 - Years playing: I play the violin/fiddle and sing My partner Whit Smith and I co-own the band. We met though an ad in the Village Voice in 1994 in the music classifieds. We both sing and he plays the guitar and I play fiddle and we have a bass player, Jake Erwin, who also sings. Whit and I sing lead about 50/50, we both write songs, and in the studio the band is set up pretty democratically--we collectively decide on the set list, the arrangements, etc. I tend to keep track of all the finances and almost all of the non-musical details, though, which I hope to graduate from soon. We also have a band assistant, whom I supervise, who takes care of stuff I can no longer bring myself to handle (advancing shows, web stuff, email, etc). But I write the checks and we are a very low-fi outfit. I play the same violin I have had since I was about eight years old. It's a Mittenwald, which means it was made at the Mittenwald School which is on the border of Austria and Germany. It was made in 1962 and my mom was the original owner and handed it down to me. It's the only violin I have owned/that I play since being big enough to play a full-size violin. I play through an AER amplifier with no direct box. All my gear info is visible on my website and myspace page, if you want more info. I use Dominant strings and have six bows that I travel with at all times and get them rehaired often. Oh yes! I am way more detail-oriented than most guys in bands, especially the guys in my band. I care about things that they simply don't. It's a strength and a liability. Sometimes being detail-oriented, or holding a buyer to the terms of a contract, or telling the tour manager what he needs to do differently, or talking with the label, or being clear with the agent about what you want and what you don't want--I am acutely aware that coming from a woman these things can sound bitchy rather than just \"business.\" I understand it's important to temper your delivery to be more patient and compassionate, but often I just want to be direct, like a guy might be, but I think I have a little bit of a reputation for being difficult or bitchy because I know what I want and I think it's fair to ask for it. I went to Barnard, and grew up with a sister, so the idea of women somehow being a weaker gender, or less capable of heading a business has never occurred to me, but I know I need ongoing work in finessing the finer points, but I'm working on it:) I think music is really a tight business these days. There's a huge element of it now that is DIY where you can just decide you're going to do it and away you go--you don't need a label or an agent or a manager or whatever--there are all sorts of ways to show up (digitally, in real life, whatever), and new, unconventional ways to be seen and to grow a fan base. But because of that, these days I think it would likely be hard to sit around smoking pot or being laccadaisical (sp??)--there is no substitute for working your butt off and making it happen. I think in the past there were more established people who could step in and take care of things--it's more of a free for all now, and you have to be very focused and stay the course. But some issues remain. I would love to have a kid, or even a family, and have not been able to figure out yet how to do that and how to keep touring and maintain my career--it's a puzzle, and likely not too different from what women tried to deal with 30 years ago. \"Sure! Eddie Stubbs, who hosts the Grand Ol' Opry told me one night when we were playing there and I was telling him I was kind of beat from all the touring we'd been doing lately and he said, \"\"Don't make yourself a martyr for country music, because country music sure isn't going to be a martyr for you.\"\" Amen. Also, once I asked Mary Traverse (sp?) from Peter Paul and Mary if she had any advice for a female in a band with two guys and she said yeah. First, don't sleep with 'em! And if you DO, get over it, FAST! And that they may act all progressive and liberal, but when it comes to stuff like that, they're really not. Words to live by! Also Buck Owens told me to just keep doing what you're doing, don't worry about what everyone else is doing, so that when the tide turns and what you're doing becomes popular, you're right out there in front of it and just let it come and run you over (in a good way). Also got some good advice from Bob Dylan from three tours with him--more in the abstract--about just getting out there and doing it--I don't feel like he gives too much thought to some aspects of a show anymore, just the act of playing for people is sacred and a kind of spiritual practice of some kind..... Re: advice I would give someone starting out? You have to want it--a relationship with music--pretty darned bad--to the point of single-minded obsession. There's a lot you're going to sacrifice, but if it's what you love, its going to be worth it. It's a reward unto itself, too--don't wait for some big payday that may never come. You need to come home from each tour, or wrap each record feeling like you did what you could do. That's all you can hope for. That and coming home with enough money to pay your bills. No one but you cares if you're in a band or not--if you're not satisfying yourself, it's not worth it. But when it's great, it's great!!\" I heard my mom playing it around the house when I was three and thought it would be fun. - Instruments: over the years? probably 20 or so -- too many to list individually. Includes theatre and opera companies, school and church choirs, professional vocal ensembles and community choirs - Years playing: voice (mezzo-soprano); also conductor and composer \"No band -- I do more \"\"classical\"\" music. I sing with a 40-voice chamber choir in which I also serve as assistant conductor; and a 28 voice women's choir (plus a 20-voice church choir). As a composer, I write music for a cappella choir, as well as accompanied choir, usually for voices plus one or two other instruments. As far as decisions regarding my music -- I have total control over the stuff I write until I turn it over to a publisher. I serve on the boards of the two non-church vocal ensembles, so I have *some* influence over business and marketing decisions.\" ?? I sing -- so I suppose my voice would be my \"gear.\" I also compose using a MacBook Pro and an M-Audio midi keyboard with Finale notation software. My voice is higher than most men's, and there are usually more women than men who want to sing in an ensemble. Other than that, I've seen no difference in how I've been treated. My music is taken just as seriously, my conducting is respected just as much, and my singing is likewise appreciated. Only small difference -- some younger women just starting school seem to assume they can bypass all the hard work and be a \"star\" immediately (a la \"American Idol\"). The business doesn't exactly work the way they want it to work. Learn as much as you can about ALL aspects of your chosen craft, apprentice if you have the opportunity, and don't expect to \"make it big\" until you've paid SOME dues.

So I co-write and arrange, co-produce in the studio, come up with funds sometimes since I have a well-paying day job, and share PR and booking contact duties. In The Gobshites (where I am now a part-time player after 4 yrs of 70+ shows yearly) I just show up and play. \"Depends on band, and if acoustic or electric gig. Ginger Ibex (Rock/Classical crossover original instrumentals - gingeribex.com) - 6 mezzo viola with electric pickup - Codabow Joule bow - tube preamp, Boss RV-3 reverb/delay pedal - Fishman Loudbox 100 amp - Shure wireless in-ear monitor Las Aboricu\u00e1s (Latin singer/guitarist & violin - myspace.com/lasaboricuas) - standard 4 string acoustic violin with electric pickup, Codabow diamond GX box - Fishman preamp & Loudbox 100 amp - LP Aspire Jr Cajon The Gobshites (Irish Punk - gobshites.com) - Skyinbow 5-string violin with onboard bow - Shure wireless in-ear monitor \" \"Yes, but sometimes it's subtle. For instance, as a lesbian playing in a mostly male, Guinness drinking Irish Punk band I was treated as \"\"one of the guys\"\" mostly - which was better than being treated as a \"\"girl\"\", but assumptions that I was as interested as a guy in oogling \"\"girls\"\" were weird. Mostly it's the \"\"I told you so\"\" moments, where my input has been ignored as being less valid, though later turns out to be correct.\" Since I missed being an active musician in my 20s and 30s, I don't know that I can evaluate younger women now. \"The most down-to-earth advice came from my rock violin teacher, who warned me that \"\"guys in bands will just fart all the time and unapologetically\"\", which I found to be true! To anyone starting out, I'd say: pay attention to the details, get agreements in writing, follow up with bookers regularly, show up with all the gear you need in working order, and learn to let all that go on stage because the audience wants to see you having a good time!\" My public school offered in-school lessons (for extra $) starting in 4th grade. I wanted to play trombone because my father said he had, but was told \"girls don't play trombone\". So I picked violin because my mother had once played it as a child. I was strictly classical until college, burned out on it and stopped playing for 20 yrs. Realized I still missed it but didn't want to go back to classical, so started lessons in how to improvise with a woman who played in a rock band. I realized I LIKED being in a grungy room being blasted by amps, and my rock etc career took off! - Instruments: Just The Naked Heroes and an awesome all girl band called Bad Girlfriend. - Years playing: I play the drums. I never really thought about it. My husband and band-mate George Michael Jackson and I write songs together. We work really well together concerning all of these things considering we're both nerds/cool. I have a big, white, dirty Mapex. I'm definitely not precious about my gear. It would be cool to have some sort of vintage Vistalite but I think it's more punk rock to have a K-mart brand, ya know? Totally. I mean, I've never ever witnessed a dude, after a show, go up to GMJ and try to give him advice about his gear or his tone or whatever, but I've actually had dudes come up to me and try to give me advice!!! Can you believe it?!! HOLY CRAP! Of course! You still had your badass women in music throughout the ages. But, it was really rare for a woman to play instruments (besides the acoustic guitar and that usually just as an accompaniment for their singing voice). I know there are a few exceptions to this rule but let's be honest very few. I have musical women heroes most definitely!!!!! But as far as the drummers that I think are the toughest and most awesome, they are men. Things are changing tho! It's not weird for me to roll up to a show and find that a few of the drummers in the other bands are girls. Or to have women come up to me and tell me that they play the drums too! I know that the next generation of lady drummers will most definitely have heroes, girl drummers whose styles they'll try to copy. This is exciting news and I cannot wait! \"The mighty Dean \"\"Rattlesnake\"\" Rispler, who produced our record, is great with advice concerning the band! As far as being a girl who can play I've never really had a woman mentor. Basically, if I ever have any questions I just think \"\"What Would Poison Ivy Do\"\" (WWPID) To a young girl starting out on the drums I would say: Sit in the pocket and watch every youtube video you can find with The Cramps.\" I love to dance. It seemed that playing the drums was just an extension of that. Plus, it's pretty \"tough\" for a girl to play the drums. - Instruments: 2 a number of years ago and solo for the last 10 years - Years playing: Vocals, Piano, Violin I write, sing and record all my own music. I hire all other musicians, producers, etc that I require for performance and recording. I make all the marketing and business decisions. \"Kurzweil Keyboard SP88X BOSE L1 system Neumann KM 105 Microphone\" I believe as a woman it is challenging to be successful as a musician while also having a family. The ability to tour is severely limited by the needs of children and because women still do the majority of both child care and house care even when they are working, it can be difficult to have the time to \"pay one's dues\" musically. The only advice I have ever heeded is \"be yourself\". I sing because it feels whole to me. I play piano and violin because my parents put me in lessons as a child and I grew to love both. - Instruments: I freelance. There have been less than 10 groups I have performaed with regularly. - Years playing: bass I lay down the groove that keeps things together. \"An acoustic bass. Its bow. No pickup. An electric bass. No pick. Two small combo amplifiers. \" Let go. Just play. It chose me, and I was unafraid. - Instruments: Organ Donor, Mixed Company, The Graces, Gia Ciambotti, Bruce Springsteen, Joe Walsh.. - Years playing: vocals I am the primary motivator. \"My voice.. a few microphones.. including a Beta 57 (Sure) and a Neuman mid level \" It is different, in ways an advantage and in ways a disadvantage, mostly to the outside world.. musicians, good ones, treat each other without prejudice, in my opinion. If you can play/sing you're respected for what you bring, not judged for your gender. That is my experience. Professionals are pro. I believe it is less intimidating now. Musicians, writers of music, singers, really just love the art form.. women have traditionally played a major role in the creation of music in America. The business of music is more open to women now. Music advice.. Be able to do what you do, well.. without the computer as a crutch.. listen to the originators of the art form. Business advice.. be a great self-promoter.. Talent comes down the list, in the music industry. Your product has to look good. Steady your nerves, it can be a bumpy ride. It chose me. - Instruments: Classical: the Versailles Quintet, The Fine Arts Trio, many other chamber music groups in college. Not as classical: the Momos, Roja Rouge and the Solid Gold Pieces, The Nihilists, many others... - Years playing: vocals, piano, guitar, cello I am my own one-man band. I am my own manager, booking agent, publicist, and more or less auto mechanic. All business and marketing decisions (and catastrophes) are my own. I have produced two of my own records, both in a small studio in NYC so that I would play and not engineer, but then I mixed the records. I am on the road about 9 months out of the year, and I travel with a 2 speaker Yamaha sound system and mixing board, although I usually use whatever (sketchy at best) system is available in the venue that night. I play on a Roland FP4 keyboard (love it), a Martin acoustic/electric guitar or an Ibanez George Benson hallow body electric guitar, and sometimes I play the keyboard and an audion (cross between an accordion and harmonium I found at a flea market for $5) simultaneously so I can \"solo\" with myself. But I call it my circus organ. If I record myself it's with a 2 channel mbox running through an imac. \"I have been in a professional musician mindset since a relatively young age. I knew I wanted to be a musician by the time I was 12, but at that time I wanted to be a classical pianist (chamber musician). I think this makes the differences between being a man and a woman in the particular business less stark to me. That said, I have noticed that being a woman in classical music is very different from being a woman in the improv/jazz/lounge music setting, interestingly enough not at all in the way you'd assume. In classical music, women tend to hold up about 50% of the working musicians in my experience. There are many women employed by top 10 American orchestras, and the fact that they win their auditions is rarely seen as significant because they are women. In jazz, it is different. I can count on one hand the women I know who can and do take solos. Most women in the genre are singers, or singer/songwriters. There is a huge difference between male and female instrumentalists in terms of ability. The women are by and large much less self-educated or daring in their knowledge of and approach to their instruments. (Again, with singing, this is not as true). All my life, as a classical pianist, listeners would comment to me that I am such a small person, but that I had such a huge sound. When I started playing jazz/blues/rock/whatever it is I do now, the comment is most often it's surprising I can so easily get around the piano and \"\"are you classically and jazz-trained? You can tell.\"\" I've noticed this comment isn't as thrown around with my male bandmates or collaborators. What's interesting to me is, it doesn't make me angry at all. When people comment that I play the piano \"\"like an old man,\"\" I don't immediately reflect on the shortcomings of society by way of feminism and socially accepted women's equality. Instead, if anything, I wonder, \"\"well where ARE all the other women?\"\" I think that if we (women) spent more time practicing, learning how to play our instruments, and less time marketing ourselves, there would be more Shirley Scotts and Betty Carters and less -insert female pop icons here-.\" Yes. The older generations of women tend to have experienced more obvious forms of gender discrimination. I think that tends to make them more hyper-aware of it, but it has also meant that in order to survive in the business they've had to work their way around it. My generation of women have this react-by-working mindset seemingly less so. Maybe, growing up with pop music has meant we've always been somewhat aware that we could always just get by via looking sexy, or choosing a look (innocent girl nextdoor look = pure voice and simple sound, etc). But that is the entire business--these days, people (both men and women) tend to go about development as an artist by figuring out what is the best marketing strategy, as opposed to just learning art until they have become a working artist. Yes, lots. Again, since I started so young it's difficult to pin-point most of it. What has worked best for me though is, don't think of yourself as a \"young woman in music.\" Think of yourself as a young musician. Practice your craft, learn from your mistakes, be persistent, work hard, etc. The few times you are aware that you are being treated by a booker or sound guy or club owner in a particular way because you are a woman, ignore him. The best revenge is living well and all those other old sayings. Dwelling on any kind of unjust \"ism\" that is so deeply rooted in cultural history well only drain you of energy you could be using to create. That said, it makes excellent fodder for lyrical content. The piano was in my house when I was a little girl. My mother played until high school, and her parents had this upright they wanted to get rid of, so we inherited it. Apparently I had sounded out most of the parts to the Nutcracker and would play and sing them simultaneously by ear before I learned to talk. But I think I talked pretty late, so my parents were worried... They didn't sign me up for piano lessons until I was 6. I started playing cello when I was 10, because a Suzuki teacher moved in down the street and I was fascinated by the shape and sound of it. I started guitar at 18 and then started writing on it primarily at 22 because the piano isn't portable, I couldn't afford a keyboard at the time, and none of the clubs I played at in NYC had pianos. There is also something to be said about the romance of setting up shop when you are on the road with a guitar in tow and playing/writing. I didn't start officially singing or writing until 22/23, and the singing was just a ploy to enable me to explicitly write politics into my music. It wasn't until very recently I started thinking of my voice as its own solitary instrument. - Instruments: 4 The Flashbangs, hot house, Cowboy Curse, Overcasters - Years playing: Drums Drumming, Marketing, posters, I do it all. Everyone is treated as an equal in the studio. I think I have a pretty big part in alot of decisions due to that fact that music is my life. \"Numerous guitars, 2 drumsets. Pearl Reference redline kit in white with a matching snare. I had a sparkle pearl reference that got jacked up after driving to New york to play Musichall of williamsburg with The Fluid. Wrecked our van and sat in the snow for 9 hours when it was -20 degrees in Joilet Illinois. A tree ripped through the side of the van and pulled my drums out! We cardboarded the van and made the show. Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon ended up at our show and that made the trip better for me! I play guitar and bass \" Yes. I still think there aren't enough females playing instruments in rock bands. I think alot of women have been made to believe that playing drums, guitar is a masculine thing and it really has been dominated by men for a really long time. I have been at so many shows that I was playing and have been hanging out with guy friends and guys or girls come up to them and say \"hey you must be in the band, what do you play.... they will then say Im not in the band she is.. then they go on to ask me well what do you play? Bass? or do you sing? I also think that being a woman has its advantages. You just have to stick to your guns and believe in yourself. Not to much. I think its becoming easier for women in music Make your own scene. Believe in yourself. and have fun! Started out on guitar and always wanted to play drums. Drumming is not usually an instrument that alot of women play. My mom and dad took me to a music store and bought me my first kit. Best thing I ever did. - Instruments: Melanie Fiona - Years playing: Vocal I play a very strong role in my band, I am my band, In the studio its me and whomever else Im writing with, as far as business and marketing decisions I play a part along with two other ppl in my team. Microphone, and My vocal Chords :-) I do, but I think as a woman it gives you more options, your open to do alot more as a woman entertainer. Just watching the industry and how consumers take to women over men, lets me know that theres a difference. I do, I see the differences in the way we perform, what we talk about, our dress, everything. We're actually circling back around and doing the same thing that we used to do in the 60s and the 70s, certain artist are recreating, which i feel is fun, just has to be done correctly. \"Ive had a few women in the industry give me sound advice about how to move in this industry, being in a man dominated industry. I would tell women to be mindful of how they carry themselves, how they're spending they're time, and stay focused on the goal. \" It was natural, something that came effortless, so it was nothing for me to start doing music. - Instruments: Growing up, too many to name...lately, my solo project and a trio project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, piano, saxophone I'm the lead vocalist and I've written the songs so I lead rehearsals and sessions. When I have a producer (for the last two albums it's been Don Was and Brad Jones respectively) they take the helm so I can focus on performing but I still have a good amount of input. I travel with a Nord Electro 2 keyboard for the killer Wurlitzer and Rhodes sounds, a Taylor 514 acoustic guitar that runs through a Tone Bone PZ-Pre pre amp, a Porchboard for stomping, a Selmer Mark VI soprano sax and 2 Neumann KMS 105 microphones. In the studio I use Vegas, a Yamaha 01V board and a slew of mics, mic pres, acoustic guitars that I would never take on a plane and random instruments everywhere. I started playing saxophone in clubs early on and heard \"wow, you're really good for a girl\" too many times to count. It was obvious though that the people who said that were more about postering and less about playing and it never came from someone that was really good at what they did. None of the accomplished players (and socially aware humans) I've met have had an issue with women musicians. Where it IS different is that I believe women performers have to be more diligent about their appearance including, like women in any field, about their weight. Not fair but also not exclusive to women musicians. Yes. I think there are always differences between generations of women in any field. To whatever degree, women of previous generations had to fight harder for recognition, put up with more ignorance and bust open more ridiculous social boundaries. I know it's been easier for me as a woman musician because of my kick ass predecessors. My folks saw I was serious about music right away and enrolled me in music theory classes when I was 14. Being able to walk into any musical setting and speak in chord changes, bar numbers, etc saves so much time and tends to eliminate any worries that the girl is just a chick singer. My advise is to study music in its entirety, not just listening and playing but also transcribing and writing your own charts. When you can tell the keyboard player he just played a 9th you didn't ask for, nobody will mess with you. I started on Oboe when I was 11 and it was a beast. I noticed how much fun the saxophone section seemed to be having while the double reeds whimpered and turned purple. So, at 12 I switched and loved it. Years of saxophone obsession led to Cal State Northridge as a music major where I met many future writing and performing cohorts. Songwriting took over at about age 20 but I still play sax in my shows, on the albums and an occasional sit in. - Instruments: Winds of Time recorder consort, and freelance - Years playing: oboe, English horn, recorder I don't have a group so this does not pertain to me. However, I spend a certain amount of time marketing myself as a composer and performer, though not as much as I would like to, since I am busy. The decisions in marketing are limited, as I am married with a family and cannot just go anywhere and do anything. I look for local opportunities. oboe, English horn, full consort of recorders, desk top pc computer for composing, amplifier, mic, effects pedal for composing and performing electro-acoustic works, and also lots of music, books, and a music stand and metronome, and reed-making equipment, of course. Yes, there is a difference. Not in production or creativity, but in ability to reach out, market myself and make decisions for my own career and future. There are moments every day that make this difference clear to me. I am not sure. I am sure the basic social aspects are the same - better for some, not as good for others, depending on their environments. However, as far as the way music influences women and what they write and perform, well, that changes with the times, and probably always has. Times change, and musical tastes and styles change with it. Therefore I am not sure if things are different this generation than they were from the last generation. Just advice in making your way at all is good. It pertains to all facets of life, and in this case, music...not just music industry. The best advice is positive advice - it keeps you going and keeps your self-esteem up. Follow your heart, make your dreams come true. That's all. love the sound of it - Instruments: Mostly solo - Years playing: voice, 12 string guitar, mountain dulcimer I am the leader. Guitar, dulcimer, me. .a small sound system when I need it, one spreaker and 4-channel mixer. .usually my venues have sound or I don;t need it. Yes, always and forever. In the beginning, pay differences, (yes!) a club would hire 2 male musicians but not 2 woman musicians (unless it was 'women's night'. .give me a break) Guys can be old, fat slobs and look that way on the poster and no one thinks twice about it. .if I did that, people would say 'what a shame, she's let herself go'. .)guys alway have their wives or girlfriends to sell CDs. .not so women. .it's always been clear to me. A huge double standard in the biz. I think a lot of the women now are forced to think even more about packaging (themselves, I mean) than in the past. Cleavage and legs, even the folkish artists. There's a lot more pressure to be young and sexy, I think. Who said we're 'post-feminist'? My friend Bryan Bowers said, 'remember, no matter how far they build you up, that's how far they'll have to tear you down later\". So. .take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Maintain a sense of humor. And I think of the words mentioned in West With the Night (words of wisdom from her dad, I recall) \"Work and hope, but never hope more than you work.\" Just the right sound! I was in my first choir at age 5, the rest followed. . - Years playing: Classical Voice I like to think of my self as a politician. I am in charge of my own talent. (A singer is not called a soloist for nothing.) It is my job to be focused in regards how I'm doing vocally or how much work I'll have in the coming months. Like all singers I have help. I ask for feedback sometimes on a daily basis from my voice teacher, my vocal coach, my accompanist, conductors, and colleagues. It is my job to take in all this information and sift through what works and what doesn't work without offending anyone. It is a delicate balancing act that every singer goes through. That can range from opera costumes to gowns for a recital performance. I always envy a man. He can just wear a suit and he looks great for a recital event. Where as a woman has to find the perfect dress that's not too tight around the waist so that you can breathe comfortably without anyone seeing how much your working. Then there are shows to consider, makeup, hair, nails, the list could go on and on. For opera I feel that the costumes always require so much more work for women than for men. However, in the end I personally enjoy the process of getting that dressed up. I guess it is the equivalent of getting dressed for one's wedding day. One wants to look perfect because everyone will be focused on just you. Yes!!! Being a woman specifically a soprano voice is extremely competitive. The men don't nearly have to work as hard simply because their men. Males don't have to be fabulous in every area of singing in order to gain lead roles in operas simply because there are fewer men to compete with. I will say that the Tenors have a more difficult time as the tenor parts are coveted and widely appreciated almost as much as the Soprano voice. However, I cannot count the number of times I've heard an awful tenor singing in a lead role. I can't help but wonder how they managed to get the part. A female singer would never be hired if she didn't sing her languages with perfect diction with full understanding of the style, or have beautiful phrasing, or even just stage presence. Whereas, I've seen men perform with inadequately and they think they can get away with certain things because their charismatic. I'll close with a something a wonderful Baritone colleague of mine said to me after we found out that I didn't get cast for an opera that he did get cast for, \"Don't feel bad Cassandra, you know they only cast me because I'm a man.\" In my profession I would have to say no. The world of music that I live in is based in old traditions that continue to recycle themselves. It's rather like Comedia dell'Arte's characters where the archetypes are recreated in a different medium. They are still the same personalities but with a different setting. The generations of musicians in opera have not changed much. We've only been updated with better access to resources and connections with other people. Otherwise it's all the same. \"Yes!!! Every week I sift through advice about what to do next. I am my own manager and I like to think of myself as a private company of one! I have my own best interests at heart. It is essential to surround myself with people who believe in my ability and have the tools to help me attain my goals. The sooner a young singer does this the better. Classical music is a hard profession and one needs really strong people along the way to help embolden a singer. Ultimately, it is up to the singer to really come to terms with whether or not singing is something they really want to do. It is truly the life of a starving artist and the rewards come in the actualization of a performance where you bear all the pain, love, or joys you've ever had to a group of people who are paying you to move them into an emotional state of ecstasy. Being that vulnerable is not for everyone. There are also too few people available to support singers financially. The idea of a patron is a thing of the past and the money to pay for all the coachings, voice lessons, accompanist fees, audition fees, headshots, audition and performance attire, and music scores has to come from somewhere if ever one wants to come close to actualizing their dreams of performing professionally. The real joy for me in singing is that it actually feels wonderful to sing and sing well. I also love the drama of opera and the chance to connect with an audience. After 14 years of study under my belt, it wasn't until last year that I felt I must sing because there is nothing else that I love to do more! Being a singer is one of the most personal journeys one can make. For me, I've come to discover that it is worth the struggle to be able to share so much of my self with others. \" I would say my voice choose me. I never woke up one morning and decided to be an opera singer. It was something that I came into gradually. One main reason is that my voice simply felt more comfortable singing the beautiful melodic lines in opera and art songs. I was never able to really sing musical theater or pop song with any sort of ease. I also was very moved by some of the profoundly beautiful poetry with which inspired the composers to set the music in the first place. I also fell in love with this art form over time because as I gained my own plethora of life experiences I realized that I could offer more in my own performances. It is a demanding task to draw on emotions so that one can express an emotion without being drawn up in the emotion itself. In other words, I can't sing if I'm crying. Art songs gives a singer a chance to draw on those personal experiences and in turn offer the chance for an audience member to recall their own life experiences. For a moment in time, music allows one to look on their intangible emotions as the music and the words recall all sorts of memories. Opera, on the other hand, is about an emotion felt in a period of time by the character(s). It can be funny, sad, devastating, love-filled, or any emotion that man-kind can feel in a given moment. It is the culmination of the human emotion in the form of theater and drama. When watching a great performance I feel as the character feels and when the music is added to it I feel that my soul opens up and it soars. - Instruments: Diane Moser's Composers Big Band, Diane Moser Quintet, Diane Moser Trio, and countless others - Years playing: piano Currently I make all of the decisions. In a few months my big band will be a non-profit, and will operate more as a collective. acoustic piano \"Absolutely. When I was coming up in the 70's-men were still \"\"hitting\"\" on women for sexual favors in return for playing in their band. Also, it was dangerous for a woman to be leaving the gig late at night alone. The first time a man \"\"hit on me\"\" at a gig-I knew right there and then that working as a female jazz musician was going to be rough. To this day-male musicians tend to hire male musicians-unless they have worked with a female musician ( she is usually the leader) in the past that they really enjoyed playing with-or-can expect more gigs from. Women get relegated to Women In Jazz Festivals in order to be heard (this would be in the jazz world-not so much in other styles of music). Also-young females in school (middle and high school) are not encouraged enough to play jazz-on any instrument-although they are constantly encourages to sing.\" \"Absolutely again. Those of us who are 50 and older remember coming up at a time when women were not encouraged to be in the band, or even to study music seriously. The young women who are going in a jazz program at a college today-still too few-are really making their own way. We had a lot of rules to follow-even down to how we had to dress. Young women today have their own style on every level-music-clothes-politics-relationships-they have more freedom than we did. Although, I will still say, they usually have to be the leader of the band-they're not called to be \"\"side-women\"\" as much as men are.\" \"In the beginning no one gave me advice-I just had to make my own way. However, thru the years I have received timely advice from female and male musicians alike. My advice to women musicians just starting out would be..... 1)always protect yourself when playing in less than safe conditions-don't be too proud to ask the biggest guy in the band to walk you to your car after the gig. 2)Seek out older women musicians-ask them to lunch and for advice-they'll be delighted you asked and even more so to help. 3)Make sure you learn about the business side of music! 4)Remain true to your creative spirit. 5)When it's your turn-help the women musicians who are coming up behind you.\" I was drawn to the piano and organ at the age of 2. By the age of 5, my grandmother gave me her very old and very big upright piano. - Instruments: too many to know - Years playing: Vocals and guitar The songwriter the lead singer,The gutair player the business person, If I'm in the studio and if I'm not supporting a friend on a project. I'm the reason why we are recording.Usually my projects. I have to do it all.The business and marketing all of the decisions etc.. \"Taylor guitar, Larrivee guitar, Bud guitar, baby Taylor etc..\" \"Not so much now with the advent of the independent artist. Women can write their own path. A Beautiful thing. In the main stream it is so obvious to me that we are different by the way they market women for show more than the music. Sad. When I got started. Wasn't that long ago. I'm a late bloomer. I never heard of a man on my record label being told he was too fat or too old. Or not good looking enough.when I got my record deal in 1996. That was the case for me. by then I was almost 40 had only been performing for about a two years when I got signed. It was very apparent to me when I got a distribution deal with MCA and the $65,000 advance was doled out to me at my record label's discretion while the men on my label with the same deal was given their money to do with what they saw fit.( and when I could not get a decent tour on my own after being denied by my record label radio money for a world wide tour as and opener for a major act they cut off my money all together. mind you I was a single mother with two young daughters.)I lost everything including our place to live. Was very apparent to me that men and women were treated differently. Much better now!\" \"From an Indie perspective.I see a difference in delivery of the music. the way younger women play their instruments.(Veronica May for instance)The way they express their music vocally too.Different than say Ferron who expresses her music mostly lyrically than musically. Their attitudes about music seems different to me too. I see a lot more women playing music out here in the world than ever before. They are not afraid of pursuing their dream. that's cool. From a major perspective. You wouldn't see Carol King or Aretha or even Janis Joplin traipsing around in scantily clad clothing singing touch me baby.. While entertaining I don't think they would have done that.\" \"Yes Ron deBlasio my old manager.said If you don't want to do something in the business (like you've been asked to do something) that goes against your inner self.simply don't do it. No your strengths, Your weakness, Don't be afraid to get help when you need it. Be totally clear on what you want in this business. Have a plan if you can. Have a Thick skin. If you don't have one get one or get out. \" it was the most accessible for writing music . my first passion - Instruments: Solo artist as Lynda Kay and my duo Lonesome Spurs (as Lynda Kay Parker) - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, suitcase kickdrum \"Here are just a few of my roles: singer, songwriter, production, bandleader, booking, marketing, web designer, flyers, contracts, costume designs I am actually quite involved with many aspects of my career, although I'd prefer to just sing, write songs, and design costumes! \" \"I am a proud Gretsch endorsee, and I have two guitars that are my favorites: Gretsch Knotty Pine Roundup (semi-hollow mahogany body with beautiful tooled leather binding) and Gretsch Rancher Jr. (black lacquer acoustic with creme binding). My friends at Shure keep me in microphones and the SM Beta 58 or 55H seem to work best for my deep contralto voice. And when I'm hitting the road ramblin' roots style, I bring along my signature homemade Samsonite suitcase kickdrum with the double bass drum pedal so I can get that rolling train beat, compliments of the kind folks at The Duallist from Scotland. (normally, these pedals are used by the hardcore men of metal, but it seems that I am their only female endorsee) \" There is absolutely a difference. And one can either look at that in a positive or negative way. I prefer looking at it as a good thing. It is a little more challenging as a woman to be taken seriously as a musician, so I have taken that to mean that I have to continue to work at my refining my craft and develop those aspects that are unique and special to me as a musician and a person. There may be gender bias out there, but talent is undeniable. The only differences that I can see between the generations of women musicians is the expression in the eyes and the feeling of the voice...there is a knowing in the later generations that can only come from years of experience. If you love making music more than anything you've ever done in your entire life, then don't stop, no matter how challenging the business aspects are, and regardless of the personal sacrifices, always keep making music. It will be your saving grace. Out of necessity. I started singing at the age of 3, so my voice was the first instrument I was drawn to. I really wanted to learn to play piano, but my parents didn't think I had the patience, so my sister got piano lessons, and they put me in tap dancing (I guess that's where I got my sense of rhythm.) And when I was in my late 20's, I decided to teach myself to play guitar so I could put chords behind the melodies in my head and began writing songs. - Instruments: It's my band but members vary - Years playing: Vocals Musically, I lead the band in collaboration with my musical director/arranger Daryl Kojak. Although I consult with Daryl and my managers, business and marketing decisions are mine. Mic, mic stand, speakers, mixers I think differences still exist. I've been fortunate, however, to work with many many musicians (male and female) where mutual respect is always present. I won't work with folks who behave otherwise. I don't get to work with a lot of young artists so don't really feel qualifed to answer this. Find the things you LOVE to say with music and say them. It's a tough tough business so your art must always be a source of inspiration because it will take you through the really tough times. If you're not that into it, you won't last. Have no idea. We all sing, mine just became a calling. - Instruments: Action Sound Painting Orchestra, Thousand-Faced Moon, Laundry Room Squelchers, MINIM - Years playing: vocals, keyboards, tibetan bells, gongs, trinkets, found objects, dictaphones, broken glass, contact mics I like working solo on my current project because I have a certain feeling for what I want to express and it's often difficult to work with other musicians unless they themselves are on the same wavelength. However, I do collaborate with 3 other groups, and that is always refreshing. The collaborative projects I'm involved with are each different from the next... in two of them I'm usually the only female, yet it doesn't feel like a male vs female struggle... these projects involve more about going beyond \"self\" so being the only woman in the group goes often unnoticed. Aside from my solo project, the other acts I'm involved with are pretty organic and highly collaborative, but I am definitely not the ringleader of those... They were started by others who have asked me to participate. Mainly use casio keyboards, a tibetan bell, a microphone, a cassette player and a dictaphone. Certainly. The whole rock star syndrome really took off after the 70s and a lot of people are turned off by that mentality. It's just another form of patriarchy, which is still very much alive and causing social dysfunction. Yet, not all male musicians want to be rock stars, and not all female musicians want to be anonymous... I think there are so many layers to these questions that are hard to answer through a questionnaire. But yea, I would say that usually if you are not \"plugged in\" to any community that may receive your art, as a woman, it seems one has to either be dating one of the main boys in town who run the scene, or actually be active in putting on shows. Usually most women musicians don't have time to be as active as their male counterparts in the musical scenes, and unless they know people, run the risk of fading in the periphery. Most women musicians I know are either in duos with their partners, or are deeply linked in to their netowrks that that is why they have received some amount of recognition. Subtle differences.... The current generation of 20-30 year old lesser-known artists seem to have more of a strong sense of the feminine, a respect of the feminine, yet the popular artists are exploiting it like previous generations. Allow yourself to be beautiful. Allow yourself to make beautiful sounds. It doesn't matter how well you're known, as long as there are a few who become inspired by your presence. It's all about passing the torch. Minimalism can deliver some interesting results. Everything has a sound waiting to emerge. I like to cultivate something ecstatic within what would seem otherwise mundane or trivial, so the simpler the better... - Instruments: Irish music is weird - there aren't many of us so it's the same people in multiple configurations. - Years playing: Irish flute, tinwhistle, uilleann pipes (Irish bagpipes), some vocals \"I'm the designated wearer of the cool shoes. One of our band members even wrote a jig about my shoes. (Though they're not that great, honest.) OK, seriously -- I'm pretty opinionated and again, since I'm also about the only Irish flute player in the area (there are just a couple of us in the whole state), I get a fair amount of say in things. This is also because no one really understands how I do what I do or how my instruments work -- somewhere between a better mousetrap and rocket science are the uilleann pipes, heh-heh. My main band, Cloigheann, is very democratic. But I'm in kind of a nifty little niche and I think that helps my cred somewhat. I also supply a certain amount of energy and good cheer, and I'm pretty good at arranging \"\"sets\"\" so I add value there as well.\" \"LOL! My instruments represent the best 1850 had to offer (they're all reproductions of 19th-century instruments): 1/2 set of irish uilleann pipes made by James Wenham, Roscrea, Ireland. Irish flute made by Sam Murray, Galway, Ireland. Irish flute made by Patrick Olwell, Massies Mill, VA. Too many tinwhistles to count, made by various and sundry people all over the world. Classical flute: Mateki 9-Something Or Other (doesn't get played much anymore)\" \"I think there is a difference -- especially if you're not 18 and skinny or into flowing hair and gauzy stuff. i.e., it seems there are certain expectations of the \"\"woman musician ethos.\"\" {I do believe this is changing, however, especially for younger performers.} Me, I actually find the age factor a little more of a hurdle in the \"\"perceived expectations\"\" department -- I'm not cute, I'm not mysterious, and I'm not even young -- I'm just a chunky middle-aged librarian-looking woman wandering around on stage with a stick or sitting in a chair apparently torturing some strange bellows-driven apparatus, and it's my impression that audiences don't know what to make of that. Had I been a chunky middle-aged guy wandering around they probably wouldn't think twice! On the flip side, while I play the flute which is often considered \"\"girly,\"\" in Irish music circles most of the strongest/recognized flute players are male. And most performing uilleann pipers are male, so I'm actually in a minority there, too. So here I am, a middle-aged woman doing a man's work -- but then again, that's sort of how my career seems to be, too. So I'm kind of used to being the odd woman out!\" \"Yes and no. I mean, record companies have always pandered to the masses with certain \"\"prefab models\"\" of singers and performers, but there have also always been independent female musicians as long as I can remember, in virtually any genre I can think of. In any generation women have had to be brave and put themselves out there which sometimes requires \"\"not fitting in,\"\" but if they love the music enough and can't live without writing, singing, or performing it, then they find a way. I think the younger generation has more opportunities now, somehow, and that younger women (at least singer/songwriter types) are a little more readily accepted. After all, it's now a known fact there's a VERY healthy market for what they do! I also think girls today are being raised to have a little more faith and confidence in themselves than my generation was. They seem to trust their abilities and creativity much more than we ever allowed ourselves to. Girls who daydreamed and wrote weird poems didn't have very good shots at marriage. But again, I'm in a strange niche so have a little salt with that thought.\" Get really, really good at what you do. Be twice as good as the average guy. Pay attention to technique, craft, nuance, and mastery of your instrument; your style will come out of that eventually -- and meanwhile, no one can argue with the fact that you kick ass. In other words, your looks and charm and cuteness will change, but if you're a great musician you'll get respect. And you'll just get better as time goes on. If your work's great and your music's great then people aren't going to care who made it. My mom wouldn't let me play drums and wanted me to play the clarinet. To my fourth-grade mind, the flute was the only way out. - Instruments: 3: Standard Fare, The Daisies, Persons Unknown - Years playing: Vocals, Bass, Guitar, Mandolin I play bass and sing in the band. I organise nearly all of the gigs. I organised a recent tour including all visa issues, travel, accomodation and gigs etc. I found us all the labels we are on. I write half the songs. Fender Mustang Bass. Japanese hollowback electric guitar. Steel string electric guitar. Nylon string electric guitar. Mandolin. Entry level short scale bass. I found it hard early on being the only female at gigs all male bands and soundguys and organisers. The indiepop scene has more women and I like that much more. It sometimes feels hard organising the band as a woman that the boys feel nagged or listen to me less because I have less patience with just hanging out and mucking about. There have also been occasions where although I have all the information and have been the point of contact organisers have still addressed the one of the men in the band or payed them instead of me. My mother was in a punk band, and roady-ed for bands before I was born and then was in Klezmer bands whilst I was growing up. She was a great example and was always honest about the men that supported and helped her and the men in bands that ignored her. \"I can't think of any advice. My parents were always supportive of me being myself whatever that meant at the time. Advice would be use your strengths and network! Always be polite and thank people who have helped you or put you on etc. Enjoy the music and find other people you enjoy working with and playing music with.\" I started playing bass because bands always need a bass player and I wasn't comfortable being the only guitarist in a band and having to do amazing solos! Singing I have done for a while and improved loads! Mandolin I am still learning but love it. - Instruments: Diamonds Under Fire - Years playing: My main instruments are vocals & guitar but I also write & play bass, drums & a little bit of piano. In Diamonds Under Fire I make all the decisions. In the studio I'm very hands on with arrangement, production & the whole vision. I take on the role of singing & playing most of the instruments but will also sometimes get a friend or session player to help out. For business & marketing I like to consult my manager, we bounce ideas off of each other which is great but ultimately I make the final decision. Gibson & Epiphone guitars, Fender Deville combo amp, Boss overdrive & distortion pedals, Ernie Ball strings (Skinny top, heavy bottom), Dunlop guitar picks, & audix OM5 vocal mic. I think in 2010 being a woman & musician compared to being a man & a musician is a lot easier than it used to be. I am so thankful for female musicians like The Runaways, The Go Gos, Patti Smith, Hole, L7, Pj Harvey, & Tegan & Sara to name a few who have helped pave the way & have opened so many doors for other female musicians like myself. I don't really see many differences between generations of women musicians -- I think it's probably easier for female musicians presently as audiences are more accepting and supportive. There are also so many more female musicians now. Navigating through the music industry can be daunting & a lot of it is trial & error. I was lucky & fortunate enough to have met my music manager early on & the honest advice she has given me about the business has been very valuable. Having people around you who don't sugar coat things & who support your creativity in the right way is important. Working with people who nurture your art but don't kiss your butt for you makes you a better artist. My advice to any female musicians & artists first starting out is to try & develop your own opinion/style/sound. Write as many songs as you can & tour. Don't follow trends, be yourself, respect yourself & let the music do most of the talking. I chose to sing so I could say how I feel & the guitar is great for accompanying those vocals. - Instruments: 2- Fannypack & Holy Hail - Years playing: Vocals (guitar and bass not in the band) I am the cofounder of the band. We all contribute to the creation of songs (I mostly help with lyrics and melody). In the studio I like to be there for the whole process and add percussion, bass, and little extras where needed. We all collaborate and discuss business/marketing decisions together. I sing with my voice going through a Memory Man guitar pedal. At home I also have two electric guitars (both of which I let my boyfriend use), one acoustic guitar and an electric bass. I definitely think that being a woman in music is different from being a man. Subconsciously it is still a surprise to the people who work in music when women are playing in a heavy and loud band. I say this because of the number of times that I have been presumed to be \"with the band\" as opposed to in it- mistaken as merch girl, tour manager, girlfriend of the band, etc. I think that it is way easier to be a female musician/performer today than it was even ten or fifteen years ago. There are a lot of ballsy women singers, guitarists, drummers, bassists, etc that have paved the way for girls today and we have a lot of thanks to give for that. I think of ladies from Bessie Smith to Kim Deal and Kim Gordon. I feel like as a girl in music sometimes you might have to work twice as hard as the boys to prove yourself but once you do the rewards will be twice as gratifying. Initially I tried to play guitar and sing in Holy Hail, but I still haven't figured out how to do both and the rest of my band sort of nudged me to concentrate on vocals and performing (I share the vocals in HH with a guy). - Instruments: One Dove, Massive Attack, Babyshambles, Pete Doherty, Slam - Years playing: vocals, keyboards, guitar The decision-maker \"Logic 9, Mac Book, Yamaha Keyboard - Weighted Keys, SM58, AKG mic, Mackie 16 channel console, Soundcard, 001, Zoom FX, Takemine guitar, Tangle wood 6 string,\" \"I think women are still objectified too much across the board.. and therefore as a creative you are always fighting against the limiting beliefs held about women's roles across the board... Yes my NME review of my past LP which accused of me getting my 'famous friends' to help me with my album... all of whom were colleagues before friends if indeed those working relationships developed into friendships... and I felt this to be incredibly sexist.. I am sure they don't accuse Massive Attack of getting their famous friends to help them with an album but more see it as it is a meeting of creatives purely. Bless the guy who wrote it.. apparently it was so factually incorrect it was entertaining.. I didn't actually get round to reading it myself.\" I do... I hope we are progressing... I think women need to see themselves as worthy without having to allow themselves to be sexualized in a 'victim' kind of way... sexuality is beautiful.. but I think the objectification of any human being in an exploitative way is really sad. \"Nope.. I'd say... Know your own mind, listen to your gut.. Keep your boundaries and stay true to yourself .... and keeping those boundaries in my book entails not being creatively or personally railroaded in any sense that diminishes you or makes you feel uncomfortable... Female experience in art is equally important and I believe essential to keeping balance in our world.. I think we need that and so do men!\" I found my voice had a unique sound and worked with that.. - Instruments: EB Hawkins Band, Union Square, Geri Smith duo, John Hadfield currently - Years playing: vocals, piano, guitar I do most of the work myself. sorry don't feel comfortable w/this question Playing alone had security issues so I never play alone anymore. The moment that made a difference was when a creepy fan waited for me after a gig in the parking lot and I saw how vunerable I was. Men probably have to deal w/this too but I think they are not in such great danger as women. I also never publish my address anywhere. I had a stalker when I was in my 20s for a couple years. Cops said he probably followed me home from a gig. \"Yes. There doesn't seem to be such amazement anymore when a woman can play the guitar. No one used to believe women could be good guitarists. Bonnie Raitt was my champion. Many women have come after her that have proven a woman can be as good or better than a man if they are willing to work hard at it. The worst thing today's young talented women have to face in the Pop Music world is the Britney Spears factor. If you are not a size 2 and gorgeous the industry doesn't take you seriously. You have to have the whole package, and for women The bar is much higher looks wise than it is for men. Before the age of video it was so much more about how talented you were. There are so many more fakes today than there used to be. Ashlee Simpson's SNL meltdown opened people's eyes to what was going on in the industry. It was shameful. The only pop artist I can think of that is not perfect looking is Adell. I should note that R & B and Rap have a lot more female artists that are signed on the basis of talent over looks. \" Network network network. Join NARAS. Make good recordings and distribute them as widely as possible. Try your best to get some of your music licensed. And don't tell WXPN if you are from the Philadelphia area, you will get shoved into the local bin and not get played. I know several local artists like myself who are good enough to play in the best rooms in NYC but can't get airplay in thier home town. It is very frustrating. I was drawn to it at a young age. Piano at 5, guitar at 9 - Instruments: Seven 1) The New York Chamber Orchestra, Suburban Symphony (NJ), 3) The Virtuoso Strings, 4) Riverside Orchestra, 5) Bronx Concert Singers, 6) The Orchestra Celebrate!, 7) Boricua College Chorus - Years playing: Conductor Conductor \"Very large collection of scores and records/tapes/CDs. Computer w/ Finale and Sibelius software.\" Yes. Far too complex to go into. Yes. It seems that it becomes easier for each successive generation of female musicians to be accepted just for their music and not have the focus be on their gender. No. Depend on the person and genre of music. Its expressive capabilities - Instruments: I've performed mainly with three groups: Madder Rose, Saint Low, Mary Lorson and the Soubrettes. I've also scored several films. - Years playing: vocals, keyboards, guitar I'm the lead singer, songwriter, main (but not only) arranger, and Chief Executive, complete with veto power. My current band was assembled fairly recently, and is composed of incredibly smart business people who have tons of energy and good will, so I'm trying to learn from their example on the practical end, as I contribute to the next phase of their musical development. It's a great match. I'm also fortunate to have a rather long career at this point, and can reach out to a number of proven professionals for advice and help on any aspect of the process. I rock a pre-CBS Frankenstein Fender telecaster (mauve in color) through a Fender Vibroverb re-issue that looks original now, it's so beat-up. I like the sound because it's warm, clean, and versatile. Recently I acquired my first plug-in acoustic, and I enjoy it immensely too. For keyboards: at home I play a yard-sale spinet, and I have sweet collection of old and new organs, etc., including a vintage Fender Rhodes which is a bit too delicate now for travel, so I tend now only to play at venues with in-house acoustic pianos, or to skip my keyboard songs if the venue doesn't have one. I go back and forth between acknowledging/identifying the differences you mention. Really, it's different being a woman ANYTHING than being a man. Frankly, when I was a young woman it was pretty rough trying to get an idea across, but I was also not the ballsy-est girl around, so that may have had something to do with the frustrations I experienced. I do think that a woman benefits from having the right men around her in order to be fully heard and understood; strong, intelligent people who are decent collaborators; they do exist. Insecure men are power-hungry and tend to stifle a woman more than they will a man. Yes....that is, I think so? I think (I hope) I see a more relaxed and confident generation of young women in the world today, not so anxious about sexism, not so squashed or deferential. I hope. Unfortunately, I didn't get tons of great advice when I really could have used it. So here are my own hard-earned pearls, and frankly, I'd give same advice to a man as to a woman who wants to make a life in the music industry: Write, play, and sing. Do your best work, and do not abuse yourself in the process of bringing it to the world. Be honest with yourself and your collaborators about what's working and what's not, and never rush the process. Enjoy yourself but save some money, and when opportunity knocks, answer the door--it will likely be your one real chance. My dad's a killer jazz pianist, so the piano chose me at an early age. I adopted the guitar in my early 20s because they were cheap and portable, and I always seemed to have friends playing them around me. As I became more confident, I allowed myself to bang on anything in the studio--I have marimbas, triangle, harmonica, drums, etc. - Instruments: I've sung with quite a few bands live and on recordings, but I've been a member of two bands. The punk band Zeitgeist Auto Parts, and Leslie and The Badgers. - Years playing: Guitar, Piano, (Saw, Harmonica, sometimes Kazoo) and Vocals. I am the principle songwriter and band leader. We make the important decisions as a band and the song arrangements are collaborative. When it came time to record \"Roomful of Smoke\" in the Studio, I fought the fights to get the details straightened out. \"Gibson Acoustic Blues King, Saw from Home depot. Alvarez Classical guitar. Mexican Telecaster, Princeton Amp Nineteen Sixty Twoooooo! Fender Twin Reverb Amp, Nineteen Seventy Six.\" \"Firstly, no interviewer has ever asked me this and the answer is a resounding, yes. There is no doubt in my mind that it's different. It's different being a woman in many industries. The culture of musicians however is male dominated. The vast majority of engineers, producers, sound engineers, are male. The majority of the leadership roles are male. I think that there is so much discrimination against women by men and that there is a good deal of misogyny among women themselves. I think we are blind to it a bit because as a culture we see a member of a group as a natural advocate for that group and that is simply not reality. Nothing about being a woman makes you an advocate for women as a group. \" Not so much. \"Don't apologize for yourself. It's good to want your vision to exist. A couple of friends and I formed a group in Los Angeles of female songwriters and we meet about once a month to play and critique songs and we support each others art. This has been really helpful to me as an artist. I know I was raised to prioritize others choices. I think a lot of women I know were raised in a similar way, so being aware of that, and giving your ideas and choices their weight and value without apologizing is important. While selflessness is a wonderful quality in men or in women, I think it is helpful to be assertive to be able to achieve an incredibly difficult goal like the completion of a record with a vision behind it. It won't exist exactly like it did in your mind, someone told me that once, and I have found it to be true, but you might get close.\" \"The piano was picked for me, the guitar I picked for myself. I come from a fortunate household and I was raised playing the piano and reading Tiffany's Table Manners for Teenagers and I was to have a coming out party as a debutante when I was old enough. But I didn't end up becoming a debutante. When I asked for a guitar, I was eventually given my mother's old guitar (a useless prop from her hippy days). Once I got strings I couldn't make it sound right. So I ended up getting my first guitar from a boyfriend years after that. So it took a long time to get to a guitar. The guitar itself represents a sort of independence or freedom. It is actually physically freeing, you can take it anywhere you can play it alone, even on the roof and you can't take the piano on the roof. So the guitar leant itself to private musings and freedom just by virtue of the physicality of it. And then in my mind if you played the guitar you could say whatever you wanted and do whatever you wanted to do. Joni Micthell, Bonnie Raitt seemed so self possessed- K.D. Lang, these icons were not going to bow down as debutantes to a man wearing a veil. (That's what you do at the debutante ball in my hometown, you submit by bowing down to a guy in a veiled disguise. You can google it. The VP ball, Saint Louis MO. It's 2010 and young women bow down, some of the debutantes lay down completely submissive on their bellies, to a stranger, and I don't think I like that.)\" - Instruments: 5. The Rag and Bone Men, White Fang, The Ocean Floor, Typhoon, Ah Holly Fam'ly - Years playing: violin, vocals, percussion \"All of the bands I am in were started before I joined them. So across the board, I write my own parts to songs, help with selling merch, help with some booking, etc. I've been with The Ocean Floor for 3 years so our relationship has become more cohesive and I am much more involved than I once was. I am one of two in that band. I am one of three in Ah Holly Fam'ly (as of the last three or four shows). I am one of a dozen in Typhoon.\" \"What I play regularly: violin with quarter inch pickup, harmonica, glockenspiel. What I play at home: violin, viola, upright bass, acoustic guitar, banjo, electric guitar (an imitation les paul called \"\"the paul\"\")\" I never used to think about it but I definitely get treated differently. Before a show, it is assumed that my skill is limited, my knowledge of sound equipment is limited, and sometimes I've been mistaken for a male bandmates girlfriend. \"The women musicians I grew up listening to were almost all feminists. A lot of their musical content talked about it. Lately, the ladies I listen to write about everything and anything. They don't avoid the topic of feminism but I think a road was paved so that it doesn't have to be such a focus anymore.\" Be confident. Introduce yourself to people. You don't have to think about being a girl. Just be a musician first and foremost. My mother plays violin. When I was little we went to a toystore and saw a pink toy violin. I later told my mom I wanted it. I guess I wasn't very specific because she took me to Schuback Violins and we got a real one. - Instruments: playing with backing bands for 15 years - Years playing: vocals, acoustic guitar \"On stage I sing and do the acoustic guitar parts. In the studio I am producer or co-producer. I make all the final decisions on business and marketing, but have a great team of people who are constantly giving their input and advice.\" \"Primary acoustic - Gretsch Historic Series G3700 - spruce top, mahogany sides and back, with pick-up Taylor 512 - spruce top, mahogany back, rosewood neck, with pick-up Hand-made acoustic, out of old Martin wood, made by an old Martin guitar-maker. Sounds like a cannon. Spruce, rosewood, with no pick-up \" \"I think there are some differences. There are challenges for women musicians performing on stage that have to do with being seen as more than just a pretty face, as a great musician or a great vocalist more than just a \"\"chick who plays guitar\"\" or a \"\"chick singer.\"\" From my experiences, challenges for women musicians within the band have to do with perceptions - in proving yourself to be a team player, a legitimate contributor, and in gaining the respect of your band members. Do you contribute creatively, do you help solve problems, do you help the band set up and break down? \" \"As women in general, it seems we face the same personal challenges. It seems more that what has changed is how society views women. More is accepted, and more is expected. I think earlier generations of women have made it easier on women today, by breaking down stereotypes and breaking through glass ceilings in our society in general. As a woman musician, there are the same internal struggles and difficult decisions on how best to balance career and family. However, it is more accepted these days when a woman makes a choice to be away for career reasons, and it is more acceptable for women to take on the roles of living independently or of being bread-winners for their families. Now, more than ever before, women can wear many hats, and have it all. These days women are more respected for trying to balance marriage, home, children, artistry, adventure, career, and independence. This is thanks to the generations of women who came before and fought to change how women are viewed in society, to change our rights. I do think, however, that the same complexities within each woman on how exactly to find her own balance - musician or not - still remain.\" \"1. For any musician male or female: You must have a higher reason and a lasting passion for doing music, one that goes above and beyond basic goal-setting, or you will not last. 2. Try to keep emotions in the music and out of the business and continually keep good lines of communication open with those you're working with. Don't assume people can read your mind, and listen carefully to what others have to say. 3. Good paper makes good business.\" \"I didn't get into the piano lessons as a child, but loved guitar. I learned quickly how to play songs by ear, which made it more fun for me. Portability is another big plus.\" - Instruments: Drunken Boat, Ash Reiter - Years playing: guitar/vox I suppose I am the band leader, I book the gigs and am the contact for the press. I play guitar and am the lead singer. Most of the songs are brought to the band by me and then the boys come up with parts. The drummer Will Halsey has written the music to a couple really great songs too and I added some lyrics. I'm glad when it is collaborative as much as possible. I play a Eastwood Airline electric guitar and use a fender blues junior amp. I record at home using a program called Reaper. I think it is different. People expect less of you and involve you less in the technical parts of things, then its harder to learn them because you never have to. Its also different in how the audience treats you because I feel sex is more present when a woman is performing it becomes involved in the experience. Yes, I think in the past women had to be pretty in music then there was the revolution where women could be punk, now I think things are a little more relaxed and women can create their own niche. \"Jolie Holland once told me that it could be risky thing taking voice lessons, that it could really harm the character of your music. I haven't taken lessons and I think my unique voice is an asset. I would just say make music fun, feel it and make the audience feel something too, otherwise its just an exercise.\" Its a very natural instrument to write with. Plus its just such a fun way to get into you body playing it because its both melodic and rhythmic. - Instruments: Pop groups? Just two: Secret Cities and Haley E & the Rydells. - Years playing: Vocals, piano, cello, French horn, guitar \"I write and sing about 40% of our songs and write string and horn arrangements and piano parts. We don't have a studio; we record in Charlie's parents' house using his equipment, so my role there is just to play my part. I'm the only one who currently lives in Fargo-Moorhead full-time, so it's also my job to find musicians to come in and record what we can't play (violin, trumpet, etc). As far as marketing, Brian has been running Western Vinyl for a while so I figure he knows what he's doing. He emails all three of us with these kinds of issues and I usually respond with a \"\"sounds good to me!\"\"\" All I own personally is a horn, a cello, a computer with Sibelius notation software for our string arrangements, and a crappy old guitar that we don't use when we record or perform. Between the three of us, we also have electric guitars, a drum set, electric keyboards, some microphones, a couple of Digital Audio Workstations, and even a little bit of analog recording equipment. Well, the bigger issue is that regardless of any natural or socially constructed behavior differences, it's generally different to be a woman than it is to be a man. Speaking strictly as a musician in Secret Cities, however....I mean, I feel different in the sense that I can sing higher and the fact that my grandparents think it's weird that I'm going to hit the road in a van full of men this summer. But nobody in the band makes me feel like my I'm any \"different\" from them because of my sex. \"Keeping in mind that I've only experienced two decades of music as they happened, the thing that I notice right away is the increased sexualization of women musicians.\" I'd give the same advice regardless of the musician's sex or gender, and it's this: Have confidence and be proactive. Also, if you're like me, you write two or three songs you hate before writing one you like. Don't let it discourage you. \"I picked up each instrument for a different reason. Piano was compulsory in my household; much to my dismay. I took four years of formal piano lessons, and about a year after dropping them, I approached the piano on my own and discovered that I had a talent for playing by ear. Shortly after, I started experimenting with writing music as well. I picked the horn because I thought it looked weird and nobody else in my school's band played it. When I was in high school, somebody left an old guitar in my choir director's office and never went back to get it. My choir director also happened to be my dad, so, hooray, I had a guitar! I decided to learn to play it. The cello was least convenient for me to start because my school district had no string program. I didn't even know what a cello was until I was about fifteen. Right away, I loved the way it sounded. It took a few months, but I finally convinced my parents to rent me a cello -- which had to be mailed to us -- and then I started taking monthly lessons. In Montana.\" - Instruments: The Decemberists, Calobo, Caleb Klauder Band, Black Prairie, Casey Neill and the Norway Rats, From Words to Blows, Lewi Longmire Band, Jerry Joseph and the Jackmormons - Years playing: Piano, Organ, Accordion I am an equal business partner with my bandmates in the Decemberists and Black Prairie. \"Petosa Accordion Hammond B3 Organ Nord Stage Piano\" I think you are treated a little differently. I think in most cases it s to our advantage to be women making music, I think audiences really enjoy seeing and hearing women in bands. I think if you are a good musician it might help you get hired into a project. At times it can still feel like a boys club, if you stop and look around at some festivals you can really feel what a minority you are. There have been plenty of moments of security guards not believing I was in the band and keeping me from the backstage, but those instances are getting more rare. I think the younger generation of musicians has a lot better representation of women. I am not sure about other differences though. It is hard to lump a whole group of people together and make a judgement. If you act like there is no difference between you and your male counterparts, there most likely won't be. I grew up playing classical piano music. I have always loved rock music and slowly learned to play electric piano and organ. I started to play accordion about 15 years ago to play more folk music and play acoustic gigs. - Instruments: just my own - Years playing: composer/arranger/conductor (I write at the piano and am also a certified music teacher in NY State) In my band: founder, composer, arranger, contractor, conductor. In the studio, all of the aforementioned plus executive producer, the ears and the one who decides what we eat for lunch. I write on a \"Steinway M\" to paper with a pencil and an eraser. I copy parts with a calligraphy pen using ink on paper or hire out. Still haven't learned the computer thing, \"Yes, I do. There was indeed one moment that stood out but it seems that men seem to think women are supposed to exist on the scene with the same response to the rehearsal or gig scenarios as they have. \"\"Don't take it personally\"\" when something seems off the mark, or \"\"not nice\"\" or when faced with unacceptable behavior from colleagues. Regardless of the playing opportunities or pre-conceived thoughts regarding a particular woman player or band leader, there is an underlying dynamic that has been that of \"\"the boys' club\"\" forever. Women think, view things and respond differently. We are allowed to think, see and respond as we do and if we see something as unacceptable and we say it, it doesn't mean we're \"\"emotional.\"\" It means we see things as we see them. Period. It's time men started dealig with that. In my dealings I have experienced piano players (in my rehearsals of my own music) instruct me as to something they perceive being wrong with one of my voicings. When I asked him to just let it go, that I would have a look later I was told \"\"I'm just trying to do my job.\"\" Well, from my perspective, as the composer, arranger, conductor, contractor, roadie and stage manager, I believe finding and fixing voicings is my job and I believe I have earned the right to take care of that task in the way that makes me the most comfortable. The first time I ever dealt with this it was because I was functioning as producer of a very big memorial concert for a well known arranger, a mentor of mine. I was rehearsing some of his charts with a well known jazz orchestra. The band members were long time acquaintances of mine, yet it seemed to me that although I was the person in charge of all the decisions and making everything run smoothly as per the widow's wishes, some of them just didn't respect my position. This manifested in a few different ways which I don't wish to cite for professional reasons. There are other stories but I would be fearful of disclosing them, as this industry is so precariously balanced as we all try to work with friends and acquaintances. A strange thing perhaps common only to the performing arts...not sure.\" \"I know my mother, Phyllis Terrazzano Brown studied with Lennie Tristano right along side of my father, Ted Brown, Warne Marsh, Lee Konitz, Sal Mosca and on the scene with he close friend Sheila Jordan. I know that few women chose to put themselves out there, particularly as instrumentalists. Perhaps they were accustomed to allowing the men their \"\"space,\"\" I don't know. It has seemed to me that my mother's generation seems to maintain a \"\"don't make any waves\"\" perspective, while I can't seem to hold my tongue when I see something as wrong. I also know that my 25 year old, brilliant writing student, who also plays alto and flut, experiences an steady \"\"attitude\"\" from her male peers and that the men still make snide locker room comments amongst themselves about their female peers. She has told me about overhearing such comments from musicians who I consider my peers, not hers. While this sort of thing bothers her personally, this specific behavior doesn't phase me much. It's the stuff I mentioned before that makes the social aspect of following one's calling as a woman in music, specifically jazz, a challenging endeavor. I probably said too much...\" All the men keep telling me to keep doing what I'm doing and eventually it will pay off. Trombonist Luis Bonilla took me aside once when I was distraught over feeling as though I had not been treated with appropriate respect. He said, \"Screw them! You're Anita Brown! You have to stop giving them so much respect and give them some of their own crap!\" I think my great aunt bought me a 2-octave tiny, white grand piano for my first birthday. Can't remember ever being introduced to the piano keyboard. My mother, grandmother, great aunt, great uncle in an extended household all played piano. - Instruments: The Cathi Walkup Quintet, Walkup & Backup, Blue Swing, Burns Zannini, Sentimental Journey, Almost Famous, Cathi Walkup & Shanna Carlson - Years playing: vocals I'm the leader but like an atmosphere of collaboration and want everyone to bring something to the party - and I've been blessed to work with musicians who usually do. I see \"marketing\" per se as another way to be creative. SM87(C) condenser mic, Sennheiser 835 dynamic mic, hybrid (Countryman) headset wireless mic and the attendant accoutrement that goes with that. I think there used to be more opportunities for men than women, but I feel that is changing. I think most musicians are interested in playing with the best musicians they can and gender takes a back seat to that. I would certainly hope so. Each generation brings their own take to every aspect of their generation and that, in my opinion, is as it should be. I do hope that they would have respect for and interest in what came before them and I would also hope the same for my generation in dealing with the generations who come after. Teachers should not only teach but also learn from the students as well. \"When I was starting out a wonderful piano player let me come to his house every Wednesday for a year or more. He helped me get charts together, taught me a lot and played for me to sing and worked with me on gigs. I didn't realize at the time how very generous this was. I've always felt an obligation to pay this forward and try to help others when I can. I would say to never stop learning, to learn your instrument from the ground up and know that music is communication, Learn to communicate on every level with other musicians. Always remember it's the journey and not the destination. Life is like a lottery. Everyone gets a chunk of time, nobody knows how much. What you choose to do with your time determines the quality of your life. Don't forget to have fun.\" I've always been drawn to sing and my mother sang around the house when I was a child so it was always something I thought of as totally accessible. Music is magic and can heal. I discovered early that it could uplift and make me feel better and later learned it could also do that for others. - Instruments: two, Retarted elf and Scorpio Rising - Years playing: vocals and moves \"I am the front woman, the singer as well wear a lot of hats. Our band does everything, we don't get much outside help. I fund our studio, always in on the mix of our recordings for approval. Sometimes I will help engineer Wonderbred while he records his parts. The marketing is always in my lap. Both Wonderbred and I manage all our social networking sites for marketing, we both work on the art for posters ect..Wonderbred is the master of the studio though.\" We are an elctronica band with live drums, bass and guitar with backing tracks. All backing tracks are our original works. \"In a few ways, people treat you different knowing you are the front woman, but I have gotten some bad treatment thinking I am a groupie...that pisses me off. some people are infatuated with Fem fronts as well some think woman just can't rock...It doesn't really matter to me...just being in a band makes for different treatment no matter the gender..most people seems to not respect musicians overall...like it is a bottom feeder choice. They have no idea how much work goes into creating and maintaining a band.\" \"Get a job. If you are in a band or doing it for yourself you and other members better have a job. There will be many expenses to pay. Practice faculty, tour transpo van, gas, food, instrument repairs, adding instruments, trailer, keeping your travel van up on maintenance, registration, inspection, van insurance, advertising, flyers, give always, tshirts, all your merch, legal advice...many many tings that need to be paid for. If no one in the band has a huge bank roll...get a job! If it comes down to having to quit your job because your music is taking off so well, that is great...but it will probably not happen. It is best that you wear all the hats, no one else will have your bets interest except yourself...don't trust anyone.. so \"\"get a job\"\" and \"\"don't trust anyone\"\" is my advice, along with grow a thick skin...you're under the spot light and people have their opinions. On the same note...having a job helps with a bank account to pay medical expenses. I was diagnosed with breast cancer Oct 16 2009. Fortunately I have a full time job with great insurance, even though the co-pays are kicking my butt at this time, I have no idea what I would have done with out the insurance. i know for a fact my treatments would not be the same. I am in my 5th chemo treatment with one more to go. I had a mastectomy and will go through a couple more surgeries to finish up the reconstruction already in progress. We are playing SXSW showcase at the Ghost Room 304 west 4th str. on Thursday, March 18th at 7pm sharp! Austin Texas in the warehouse district.\" It was destiny to be a front woman. - Instruments: About 4, but you don't wanna know their names...local teenbands... - Years playing: Vocals, guitar, keyboards, percussion I write a lot of songs on my own, sometimes we compose together too. In the studio it's just Dan & I recording one another, playing different instruments, trying out things. I give a lot of directions as for the arrangements, but Dan's the one to finish the songs. We have the same amount of work, and are very complementary. Then, though i'm learning a lot, i'm still not business-minded, there are things i just won't understand. Lady Gaga is way ahead. \"At the studio, we have tons of different instruments: the usual ones such as acoustic and electric guitars, bass guitars, loads of vintage keyboards, but also a harpsichord, a Finnish Kantele, a Turkish saaz, kitchen pans and pots, drums, etc. On stage I've played on an American Fender Stratocaster, with 3 or 4 different effects- mostly distortion. I also played on a Gretsch duo jet reissue, which I love. Also some wurlitzer and some Farfisa. I sang in a Sennheiser e945, and I had a multieffect pedal, Boss vocal 300. But i am trying out new gear now...the whole set is gonna change for our second tour!\" What bothered me mostly was that I was the only girl on the road, on the bus, the technical team was all boys. I asked the tour managers to find at least one girl for the team, but we so are outnumbered in those jobs. It's just tough to be a woman on a tourbus, considering the hygiene, the intimacy, etc...You end up acting like a boy! I can't see much more of a difference otherwise, you obviously meet some guys who don't take you seriously when it comes to technical issues, but never when it comes to artistic matters. \" Make your own path and may others follow you there!\" \"Because no one could play as clumsily as me! I started playing classical guitar when I was 12, but i never thought i could play and sing at the same time. I liked to focus on one or the other. When we started rehearsing as The Do, we looked for guitarists, but they were all trying too hard, they were too skilful... And we were in such a hurry, we had a gig in like two weeks, that i just had to pick the guitar and handle the problem. It wasnt easy, but i made it, and i even enjoyed it. Then I play the keys for fun, to change a little, but it's more Dan's instrument.\" - Instruments: Kitten Forever, Daisy's Compact Mice, Pocket Pussy - Years playing: Drums In Kitten Forever we all usually make our decisions pretty unanimously. We are all about sisterhood is powerful and that kind of shit so we are a team. If one of us doesn't like something, then it just doesn't happen. I have the van and that's about it as far as my designated responsibility. But we just record in basements and don't do anything as far as marketing decisions really. Only for our most recent 7\" did we go to Old Blackberry Way Studios in Dinkytown to record with Neil Weir of The Chambermaids because a vinyl record costs a lot of money right? We wanted it to sound good. Everything is just all about having fun and making sure we are always having a good time with whatever band related thing we do, because otherwise, what's the point? I play a super minimal drum kit, kick drum, floor tom, snare, and crash cymbal. It's the kit I learned how to play on when I was 15 and it always just seemed like all you really needed. One of the main things that happens to me at almost every show that makes me realize the gender difference will always be an issue is when inevitably some guy comes up to me after we're done and says this: \"Wow that was awesome. You know, you're actually a really good drummer!\" I mean, thanks I guess, but the word \"actually\" is such a strange thing. And the compliment in itself is also sort of backhanded. The word actually implies that at first, you didn't think I would be good, and now you are pleasantly surprised. Why would someone think that I wonder? I have never seen anyone go up to a male drummer, especially one that plays as simple and straight forward punk rock beats as I do, and say \"You are ACTUALLY a really good drummer.\" For men, it's just a default given that they will probably be good at their instruments if they are up on that stage. When they are adept at playing, no one thinks twice, because that is the status quo. But when girls get up there, and can play, and do so in a non-conventional way, it's always going to be super surprising to someone. i think the main difference now with women in this generation is that we have been brought up in an artistic world that is third and post-third wave. We don't have the same kind of primal struggle that women before us had and now it seems almost that \"women in music\" has become just another commodity to market. That is the dark side to any kind of revolution it seems; the best way to disarm it is to co-opt it and market it back to the masses, starting with Spice Girls for us and onwards. So now, our generation has to figure out how to navigate these new waters where a lot of the time, it seems like success can come to women because there's a price tag to be put on it. I'm not saying that the over exposure of female artists is bad, but there's a lot of people out there now discussing this \"new wave of post riot grrrl bands\" but I think there's a danger to be found in that. Riot Grrrl before us had a message, it had a political stance and stood for something. Now we are riding the wave of riot grrrl but I'm not sure what the new fourth wave of women in music is going to stand for. Each generation needs a voice, and so far none has emerged triumphant from ours that I can really get behind. (Don't get me wrong, I love Lady Gaga, but I'm just not sure if I want KeSha to be the new voice of women in music.) Our generation in general is one of marketing, not just for women in music, but for men as well and for all other aspects of our society, the arts, politics, and otherwise. This will be the difference with our generation I believe, to discover how we make something new and vital and engaging in a world of blogs that tell us what the hot new single is to download from an artist whose album we won't need to buy, and the 24 hour news cycle that exists to sell advertising time so we can buy \"NOW That's What I Call Music 103\". \"When I first started playing music in the suburbs, there were no other women there doing the same thing to point me in any direction. I had to make it up as I went along, and I think that that's some of the best advice I could give to any lady, woman, or girl looking to start a band. Don't worry about it and just say Fuck It. Do whatever you want because what's important is just that you are DOING IT and don't let anyone's reactions or negativity get you down.\"\"Making your way in the music industry\"\" is not nearly as important as making sure you are able to do something that you love. If you love to play music, then play it. Organize shows with your friends and record albums on cassette players and distribute them yourself. We can make our own music industries for ourselves instead of figuring out how the \"\"correct\"\" way to function within an already fucked system is. I had to look to women from past movements to influence me and get me going. The best thing I ever read as a 15 year old girl was Kathleen Hanna's \"\"Riot Grrrl Manifesto\"\". It changed my life so I guess that's my concrete advice, read that. And listen to Patti Smith. http://www.feastofhateandfear.com/archives/hanna.html\" No one I was friends with knew how to play drums, and I certainly didn't know any girl drummers at the time. I had played guitar in another band previously and never really liked being up front on the stage, having to put on a show or something. Really, we wanted to start a band, and one of us could sing, and one could play guitar or bass, so I just said, \"I will play the drums!\" Whether or not I knew how to didn't seem like that big of a deal at the time. - Instruments: many! most recently, Dertonnz, American Gladiators UK, Jenifer Jackson + her Secret Agents - Years playing: vocals, guitar, piano, drums band leader, writer, arranger, booker, etc. i do it all since i am a solo artist with revolving band members. \"1964 Epiphone Caballero guitar tuner\" \"all along, i have been the minority, usually surrounded by lots of male musicians, club owners, record label owners, PR people. when i was 20, i lived and worked in italy as a singer, and had many instances where male co-workers would come on to me. later, in NYC, signed to a label, i often felt i was very emotionally effected by the business men's actions/decisions/ways of communicating with me. perhaps if i were a man, they would not have tried to control my decisions?\" the younger generation of female musicians seem a bit more business-oriented and pro-active. this may just be the personalities of the specific younger musicians i know & work with now. the changing business seems less structured, and therefore, more open to any gender. do it for the love of music. \"my dad plays guitar & growing up, we always had his guitars around. my parents bought an old piano when i was a baby & i also began to play that, since it was in our living room! drums i began later when a boyfriend moved his kit into my living room. i have always sang!\" - Instruments: This House/ Emerald Sun/Fruit/ Mel Watson solo/ Corbin & Mel - Years playing: Vocal, Trumpet, Saxophone, Guitar, Tenor Horn, Flute, Percussion \"I play solo and with my duo partner who is a virtuoso cellist named Corbin Keep. I can write when ever I feel like it, I don't feel like I have to turn on any creative faucet. I feel it is always there, at any time. We write together. I have my own little studio and have recorded my last two releases from there. I run a little independent label called 100th Monkey Records. I make and release my own music. I also book for a couple of other artists non exclusively. I create projects for example the last one i did was called Compassionism. A compilation album created to raise awareness of animal cruelty. 100% of the profits going to PETA. \" Takamine Acoustic Guitar,Yamaha Trumpet, an old Lyon Healy Soprano Sax, Yamaha Flute, Werl Tenor Horn, various percussion pieces. I use a mac set up to record my own music. \"Yes I think there is probably a difference, but I prefer to contemplate the similarities. When you go beyond the surface of a musician, man or woman, dive beyond the person, the personality, all the stuff that is on the surface, and dive into the heart of a musician, that is the place where you find the most precious of gifts. It is that place, that when expressed through sound, connects us on levels that are unable to be expressed with such intensity in any other way. To me music is the most powerful art form and there is no difference between the heart of a male or female musician. \" I think women musicians of the past had a battle to be able to be a musician more so than women do now. But I can say, that when you have the burning desire inside, it doesn't matter, you just do it. I did. \"I had boundless support from my music teacher, and my parents. My father said \"\"it's all about the marketing and management.....\"\" I didn't take his advice, but he was right. i was interested in making my own way, and finding my own path. Be you. This is the most valuable advice I would give any one starting out. I want to hear what you have to say, not what you think I want to hear. :)\" \"I love making music, and so I try to play the sounds I hear. Trumpet was my first instrument, I loved the dynamic range of the instrument. I used to love playing loud, now I am appreciating the softer qualities of the horn. :)\" - Instruments: I put my own units together each weekend and they are always different. - Years playing: vocalist and a little piano I am usually the leader, but I do get hired by other musicians. I did a great deal of studio work in the 70s and early 80s. I was hired by other producers. I handle all my own marketing. I own Bose speakers both 802s and 402s. Have a Mackie mixer, a Walter Woods amplifier, a Lexicon reverb unit. A tri-cart to transport gear. I also own an electric piano. Yes, I do think it's different for a woman in the music industry. I believe we have to work a little harder to gain respect and attention. Often we are judged by are looks more often than men. I also feel that sometimes men (in general) whether they are musicians or agents, or club owners think they can take advantage of a woman's softer side. I can only speak for my generation. But I would guess with each new generation, it gets easier. At least I hope that's the case. Yes, I was given advice at an early age. It was ... know the exact melody, honor the composer, work hard, etc. I feel that there is no better training than live performance. I resent shows like American Idol making fun of hotel and wedding musicians. This is where artists gain experience. I'm willing to bet that every musician in the band on American Idol worked hotels, clubs and weddings at one time or another. My parents chose the piano for me. I chose to sing and study when I was old enough to pay for the lessons myself. - Instruments: two. Imperial Teen and my teenage all girl punk band, The Wrecks - Years playing: bass, guitar, vocals \"We are a very democratic band. We all do it all. I do handle all our \"\"business\"\" right now as we are self managed at the moment\" \"I play an Ernie Ball MusicMan Bass I also play a Gretch hollowbody guitar\" No so much. I remember back in the olden days I would get interviewed about being in an all girl band and even as a 14 year old I said an E minor is an E minor whether its played by a boy or a girl.... go for it. Well as a pre teen in the late 70's early 80's I was really into Saturday Night Live. At that time it was one of the only places to see current happening music being performed plus it was just so funny and cool...anyway I clearly remember seeing the Talking Heads on SNL and saw Tina Weymouth playing a guitar ( I thought it was guitar at the time) I had NEVER seen a girl playing an instrument in a rock band before!! My best friend and I decided then and there to do it too. We formed our all girl band The Wrecks soon after recruiting some girls from school one of whom was Lynn Perko who amazingly I AM STILL IN A BAND WITH 21 YEARS LATER. Weird. I played guitar back then but play bass in Imperial Teen now, mostly. We do trade instruments around... - Instruments: This is my first one - Years playing: I sing, and play keyboards I work with my band on coming up with melodies, harmony's, and the overall structure of the song. I also make sure to make our shows visually appealing to our audience. I love when bands make an effort to put on a show and not just stand there, it's extremely important to me. I play a Roland Juno-D, beat up old floor toms, and sing. Yes there is definitely a difference. It has its ups and down, especially if you are in a band with all guys, people treat you differently. They might pay more attention to what the men have to say and disregard my input, while others embrace it. I've had people think I was just \"the girlfriend\" of the band before, but I love being the only woman in the band. I think more and more women are becoming a big role in the music society. I see a lot more women musicians on the cover of magazines and taking over the rock music scene than before. \"Someone said once to not care about how people react to your music or what they write. Not everyone will like it and there will always be people who will say negative things and that's okay. I try not to pay too much attention to reviews. As for advice to women, as cheesy as this sounds, you have to be yourself. Don't let anyone tell you what you have to look like or sound like to be successful. \" I've always loved to sing and perform , I've been singing since I can remember. I cant imagine doing anything else at this point, it has always come naturally. - Instruments: only mine - Years playing: Vocals I am the lead performer. I make all of the business/marketing decisions as a solo independent artist. Sometimes, I don't feel as respected during business/financial negotiations. After they see me perform and know I'm serious and professional, that seems to change! I think each generation gets more creative and bold by the groundwork that previous female musicians have laid. Yes, a teacher once told me you have to make your own gigs. You have to go out and perform anywhere they will let you. Then decide where you want to perform and pursue those venues. When you can't find a venue to plug into, create your own event. Volunteer to play at a fundraiser or start a fund-raising event that you can be a part of as an entertainer. It's one way to get yourself out there and heard. People have always responded positively when I perform and I enjoy entertaining them! - Instruments: 1, Pearl Harbor - Years playing: Vocals, bass I sing, play bass, program the drums, and come up with the keyboard parts. My sister is 15, so I pretty much call the shots as far as business goes. My sister has a nice gold glitter '69 taesco guitar, I have a pretty boring standard black fender p-bass, a pretty aged yamaha keyboard for psychedelic sounds & drums, roland sp-404 sampler. I don't really think in terms of gender when it comes to making art. Personally I like to look at this as an ongoing world-beautification project that everyone has a stake in, regardless of age, gender, upbringing, etc. Yeah, I think that the 60s-90s provided us with female Superstars in all genres, I.e. Diana Ross, Grace Slick, Janis Joplin, Madonna.. female figureheads in music used to exist. You don't really see that anymore, because the world is moving too fast for anyone to really latch onto anybody. It's hard to say what's valuable and what isn't this early on, but I'm sure we'll know pretty soon! Well, my sister plays guitar, and we kind of needed the other instruments to write songs, haha. - Instruments: just mine: Rykarda Parasol - Years playing: Voice, electric guitar, piano I am the songwriter, front woman, and overall boss lady (but nice boss lady) I play a Gibson Melody Maker and am known for my wide vocal range, which can be quite low and smokey to very high. I am most often likened to a female Nick Cave, Diamanda Gallas, Nico.... My band performs live as a 4-piece with drums heavy on the toms, bass, backing vocals, and guitar. YES! If you play serious music it can be hard to be taken seriously. What I mean is that men don't presume I can be as good or raw as them. They look at me and think I play pop music or perhaps I've a sweet voice. I give them a run for their money and that can threatening. The moment I realized this was the countless times I've been hit on and the countless times. It's quite rough out there for women YES~ the new younger male audience is far more open to female artists. The 90s was a terrible phase I think. Women were so busy trying o be men that they lost their feminity and I think that's a big mistake Be yourself. Because that is being a true artist.... but don't sleep with boys in bands. Serious. OTher boys aren't sleeping w each other and you need to be respected and play shows etc. You are only as valuable as you are rare and a women needs to stay professional along the way I want to be able to accompany myself and be able to move on stage same time - Instruments: 3....Blue Night Express, Dixie Chicks, Court Yard Hounds - Years playing: banjo, dobro, guitar, vocals In the Chicks I always tended to play the role of the soft spoken pragmatic one. I find it enjoyable to put myself out there more in Court Yard Hounds both as singer, songwriter and as a personality. In both Dixie Chicks and Court Yard Hounds we all had a hand in creating and producing the music and in managing our business affairs. If something is going to be done right, it requires involvement on all levels and in every aspect of this business. I think women are great at recognizing the importance of the details. I'm not a gear head....you'd have to ask my tech. ;) YES!!! Women have a built in guilt gene that I believe makes it harder to be away on the road. We expect ourselves (and want) to be the ones who are always there for our kids' day-to-day needs. It's a constant struggle. Maybe they just hide it better, but it seems like guys are better equipped for the long stretches away from home. Every generation has it's pioneers. The advice I got was to keep my own publishing. I did....BUT...with the music industry changing so quickly, I'm not sure it's really the cash cow it once was. The internet has changed everything. If I meet a young girl who is interested in music and asks my advice, I suggest she learn an instrument. There will always be a lot of great voices out there and not only will playing set her apart, it will allow her to accompany herself if she does want to sing. Playing in bands, doing gigs and just generally getting experience on stage (before trying to \"make it\") will always be a great way to prepare. Banjo was my first serious instrument and I picked it because I didn't see any other girls playing it at the time. - Instruments: The Gypsy Moths, Raina Rose, Raina Rose Trio, SQUINTO - Years playing: guitar, mandolin, vocals, percussion I am the captain of my own ship in most ways. I lead the band, i book the shows, i make all the business decisions. However, i have recently put together a trio and the bass player and i have started sharing some of that responsibility, which is incredibly nice. I'd love help from a booking agent or a manager, but i'm only going to hand over that role to someone who is truly dedicated to what i do. \"1980's shure SM 59 vocal mic custom made Bayard Blain acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup mid-missouri brand mandolin (i'd love a nicer one) a hardware store bucket with a strap and brushes (makes a great drum)\" Absolutely. I have done a lot of touring with male musicians and have had this conversation quite a few times. When someone wants to compliment a man who plays guitar they say \"Wow, you're a great guitar player\" I have heard this \"compliment\" more times than i care to admit \"You are the best female guitar player i've heard\". I understand they were meaning to compliment me, but what they are doing is saying \"my expectations for your guitar skills were low!\" and the fact that i'm a woman comes before the fact that i play guitar in the sentence. It really bugs me. I also think there is more focus on a female musician's appearance than a male musician's appearance. You have to be pretty BEFORE you have to be talented. It's still thought of as a boy's game. I think there were fewer female musicians in generations. I also think they had fewer role models than we do now as the gap between the sexes in terms of profession closes. I am sure i had more women to look up to then say, Joni Mitchell or Bonnie Rait, both incredible and well respected musicians. I also think Ani DiFranco's commitment to running her own empire has opened many doors for all of us wanting to not be taken advantage or in terms of her music/art. \"i would say that music is the most important and rewarding and most difficult thing i have done in my life so far. The blessings it has brought me and the lessons it has afforded me are absolutely priceless. Quit your job! Believe in the fact that the music and art you make can in fact make the world a more perfect place. thank you for asking these questions and I'd love to talk more about this kind of thing. Feel free to get a hold of me xoxo raina rose 503 380-4547 raina@rainarose.com\" i adore the acoustic guitar. I always have. My dad is a guitar player (he has a degree in the history of country and western music from UCSC) and they were never off limits when i was a kid. I took piano lessons for a year in 2nd grade. hated it. Then tried cello, i wasn't great. Then tried saxophone, that was beyond me. Then i started taking guitar when i was 11 years in 6th grade. I loved it. I stopped doing my homework and pretty much spent my afternoons playing guitar. It is like an extra limb. - Instruments: numerous - freelance and direct my own - Years playing: viola da gamba Director, President of organization a French Baroque bass viol by Judith Kraft, a six string bass viol by John Pringle, a French Baroque treble viol by Michael Heale, a Kessler treble viol, a lirone by John Pringle, and a pardessus de viole by Guersan (1754) Yes. There are plenty of women musicians, but few women musical leaders (especially who are respected). No. Yes. So much of music making is about interactions between musicians (and between the musicians and the audience). Behave professionally and practice! Always evaluate what it will take to make you happy. Being a musician is a big struggle. If it is too much of a struggle to provide fulfillment, look for other outlets that will contribute to that end... I found my voice in this instrument. - Instruments: Lycia - Years playing: vocals I'm the singer and lyric writer for the songs I sing on. I am an equal partner in making any decisions regarding marketing etc. I do not do the recording for Lycia, but I do when I'm doing solo projects. Ibanez guitars, Kawai Synth, Acid 4.0, Anwida FX, Digitech, Boss, GSP fx I don't really believe so. I think you have to be aggressive in this business male or female...weakness is the thing that holds you back and gets you manipulated by users. I don't personally believe it has anything to do with gender. No. I believe there are those that take charge of their own careers and those that are puppets and it's always been that way. Follow your own path and never compromise. I'm a singer - Instruments: Lovespirals is my main band, but I also collaborate with The Grooveblaster regularly and am collaborating with other artists including Nick Murray, Falling You, Karmacoda, and TwiztedNation on new songs coming out this year. - Years playing: Vocals, sampling, programming, production Not only am I the lyricist, vocalist, and vocal arranger in Lovespirals, but I am the front person and the band member that makes most of the decisions regarding release and promotion of our music. I am the one who spends long hours at the computer adding our music and images to various sites on the internet, updates our band site, reaches out to podcasters, broadcasters, bloggers, and other musicians, and I'm even the one that creates the band artwork, retouches and edits band photos, etc. In the studio we share productions duties, though my partner - Ryan Lum - actually tracks our music and plays the instruments. The bulk of the composition is his doing, but with my input and vocal arrangement. I have always been more of a studio musician and recording artist than a live performance one, though I do perform live from time to time. I own many mics including a vintage Neumann, and a whole host of gear for recording in my own home studio. I actually have two studios, one for podcasting/vidcasting, and the other for music. Yes, people don't hold women and men to the same standard musically, or expect them to be equal in talent. Women musicians are often judged more on their looks than their skills. Keeping to my own forte as a woman vocalist, the biggest difference I see with the new generation is that women are relying more on pitch correction software and harmonizing effects than vocal skills. I grew up in an era when people still sang naturally and composed their own harmonies. From my perspective, the most important thing is to develop a strong internet presence that includes quality audio, video, and photos. The more professional you come across, the more likely people are to take you seriously. I personally wouldn't rely on gimmicks to get attention, but that seems to be working out for Lady Gaga, so who am I to say anything against it? I used to play guitar, and attempted piano and keyboards, but the truth is that I just wasn't very skilled at it. Particularly when performing live, it was best for me to simply focus on singing. I've always had a natural talent for singing and poetry, so spending more time on those skills have been much more satisfying than struggling with instruments. - Instruments: The Pandoras, The Muffs, The Beards - Years playing: Vocals/Guitars I am the lead singer/lead guitar/producer/songwriter and co Gretsch BST guitar, Fender Vibrolux amp, Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal. \"I've always been a woman and have no other experience from which to draw from. I imagine being a woman guarantees a different vibe for the band than being a man does, but it's me and 2 guys and we all kinda rock out.\" I really don't know. Again, I'm sort of in my own world. The ladies from the 60's didn't usually write their own songs. At least not that I know of. Don't get a manager. Do it yourself. Be true to your vision and be strong. I love the guitar and that is why I play it. "}
