A homeopathic practitioner must study a minimum four years post graduate, including a clinical internship. Originating with the work of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in the 1700s, homeopathy is the second largest practiced medicine in the world. It is capable of resolving disease and dysfunction in the body by understanding the cause and determining the exact remedies that will work to eradicate the person's problem. It is highly effective and cost-efficient, and safe for everyone, infants, children, and seniors. The remedies have no side-effects, nor do they counter the action of any life-sustaining pharmaceutical drugs. Homeopathy is effective in all types of health issues ranging from infant and childhood illnesses, male/female issues, mental health and chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis, cardiac issues, neurological issues, skin problems such as herpes and acne and is highly effective in acute cases such as the common cold, influenza, ear infections and childhood ailments such as chicken pox.

The initial consultation is 90 minutes and during that time your total health situation from what your chief complaint is assessed. That is called taking the totality of the case and it is crucial if the most effective remedy is to be prescribed. Depending on your situation usually you would follow up in two-three weeks to determine how well the remedy is working for you and if any adjustments need to be made. "}
