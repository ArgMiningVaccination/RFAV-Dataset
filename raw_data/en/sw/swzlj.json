Reiki Master Practitioner. Intuitive. Doctor of Naturopathy Student. Former Registered Nurse. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a doctor. It has always made me feel so good to help and support others, so I wanted to make a career of it. After high school I went on to take two years of Pre-Med courses, before changing course and enrolling in nursing school. I graduated from Ferris State University with my Bachelor's in Nursing in 2012. Five months after graduation I gave birth to my first child, a little girl, and my whole world changed! Just a short year after having our first daughter, my husband and I welcomed another sweet baby girl into our family. I was blessed with the opportunity to stay home and raise my girls, while working as an RN on and off. My number one job was being a mother, everything else followed. After having children, something deep inside me had changed. I no longer took the word of others. I wanted and needed to know every little detail about my children's health. This included the best way to feed and nourish them, ways to love and guide them in a gentle manner, what things were safe for them, what wasn't...and so much more. Sherlock Holmes "}
