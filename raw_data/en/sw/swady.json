We are keenly aware of your tenure at FIU both as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration and most recently as Interim President. We would like to know more about your Higher Education history prior to FIU . Page 17 of 36Florida International University Board of Trustees Minutes October 17 , 2022 Page | 3 2. FIU is a leading Hispanic Serving Institution and diversity, equity, and inclusion are important core values of our university. What is your commitment to these values and how will you ensure that we maintain this commitment at FIU? 3. The labor participation rate in the United States is about the worst it has ever been. There are approximately seven million men between the ages of 25 and 45 years old that are no longer looking for work or seeking employment. What role do higher institut ions play in analyzing that and finding out if there is a problem? 4. Fundraising for a university president is probably his primary job. You have been here a long time and have watched other people do it. How would you do it differently? 5. With the benefit of your experience of serving our institution, what do you believe is our biggest challenge in managing our budget and how do you plan to address that as the University's president? 6. As you are aware, we have a goal of being a top 50 public university. We understand the importance of research in the ranking and reputation of our institution. As President, how would you go about furthering the research mission of our University? 7. Describe a situation in your professional life when you were unsuccessful , or even failed completely , and what you learned from that experience. 8. FIU strives to be a truly student -centered University , and we are dedicated to making the student experience as rich and as robust as possible. How have you interacted with students and what will you do to enhance student life? 9. As you know, international is our middle name and I am an international student m yself. International students carry experience s and challenges in a number of areas, including language barriers, academic, social, cultural, financial, and mental health concerns. What are you plans to ensure that international students have a welcoming e nvironment as they transition from a completely different background and that they receive a first -class education? 10. Based on your tenure at FIU in multiple roles, what do you perceive to be the appropriate role of athletics at FIU? 11. As a public inst itution, it is important for FIU to maintain constructive relationships with the Florida Board of Governors, legislature, federal delegation, and local and state officials. Will you be comfortable continuing to represent and promote the University to these audiences? 12. Fundraising is a difficult activity. Does FIU have the right organizational structures in place? 13. In -person instruction versus online , what are your thoughts on that? 14. During this process that you have gone through as Interim University President, I am sure that there have been many tribulations . There have been, I am certain, one or two occasions where you Page 18 of 36Florida International University Board of Trustees Minutes October 17 , 2022 Page | 4 stand in front of the mirror, and you go to a comfort area that gives you confidence and I would like for you to share one or two of those things that make you uniquely qualified to be the president of our U niversity. 15. Two of the most valued principles in higher education are shared governance and academic freedom. Please share your thoughts on these core values and how they will be part of your tenure should you be selected to be the sixth President of FIU.

Mr. Funk commented that , in past years , university presidents were undercompensated when taking certain factors such as enrollment , faculty, and staff into account . He added that wit hin the last decade, presidential salaries seem to have become more realistic.

Trustee Marc D. Sarnoff advocated for a higher compensation package that w ould be over the $1,000,000 threshold. Board Vice Chair Tovar mentioned that , while he concurred that Dr. Jessell was worthy of said amount, the Board of Trustees can revisit the President's compensation package at a later time should additional state funding be secured. He added that the proposed compensation package recognizes University faculty and staff that have not received increases in numerous years. Trustee Carlos A. Duart concurred with Trustee Sarnoff. The Board of Trustees r eview ed the executive compensation analysis, and a motion was made and passed that the Florida International University Board of Trustees set the compensation as presented and recommended by Board Vice Chair Roger Tovar to be used in negotiating the presidential contract with University Pre sident -Elect Dr. Kenneth A.

Consistent with the BOG's amendment to Regulation 1.001, the proposed amendments to the Bylaws of the BOT include the removal of the reference in the Bylaws that the Florida International University P resident shall se rve as the Corporate Secretary of the Florida International University B oard of Trustees (BOT ) and other related amendments . The amendments propose that the BOT Chair, in consultation with the University President, shall select a University employee to serve as the Corporate Secretary.
