When stress starts to become overwhelming, it can negatively impact our health, causing issues ranging from tension and depressed mood to weight gain and sleeplessness. Unfortunately, many people seeking relief from the effects of stress are steered toward temporary \"band aid\" solutions. This doesn't allow their bodies to repair and maintain the systems that are desperately in need of maintenance and rebalancing. The physician who created HPA Balance took a different approach. He discovered that by promoting balance in your HPA axis, you can maintain a calm state of mind and manage your stress in a healthful way. How HPA Balance Works The unique herbal combination offered by HPA Balance works synergistically to maintain normal hormonal balance and adrenal function, naturally.* It starts at the root of your system imbalance and helps promote the body's ability to handle stress. A key ingredient that makes this possible is the extract of an herb called ashwagandha. Ashwagandha is one of only a handful of herbs that are considered to be adaptogenic. Adaptogens have unique natural qualities that: - Promote nervous and endocrine system stability* - Modulate immune function* - Support mitochondrial function in the face of stress* The Sensoril\u00ae ashwagandha used in HPA Balance is a full-spectrum standardized extract that delivers reliable potency from one batch to the next. That reliability reduces the number of capsules needed while providing optimal benefit. Combining ashwagandha with Relora tree bark extracts and L-theanine provides a number of benefits, including improved focus and concentration, better quality sleep, and more balanced moods.* \"This is definitely helping with my stress levels.

It completely wiped out those symptoms AND apparently many more bc I've not ever had terrible or stressful mood swings since starting HPA-Balance and I have to say it's got to be bc of that. We I'm now in full menopause and I'm always excited to tell my friends who are struggling about this amazing product bc it changed my life for the better-so much. I've not been sleeping great lately, and read one review that said she was having the same problem and started taking her first 2 after noon and then her second 2 at bedtime which helped solve her sleeping issues, so I'm going to try that and hopefully report back with good results! Thank you for creating such a fantastic product to help me. I'm truly, forever grateful! Fantastic Balance Truly is helping me find the hormonal balance I needed for my continued healing process! Relaxing HPA Balance did not help me at first, so after a couple weeks I gave up. But then I decided to try again a few weeks later, and for some reason, the second try proved helpful. When I start feeling stressed, it calms me, and if I remember to take it every day, I stay fairly calm, but sometimes I need it twice a day. Thank you. Very supportive to me as I strive for better nervous system health. Two capsules every morning and I am good to go. Recently, while traveling I realized I'd forgotten to pack enough of my HPA to maintain my two per am ritual. I noticed after a day or two that I simply lost my umpf, nodded out more easily even though I'd had a good night sleep. HPA balance. Don't leave home without it. "}
