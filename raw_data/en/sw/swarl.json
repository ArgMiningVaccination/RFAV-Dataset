It's not really an issue if we judge it like this but the question about essential oils versus pharmaceutical drugs still remains. We're going to talk about the ground win that Aromatherapy managed to score in recent years against traditional medicine. We're also going to break down how you can create a home kit based on essential oils and talk about the health benefits these amazing substances have. Aromatherapy essential oils vs. pharmaceutical drugs Pharmaceutical drugs and Aromatherapy oils have different effects on our body. Drugs usually infiltrate our bodies while having a toxic effect but essential oils on the other hand have a detoxifying effect. Pharmaceutical drugs are not really able to provide clear information for receptor sites while oils actually perform the right operations for the receptors. Drugs usually don't provide any coverage for the immune system while oils are constantly trying to provide strength. For example, antibiotics will battle both good and bad bacteria, but essential oils will only battle the bad ones, allowing our body to maintain a strong immune system. Drugs are chemically designed to have tunnel vision, programmed to carry their actions to a certain part of our body without being aware of how much damage they do to the rest of the body. Essential oils on the other hand work on more than one area of our body and despite being utilized for a specific treatment, they won't provoke any type of damage. When our body condition changes, essential oils are able to perform different actions while adapting to our blood pressure if necessary, stimulating enzyme activity if needed or energizing and relaxing our bodies if necessary. Basically, pharmaceutical drugs were created to send information to our cells or to block certain receptors from feeling anything while tricking our body to give up the symptoms of a disease. Drugs rarely cure the issue while most of the times giving comfort or relief from certain symptoms. On the other hand, oils are able to communicate with our cells and our receptors in order to bring our body to its natural balance and to heal disease. Essential oils were meant to address the cause of our disease by reprogramming all the wrong causes. Drugs misinform the body to offer temporary relief of symptoms, but true healing may never be obtained by using classic therapy only. Essential oils come with no side effects if applied properly and are designed to treat our bodies, instead of relieving temporary pain while damaging another area. | | Organic Aromatherapy products vs. Pharmaceutical drugs | | Essential oils | | Pharmaceutical drugs | | 1.Properties | | 1.Properties | | Obtained through natural methods or grown organically under severe care and a trustworthy processes Made by nature | | Obtained in the lab, produced industrially, synthetic; chemically or genetically engineered Man-made | | Hundreds of benefic constituents | | One or two constituents included | | 2.Effects and consequences | | 2.Effects and consequences | | Restore natural functions without any adverse reactions | | Inhibits natural functions and often provokes unwanted side effects | | Antiviral | | Usually not antiviral | | Improves communication between cells | | Disrupts communication between cells | | Restores proper cellular memory and corrects the information | | Often doesn't restore cellular memory | | Clears receptor sites | | Blocks receptors sites | | Helps to restore and build the immune system | | Often depresses the immune system | | Balances us emotionally; helps us find our natural balance | | Often unbalances us emotionally and rarely helps us find any balance | | Beneficial side effects | | Often harmful side effects | | Leads to wellness without causing dependency | | Often causes dependence and chronic diseases | | 3.Paradigm | | 3.Paradigm | | Constantly aims to create wellness as a natural state, while making us strong against disease | | Assumes natural state prone and makes us vulnerable to illnesses | | Trains the body to become self-healing | | Assumes body and mind need external assistance for healing | | Integrates the body, the mind and the soul as a unit | | Treats the body in parts, doesn't pay attention to the mind and the soul | | Builds natural defenses to prevent our bodies from getting sick again | | Only attacks one disease while lowering the symptoms | | Treats internally on the level of cellular intelligence | | Treats externally depending on symptoms Natural Aromatherapy products are now being used in regular hospitals Aromatherapy comes with many advantages for our body and we can use it for more than just one medicinal purpose.

Can classic medicine unite with Aromatherapy to create a new medical system? It can only be for the patient's benefit if this happens. We already see countries like France and the U.K. adopting Aromatherapy into classic medicine; so changing the medical system to accept natural and spiritual forms of healing can only come with great advantages for everyone involved. Many experts consider the holistic approach system while emphasizing personal responsibility and a combination of good nutrition, exercise, stress management and Aromatherapy while addressing the person physically, mentally and spiritually. A new type of medicine should emerge, one that is less dependable on pharmaceutical drugs and procedures. Doctors will also have to address the person on a mental, physical, emotional, spiritual and on an individual level to obtain results, instead of treating only the disease. This is most likely the time for medicine to take the step and base itself on different terms. We need to understand and accept the fact that essential oils can be a wonderful ally, and that these substances can treat many of the illnesses and afflictions we face on a daily basis. Traditional medicine might have its role but Aromatherapy's benefits are hard to ignore and are being embraced more and more.
