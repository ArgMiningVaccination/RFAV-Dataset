Chinese herbal medicine is a therapeutic system designed to normalize imbalanced energy, or Qi, that runs through invisible meridians in the body. Our plant-based preparations are designed to treat the underlying causes of illness rather than individual symptoms. Where do the herbs come from? At our practice, we utilize Chinese loose herb tea, powder and tablet herbal combinations, and Japanese herbal medicinals to create the optimal preparation. We use only authentic Chinese herbs that are harvested in China and imported to the USA to create our preparations. How is an herbal preparation created? After determining your diagnosis according to Traditional Chinese Medicine, we then choose from a few hundred herbs we have stocked in our office and provide them to you in an uncooked form. You will then make them into a tea by simply simmering them in water. How long does an herbal preparation last? We usually supply you with enough herbs for a week and then re-evaluate to determine if any changes are to be made in the next batch. This helps ensure you are are experiencing improvements from session to session. Is herbal medicine safe? Yes. All herbs are safe and can be very effective. There is no drowsiness associated with the herbs, and the preparations are safe to take while working, driving, caring for children, etc. Schedule an Appointment Let us bring our experience with herbal medicine to help you achieve your health goals.
