The mystery of the human being continually draws his attention and study. When his children began attending a Waldorf school 20 years ago, he was initiated into the wonder and intrigue of Anthroposophy - a philosophy of the human being as a mystery of Mind Body Soul. He spent many years passionately engaged in readings and studies in Anthroposophy. He went on to spend nine years studying with The School of Spiritual Psychology formerly in North Carolina; after which he completed three years immersed in Contemplative Spiritual Direction with The Alcyon Center in Seal Cove Maine. In late 2018 he began pursuing training in Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy (\"BCST\"), as his next level of understanding the human being as mind-body-soul. He has obtained his Diploma in BCST through training with the international school of Body Intelligence. BCST Foundational Training involves at least 700 hours of practitioner course trainings, studies, practice and experiential learning over a two-year period. Since obtaining his diploma, he has continued his development through being a Student Assistant and Tutor Assistant for ongoing training Seminars in the region. The training and practice is biodynamic in its approach; which means an orientation to the body's natural wisdom and allowing innate intelligent processes to arise and bring about authentic physiological and psycho-emotional change. In Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy the inter-connectedness of mind, body and spirit are deeply acknowledged and, thus, it takes a whole-person approach to healing.

During a session the client is fully clothed and resting comfortably on a massage table. The practitioner establishes a safe therapeutic relationship, and then uses a gentle non-invasive touch to listen for and support the expressions of health in the client's system. The practitioner follows the natural pace of the clients system, to support nervous system balance, resilience, a felt sense of inner resources, allowing for the resolution of conditions resulting from stress and trauma. STILLNESS AND HEALTH Just after the moment of conception there is a long Stillness before the cells in the embryo begin rapid creation and organization. This is a function of the universal within us. This Stillness is a Fulcrum. It is in this depth of Stillness around which our whole being is organized. It is the most essential and fundamental ground of our being. In this Stillness, the \"blue print\" of our original formation, original health, is created. Returning to Stillness, returns us to our ground of being and to our Original Health. BCST orients to this Original Health. FULCRUMS AND INERTIAL FULCRUMS Understanding Fulcrums and inertial fulcrums is key to maintaining the potency of the natural health of our mind, body and soul. A Fulcrum is a point of stillness around which motion organizes. Within the human being, within each body, each bone, each organ, each cell, and in all creation, there are fulcrums around which Formative Forces organize. There are natural fulcrums and there are \"inertial fulcrums.\" Our original potency of our original health organizes our physical body, mental and soulful being around natural fulcrums. Our systems, potencies, fluids, and tissues, express a natural motility and motion around these natural fulcrums. Our life forces and original health flourish. Inertial fulcrums develop in reaction to the \"conditional forces\" of our lives. An example of a conditional force is a traumatic event - physical and emotional. Inertial fulcrums do not shift with the intention of our life forces; rather, resistance to movement within the human system is organized by Inertial Fulcrums; basically, potencies and life forces have become inert. Every experience we have has its potency; if these experiential forces are not resolved in the system, our system compensates by containing them. Thus, Inertial Fulcrums \"contain\" the potency. Inertia - resistance to motility and motion - is organized by these \"inertial fulcrums.\" If potencies become inertial within the system, tissue and fluid inertia follow. BCST facilitates transmutation of inertial fulcra, freeing potency and restoring Original Health to mind, body and soul. "}
