Our name change to The Leukemia & LymphomaSociety in 2000 was simply perception catching up to reality. TheSociety's objective is to nd cures for allblood cancers, and to be the leading resource for patients battling allof these cancers. This year, the Society took the rst step in making access to specic information and services simpler for patients with these cancers. We developed a color-coding system for the three main categories of blood cancers: Our new signature colors are green for leukemia, gold for lymphoma and blue for myeloma. Any information that is relevant to all the diseases is coded burgundy . All print materials prepared for patients during this year reflect the new system, making access to important information and resources more efcient. You'll also see our new colors in such e-newsletters as LeukemiaLinks, LymphomaLinks andMyelomaLinks. The next step will be to extend the new system to other venues, including access to information on the Society's Web site. This year's Annual Report displays the new colors with pride. They represent the ongoing efforts to constantly improve on the ways the Society serves and supports patients and those who love and care for them.2005 | ANNUALREPOR fortunate to be able to report that scal year 2005 was a banner year for the Society in many ways. Let's start with revenue. The Society raised $218.6 millionthrough private donations, corporate gifts and our various fundraising campaigns - that's $38 million more than we raised in scal 2004. Our already successful campaigns such as Team In Training \u00aeand Light The Night\u00aeWalk were even more productive in scal 2005 (for information on individual campaigns, please turn to pages 12 and 13 of thisreport). And our donor development initiatives have shown impressive growth - a 38 percent increase in revenue over last year, to more than $25 million in scal 2005. The big story of the year is not just our success as fundraisers, but also our success as prudent stewards. Since its founding in 1949, the Society has been steadfast in pursuingits mission: Cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and improvethe quality of life of patients and their families. In scal 2005, we were able to strengthenour commitment, supporting four new Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) grants and renewing two others - for a total of six SCORs awarded in the scal year, a Societyrecord. More money for the best research globally means more research successes; andmore research successes mean greater hope for the hundreds of thousands of patientsbattling leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Finally, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada became part of the Society effective July 1, 2004, and this year's annual report is the rst to include our Canadianoperations. We are pleased to be serving the needs of patients and families in Canadaas well as in the United States. Until the day comes when we can nally say we've defeated blood cancers, the Society will be here to help guide patients and their families on the cancer journey. In scal year2005, the Society had 2.5 million contacts with patients, caregivers and healthcareprofessionals, through our Web site, Information Resource Center, education programsand chapter-based outreach. Yes, we made great progress in advancing our mission in scal 2005, thanks to the dedicated volunteers, employees, donors and researchers who helped make the year so successful. We are looking forward to doing even more in scal 2006! Dwayne Howell President & CEOJohn M. Kamins Chairman leadership message 42005 leukemia highlights patient services In 2005, the Society offered new educational and support programs and services to meet the needs of patientsbattling AML, CML, ALL and CLL. A small sample of new Society programs, services and materials follows: INew Approaches to CLL: The Changing Treatment Landscape, featured world-renowned hematologist/ oncologist Michael Keating, M.D., The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. A betterunderstanding of how leukemia cells work and grow has led to targeted therapies for individual patients, and more rened diagnostic tests have enabled doctorsto devise smarter treatment strategies for all patients. In this program, Dr. Keating discussed the latest newsabout CLL, as well as clinical trials that might lead to even better treatments in the future. IMedical Update on AML: New Treatments and Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, was jointly presented by the Society, the National Bone Marrow Donor Program andCancer Care. The program featured Selina Luger, M.D., University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, who presentedan overview of AML; and J. Douglas Rizzo, M.D., MedicalCollege of Wisconsin, who discussed treatment options,including marrow and blood stem cell transplantation. ICML: Ask the Expert, a telephone education program, featured Stephen D. Nimer, M.D., head of the Division of Hematologic-Oncology, Memorial Sloan-KetteringCancer Center. The entire one-hour session was devotedto Dr. Nimer elding questions from the audience, a format of great value to participants. INew Discoveries in CML: This teleconference featured two distinguished experts from M.D. Anderson: Francis J.Giles, M.B., M.D., F.R.C.P.I., F.R.C.Path, professor ofmedicine, Department of Leukemia; and Moshe Talpaz,M.D., professor of medicine, Department of ExperimentalTherapeutics. They discussed the latest information on CML therapies and the future direction of CMLresearch, and they answered questions from theaudience about CML clinical trials, newer treatments and other topics of interest. IAn updated booklet, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, provides information on this cancer, current treatments, new research directions and emotional aspects of managing the disease. 52005 | ANNUALREPOR Tresearch In the ght against blood cancers, leukemia research has arguably led the way, with major innovations in the development and testing of targeted therapies in just the past ve years. Gleevec \u00ae, the rst product of this research, was only the beginning. This Society-funded breakthrough has led to additional studies thatare further advancing treatment options for patients withchronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and for thosebattling acute myelogenous lymphocytic leukemia (ALL and CLL). They include: IThe Society funded a new Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) grant, Targeted Inhibition of Oligomeric Translocation andALL, led John Bushweller, Ph.D., the University of Virginia. The ve-year project will focus on newtherapies for Gleevec-resistant CML patients and AML and ALL patients who do not respond to standard therapies. This SCOR expands on currentknowledge about the specic genetic defects thatcreate malignancies in blood cells that harbor them,and on the successful application of Gleevec to many patients with CML. ICharles Sawyers, M.D., UCLA School of Medicine, presented ndings at the 46th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) for a new agent, BMS-354825. In clinical trials of thisagent, 86 percent of early-stage CML patients resistantto Gleevec experienced a complete team leader, creditedearlier Society-funded research on Gleevec resistancewith his ability to move ahead with recent, highlysuccessful clinical trials. IVarsha Gandhi, Ph.D., The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, received a TranslationalResearch Program (TRP) grant from the Society for her work, DNA Independent Strategy to Target CLL.Many types of leukemia are caused by increased cell proliferation and are frequently treated with drugsthat target DNA. In contrast, CLL expansion is moreoften associated with decreases in leukemic cell death.Dr. Gandhi's research focuses on a chemotherapeuticagent called chlorinated adenosine (8-CI-Ado), which has been shown to cause CLL cell death inlaboratory models by decreasing energy stores and the production of new RNAs, both critical to cellsurvival. Dr. Gandhi will now study what happenswhen 8-CI-Ado is introduced into fresh peripheral, (circulatory) blood cells obtained from patients with CLL. The objective is to advance this agent to clinical trials. \" \"hunter's story On the Friday afternoon when the doctor announced that our 10-month-old son hadleukemia, I was very frightened even though I wasn't 100 percent sure what leukemia was. It was a great reassurance when, by Mondayafternoon, the Society had contacted our homeand was helping us cope with the diagnosis. Theyfollowed up regularly and continued to supplyinformation as my son's situation changed. Lori Ruderman, mother of 6-year-old Hunter, leukemia survivor. \" \"We're currently testing a new agent, BMS-354825, in clinical trials among CML patients resistant to Gleevec, and it shows tremendous promise for getting patients into complete hematological remission. Earlier Society-funded research we did on Gleevec resistance enabled us to get to this point. Charles Sawyers, M.D., UCLA School of Medicine 6 72005 | ANNUALREPOR T2005 lymphoma highlights research Below are just three examples of outstanding Society-sponsored lymphoma research, includinglaboratory studies, clinical trials and a collaborativeSpecialized Center of Research (SCOR) project, all ofwhich will help advance the search for cures. IA SCOR grant was awarded to Tak Mak, Ph.D., Advanced Medical Discovery Institute, University of Toronto, for a ve-year project, Signaling Pathways in Lymphoma and Leukemogenesis. These collaborative studies will increase our understanding of lymphoma and leukemiaprocesses and direct the development of new anti-cancer agents and clinical trials. Dr. Mak and his team will identify how genetic defects in blood stem cells cause the formation of rarecancer stem cells that expand to form lymphomasand leukemias. IA Translational Research Program (TRP) grant to Alain Rook, M.D., University of Pennsylvania, wasrenewed this year for his ongoing investigation intopromising new therapies for patients with T-cellmalignancies. Dr. Rook and his team discoveredthat immune system cells in patients withextensive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) weretypically not producing a molecule called CD40L,rendering them unable to attack and killlymphoma cells. In the laboratory, synthetic CD40Lmarkedly improved immune cell anti-lymphomaactivity. Dr. Rook's new study, CD40 Ligand Defect in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, will investigate the cellular and molecular reasons for the CD40L effect with a goal of administering the new drug in clinical trials to treat patients withadvanced CTCL. IWeiguo Zhang, Ph.D., Duke University Medical Center, received a Career Development Program(CDP) grant for a study titled Adaptor Proteins in Lymphocyte Activation. The research studies two molecules, LAT and LAB, found in certain immunecell (lymphocyte) membranes. These moleculeswere shown in previous studies to be essential for the lymphocyte activation and developmentthat is needed for effective immune responsespatient services A number of new educational and support programs were developed this year to answer the needs ofpatients battling Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A small sample of new programs follows: IInformation for the Newly Diagnosed: A Patient's Guide is part of our ongoing program, Insights Into NHL, a year-long series of teleconferences and newsletters for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)patients and families. This telephone educationprogram featured Andrew Zelenetz, M.D., chief, Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Dr. Zelenetz explained the importanceof diagnosing the sub-type of lymphoma anddetermining its location(s) in the body, stage ofdevelopment and other factors to ensure the besttreatment. Clinical trials also were discussed, and Dr. Zelenetz answered questions from the audience. IMeet the Expert on Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma was updated this year and offered at chapters across the nation to share new information on NHL withpatients at the community level. This informativeprogram featured local lymphoma experts and cancer-care professionals. IEmerging medicine, New England Medical Center; David J. Inwards,M.D., assistant professor of medicine, practice chair,Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine; andMorie A. Gertz, M.D., professor of medicine, divisionchair, Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine.These \"orphan\" lymphomas (meaning that they affectfewer people than the more common types of thiscancer) were explained along with the latest treatmentadvances and clinical trials.against tumor cells. Ongoing studies in mice will determine how these proteins function in the immune system. Results will likely help in the development of a new class of molecularlytargeted drugs for patients with lymphoma and leukemia. \" \"vaithee's story The Society has helped us in so many ways \u2014 from nancial support for expenses not covered by health insurance to tickets to baseball games to keep our spirits up. Through the First Connectionprogram I was able to talk to someone who isliving healthy and cancer free. That was a greatmorale booster in a dark time. Subramanian \"Vaithee\" Vaitheeswaran, non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivor. \"\"Thanks to our Society SCOR grant, we're able to develop customized lymphoma vaccines that we hope will trigger an immune response specically against an individual's tumor. This will make the rst treatment the best treatment for that patient. Ronald Levy, M.D., Stanford University School of Medicine 82005 | ANNUALREPOR T2005 myeloma highlights research Three new, Society-funded research programs are examples of current efforts in the search for improvedtherapies and cures. IA Translational Research Program (TRP) grant was renewed this year for David Avigan, M.D., Beth IsraelDeaconess Medical Center. In previous studies, wholemyeloma tumor cells and normal immune cells, bothtaken from a patient, were fused, and these fusedcells were used to stimulate (immune) T cells torecognize and kill myeloma cells from the samepatient. In his new study, Vaccination with Dendritic Cell Tumor Fusions in Conjunction with Stem CellTransplantation as a Novel Immunotherapy forMultiple Myeloma, Dr. Avigan will conduct clinical trials in which stem cell transplant patients with myelomawill be immunized with a customized fusion vaccine to determine whether these vaccines will improvechances for patient survival. ILawrence Lum, M.D., Roger Williams Medical Center, received a TRP grant for a project called Circumventing Rituximab Resistance in Patients with B Cell Malignancies. Dr. Lum will study the effects of a molecule he created, CD20Bi, on myeloma andlymphoma cells. The molecule links a drug used toght these cancers, rituximab, with a patient's own T cells. Dr. Lum's new research will determine whetherpatients who are resistant to rituximab can benetfrom multiple infusions of their own rituximab-armedimmune cells, following chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. If successful, this clinical study will improve survival and decrease relapse rates for myeloma and lymphoma patients.patient services The Society provided several new myeloma resources this year. These are just a few of theSociety's programs and services for myelomapatients, their families and caregivers: IThe Latest News LurieComprehensive Cancer Center. She shared heroptimism about the future of treatment for thiscancer and provided updates on new therapiesand combination treatments, clinical trials, genetictesting and other factors that are dramaticallychanging the landscape for myeloma patients. IExploring Myeloma was launched to provide patients with a new educational resource. Led by local blood cancer experts, Exploring Myeloma presents a thorough overview of the cancer in an easy-to-follow, one session, classroom format.The program, piloted this year in seven Societychapters, includes a one-hour slide presentation,followed by an hour-long Q&A with the experts. Exploring Myeloma also examines the emotional and social aspects of a myeloma diagnosis. It is being offered at all Society chapters in 2006. ITwo new educational booklets were created this year: Myeloma provides a comprehensive overview of the cancer, with segments on thedisease, how it's detected, treatment options and what the future for this disease may hold,based on today's research. Social and emotionalaspects are also explored. Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and their Families gives information on how to help manage this cancer from diagnosisthrough treatment. 9 IJing Chen, Ph.D., Emory University, received a Career Development Program grant for Molecular Therapeutic Strategies in Multiple Myeloma: Targeting FGFR3. This study is likely to provide information about the role of the protein FGFR3 incausing multiple myeloma. The research may alsoprovide new strategies to improve treatmentoutcomes, since about 15 percent of myelomapatients have a genetic abnormality that causesinappropriate FGFR3 expression. \" \"judy's story I began suffering from health issues in 1999, but it took two years of specialists and complicatedtests to come up with the devastating diagnosis:multiple myeloma. Thankfully, the Society wasthere, helping me make informed decisions aboutmy care and making it easier for me to explainmyeloma to my concerned friends and family. Judy Dixon, myeloma survivor\" \"Our Translational Research Program grant from the Society is helping us conduct clinical trials of patients with B cell malignancies who are resistant to rituximab. If we're successful, we'll be able to arm patients' T killer cells with the targeting antibodies and improve their survival and decrease relapse. Lawrence Lum, M.D., Roger Williams Medical Center 10 112005 | ANNUALREPOR T2005 blood cancer highlights research In addition to funding research focused on specic blood cancers, the Society invests in research that holdspromise for nding cures and improved therapies acrossthe entire blood cancer spectrum. The following areexamples of important studies: IJose Villadangos, Ph.D., Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, received a Career DevelopmentProgram (CDP) grant to study the Control of Antigen Presentation, Cross-Presentation and Migration inDendritic Cells. He is studying one way in which our immune system can ght cancer. This involves anti-cancer \"killer\" T cells that are recruited by otherimmune system cells known as dendritic cells (DC).These cells take parts of cancer cells, break them intosmaller pieces and display these pieces to the killercells, which recognize them. The killer cells then seekand destroy other, related cancer cells. However,cancer cells sometimes avoid detection by dendriticcells, and then a tumor can expand. To get around thislimitation, Dr. Villadangos will obtain dendritic cellsfrom patients and put them in the test tube withcancer cell pieces to generate \"DC vaccines.\" Thevaccines can then be re-introduced to patients toactivate anti-cancer killer cells. He will learn how thedendritic cells obtain the cancer cell pieces, processthem and display them on their surfaces. Thisknowledge is likely to improve methods for generatingDC vaccines that will have broad applications in anti-cancer therapies. IDavid Scadden, M.D., Massachusetts General Hospital, received a Translational Research Program grant forthe study Therapeutic Manipulation of the Stem Cell Niche. Hematopoietic stem cells are the cells from which all normal red and white blood cells derive, andadult stem cell transplantation is an important therapyfor individuals with advanced leukemia, lymphoma ormyeloma. Unfortunately, transplant success dependsin part on the number of stem cells that can berecovered from donors, and blood stem cells are rare.Dr. Scadden has discovered a drug, parathyroidhormone (PTH), that might increase pre-transplantstem cell harvests. Dr. Scadden and his colleagues will test the effect of PTH on the number of adultblood stem cells in a mouse transplant model and inhuman patients. If PTH treatment increases the stemcell recovery rate, it could be used to improve thesuccessful application of stem cell transplants forhematologic malignancies. IDavid Weinstock, M.D., Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, received a CDP grant to study the chromosomal breakage and exchange that results in an abnormality called a \"translocation,\"commonly found in various types of blood cancers.The Chromosomal Translocations after RAG-Mediated DNA Double Strand Breaks project is aimed at understanding how chromosome breaks occur andhow normal cells repair them. Using a novel systemthey have developed, Dr. Weinstock and his group will determine which proteins prevent and which ones facilitate translocation formation. In addition, they will study how chemotherapies for various human cancers can promote translocation formation,producing secondary blood cancers. The ultimate goalof this project is to be able to prevent chromosometranslocations and block blood cancer formation. patient services In addition to disease-specic information and services, the Society provides resources of relevance and interestto all blood cancer patients. This is a small sample of programs and materials made available this year: IBreaking Through the Age Barrier: Getting the Best Cancer Treatment, is a series of chapter-based educational workshops launched this year. More thanhalf of all cancers occur in people older than 65, andthese patients may need special attention when itcomes to cancer treatment. The program helps deterthe outdated notion that people in this age groupare \"too old\" to benet from therapies that arestandard for younger segments of the population. The workshops familiarize older blood cancer patientsand their caregivers with information on treatments to help them communicate more effectively with healthcare professionals. The Comprehensive GeriatricAssessment, a checklist to help oncologists evaluateolder patients' capacity to undergo treatment and sideeffects, was introduced as part of this program. IAlso published this year is A Toolkit for Older Adults with Cancer and Their Caregivers, which includes booklets on choosing a healthcare team,understanding treatment options, clinical trials andnancial matters; and a guide to help caregiversunderstand the ins and outs of their important role. ICognitive and Late Effects Related to Childhood Cancer is a teleconference education program featuring Daniel Armstrong, Ph.D., University of MiamiSchool of Medicine. In this program, Dr. Armstrongdiscusses new research on the potential long-termeffects of cancer treatment on a child's ability to learnand, eventually, to work and participate in socialrelationships. The potential effects of chemotherapyand radiation therapy were discussed, along withsome of the educational and pharmaceuticalmeasures being used to address cognitive problemsthat can result from cancer treatment. The specialneeds of these children with respect to individualizededucation plans were also addressed. advocacy Advocates for blood cancer patients faced many legislative challenges in 2005, but the Society was ready, scoring some notable successes for cancerresearch and education. Our advocacy efforts strengthened in March during the annual Mission Day in Washington, D.C. More than 250 Society supporters lobbied legislators to increase funding for various medical programsimportant to cancer patients. Their efforts paid off. Despite signicant federal budget cuts, the Society was able to secure an additional $5million for blood cancer research at the U.S. Departmentof Defense, and an additional $5 million for bloodcancer education provided by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention. The Society's free information programs and services for blood cancer patients, their families and caregivers are accessible in a variety of user-friendly venues: ICall (800) 955-4572 or email (infocenter@LLS.org) an information specialist at our Information Resource Center IVisit our Web site at www.LLS.org ILearn the latest about any of the blood cancers through our online education workshops andteleconferences, archived on our Web site IVisit or contact any of our 66 chapters in the United States and Canada, providing informationand support services at the community level 2005 | ANNUALREPOR T2005 fundraising highlights 12 13light the night Light The Night Walk continued its impressive growth as a leading national charity walk.

(the Society) as of June 30, 2005, and the related consolidatedstatements of activities, cash flows, and functional expenses for the year then ended. Theseconsolidated nancial statements are the responsibility of the Society's management. Ourresponsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated nancial statements based on ouraudit. The prior year summarized comparative information has been derived from the Society's2004 consolidated nancial statements and, in our report dated October 1, 2004, we expressed an unqualied opinion on those statements. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the nancial statements are free of material misstatement. Our audit included consideration of internal control over nancial reporting as a basis fordesigning audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Society's internal control over nancialreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the nancial statements. An audit alsoincludes assessing the accounting principles used and signicant estimates made by management,as well as evaluating the overall nancial statement presentation. We believe that our auditprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated nancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the nancial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2005, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Organization and Signicant Accounting Policies Organization The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. (the \"Society\") is an international not-for-prot health agency dedicated to seeking the cause and cure of leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma and improving the quality of life of patients and their families. The Society's principal activities include: awardingresearch grants; facilitating psychosocial support aid to patients; answering phone requests for blood-related cancer information made to the Society's InformationResource Center; and disseminating educational information about blood-related cancers in the form of publications, internetsites, conference calls and symposia sponsorship for both themedical community and the general public. The Society entered into a merger agreement with Leukemia Research Fund of Canada (\"LRFC\"), effective July 1, 2004, underwhich the Society has approval rights over all LRFC resolutions.As part of this agreement, the name of LRFC was changed to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (\"LLSC\").The merger was accounted for in accordance with purchasemethod concepts whereby a contribution of LLSC's net assets (at fair value) was recorded by the Society. Tax-Exempt Status The Society qualies as a charitable organization as dened by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accordingly, is exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, since the Society is publicly-supported, contributions to the Society qualify for the maximumcharitable contribution deduction under the Internal RevenueCode. LLSC is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is therefore not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements are met. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated nancial statements include the accounts of the Society, which encompasses the Home Ofceof the Society and its sixty three chapters, LLSC, and the Society'snot-for-prot afliates, The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocietyResearch Programs, Inc. and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation. All signicant inter-company and intra-Society accounts and transactions have been eliminatedin consolidation. Net Asset Classications To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to the Society, funds that havesimilar characteristics have been classied into three net assetcategories as follows: Unrestricted net assets: Consist of funds that are fully available, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, for theSociety to utilize in any of its programs or supporting services. Temporarily restricted net assets: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specic time period or purpose, aswell as amounts relating to term endowment or deferred givingarrangements in which the funds must be maintained intactover the lifetimes of the donors.Permanently restricted net assets: Consist of funds that contain donor-imposed restrictions requiring that the principal be invested in perpetuity and that only the income be used. Income earned on these funds may be unrestricted or temporarily restricted, depending upon the donor-imposedrestrictions. Contributions and Deferred Revenue Contributions are recorded as revenue, at their fair value, when received or promised unconditionally. Contributionsreceived with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as either temporarily or permanently restricted revenue. When a donor restriction is met through the passage of time or fulllment of a purpose restriction, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassied to unrestricted net assets and reported in the statement of activities as net assets released fromrestrictions. Conditional contributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met. Deferred revenue includes amounts received for special events that will be held subsequent to the scal year-end. Donated Services In 2005, the Society determined that certain of the donated services it received met the criteria for recognition in the nancialstatements. Specically, the donated services of family supportgroup facilitators and research grant reviewers have been valuedand are reported as both revenue and expense in 2005. Sincethere is no impact on the reported change in net assets, theSociety has not retroactively recorded these donated services in2004. Society management believes the value of donated servicesin 2004 was comparable to that in 2005. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less from date of purchase, exceptfor amounts held for long-term purposes reported as investments. Fixed Assets and Depreciation Fixed assets, which consist principally of equipment and leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, if purchased, or atfair value at date of donation, if contributed, and are depreciatedor amortized using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, if shorter. Estimates The preparation of nancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Society'smanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect theamounts reported in the nancial statements and accompanyingnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Summarized Financial Information The nancial statements are presented with 2004 summarized or comparative information. With respect to the statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by netassets class and, in the statement of functional expenses, 2004expenses by object are presented in total rather than by functionalcategory. Accordingly, such information should be read inconjunction with the Society's 2004 consolidated nancialstatements from which the summarized information was derived. notes to consolidated financial statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc.
