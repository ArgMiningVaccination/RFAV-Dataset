Method of treatment and selection of acupuncture points are based on a proper diagnosis according to the theory of TCM. During a typical treatment, the practitioner may insert ten to twenty needles anywhere on the body, but most commonly on the forearms and lower legs. The procedure usually causes little discomfort, although the patient may feel tingling or a sensation of heaviness in the area of insertion. Electro-Acupuncture Electro-acupuncture is a form of acupuncture in which an electric current is passed between a pair of needles. The frequency and intensity of the current is adjusted according to the condition being treated. It is especially useful in treating severe pain, and stubborn, chronic pain. Electro-acupuncture is also effectively used in post-stroke recovery and improving the appearance of scars. Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal medicine uses individual herbs and combinations of herbs to prevent and treat disease. Chinese herbal medicine includes over 350 plant, mineral, and animal products that have therapeutic properties. A unique and practical understanding of these substances makes for potent, natural remedies. In Traditional Chinese medicine, when treatment includes the use of herbs, they are carefully selected according to TCM theory to assist the body in healing itself. Fire Cupping Fire cupping is the use of fire to create suction in glass cups, which are placed on the body. The suction increases blood flow, relaxes muscles, and softens connective tissue. Cupping creates new pathways for blood flow, which is a necessary factor for healing and regeneration. Cupping is effective in treating fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain, and chronic, tight muscle knots. At the Chinese Acupuncture and Herb Center, fire cupping is typically included at no extra cost with an acupuncture treatment.
