Paperwork Reduction Act Compliance 127 Appendix E. PRA Violations Memorandum 151 Appendix F. Examples of Economic Surveys and Censuses Conducted 157 by the U.S. Bureau of the Census Executive Summary The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) provides a framework for ensuring that all of the Federal Government's information collections satisfy a programmatic need, that the information has practical utility, and that the burden on the public of these activities is curtailed. This report, Managing Information Collection and Dissemination, provides a broad view of the PRA, its history, and its implementation by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and by Federal agencies. The Bush Administration, while recognizing the public benefits of information collections, is committed to reducing needless paperwork burdens and other violations of the Paperwork Reduction Act. In describing the Administration's efforts to reform Federal information policy and improve information resources management of the Federal Government - and fulfilling OMB's obligation to report annually to Congress on the PRA - the report offers a number of findings. The paperwork burdens imposed on the public by the Federal Government are substantial. Due to th e vast scope of the Government's information collection and dissemination activities - which reflect the size, diversity, and dynamism of the American economy - the public bears a significant burden in providing information to the Federal agencies. In FY 2001, the public devoted an estimated 7.65 billion \"burden hours\" responding to all Government requests for information. Roughly 63 percent of this paperwork burden was imposed on businesses, and another five percent affected State, local, and tribal governments, farmers, and other respondents. About 32 percent -- or 2.45 billion hours -- of the burden was imposed on individuals. This translates into almost 24 hours per household in the United States. Despite legislated goals seeking paperwork reduction, actual reporting burden is increasing. In most years since the PRA was first enacted in 1980, Congress has called on agencies to meet government-wide paperwork burden reduction goals of either five or ten percent. In all but one year, the Government did not meet the statutory goal. In fact, overall paperwork burdens on the public continue to increase each year. Paperwork requirements, though burdensome, are often required by statute or justified by valid programmatic rationales. In setting burden reduction goals that agencies should aspire to meet, Congress understood that agencies also need to perform their missions, the success of which often depends on information provided by citizens, organizations, businesses, and other entities. Because the PRA calls on agencies and OMB to respect program missions, burden reduction can be achieved only to the extent that it does not interfere with agencies' ability to meet their programmatic responsibilities. These responsibilities often involve the provision of needed public heath, safety, consumer, and environmental protections that Americans expect from their Government. They are also frequently the result of laws passed by Congress to address important economic objectives, such as providing tax relief to families and assistance to small businesses and farmers. 1 OMB is encouraging agencies to improve performance and reduce burden. As part of the development of this year's report, OMB asked agencies to identify at least two initiatives \"to improve program performance by enhancing the efficiency of information collections and reducing burden on the public.\" These initiatives could involve comprehensive reviews of entire programs. To ensure continued progress on these initiatives, we also asked agencies to submit regular progress reports. The number of agency violations of the PRA continues to decline , though more progress is needed. The agencies contributing to this year's report committed 406 violations of the Paperwork Reduction Act in FY 2001, only 109 of which remained unresolved as of March 12, 2002. Last year, these agencies reported 161 unresolved violations. Although we are reporting fewer unresolved PRA violations than we did last year, there are still too many. Accordingly, last November OMB sent a memorandum to agency chief information officers (CIOs) and general counsels that stressed the importance of full agency compliance with the PRA. OMB requested specific information on the steps CIOs were taking to resolve PRA violations that we reported in the FY 2001 Information Collection Budget. We also asked agencies to describe the procedures that they have instituted to prevent future violations, including monthly reviews of OMB's computer-generated reports and CIO oversight of and participation in programmatic functions. The potential of Electronic Government to advance the goals of the PRA is enormous. OMB has identified 24 E- Gov Initiatives that will foster improvements in the Federal Government's gathering, use, and dissemination of information. OMB believes that these initiatives have the potential to improve the Federal Government's compliance with the purposes of the PRA, whether through burden reduction or by \"maximizing the practical utility of and public benefit from information collected by or for the Federal Government.\" OMB has launched a new effort to improve the quality of information disseminated by agencies. Another way in which the public is served by the Government's use of information occurs when agencies provide information to citizens. In 2000, Congress directed OIRA to expand on its existing policy by requiring OIRA to issue guidelines on the quality of the information agencies use and disseminate. The result of this effort, \"Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies\" (Appendix A), is OMB's response not only to the statutory mandate, but to the need to increase the transparency of government decision-making. Chapter One of this report discusses some of the reasons that agencies need to collect information, either for their own programmatic purposes or on behalf of the public. Chapter Two outlines the history of the PRA and the reasons it has evolved into the statute it is today. Chapter Three discusses the importance of OMB's information quality guidelines. Chapter Four presents a summary of the 24 E- Gov initiatives. In past years, the annual report to Congress has been called the Information Collection Budget (ICB) of the United States Government. Traditionally, the ICB has discussed agency burden accounting numbers, significant paperwork reductions and increases, and overall 2 compliance with the PRA. That information plus a description of various agency burden reduction initiatives is presented in Chapter 5 and Appendices B, C, and D. 3 4 Chapter 1. RATIONALES FOR FEDERAL PAPERWORK BURDENS One of the most common complaints about the Federal Gov ernment relates to requirements for individuals, businesses, and organizations to provide seemingly endless amounts of information. And, as a general matter, that impression of a large and growing amount of information collection is historically accurate. Based on the agency estimates of the number of hours spent providing information to the Federal Government (\"paperwork burden\") maintained in OMB's inventory of approved information collections, the total annual burden imposed by Federal agencies is as follows1: Total Government Burden Hours by Year 0 2 4 6 8 10 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 Year Burden Hours (in billions) As illustrated by the chart above, the paperwork burden has generally increased over time. In 2001, about 7.65 billion hours were consumed responding to or complying with information requirements. Since 1989, only one year (1993) realized a decrease in annual paperwork burden. Although progress is being made in reducing certain types of unnecessary paperwork, it is important -- given the large magnitude of Federal paperwork burdens -- to recognize why paperwork burdens exist in the first place. The success of a wide variety of Federal programs and regulations depends on access to information that can only be obtained from the public. To carry out all of these responsibilities carefully and effectively, the Federal Government collects and provides information to public and private decision-makers. In this opening chapter, we describe the public-interest rationales for these collections of information and provide real-world examples of how paperwork burdens are serving the public interest. 1 In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service changed the way it calculated is paperwork burden estimates. That reestimate increased the agency's paperwork burden estimate by 3.4 billion hours, and nearly tripled the government-wide burden-hour estimate. 5 Planning Government Programs In order for public servants to design Federal programs, they need access to information about whether programs are needed, the extent of these needs, and how these needs are changing over time. Without information to support planning activities, government programs may be poorly designed to address public needs or may fail to adapt to the changing needs of the American population. If program planners do not have access to up-to-date information, it is unlikely that planning activities will be responsive to changing circumstances. For example, statistics on the incidence of poverty in the United States -- including information on how the incidence of poverty is changing over time and in different regions of the country -- is critical to evaluate current initiatives and plan the future design of anti-poverty programs in the United States. In order to obtain information about poverty, it is necessary to place informational burdens on the public regarding the amount of income received and the various sources of that income. The measurements of both \"poverty\" and \"income\" are complex and are comprised of various components; thus, the paperwork burdens associated with providing necessary information are time-consuming and often appear somewhat intrusive. Although it may be feasible and appropriate to reduce or mitigate this burden in various ways, some degree of information collection from the public is clearly necessary to define poverty and plan anti-poverty programs. Evaluating Government Programs Through the Government Performance and Results Act, Congress has required agencies to define performance measures for their programs. Agencies are also required to provide evidence that their budgetary requests each year have been made with insights from performance measurement. In order to collect information on program performance, agencies are often required to collect data from the public, an information-collection process that can be costly and time consuming. For example, an important measure of performance for some Federal agencies is citizen satisfaction with the services provided by the agency. In order to measure citizen satisfaction, agencies often commission focus groups or surveys of the public to provide systematic feedback on satisfaction. In the field of health care, for example, measures of patient satisfaction are an important aspect of quality health care and may be relevant to Federal agencies ranging from the Veterans' Administration to the Department of Health and Human Services. While patient satisfaction is a subjective measure, evaluation of health care also requires information on a wide variety of objective clinical and health outcomes. Collecting this information may require imposition of paperwork requirements on physicians, hospitals and other providers of health care. As long as Federal agencies are active in the delivery, financing or regulation of health care, paperwork burdens will be necessary to evaluate these activities. 6 Providing Basic Statistics to the Public Each day citizens, elected officials, businesses and non-profit organizations use basic statistical information that appears in reference books, bulletins and on web sites, often without realizing that this information was provided by the Federal Government and was collected by imposing paperwork burdens. The most well-known and comprehensive Federal collection of statistical information is the Decennial Census. The Decennial Census provides the only comprehensive portrait of the people living in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. It provides the official population counts that determine how large amounts of Federal funds are allocated. In recent years, for example, official Census data have been used to allocate nearly $200 billion annually in Federal funds. Many State, local, and tribal programs also rely on Census data. Decennial Census data are used by each State to determine State and local legislative boundaries. At the Federal level, official Census counts determine the allocation to States of seats in the United States House of Representatives and are also used by States to determine boundaries for Congressional seats. These examples illustrate that, while filling out a Census questionnaire may seem burdensome and time-consuming, the resulting official data play a crucial role in the operation of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments. The Federal Government also sponsors a wide variety of ongoing, specialized statistical data collections that provide useful information for the public. These collections address vital topics such as health, housing, employment, natural resources, energy, environmental quality, highway and vehicle safety, crime, education, agriculture, foreign trade and civil rights. The data from these specialized statistical collections are utilized by policy makers, businesses and citizens interested in these topics. In order to collect valid information on each of these topics, the public bears the burden of responding. Significant paperwork burdens are imposed on businesses, consumers, workers and investors to collect the basic economic and financial statistics used by agents in the growing American economy. Among the most important economic surveys conducted by the Federal Government are the Economic Census; the Census of Governments; the Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders Survey; the New Residential Construction Survey; and data collected for the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services Program. Other important economic surveys include the Annual Survey of Manufacturers, the Services Annual Survey, and the Annual Finance Survey. Appendix F of this report provides a brief description of each of these surveys. Although each of these surveys is burdensome for some respondents, there is no question that the resulting information plays an important role in the functioning of the American economy. 7 Application for Government Benefits Although filling out application forms can be tedious and frustrating to the public, it is necessary to determine which individuals and organizations are entitled to government benefits. For example, the Federal Government collects information to accurately determine the initial and continued eligibility of applicants and beneficiaries for such programs as Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and the School Lunch Program. The Government collects a constant flow of information to manage the Federal disability and retirement system; the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a variety of agricultural programs that provide farm operating credit, crop insurance, and rural business loans; and loans for small business and physical disaster injury loans authorized in response to the events of September 11th. An \"application for benefits\" can also take the form of a request for a license or permit to do something that is regulated or otherwise prohibited, such as the importation of any goods subject to a tariff, the marketing of prescription drugs and medical devices, the broadcast of radio or television programs or the transmission of cable sports programs, and the issuance of patents or trademarks. Similarly, the Federal Government obtains information from employers verifying employment eligibility before it issues a visa or naturalizes an individual as an American citizen. Regulatory and Compliance Reporting Perhaps even more burdensome than filling out application forms are Federal Government requests for information to verify compliance with regulatory requirements. For example, businesses and institutions submit environmental reports concerning emissions of air pollutants from industrial facilities, vehicle and engine emissions from manufacturers, hazardous wastes from generators, transporters, and treatment and disposal facilities, oil and hazardous chemical spills from facilities, and constituent levels in drinking water from municipalities. Accredited veterinarians submit health certification information. Surface coal mines provide information on exploration, development, and production plans. Banks provide information on their financial condition, performance, and activities. The Federal Government also requires individuals and companies to retain certa in information for a specified period of time (i.e., a recordkeeping requirement) so that inspectors and other officials can verify compliance with government requirements. The Government also requires individuals and companies to report information to sources other than the Government, i.e., third parties. For example, there is third-party reporting to help tax administration, specifically the filing of the IRS Form W-4 by employees with employers. Employers use the information to determine the correct amount of tax to withhold from the employees' wages. In other cases, the Federal Government tries to ensure that people have the information they need to make better decisions, rather than actually regulating their behavior. For example, nutritional labeling on food products is also a form of third-party disclosure. The Government 8 has requirements for labeling commodities with respect to their identity, their manufacturer or distributor, and the quantity of contents or servings. Similarly, the Government ensures that home buyers, consumers, and investors are informed of the costs of their loans and the nature of the investment opportunities they are considering. Moreover, the Federal Government imposes paperwork burdens on the public not only when it promulgates regulations that direct or prohibit certain conduct, but also when it undertakes the steps necessary to develop the regulations themselves. Specifically, for many significant rulemakings (and virtually every economically significant regulatory action), Federal agencies rely on information that they have acquired from the public through surveys, data call-ins, and other instruments to identify the nature of the problem to be regulated, and to evaluate the likely impacts of the possible regulatory approaches available to the agency to help solve the problem. This information collection is particularly necessary when an agency prepares a Regulatory Impact Analysis required under Executive Order No. 12866 and risk assessments, which estimate the likely scope and danger of possible health, safety, or environmental risks. Research for Scientific Progress The ability to collect a wide variety of information through surveys contributes to much of the research accomplished in our Nation. Collecting information from the public, while seemingly burdensome, provides essential information that is critical to advancing our understanding of the problems faced by our citizens. For example, empirical research on societal and human behavior has contributed to policy and practice in areas ranging from drug abuse to education, health, retirement, and welfare. Similarly, supplementing clinical and biomedical research with empirical investigations of cancer patterns and associated risk behaviors in the population can stimulate prevention and education programs as well as increase our basic knowledge of the causes and effects of this disease. And, while recognizing the paperwork burden that forms and surveys may impose, the collection of agricultural production and marketing data from farmers is key to understanding and addressing issues in the agricultural economy such as genetic engineering and the changing structure of agriculture. These are but a few examples of areas in which the imposition of a paperwork burden facilitates our scientific progress. Tax Returns Perhaps the best known and most frustrating paperwork burden is IRS Form 1040, which is used to calculate and declare personal income tax. Taxpayers must both collect and maintain information to determine if the correct amount of taxes, fees and other revenue has been paid and to correct errors that have been identified. It is estimated that the Treasury Department is responsible for 80 percent of all information collection and recordkeeping conducted or required by the Federal Government. Although tax-related paperwork is burdensome, it is also critical to the revenue flows of the Federal Government. In total, the Treasury Department collects roughly $2 trillion each year in revenue from various taxes and fees. This figure includes revenues from individual and business income taxes, tariff duties, user fees, excise taxes, registration fees, license fees and 9 other assessments. Paperwork burdens are an integral part of any revenue-collection process that is linked to income or transactions. Conclusion The Federal Government, through its many programs, regulations, and revenue- generating activities, imposes significant paperwork burdens on individuals and organizations of all types. Yet this chapter illustrates a variety of public-interest rationales for paperwork burdens. Thus, efforts to curtail burdensome paperwork requirements must be sensitive to the benefits of governmental activities. To carry out its responsibilities carefully, effectively, fairly and efficiently, the Federal Government needs access to information - lots of information. 10 Chapter 2. ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF FEDERAL PAPERWORK POLICY As described in Chapter 1, the Federal Government requires information to serve a wide variety of purposes. But, the collection of information is costly and time-consuming for the public. Thus, the Federal Government has developed a formal process to oversee the collection of information. In this chapter, we describe the evolution of that process, including its current state and the requirement that OMB publish an annual information collection budget.2 Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB must review and act on \u2014 generally approving or disapproving \u2014 all proposed collections of information conducted or sponsored by Executive branch agencies, including independent regulatory commissions. OMB has been approving or disapproving proposed agency information collections for almost 60 years in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act and its predecessor statutes. The Federal Reports Act OMB3 was first given the authority to approve Federal information collections in the Federal Reports Act (P.L. 77-831), signed into law by President Roosevelt on December 24, 1942. The rationale for enactment of the Federal Reports Act came with the declaration of World War II and the emergence of war agencies concerned with price control, rationing, and material and manpower allocation. As the Senate Small Business Committee later observed: With the advent of the war, vast quantities of additional facts were needed by the administrative agencies. Almost all the measures adapted to activate the war programs required paper work. The Government's billions of dollars of war work could not have been accomplished without a tremendous increase in the number of forms. The allocation of materials and manpower, production control, price control, selective service, and many other policies all required the assembly and use of facts which would permit the executive agencies to carry out their duties. In the absence of adequate review and screening devices, business concerns and others were overwhelmed by paper work. It was almost a daily occurrence to receive some new request from Washington. Many of these requests to a greater or lesser degree duplicated each other and many of them showed no evidence of having been carefully considered. (S. Rpt 79-47, part 2). 2 This chapter was adapted from Chapter 2 of the Information Collection Budget of the United States Government: Fiscal Year 1998. 3 In 1970, the Bureau of the Budget was designated as OMB. E.O. 11541, July 1, 1970. 11 The statement of purpose for the Federal Reports Act reflects these concerns: It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress that information which may be needed by the various Federal agencies should be obtained with a minimum burden upon business enterprises (especially small business enterprises) and other persons required to furnish such information, and a minimum cost to the Government, that all unnecessary duplication of efforts in obtaining such information through the use of reports, questionnaires, and other such methods should be eliminated as rapidly as practicable; and that information collected and tabulated by any Federal agency should insofar as is expedient be tabulated in a manner to maximize the usefulness of the information to other Federal agencies and the public. Responsibility for reviewing and approving agency collections of information was placed in OMB's Division of Statistical Standards, which continued its work into the 1970s: The forms clearance responsibilities of [this Division] declined sharply after the end of World War II. The necessity for many questionnaires associated with the war effort from agencies such as the Office of Price Administration and the War Production Board was eliminated. This is illustrated by the fact that, in 1943, the first year after the Federal Reports Act was enacted, about 7,500 questionnaires were submitted for review. By the mid-1950s, the forms clearance volume had diminished to a level of 2,500 to 3,000 requests per year ... After World War II [this Division] encouraged the agencies to establish internal clearance units to sift out unacceptable reporting proposals. * * * In the 1940s [this Division] was concerned with promoting greater use of sampling and other advanced statistical techniques to reduce costs and to improve the quality of data. At the end of the 1950s, ... the responsibilities of [the OMB Office of Statistical Standards, as the Division had been renamed] included ... [c] ontrol of data collection activities to achieve maximum efficiency and economy in the Government's statistical programs. * * * Throughout the 1960's, the Office of Statistical Standards continued to employ several ... devices [as instruments for coordinating statistical policy]. These included the traditional review of ... data requests under the Federal Reports Act ... 4 The Commission on Federal Paperwork 4 Revolution in United States Government Statistics, 1926-1976 , Department of Commerce, October 1978, pp. 151, 153, 155. 12 By the early 1970s, the Federal Government's growing need for information led to complaints from the public about paperwork burden. A legislative debate began on how to make the Federal Reports Act work more effectively and usefully to reduce burdens on respondents.5 In 1974, Congress passed P.L. 93-566 to establish the Commission on Federal Paperwork, stating as its concern that \"Federal information reporting requirements have placed an unprecedented paperwork burden upon private citizens, recipients of Federal assistance, businesses, governmental contractors, and State and local governments.\" Three years later, in October 1977, the Commission on Federal Paperwork concluded that the total costs of Federal paperwork were \"more than $100 billion a year, or about $500 for each person in this country\" \u2014 $43 billion for the Federal Government; $25 to $32 billion for private industry; $5 to 9 billion for State and local governments; $8.7 billion for individuals; $350 million for farmers; and $75 million for labor organizations.6 Based on its findings, the Commission made a number of recommendations. Under the category of \"Managing Information/Paperwork Resources,\" the Commission's first general recommendation was that \"Executive agencies should establish comprehensive information plans that incorporate all the information needs and resources of the agency.\" Under the category of \"Strengthening the [OMB Paperwork] Clearance Process,\" the Commission's general recommendations were: Congress should remove all exemptions from the clearance requirements of the Federal Reports Act. Congress should consolidate the clearance function in a single place, but retain oversight of independent regulatory agency requests. Agencies should assume responsibility for 'clearing' forms when they have sufficient expertise to do so and should operate under OMB guidance. The Commission specifically recommended, \"an Executive order requiring all agencies \u2014 including those agencies now exempt from the Federal Reports Act \u2014 promptly to register their information gathering plans and programs with OMB.\"7 The Information Collection Budget President Carter responded to the recommendations of the Commission on Federal Paperwork by establishing a new procedure to permit more systematic executive review of 5 In 1968, P.L. 90-620 had codified the Federal Reports Act as Chapter 35 in Title 44 of the United States Code. In 1973, Chapter 35 was amended to provide that the General Accounting Office (GAO), rather than OMB, would review the collections of information proposed by the independent Federal regulatory agencies ( P.L. 93-153, Sec. 409, adding a new Section 3512 to Title 44). 6 Final Summary Report, Commission on Federal Paperwork, pg. 5. 7 Final Summary Report, Commission on Federal Paperwork, pp. 6, 16, 18, 51. 13 regulatory and other paperwork requirements imposed by agencies. On November 30, 1979, he issued Executive Order 12174, \"Paperwork,\" requiring each agency to establish an annual information collection budget. As he explained in his Message to Congress explaining the new Order: The Executive Order ... establishes strong management tools for the Executive agencies. First of all, it creates a 'paperwork budget.' Each agency will submit an annual estimate of the number of hours required to fill out all of its forms. The Office of Management and Budget will then hold agencies to that total or order it cut. The process will be similar to the spending budget; it will give agencies incentives to set priorities and to eliminate or streamline burdensome forms. 8 Following up on this Executive Order, OMB issued a proposed regulation on January 11, 1980, to guide agency implementation of Executive Order 12174 (and provide additional detail on how to prepare the annual information collection budget).9 Five months later, on June 19, 1980, OMB issued Bulletin 80-11, \"Fiscal Year 1981 Information Collection Budget Request,\" which instructed Federal agencies on how to prepare paperwork budgets for FY 1981 and submit them to OMB \"for review and possible modification and revision.\"10 The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 President Carter and OMB were not alone in responding to the 1977 recommendations of the Commission on Federal Paperwork. Six months after OMB issued its Bulletin instructing agencies how to prepare the 1981 Information Collection Budget, Congress passed and President Carter signed into law the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-511, the 1980 PRA), which took effect on April 1, 1981. The 1980 PRA strengthened OMB's paperwork oversight responsibilities in a number of ways. First, as recommended by the Commission on Federal Paperwork, the 1980 PRA expanded the scope of OMB review. The 1980 PRA eliminated all of the original agency 8 44 FR 69609, December 4, 1979. Section 1-104 of the Order states: \"Each agency shall prepare an annual paperwork budget, i.e., an estimate of the total number of hours required to comply with requests for information. The budget should itemize each form used, describe its purpose and identify those affected by it. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and may modify each agency's proposed budget. After the Director has approved an agency's paperwork budget, it may be increased only by the Director upon request of the head of the agency.\" 9 45 FR 2586. OMB also sought, consistent with Executive Order 12174, to clarify the applicability of the Federal Reports Act to agency rulemaking. Proposed Section 1320.22(a) specifically provided \"that provisions of regulation that involve information collections may not be issued as final or otherwise implemented\" until they obtain OMB approval. 10 As recommended by the Commission and as provided in Executive Order 12174, this Bulletin applied to two of the agencies exempt from OMB review under the Federal Reports Act, the Department of the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent regulatory agency. 14 exemptions from the Federal Reports Act, making subject to OMB review the regulatory paperwork of the Internal Revenue Service, bank regulatory agencies, and independent regulatory commissions (subject to an override of an OMB disapproval by a majority vote of the commission members). It also restored the OMB Director as the single point of authority for approving or disapproving Federal collections of information from the public, superseding the clearance functions of the General Accounting Office and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Congress specifically required that OMB review and approve the regulatory paperwork of Federal agencies,11 included recordkeeping requirements, and made clear that the Act applied to much more than statistical compilations of general public interest. Second, the 1980 PRA suggested that the \"top down\" approach of the Federal Reports Act should be blended with a \"bottom up\" approach stressing the responsibility of the Federal agencies themselves to oversee and manage their activities involving collection of information from the public. As stated in the report of the House Committee on Government Operations, \"[the 1980 PRA] clarifies the agencies' responsibilities by requiring agencies to eliminate duplication, minimize burden, and develop plans for tabulating data before they request OMB approval of proposed information requirements\" (H. Rpt. 96-835, p. 19). As explained in the report of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, [E]ach agency head is to appoint a highly ranking official who is to ensure that the agency carries out effectively its information activities. The Committee's intent is to establish an identifiable line of accountability for information management activities between the [OMB] Director and individual agencies and within agencies. Not only will this structure enable agencies to better manage their information resources , it enables Congress to pinpoint responsibility for information activities in any legislative oversight activities. For example, senior officials will be responsible for explaining how the related functions of information policy are integrated within an agency to manage information resources more efficiently and to minimize the information burden on the public (S. Rpt. 96-930, p.6). In other words, it became more explicit that it was each agency's responsibility to balance its need for a proposed data collection or other paperwork, and the practical utility of the information it might receive,12 against the burden imposed on respondents and the costs involved. 11 44 U.S.C. 3504(h) (1980 PRA). See remarks by Senator Edward Kennedy, 126 Cong. Rec. S14689 (November 19, 1980). 12 The 1980 PRA codified the concept of \"practical utility\" as a specific element in establishing agency need. 44 U.S.C. 3502(15) and 3508 (1980 PRA). This concept had been adopted by OMB in its February 10, 1976, Revision to Attachment A to OMB Circular No. A-40: \"Practical utility (as distinguished from potential utility) also includes the ability of the agency to use the information received. Particular care will be exercised by agencies to insure that, need for information notwithstanding, there are no limitations in staff, in capability to process the information in a timely and useful fashion, or other constraints on the likely use of the information.\" (page 5) 15 Third, the 1980 PRA established an opportunity for the public to make known its views concerning Federal data collection activities. Specifically, it required that agencies justify each proposed regulatory or other paperwork in writing and make their justification available for all to see. To facilitate this, the 1980 PRA required that agencies publish notices in the Federal Register when submitting a clearance request to OMB. Fourth, the 1980 PRA codified the Information Collection Budget process begun by President Carter, requiring OMB to send to Congress each year a report that included \"an analysis by agency ... describing the estimated reporting hours required of persons\" by Federal collections of information and \"a summary of accomplishments and planned initiatives to reduce burdens\" of these collections. 13 With this statutory authority, OMB developed, and continues to use, the Information Collection Budget as a tool for eliminating needless reporting requirements, cutting duplication, streamlining forms, and facilitating comprehensive executive review of agency information collection efforts. Publishing the Information Collection Budget After the 1980 PRA was enacted, but before it took effect, OMB published the first \"Information Collection Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1981.\" This 1981 Information Collection Budget (1981 ICB) called, in aggregate, for a 4 percent reduction in paperwork burden in FY 1981. The OMB Director, in his January 13, 1981, memorandum to President Carter transmitting the 1981 ICB, pointed out that President Carter's Administration had established an unprecedented planning and budgeting approach to paperwork control that \"treats all reporting and recordkeeping requirements imposed by the Federal Government as if they cause an expenditure of funds by the non-federal sector of our economy.\" As the 1981 ICB explained, The ICB represents the Federal Government's first attempt to establish a budgeting control process for non-fiscal resource allocations. Such allocations cover those Federal Government actions that play a significant role in the Federal fiscal budget. During periods of fiscal restraint Federal agencies rely more heavily on non-budget actions such as regulation and reporting requirements to accomplish their objectives. The ICB evolved from the concerns that Federal agencies have in the past considered the public's time in responding to Government requests for information to be a free commodity rather than a critical resource that should be managed, conserved and economized (Introduction, p. 2). On June 2, 1981, shortly after the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 took effect, the OMB Director issued Bulletin 81-20, \"Fiscal Year 1982 Information Collection Budget Request.\" OMB issued the 1982 ICB in December 1981. This 1982 ICB called, in aggregate, for a 12.8 percent reduction in paperwork burden in FY 1982. As the OMB Director explained 13 44 U.S.C. 3514(a) (3) & (4) (1980 PRA). See S. Rpt. 96-930, p. 54. 16 in his transmittal letter to the President, the purpose of the 1982 ICB was \"to limit the costs to individuals, private organizations, and State and local governments of filling out forms and records for the Federal Government.\" On September 8, 1982, OMB proposed a regulation designed to implement the 1980 PRA. 14 The proposed rule contained a general requirement for an annual ICB. 15 The preamble to this proposed rule explained the need for the ICB. It pointed out that OMB had a statutory obligation to inventory all collections of information and to set agency goals for reduction of burden, to \"evaluate progress toward its statutory goals of paperwork burden reduction,\" and \"report to Congress on estimated burdens of collection of information by agency and by categories within agencies.\" It also described the ICB as \"a management tool\" to help both OMB and the agencies \u2014 to enable OMB to carry out its statutory responsibilities and \"facilitate each agency's examination of its aggregate and comparative paperwork burdens upon the public.\" 16 The final OMB rule became effective on May 2, 1983.17 In 1986, Congress amended the 1980 PRA18 in a number of ways.19 The 1986 amendments also set government-wide paperwork burden reduction goals of 5% for FY 1986- 1989. The annual ICBs set individual goals for each agency. The aggregate of the individual agency goals for FY 1986 was -3.11%; FY 1995, +0.61%. In amending its implementing rule to reflect these 1986 amendments, OMB retained the requirement for an annual ICB. 20 14 47 FR 39515, 39516, September 8, 1982. This proposal sought to provide OMB oversight of paperwork \"over the entirety of the federal paperwork burden, regardless of the particular form or mechanism by which it is imposed.\" 47 FR 39519. 15 The 1980 PRA established Government-wide paperwork burden reduction goals of 15% (from enactment through FY 1982), and 10% (for FY 1983). The annual ICBs set individual goals for each agency. The aggregate of the individual agency goals for FY 1981 was -4%; FY 1320, 48 FR 13666 (March 31, 1983). This regulation \u2014 the first that OMB had issued to have agencies implement the paperwork clearance process \u2014 did much more than establish the annual ICB. 5 CFR 1320.10, 48 FR 13693. This regulation set forth the comprehensive scope of OMB review authority provided by the 1980 PRA, explicitly providing for OMB review of regulatory paperwork, labeling and disclosure requirements, agency audit guides, and requests for proposal or other procurement requirements. 18 The Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act of 1986, P.L. 99-500 (October 18, 1986) and P.L. 99-591 (October 30, 1986), section 101(m). 19 The 1986 amendments clarified the broad scope of the statute, increased the information the public was to receive in Federal Register notices concerning the OMB paperwork clearance process, and stressed the importance at the agencies of coordinated information resources management. Specifically, the 1986 amendment redefined \"information collection request\" in section 3502(11) (1980 PRA) to include a \"collection of information requirement.\" 20 5 CFR 1320.10, 53 FR 16618, 16627 (May 10, 1988). 17 The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 In 1995, Congress amended the 1980 PRA in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13, the 1995 PRA). This revision of the Paperwork Reduction Act had a number of stated purposes, including: To clarify that the Act \"applies to all Government-sponsored collections of information (including disclosure requirements), eliminating any confusion over the coverage of third-party paperwork burdens.\"21 To \"[r ]eaffirm the fundamental purpose of the [1980 PRA] \u2014 to minimize the Federal paperwork burdens imposed on the public by Government.\" To \"[e ]mphasize the fundamental responsibilities of each Federal agency to minimize paperwork burdens and foster paperwork reduction, by requiring a thorough review of each proposed collection of information for need and practical utility, the Act's fundamental standards, agency planning to maximize the use of information already available within Government or already collected by the public, and improved opportunity for public comment on a proposed paperwork requirement.\" To \"[s ]eek to reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on the public through better implementation of the annual government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 5 percent.\"22 The legislation passed the House by a vote of 418-0, and the Senate by a vote of 99-0. President Clinton signed the 1995 PRA into law on May 22, 1995, stating, \"[t]he Paperwork Reduction Act helps us to conquer a mountain of paperwork that is crushing our people and wasting a lot of time.\" As to the paperwork clearance process, the 1995 PRA stressed the responsibility of the Federal agencies to manage Federal paperwork, specifically strengthening the \"bottom up\" 21 S. Rpt. 104-8, p. 1. In 1990, the Supreme Court had limited the reach of OMB's paperwork clearance authority, ruling that OMB's authority to review and disapprove agency information collection activities was limited to information collected by the agency, and did not extend to third-party information disclosure requirements. Dole v. United States of America , 49 U.S. 26 (1990). Five years later, Congress superseded that decision. 22 S. Rpt. 104-8, pp. 1-2. The bill reported by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \"set an annual Government-wide goal ... of at least five percent\" (amending section 3505). The bill reported by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight changed this annual burden reduction goal to \"at least 10 percent\" (H. Rpt. 104-37). The Conference Report split the difference, setting the annual Government-wide goal at 10 percent for FY 1996 and FY 1997, and 5 percent for the next four fiscal years. The Conference Report noted, \"that the Government-wide paperwork reduction goal is calculated on the basis of a 'baseline' which is the aggregate paperwork burden imposed during the prior fiscal year. The conferees also noted that individual agency goals negotiated with OIRA [the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in OMB] may differ depending on the agency's potential to reduce the paperwork burden such agency imposes on the public. Goals negotiated with some agencies may substantially exceed the Government-wide goal, while those negotiated with other agencies may be substantially less\" (H. Rpt. 104-99, p. 32). 18 approach initiated in the 1980 PRA. The Chief Information Officer (CIO),23 an agency official independent of the agency's program office initiating or sponsoring information collection activities, is specifically required to evaluate the need for the information, its estimated burden, the agency's plans for management and use of the information, and whether each proposed collection meets the other requirements of the 1995 PRA. 24 The 1995 PRA also directed agencies to consult with the public on proposed collections of information and certify to OMB that the required procedures have been followed.25 The OMB implementing rule, consistent with the 1995 PRA, 26 continued the requirement for an annual ICB. 27 Specifically, the 1995 PRA requires that OMB approve each collection of information by a Federal agency before it can be implemented. Collections of information include (1) requests for information for transmission to the Government, such as application forms and written report forms, (2) recordkeeping requirements, and (3) third-party or public disclosure requirements. Many information collections, recordkeeping requirements, and third-party disclosure requirements are contained in or authorized by regulations as monitoring or enforcement tools, while others appear in written questionnaires and their accompanying instructions. An underlying goal of the 1995 PRA is to minimize the Federal paperwork burden on the public. At the same time, the 1995 PRA recognizes the importance of information to the successful completion of agency missions, and charges OMB with the responsibility of weighing the burdens of the collection on the public against the practical utility it will have for the agency. In general terms, the CIO in each agency is required to plan for the development of new collections of information and the extension of ongoing collections of information well in advance of sending the proposals to OMB. Advance planning is necessary because agencies need to estimate potential burdens on respondents, seek public comment through 60-day notice in the Federal Register, and thereafter submit their clearance requests to OMB for review and approval. In a paperwork clearance request, the agency needs to demonstrate to OMB that the collection of information is the least burdensome way of obtaining information necessary for the proper performance of its functions, that the collection is not duplicative of others, and that the 23 The \"senior official\" responsible for information resources management (see 44 U.S.C. 3506(a)(2)(A) and 44 U.S.C. 6(c) (1995 PRA)) was redesignated as \"Chief Information Officer\" in the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-106, section 5125(a). P.L. 104-106, section 5605(d) also amended 44 U.S.C. 3507(j)(2) (1995 PRA) to authorize emergency approvals of up to 180 days. 24 44 U.S.C. 3506(c) (1995 PRA). This responsibility of the CIO included a specific responsibility to consider, for small business, establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements that take into account the resources available to respondents. 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(3)(C) (1995 PRA). 25 44 U.S.C. 3506(c) (2) and (3) (1995 PRA). 26 The 1995 PRA set Government-wide paperwork burden reduction goals of 10% for FY 1996 and FY 1997, 1998-2001. The ICBs for FY 1996-1997 set individual goals for each agency. The aggregate of the individual agency goals for FY 1996 was -0.8%; and FY 1997, -1.8%. 27 OMB proposed a comprehensive amendment to its regulation implementing the 1995 PRA on June 8, 1995, 60 FR 30438, and issued it in final on August 29, 1995, 60 FR 44978 (with a correction page published on September 5, 1995, (60 FR 46149)). 19 collection has practical utility. Additionally, the agency is required to certify that a proposed collection of information \"reduces to the extent practicable and appropriate the burden\" on respondents,28 including, for small business, local government, and other small entities, the use of the techniques outlined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act.29 To alert the public that OMB review has begun, agencies publish a notice in the Federal Register of the agency's submission to OMB of a request for approval and tell the public how to comment to OMB regarding the request. The public \u2014 during OMB's review and at any other time \u2014 is to have full opportunity to make its views known concerning any Federal data collection, both as to its perceived practical utility and the reporting burdens involved. Under the 1995 PRA, OMB approval for an agency to use each data collection instrument can last a maximum of three years. Approval is evidenced by granting an OMB control number for the information collection instrument. The 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act - Lessons Learned When Congress reauthorized the Paperwork Reduction Act in 1995, it reaffirmed the Act's underlying goal of reducing reporting burdens that the Federal Government imposes on the public while seeking to ensure that the information that the Government collects and uses is of high quality. The 1995 PRA thus provides a framework for ensuring that Federal agencies obtain the information they need to provide services and protections for Americans in the most efficient manner possible. The 1995 PRA reinforces the central role of the agencies in achieving its objectives, while giving OMB responsibility for overseeing agency PRA compliance. As noted earlier, the 1995 PRA gives agency CIOs principal responsibility for managing agency information resources constructively. The Act also creates agency responsibilities to identify and address issues presented by individual information collections before they submit them to OMB for approval. The agencies follow procedures that include CIO review and coordination of information collections and a process by which they solicit and consider public comment on proposed collections, all before they submit information collection requests to OMB for review. The Act thus contemplates that agencies would do most of the work of developing information collections -- and revising them as necessary and appropriate -- before OMB reviews their submissions. As a result, agencies address paperwork utility and burden issues and resolve them before submitting their packages to OMB for review. However, the 1995 PRA specifically charges OMB with the responsibility of weighing the burden of an information collection on the public against the practical utility it will have for the agency. In reviewing the Federal Government's experience implementing the 1995 PRA, OMB has learned a number of lessons. First, the Government's reliance on information to provide 28 44 U.S.C. 3506(c) (3)(C). 29 5 U.S.C. chapter 6. 20 services and implement programs has continued to grow. Second, the need for agencies to perform their missions has in turn made it difficult to achieve the PRA's government-wide burden reduction goals. Finally, CIOs have confronted a number of challenges in meeting their PRA management responsibilities. The Government's Need for Information Continues to Grow. As discussed in Chapter 1, the Federal Government provides the American people with a wide array of protections and services. These include investing in education and training, strengthening health care, protecting the environment, ensuring a sound financial system, enforcing safety requirements, promoting useful research, and supporting the American armed forces. To carry out all of these responsibilities carefully and effectively, the Federal Government collects information. As noted above, Federal agencies must also balance their reliance on information - and the associated burden imposed on the public - against the policy objectives they pursue to meet the needs of the American people. For example, to implement fiscally prudent legislative measures that provide education and child tax benefits to working families who pay taxes, as well as other Tax Code changes targeted to improve fairness and promote economic growth, IRS must collect information on tax returns to ensure compliance with the tax collection provisions of the Tax Code. Moreover, new legislative initiatives and amendments to existing laws typically require more - not less - data collection by affected agencies. In addition, even in the absence of legislative changes, agency statutory and program responsibilities can expand over time due to a number of factors beyond the agency's direct control, such as economic growth and the number of people to be served. Since the PRA was first enacted in 1980, the size of the U.S. population has increased by over a quarter and U.S. gross domestic product has more than tripled. The 1995 PRA, in its core paperwork review provisions, recognizes that for a burden reduction target to be \"practicable,\" the target must be consistent with the ability of agencies to carry out their statutory and program responsibilities. While an underlying goal of the 1995 PRA is to minimize Federal paperwork burden on the public, it also affirms the importance of information to the successful completion of agency missions. Furthermore, the PRA charges OMB with the responsibility of weighing the burdens of information collection on the public against the practical utility the information will have for the agency. Specifically, the 1995 PRA provides that \"[b] efore approving a proposed collection of information, the [OMB] Director shall determine whether the collection of information by the agency is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information shall have practical utility.\" 30 Under this authority, if an agency information collection request meets the practical utility, burden, and other PRA criteria for approval, OMB will approve it in accordance with the PRA, notwithstanding the effect of this approval on burden reduction targets. The 1995 Act does not grant OMB the authority to disapprove a collection of information simply because an approval would cause the agency to exceed the agency's paperwork burden reduction goal stated in the ICB. Burden Reduction Goals Continue to be Difficult to Achieve. To encourage agencies to achieve the fundamental purposes of the PRA, the 1995 Act reinstituted a requirement that OMB, in consultation with the agencies, establish \"annual agency goals\" to reduce paperwork 30 44 U.S.C. 3508. 21 burden on the public to the \"maximum practicable\" extent \"in each agency.\" These goals called for government-wide reductions of paperwork burdens of 10 percent for FY 1996 and FY 1997, and 5 percent for each of the four following years, FY 1998-2001. The goals served to stimulate agency efforts to reduce paperwork burdens and were implemented through the annual process by which OMB and the agencies developed the Information Collection Budget. Due to a variety of factors, including those discussed above , agencies did not achieve the 1995 PRA's Governementwide burden reduction goals.31 Although this record may be disappointing, it is important to consider the nature and purpose of these goals. The decision to set targets at 5 and 10 percent was not based on an analysis of the amount of burden reduction that agencies could and should achieve. Rather, Congress set goals that agencies should aspire to meet while also performing their missions. Under the PRA, burden reduction can be achieved only to the extent that it does not interfere with agencies' ability to meet their programmatic responsibilities. This constraint has affected the Government's historical performance on burden reduction. Since the initial passage of the Paperwork Reduction Act in 1980, the aggregate of the agencies' annual paperwork burden reduction goals has met the statutorily set government-wide goal in only one year - 1982. CIOs Face Challenges in Meeting Their PRA Responsibilities. In making CIOs accountable for evaluating agencies' need for information, estimating reporting burdens, and generally overseeing agency plans for the management and use of information, Congress ensures that senior agency management is focused on PRA compliance. Since the passage of the 1995 PRA, however, CIO responsibilities have expanded, largely as a result of increased E- Gov activities. The attention CIOs pay to information technology, in turn, has made it more difficult for CIOs to focus on their PRA responsibilities. While the objectives of agency IT initiatives overlap considerably with those of the PRA - for example, reducing reporting burdens and disseminating information more efficiently - CIO resources are spread over more areas than was the case when the 1995 PRA was enacted. Moreover, OMB's process for reviewing agency information collection requests has proven to be labor-intensive for CIOs and their staffs. The PRA clearance process, for example, includes a public notice of a 60-day public comment period and a second notice of a 30-day OMB review. This workload has been exacerbated by the three-year OMB approval cycle. Currently, OIRA reviews roughly 3,000 PRA clearance packages a year, only a quarter of which are first-time requests to collect information. If the current limit on OMB approval time was extended, agencies would process fewer information collections annually. For example, a four- year OMB approval period would reduce the number of annual OMB clearances by about 19 percent. 31The annual ICBs established individual goals for each agency. The aggregate of the individual agency goals for FY 1996 was -0.77%; FY 2001 +1.1%. 22 Chapter 3. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION DISSEMINATED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES Federal agencies have disseminated information to the public since their inception. Until recently, agencies have dispersed information principally by making paper copies of documents available to the public. In recent years, Federal information dissemination has grown due to the advent of the Internet, which has ushered in a revolution in communications. The Internet has enabled Federal agencies to distribute an ever-increasing amount of information. Congress has strongly encouraged the Executive Branch's distribution efforts in statutes that include particular dissemination activities and in the government-wide dissemination provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA). 32 In addition, the Executive Branch's strong support for information distribution is reflected in the dissemination provisions of OMB Circular A-130, \"Management of Federal Information Resources.\" In December 2000, Congress directed OMB to issue government-wide guidelines to ensure and maximize the quality of information disseminated by Federal agencies. Specifically, Congress directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue, by September 30, 2001, government-wide guidelines that \"provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.\" 33 These OMB guidelines are to: (1) apply to the sharing by Federal agencies of, and access to, information disseminated by Federal agencies; and (2) require that each Federal agency to which the guidelines apply- (A) issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by the agency, by not later than 1 year after the date of issuance of the guidelines under subsection (a); (B) establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the guidelines issued under subsection (a); and (C) report periodically to the Director- (i) the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding the accuracy of information disseminated by the agency; and 32 44 U.S.C. chapter 35. 33 Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106- 554; H.R. 5658). For the text of these information quality guidelines, see Appendix A. 23 (ii) how such complaints were handled by the agency. The Problem of Poor Quality Information Even before Congress passed the Information Quality Act34, there was substantial evidence that the quality of the information advanced for use by government decision-makers needed to be improved. In the scholarly literature on what is called \"science-policy,\" there are entire books of case studies demonstrating technical problems with the information collected, used and published by Federal regulatory agencies. Science is an evolutionary process where the work of one scienti st is enhanced by the criticism of others. In addition, the scientific data may be ambiguous, allowing several equally plausible interpretations. Ensuring sufficient quality for information is an organizational challenge motivated by the reality that scientists and analysts are not perfect. Through the Information Quality Act and the OMB guidelines, OIRA will work with Federal agencies to improve the quality of information disseminated by Federal agencies, including disseminations that must convey scientific ambiguity. Principles Underlying OMB's Guidelines In developing the guidelines to implement this legislative provision, OMB recognized that Federal agencies disseminate many types of information in many different ways. Even numerous examples can only begin to describe the breadth of information disseminated by the Federal Government. Agencies disseminate statistical information, such as the aggregated information from the 2000 Census and the monthly and quarterly economic reports issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Agencies disseminate information that aids members of the public in their daily activities, such as the National Weather Service's weather reports and the Federal Aviation Administration's air travel advisories. Agencies disseminate information that they collect from regulated entities, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's dissemination of Toxic Release Inventory information. Agencies also disseminate information that they create or obtain in the course of developing regulations, often involving scientific research and economic analysis. Agencies disseminate information when they issue reports and studies. Moreover, agencies provide the public with basic descriptions of agency authorities, activities and programs, along with contact information for the public to interact with and access that information or those services. Recognizing the wide variety of information that Federal agencies disseminate and the wide variety of dissemination practices that agencies have, OMB developed the guidelines with several principles in mind. First, OMB designed the guidelines to apply to a wide variety of government-wide dissemination activities, ranging in importance and scope, through each agency's issuance of guidelines tailored to that agency's programs, dissemination activities, and information resources 34Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106- 554; H.R. 5658). 24 management and administrative practices. OMB has also designed its guidelines to be generic enough to fit all media, whether they are printed, electronic, or other form. OMB has sought to avoid the problems that would be inherent in attempting to develop detailed, prescriptive, \"one-size-fits-all\" government-wide guidelines that would artificially require different types of dissemination activities to be treated in the same manner. Second, OMB designed the guidelines so that agencies will meet basic information quality standards. Given the administrative mechanisms required by the legislative provision as well as the standards set forth in the PRA, it is clear that agencies should not disseminate information that does not meet some basic level of quality. OMB recognizes that some government information may need to meet higher or more specific information quality standards than those that would apply to other types of government information. The more important the information, the higher the quality standards to which it should be held. The guidelines recognize, however, that information quality comes at a cost. Accordingly, the agencies should weigh the costs (for example, including costs attributable to agency processing effort, respondent burden, maintenance of needed privacy, and assurances of suitable confidentiality) and the benefits of higher information quality in the development of such information, and the level of quality to which the information disseminated will be held. Third, OMB designed the guidelines so that agencies can apply them in a common-sense and workable manner. It is important that these guidelines do not impose unnecessary administrative burdens that would inhibit agencies from continuing to take advantage of the Internet and other technologies to disseminate information that can be of great benefit and value to the public. In this regard, OMB encourages agencies to rely, to the extent possible, upon existing agency processes for evaluating information dissemination activities rather than require the creation of new and potentially duplicative or contradictory processes. The primary example of this is that the proposed guidelines recognize that, in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, agencies already have in place well-established information quality standards and administrative mechanisms that allow concerned individuals or organizations to seek and obtain correction of information that is maintained and disseminated by the agency. Under the guidelines, agencies may continue to rely on such administrative mechanisms if they satisfy the standards in the guidelines. Similarly, agencies may rely on their implementation of the Federal Government's computer security laws (formerly, the Computer Security Act, and now the computer security provisions of the PRA) to establish appropriate security safeguards for ensuring the \"integrity\" of the information that the agencies disseminate. In summary, the OMB information quality guidelines apply to Federal agencies subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. Agencies are directed to develop information resources management procedures for reviewing and substantiating (by documentation or other means selected by the agency) the quality (including the objectivity, utility, and integrity) of information before it is disseminated. In addition, agencies are to establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, correction of information disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the OMB or agency guidelines. Consistent with the underlying principles described above, these guidelines stress the importance of having agencies apply these standards and develop their administrative mechanisms so they can be implemented in a common-sense and workable manner. Moreover, 25 agencies should apply these standards flexibly, and in a manner appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the information to be disseminated, and incorporate them into existing agency information resources management and administrative practices. Defining Quality. The legislative provision denotes four substantive terms regarding information disseminated by Federal agencies: quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity. It is not always clear how each substantive term relates - - or how the four terms in aggregate relate - - to the widely divergent types of information that agencies disseminate. The guidelines provide definitions that attempt to establish a clear meaning so that both the agency and the public can readily judge whether a particular type of information to be disseminated does or does not meet these attributes. In the guidelines, OMB defines \"qua lity\" as the encompassing term, of which \"utility,\" \"objectivity,\" and \"integrity\" are the constituents. \"Utility\" refers to the usefulness of the information to the intended users. \"Objectivity\" focuses on whether the disseminated information is being presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner, and as a matter of substance, is accurate, reliable, and unbiased. \"Integrity\" refers to security -- the protection of information from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification. OMB recognizes that information quality is costly to achieve and encourages agencies to think of the social value of better information in different contexts. In this regard, the OMB guidelines draw a conceptual distinction between \"influential\" information and ordinary information and require agencies to subject \"influential\" information to higher standards of quality -- standards that presumably will be more costly for the agencies, analysts and researchers to achieve. The OMB guidelines also provide agencies ample authority to reject complaints by affected parties that are groundless or that boil down to a difference of opinion. With several important exceptions and qualifications, the O MB guidelines require that influential information disseminated by agencies be reproducible by qualified third parties. If influential information is to be disseminated without the capability of reproduction, it is subject to some special robustness and transparency requirements. Nonetheless, the guidelines provide agencies a measure of flexibility in the interpretation and implementation of these expectations. With regard to scientific, financial and statistical information that is likely to impact important public policies -- \"influential\" information -- the OMB guidelines provide an initial framework for considering the quality of original data. Agencies are in the best position to establish specific quality standards for the generation of original and supporting data, and thus details are left to agency guidelines. In the case of analytical results, the guidelines insist that such results be reproducible by qualified third parties, barring exceptional circumstances. OMB's guidelines should be see n as only scratching the surface of a complex area. Consequently, OMB has organized several interagency panels and has encouraged agencies to commission two workshops at the National Research Council, where the issues can be addressed in more depth. 26 The first workshop on \"Ensuring the Quality of Data Disseminated by the Federal Government\" was hosted by the Science, Technology, and Law Program of the National Academy of Sciences on March 21-22, 2002. Over three hundred registrants from a wide variety of Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, and private sector firms participated. The first workshop provided a broad overview of the intent, scope and applicability of the guidelines, and then focused on the administrative procedures for handling complaints and the threshold for determining influential scientific, statistical, and financial information. The second workshop, scheduled for May 30, 2002, will focus on standards of transparency, reproducibility, and peer review for influential information, and risk information regarding human health, safety, and the environment. Specific Efforts to Improve the Quality of Agency Information Dissemination . OMB's efforts to improve the quality of information that agencies disseminate are not limited to the issuance of the information quality guidelines described above. As the occasion arises, OMB also takes steps to encourage agencies to improve the quality of specific kinds of information. One way that OMB accomplishes this is through sending an ag ency a \"prompt\" letter. The purpose of a prompt letter is to suggest an issue that OMB believes is worthy of agency priority. A prompt letter is sent on OMB's initiative and contains a suggestion for how the agency could improve its regulations or other matters. Under the PRA, OMB reviews and approves all collections of information conducted by Federal agencies in order to ensure, among other things, that the data collected have practical utility. In furtherance of that PRA responsibility, OMB recently sent a prompt letter urging that an agency improve the quality of the dissemination of a specific category of information. In the letter sent on March 4, 2002, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) requested that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enhance its Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), an annual measure of chemical releases by facilities. In sending this letter, OIRA Administrator John D. Graham noted, \"TRI data is widely used by communities and companies throughout the country, and has been credited with stimulating, through voluntary actions, a significant reduction in pollution from industrial facilities. The Administration is committed to increasing the utility of this information.\" OIRA suggested several ways EPA might improve the dissemination of TRI data35: It recommended that the agency expedite the release of TRI data by making a greater use of electronic reporting. The OIRA Administrator noted, \"The 35 TRI data are collected under authority of Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986. Additional reporting requirements were included in the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Under the TRI program, covered facilities are required to report annually on their release, broken down by environmental media (for example, air, land and water) and waste management activities (for example, treatment and recycling) of over 600 listed toxic chemicals. For calendar year 1999, the most recent year for which data are currently available, over 22,000 facilities filed 84,000 chemical release reports. These reports are widely used by government agencies, academic researchers, environmental organizations, and members of the public to track the release of toxic chemicals into the environment. 27 --increased use of electronic reporting reduces the quality control burden on the agency and should allow quicker processing of the data for the public's benefit.\" In recent years, there has been a considerable lag in the delivery of TRI data. Official TRI numbers for the year 2000 will not be released until this spring almost a year after EPA received the data. OIRA also encouraged EPA to assign a common identification number to each facility, so performance data could be presented for specific facilities. Community organizations have supported this concept in the past. 28 Chapter 4. Expanding E-Government \"Simply put, our goal is to make your Government more accessible to all Americans.\" -- President George W. Bush, March 2002 In his February 2002 budget submission to Congress, President Bush outlined a management agenda for making Government more focused on citizens and results, which includes expanding Electronic Government. E-Government uses improved technology, including the tools of the Internet, to make it easy for citizens and businesses to interact with the Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline business-to-Government transactions. The President's E-Government Strategy, released by the Office of Management and Budget, has identified 24 high-payoff, cross-agency E-Government initiatives to integrate agency operations and information technology investments. These initiatives will eliminate redundant systems and significantly improve the Government's quality of service for citizens and businesses. This strategy focuses on four citizen-centered groups, each providing opportunities to transform delivery of services. Individuals/Citizens: Government-to-Citizens (G2C): Build easy to find, easy to use, one-stop points-of-service that make it easy for citizens to access high-quality government services. Businesses: Government-to-Business (G2B): Reduce Government's burden on businesses by eliminating redundant collection of data and better leveraging E-business technologies for communication. Intergovernmental: Government-to-Government (G2G): Make it easier for States and localities to meet reporting requirements and participate as full partners with the Federal Government in citizen services, while enabling better performance measurement, especially for grants. Other levels of government will see significant administrative savings and will be able to improve program delivery because more accurate data is available in a timely fashion. Intra-governmental: Internal Efficiency and Effectiveness (IEE): Make better use of modern technology to reduce costs and improve quality of Federal Government agency administration, by using industry best practices in areas such as supply-chain management, financial management and knowledge management. Agencies will be able to improve effectiveness and efficiency, eliminating delays in processing and improving employee satisfaction and retention. Government to Citizen Portfolio EZ Tax Filing (Agency Managing Partner: Treasury/IRS) The initiative would make it easier for citizens to files taxes in a Web-enabled environment. 29 Value to Citizen: Citizens will no longer have to pay for basic, automated tax preparation. Refund checks will be delivered sooner, on-line security will be increased and customer service will be improved. Value to the Government: More information is delivered electronically, reducing data errors. A higher percentage of tax forms are filled out correctly, reducing customer follow-up. Call center receives fewer calls, reducing staffing costs. GovBenefits (Formally Eligibility Assistance On-line): (Agency Managing Partner: Department of Labor) Through a common Internet portal, citizens (with a focus on high-need demographic groups) will have an on-line tool for identifying government benefit programs from which they may be eligible to receive assistance. Value to Citizen: Each citizen attempting to determine benefits eligibility should save approximately 50 minutes by using this service over current services. Citizens can also learn about benefits they were eligible to receive but might not know about. Value to the Government: Customer service calls will be reduced by approximately 750,000 a year, and the Government will save approximately $4 million a year through eliminating redundancy. Recreation One-Stop (Agency Managing Partner: DOI) This initiative will build upon \"Recreation.gov\" and will provide a one-stop, searchable database of recreation areas nationwide, featuring on-line mapping and integrated transactions, including on-line campground reservations and the purchase of recreational passes, maps and other products. The project will include links to recreational opportunities provided by all levels of government. Value to Citizen: A single source of information through a simpler and more user-friendly site will reduce search time and provide better service to citizens. The value of the service will increase through more detailed information and the ability to conduct transactions on-line. Users will be able to find information and conduct transactions at a single site, rather than searching through multiple agency Web sites. Value to the Government: Through reduced duplication, increased sales and employee timesavings, this project should save Federal agencies approximately $5 million annually in avoided costs. 30 On-line Access for Loans (Agency Managing Partner: Education) The On-line Access for Loans initiative allows citizens and businesses to find the loan programs that meet their needs. Value to Citizen: Citizens will have faster, easier access to loan information and transactions. Value to the Government: Employees will save time in managing the loan process. USA Services (Agency Managing Partner: GSA) The USA Services initiative will use best practices in customer relationship management to enable citizens to quickly obtain service on-line, while improving responsiveness and consistency across government agencies. This E-Government Strategy will enable citizens to personalize the combination of services they obtain across multiple programs and agencies in a privacy-protected environment. Value to Citizen: More timely and helpful customer service and more consistent customer service across lines of communication and government programs. Value to the Government: Redundancy of operation will be eliminated across agencies and employees will save time operating customer relationship management tools. Government to Business Portfolio One-Stop Business Compliance Information (Agency Managing Partner: SBA) This initiative would provide information on laws and regulations that can help users understand compliance information. It would also offer wizards and tutorials to help users determine if rules apply to them and how to proceed. To the maximum extent possible, permits would be completed, submitted and approved on-line. Value to Citizen: Currently, the regulatory burden on small business is $7,000 per employee. The creation of a single, cross-agency, business compliance portal will reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector. Value to the Government: Streamlined business processes and economies of scale would reduce agency costs for achieving business compliance. Government-wide savings of an estimated $10 to $20 million could be realized after full implementation. Additional savings would be realized as a result of staff reductions from on-line permitting. 31 On-line Rulemaking Management (Agency Managing Partner: DOT) This initiative will provide access to the rulemaking process for citizens anytime, anywhere. An existing \"e-Docket\" system would be expanded and enhanced to serve as a government-wide system for agency dockets. Other agency systems would use the system by creating \"storefronts\" consistent with statutory requirements for each agency under the Administrative Procedure Act. Comments would be organized using knowledge management tools to improve the quality of rules. Value to Citizen: A single portal for businesses and citizens to access the rulemaking process, creating a more collaborative and transparent atmosphere in which to make policy and public safety decisions. It will also improve the quality of policy decision-making by increasing citizen and business participation in the rulemaking process. Public participation is estimated to increase by 600 percent. Value to the Government: Elimination of duplicative and redundant systems that currently exist or are being developed. Estimated $9.75 million in savings from consolidating space and FTE costs for 57 rulemaking agencies. Without a government-wide e-Docket system, the Federal Government will expend nearly $1 billion in development and annual operational costs. Expanding Electronic Tax Products for Businesses (Agency Managing Partner: Treasury /IRS) This initiative's goals include decreasing the number of tax-related forms that an employer must file, providing timely and accurate tax information to employers, increasing the availability of electronic tax filing and modeling simplified Federal and State tax employment laws. Value to Citizen: Reduce the burden of compliance with tax laws for businesses. Upon implementation, this initiative offers cost savings of up to $182 per year, per small business. Aggregated, small businesses stand to save up to $6.4 billion over six years. Benefits to large and mid-sized companies should be greater as they tend to spend considerably more time and effort on tax preparation. Value to the Government: Increases the accuracy and reliability of tax data, while decreasing the costs associated with paper processing. IRS and SSA may save $16 million annually in staff and printing/mailing costs. It also reduces the costs to States for processing wage and tax data by 5.6 percent. Federal Asset Sales (Agency Managing Partner: GSA) Prospective customers will be able to find assets that they are interested in, regardless of the agency that holds those assets. Customers will be able to bid and/or make purchases electronically for financial, real and disposable assets. 32 Value to Citizen: The creation of a single, easy-to-find point of access, rather than 150 disparate sites, will lower transaction costs and make it easier to do business with the Government. Value to the Government: An estimated $15 million may be saved by consolidating 150 Federal Web sites. Additional potential cost savings of approximately $750 million annually associated with the costs of excess building space could be achieved. International Trade Process Streamlining ( Agency Managing Partner: DOC) The initiative will create a single customer-focused site where new or existing exporters could be assisted electronically through the entire export process. The 20 current Web sites would be organized and accessed through a single entry point. Value to Citizen: The average export transaction by small to medium exporters (SME) is $400,000. If 224,000 SMEs increase even by a small amount, exports might increase by a billion dollars or more. Value to the Government: Could streamline 19 agencies involved in trade promotion. Consolidated Health Informatics (business case) (Agency Managing Partner: HHS) The initiative will provide the basis for a simplified and unified system for sharing and reusing medical record information among government agencies and their private healthcare providers and insurers. It would enable a single mechanism for making those records accessible. Value to Citizen: Reduce private sector healthcare expenditures for administration (accounts for $57 billion) and improve healthcare for one-half of the population of the United States. Value to the Government: Order of magnitude savings (from days to minutes) are possible in the area of managing, transporting, copying and exchanging paper medical records. Upon full implementation, this initiative could result in savings of up to $100 million. Government to Government Portfolio E-Grants (Agency Managing Partner: HHS) This initiative will create an electronic grants portal for grant recipients and the grant-making agencies that will streamline, simplify and provide an electronic option for grants management across the Government. This effort will include the work of the 26 Federal grant-making agencies to implement P.L.106-107. 33 Value to Citizen: A single grant portal will simplify the application process and increase awareness of grant opportunities resulting in a reduction of time spent preparing and searching for grants. Value to the Government: Save $1 billion in Federal funds currently devoted to the administration of grants. Consolidated Web site will save as much as $20 million in postage costs. Geospatial Information One-Stop (Agency Managing Partner: DOI) The Geospatial Information One-Stop will provide access to the Federal Government's spatial data assets in a single location and help make State and local spatial data assets more accessible. Federal agencies will also make their planned and future spatial data activities available to State and local governments to promote collaboration and reduce duplicative efforts. Data standards developed through an intergovernmental process will result in data that can be used multiple times for multiple purposes, saving taxpayer money. It will also help empower the private sector by communicating the characteristics of a desired standardized data product. Value to Citizen: Standardized and reliable spatial data can help save hundreds of millions of dollars annually through consolidation and coordination of spatial data acquisition and maintenance. It will reduce search time for geospatial assets from weeks to minutes. Lastly, it can help improve and expedite citizen service by making data more readily available to agencies requiring that information to perform their governmental functions. Value to the Government: Full deployment will result in easier, more reliable access to spatial data that should result in hundreds of millions of dollars saved annually by eliminating redundant data collection and increasing opportunities for cost-sharing partnerships. Consolidation and coordination of spatial data assets are critical enablers for other E-Government initiatives, as well as for the Homeland Security effort. Disaster Assistance and Crisis Response (Agency Managing Partner: FEMA) This initiative involves a public, one-stop portal containing information from applicable public and private organizations involved in disaster preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. This portal will also serve as a single point of application for all disaster assistance programs. Value to Citizen : Accurate and timely data may result in saved lives and reduction in property damage. Tens of millions of dollars will be saved in the reduction of insurance costs and lawsuits. A single point of application for disaster assistance will save time during the application and disbursement process. Value to the Government: Elimination of redundant programs and administrative costs in agencies that provide disaster assistance. 34 Wireless Public SAFEty Interoperable COMmunications/ Project SAFECOM (Agency Managing Partner: Treasury) For public safety officials to be effective in their daily responsibilities, as well as before, during and after an emergency event, public safety agencies throughout all levels of government, i.e., Federal, State and local, must be able to communicate with each other. This initiative will address the Nation's critical shortcomings in efforts by public safety agencies to achieve interoperability and eliminate redundant wireless communications infrastructures. At the same time, it would assist State and local interoperability and interoperability between Federal public safety networks. Value to Citizen: Coordinated public safety/law enforcement communication will result in saved lives, as well as better managed disaster response. Consolidated networks will yield cost savings through reduction in communication devices, management overhead of multiple networks, maintenance and training. Value to the Government: Billions of dollars could be saved through a right-sized set of consolidated, interoperable Federal networks, linked to State wireless networks, resulting in a reduction in communications infrastructure, overhead, maintenance and training. e-Vital (business case) (Agency Managing Partner: SSA) This initiative will expand the existing vital records on-line data exchange efforts between Federal agencies and State governments. Value to Citizen: Eliminates burden imposed on citizens to obtain and delivers vital record information from local government to the Federal Government. Enables more efficient and effective benefit qualification. Value to the Government: Save millions of dollars annually through fraud detection from computer matching programs as well as from reductions in erroneous payments. Internal Efficiency and Effectiveness Portfolio e-Training ( Agency Managing Partner: OPM) This initiative will provide a repository of government -owned courseware to be made available to all governments (Federal, State and local), to provide high interest and government- required training to government employees at economies of scale pricing. In addition, this would foster development of communities of practice. This initiative supports achievement of the President's Human Capital initiative. 35 Value to Citizen : Easy one-stop access to just-in-time training with more effective development and retention of high-quality, diversified work force. Value to the Government: Low-cost delivery of effective training. Recruitment One-Stop (Agency Managing Partner: OPM) This initiative will improve the Federal hiring process by improving the functionality of the Federal automated employment information system. It would provide job seekers with streamlined resume submission, on-line feedback about their status in the employment process and integration with automated assessment tools. The initiative will provide Federal employers with a searchable resume database. Value to Citizen: This process will allow job seekers to enter their resume information once to apply for multiple Federal vacancies and to receive up-to-the-minute information regarding the status of their application(s). Value to the Government: This process will give agencies broader and faster access to resumes and the automated tools needed to select candidates. It makes the Government a competitive player with the private sector in the recruitment market. Enterprise HR Integrations Integrated Human Resources and e-Clearance (Agency Managing Partner: OPM) This initiative will eliminate the need for paper employee records, enable strategic decisions regarding the use of human capital and financial resources to improve agency performance and address emerging needs. It will also allow for the electronic transfer of HR data throughout the Federal sector, better protect the rights and benefits of the Federal workforce and streamline and improve government-wide reporting and data analyses. It will reduce the time required to seek and access employee and contractor security clearance information. Value to Citizen: Improves services and protects the rights and benefits of the Federal workforce and provides faster security clearances. Value to the Government: Streamlines reporting, reduces dependency on paper- based processes, while improving HR capabilities and communications, all at a lower cost. e- Payroll/HR (Payroll Processing Consolidation) (Agency Managing Partner: OPM) This initiative will simplify and unify elements of the Payroll/HR process in order to consolidate and integrate HR and payroll systems across Government. This effort will provide several hundred million dollars of savings to organizations and significantly reduce future information technology (IT) investments and could foster direct privatization. This initiative supports achievement of the five dimensions of the President's Management Agenda. 36 Value to Citizen: A Government that works more efficiently is one that better serves its citizens. Value to the Government: Allows the Federal Government to consolidate payroll operations to simplify and unify processes, thus saving dollars that would be spent on multiple facilities, systems and management. e-Travel (Agency Managing Partner: GSA) Agencies will use a common travel management system throughout the Federal Government. Existing travel management resources will be consolidated and processes will be simplified for cheaper, more efficient operation. Value to Citizen: One-stop integrated travel services for all Federal employees. Value to the Government: Reduced cycle time and improved travel and budget information at a lower cost. Integrated Acquisition Environment (Agency Managing Partner: GSA) Agencies will begin sharing common data elements to enable other agencies to make more informed procurement, logistical, payment and performance assessment decisions. It will also allow agencies to make maximum use of E-market approaches. Value to Citizen: Cost savings to the taxpayer based on a more effective process that leverages scale with more supplier opportunities. Value to the Government: Will make the purchase of goods and services faster and less expensive, while providing more access to small business. Electronic Records Management ( Agency Managing Partner: NARA) This initiative will provide the tools that agencies will need to manage their records in electronic form, addressing specific areas of electronic records management where agencies are having major difficulties. This project will provide guidance on electronic records management applicable government-wide and will provide tools for agencies to transfer electronic records to NARA in a variety of data types and formats so that they may be preserved for future use by the Government and citizens. Value to Citizen: Easier process for creating information, with more reliable storage, that is also in compliance with the Federal Records Act . Value to the Government: More efficient operations that meet the statutory requirements of the Federal Records Act. 37 Initiatives That Address Barriers to E-Government Success e-Authentication (Agency Managing Partner: GSA (Infrastructure)) e-Authentication will build and enable the mutual trust needed to support widespread use of electronic interactions between the public and Government and across governments. This will establish a method for satisfactorily establishing \"identity,\" without which the promise of E- Government will never reach its full potential. The project will establish common interoperable authentication solutions for all of the E- Government initiatives. Value to Citizen: Secure, consistent method of proving identity to the Federal Government. Value to the Government: Eliminate redundancy in electronic signature technology and policy operations, thereby reducing costs and employee time required. Federal Architecture (Agency Managing Partner: OMB) This activity, which supports all of the initiatives, will map government processes by line of business. It will develop information, data and application interface standards to eliminate redundancies and yield improved operating efficiency and effectiveness. Value to Citizen: Citizens are best served by an efficient and effective Government. Value to the Government: A well architected Federal information system will provide a more efficient and effective Government by eliminating redundancies. 38 Case Studies in Burden Reduction The following initiatives have been identified as case studies to showcase how the 24 e- Government initiatives can significantly reduce the burden on citizens and businesses. EZ Tax Filing Each year the IRS receives well over 200 million tax returns and over 1.3 billion information returns (e.g., W-2s, 1098s, 1099s), issues 92 million individual refunds, handles over 108 million taxpayer assistance calls, and collects $1.9 trillion. Each year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) receives well over 200 million tax returns. The majority of these transactions are submitted by standard mail, not electronic filing. While electronic filing is easier and can reduce the amount of time taxpayers spend filling out their returns, it requires citizens to purchase commercial software products that cost an average of $12.50. Thus, the burden on taxpayers who choose electronic filing has not been eliminated; it has simply been shifted from time to cost. The Federal Government requires the public to file taxes and is responsible for the tax code's complexity, but the Government also must be responsible for making tax filing as easy as possible. EZ File will reduce the burden on taxpayers who choose electronic filing by removing the costs to the public of filing and preparing taxes electronically. Under this initiative, taxpayers will be able to use the Internet to input data on-line and file their taxes quickly and easily. EZ File, an industry partnership, will give most individuals the option to file and prepare his or her tax return online for free. In addition to removing costs to the public of filing and preparing taxes electronically, EZ File and the resulting movement of paper to electronic filers will reduce IRS and Department of the Treasury processing costs. Existing electronic filing programs for the 1040 tax form family, including the 1040EZ and 1040A, already reduce direct processing labor costs to approximately 4 cents per return - a savings of roughly $1.20 per return over paper costs. 36 This figure is only a fraction of total process savings. Further transitioning taxpayers to electronic filing will enable the IRS to re-deploy labor resources to customer service activities. In addition, electronic filing is far less prone to error than traditional paper returns -- a benefit to both the public and the Government. GovBenefits (Formally Eligibility Assistance On-line) Over 80 million people receive government benefits through hundreds of Federal domestic assistance programs and federally funded programs managed by State and local governments. Currently, information about these programs is spread across 31 million Federal Government web pages. Over 80 million people receive government benefits through hundreds of Federal domestic assistance programs (e.g., Social Security) and federally funded programs managed by State and local governments (e.g., unemployment insurance). Yet, there is no single on-line 36 IRS Study Cost of Electronic Filing, March 2000 39 information source where citizens can go to determine which benefits they are eligible to receive. To obtain benefit information on-line today, citizens must know which agency operates the program they are interested in or face the prospect of navigating through a maze of government websites to obtain the information they need. GovBenefits will provide potential beneficiaries, local aid providers, and others instant access to eligibility information for all government benefit programs and services through a single website, GovBenefits.gov. The initial site release, scheduled for April 2002, will provide descriptions and contact information for specific Federal benefit programs. GovBenefits.gov users will also be able to access an easy-to-use on-line screening tool to determine their eligibility for a range of government programs by answering basic questions about items such as age, income, marital or employment status. Future releases will gradually include all government benefit programs. Further enhancements will include site features that move beyond benefits search and information distribution to enable individuals to apply for benefits on-line. Another feature being contemplated is giving interested persons the ability to create personalized profiles through which they can review the status of applications and claims, and receive important information about benefit program developments. GovBenefits will slash the time and frustration individuals now must devote to seeking the information they need about government benefit programs. It will also create a direct link between beneficiaries and specific programs of interest, which will increase citizen satisfaction and improve benefit service delivery. Additionally, GovBenefits will improve the ability of government agencies to assess program performance and penetration into targeted population groups and pinpoint duplicative or redundant services, which will create new opportunities for more efficient resource allocation. One-Stop Business Compliance Information American businesses, particularly small businesses, must comply with numerous Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), the average \"highly regulated\" business (e.g., restaurants, gas stations, dry cleaners) needs to apply for, and receive, an average of 10 to 15 licenses and permits. Determining which laws and regulations apply -- and submitting the appropriate information to ensure compliance -- can be difficult, time-consuming, and ultimately very costly for businesses of every size. Complying with laws and regulations costs small firms nearly half a trillion dollars, or $7,000 per employee in firms with fewer than 20 employees, according to the SBA. Business Compliance One-Stop will help businesses by creating a one-stop point of service web portal where they can easily access information about laws and regulations. The site, which will initially focus on four areas (environment, workplace health and safety, employment, and taxes) will provide businesses with the following: 40 Information about Laws and Regulations. Businesses will be able to easily get information about the Federal, State, and local laws and regulations that apply to them. Compliance Assessment Tools. Businesses will have access to on-line tools that will help them determine applicable laws and regulations, whether they are in compliance with such laws and regulations, and what to do/where to go to achieve compliance. On-line Transactions. Businesses will be able to register on-line, at the State level, and apply to receive selected Federal, State, and local licenses and permits. By providing quick access to information about laws and regulations, compliance assessment tools, and the ability to perform on-line transactions, Business Compliance One-Stop will offer real value-added service to the business community. Estimates indicate that businesses will save $58 million annually by searching for information in an organized, user-friendly manner in one portal. 37 E-Grants The Federal Government awards over $300 billion in grants each year to State, local, and tribal governments, universities, and non-profit organizations. The Federal Government awards over $300 billion in grants each year to State, local, and tribal governments, universities, and non-profit organizations. These grants are awarded through 26 major \"grant-making\" agencies in over 500 programs. Grant administration varies from agency to agency, program to program, and information about grants - and how to apply for them - is scattered in printed materials and across the Internet. As a result, potential recipients face a complex and burdensome task in trying to apply for Federal grants. The E-Grants initiative seeks to make it easier for potential recipients to obtain information about Federal grants. Specifically, E-Grants will create a single, on-line portal for all Federal grant customers to access grant information. The portal will consolidate much of the grants information currently available on-line and will eliminate many of the paper-based processes that serve as hurdles to organizations attempting to find grant opportunities as well as apply for and manage grants. Additionally, E-Grants will: Make transactions with the Government or obtaining financial assistance from the Government easier, cheaper, quicker, and more comprehensible. Eliminate submission of redundant information for organizational profile information. Standardize the collection of financial report data in support of agency audit and performance measurement activities. By simplifying grants processes, standardizing data, and unifying the mechanisms for interaction with grant-making agencies, E-Grants will transform the grant process for the Federal Government and grant recipients. For recipients, common applications and management 37 This calculation is based on 8 million businesses with employees, with 60 percent of those having Internet access and 30 percent of those using the Internet for compliance information. One hour is worth $40. (8 million x 60% x 30% x $40 = $58 million) 41 processes will minimize the burden of the application process. Time spent looking up procedures and filling out redundant information can be used on the actual grant-related work. For grant administrators, electronic processing of applications will facilitate the review process, and enable agencies to make awards more efficiently. 42 Timeline for Deployment of E-Government Initiatives .

THE ANNUAL INFORMATION COLLECTION BUDGET Introduction The PRA requires the Director of OMB to report to Congress on Federal activities under the Act, based upon performance results reported by agencies. The Information Collection Budget (ICB) is OMB's annual report on the Federal Government's information collection activities under the Act. The report covers changes to information collections that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government, as well as progress on reducing the information collection burden on the public. The ICB provides a mechanism for measuring and managing the burdens of the Federal information collections imposed on individuals, businesses, and State, local, and tribal governments. As a management tool, it plays an important role in the further development of effective and efficient Federal information collections. Historically, the ICB has discussed agency burden accounting numbers, significant paperwork reductions and increases, and overall compliance with the PRA. Each of these topics is discussed briefly in this chapter and is described in much greater detail in the following Appendices. One of these topics, the government-wide accounting of the past year's information collection activities, has often been the focus of previous ICB reports. This PRA report represents an effort to shift the focus from aggregate accounting numbers to meaningful agency efforts at reducing paperwork burden on the public and improving the efficiency of information collection activities. OMB recognizes that the PRA's effectiveness in reducing the time the public spends on information collections cannot be captured simply by looking at burden hours. Sometimes, agencies make significant efforts at improving program efficiency and effectiveness, yet these improvements increase the amount of time the public as a whole spends on information collections. For example, consider an agency that improves its program performance by making its services accessible over the Internet. Obviously, this effort would benefit the public by making the services more convenient and by reducing the effort needed to learn about the services. However, if this enhanced service promotes increased use, the total burden hours might increase. This is only one example of many illustrating that while measurement of burden hours may be useful in tracking the amount of information the Government collects, it is an imperfect tool which does not give a full picture of agency efforts at reducing burden. Recognizing this situation, OMB believes that a more effective way to oversee agency information collection improvement efforts is to encourage agencies to develop specific initiatives and urge agencies to devote focused energies on these efforts. Through this type of meaningful effort, the public will benefit from enhanced information quality, program performance, and government efficiency. The following section describes OMB's efforts to 47 promote this type of effort and highlights various burden reduction initiatives proposed by agencies. Selected Agency Burden Reduction Initiatives As described in the instructions to agencies explaining how they should submit materials to help OMB prepare the FY 2002 ICB, OMB asked agencies to \"describe your agency's proposed initiatives to improve program performance by enhancing the efficiency of information collections and reducing burden on the public.\" Specifically, OMB asked agencies to propose at least two initiatives that: Improve program performance by enhancing the efficiency of information collections; Significantly reduce the burden per response on the public; or Lead to a comprehensive review of an entire program, including regulations and procedures. In response, agencies noted a variety of burden-reduction initiatives, which have the potential to make meaningful improvements for the public. While these initiatives generally fall into two broad categories -- incorporating information technology and simplifying information collection activities -- the majority involve the use of some type of information technology. This is not unexpected given the evolving nature of information technology capabilities and potential to improve the vast amount of information collection activities by the Federal Government through harnessing these capabilities. The various initiatives that agencies developed are identified below. Incorporating information system technologies. By providing electronic reporting options to respondents and using information technology to manage information, agencies are easing reporting burdens on respondents and improving information quality. Loan Deficiency Payments (LDP) Program Enhancement - LDPs are payments made to eligible producers who, though eligible to obtain a marketing assistance loan, agree to forgo the loan in return for an LDP. Currently, producers requesting LDPs must: (1) provide a Department of Agriculture (USDA) county-based service center a CCC-633 LDP request, in person or by fax; (2) meet the marketing assistance loan eligibility requirements for the producer and commodity; and (3) agree to accept such payment in lieu of obtaining marketing assistance loans. Through this initiative, USDA is simplifying program polices and developing a new Internet-based delivery system for processing \" eLDP.\" Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) ECASS2000+ Redesign - This Department of Commerce initiative ties in with the government-wide initiative on Trade Streamlining. It will provide improved query capabilities to accommodate export enforcement agents and analysts as well as increase the control of BXA's export licensing and export enforcement core business processes. The system redesign will benefit any person or company that exports or re-exports items within the jurisdiction of the Export Administration Regulations 48 (EAR), including those required to submit Anti-Boycott Reports. It will also improve information use within BXA and BXA interactions with DoD, DOS, DOE, FBI and CIA. Bureau of the Census Automated Export System (AES ) - This Department of Commerce initiative is also tied to the Trade Streamlining initiative. AES will allow for electronic filing of Shipper's Export Declarations (SEDs), resulting in a significant reduction in the number of paper SEDs. Military Health System Enhancement -Three Department of Defense information collection forms are the primary information requirements imposed upon the public by the Military Health System. This initiative will promote greater use of electronic transactions, providing significant savings to the health care industry. Data Quality Certification -As the Department of Education (ED) seeks to establish shared data definitions, it will also establish data quality standards for information used and disseminated by ED and its programs. To enhance data utility, ED plans to certify at least 50% of major agency and program databases for data quality by September 30, 2002. ED plans to continue this work into FY 2003 toward the establishment of a Department-certified relational database from which all program offices will draw their program management information. State and local agencies are expected to join ED as partners in this project. Electronic Reporting Option for Electric Power Companies -For this initiative, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) has developed a new, completely electronic reporting option for 2002 that respondents may use to complete the electric power surveys using EIA's web site. The electric power forms collectively cover the entire range of companies involved in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sales of electricity. Adverse Event Reporting System -The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) medical device reporting system currently provides a capability for some manufacturers to electronically submit files of reports to the Food and Drug Administration. An initial pilot test of the electronic submission of alternate summary reports has just begun. The pilot will be expanded. It is anticipated that electronic reporting will reduce administrative processing costs, including data submission, entry and quality control. The receipt of adverse event information will be more rapid and data entry errors will be reduced or eliminated. Electronic Research Administration (eRA) - eRA ( Electronic Research Administration) is the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) comprehensive redesign and re-engineering of the entire administrative process of application, initial peer review, secondary Council review, award and post-award operations from a paper to an electronic medium. In scope, it affects the entire NIH extramural award program, totaling over 40,000 competing and noncompeting awards annually with a total dollar amount in excess of $18 billion annually. Use of Electronic Collection/Signatures for 10 Collections -HHS's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have identified 10 collections, representing 6 million 49 Box 1.1 Planned Burden Reductions at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Capital Gains Schedule D. For the 2002 tax-filing season, IRS redesigned the Form 1040 and Form 1041 Schedule D, which taxpayers use to calculate their capital gains and losses. The redesign resulted in the elimination of 14 lines from the schedule in the 1040 and 15 lines in the 1041. More than 21 million Schedule D (1040) filers can use the shorter versions, which will reduce burden by 2.9 million hours. IRS estimates that 1.4 million taxpayers will benefit from the similar Schedule D (1041) changes, which will result in a 4.5 million hour burden reduction. Shared 1120 and 1120S Electronic Filing System. The purpose of this initiative is to significantly increase the number of electronically filed returns by enabling businesses and preparers to file many business forms, schedules and statements electronically. (infrastructure and software) to electronically file forms in the 1120/1120S family supports the Service's goal of reaching the Congressional mandate that 80% of returns be electronically filed by 2007. Project to Redesign Form 941. IRS is working with a contractor to redesign the widely used Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return. Providing the ability IRS's goal is to create a document that will reduce burden for taxpayers, practitioners and payroll agents, reduce processing and other errors, and provide instructions that are easier to read and understand. This is IRS's first major redesign initiative involving a business return. Contract to Improve Burden Measurement . IRS has hired a contractor to replace its current burden estimation methodology with a new measure of compliance burden. This revised measure will provide policy-makers with a tool to assess the effects of legislative proposals to create and revise statutory provisions on the taxpayer burden before they are enacted. The specific goals of the new methodology include measuring compliance burden more comprehensively and accurately by, for example, accounting for electronic filing methods; providing a tool to reduce compliance burden during the development and analysis of legislative and administrative proposals; and providing a tool to explain current levels of taxpayer burdens and the changes in those burdens due to administrative or statutory changes. annual responses, which could be enhanced to significantly reduce burden on the public and improve program performance if electronic collection/signatures could be obtained. eLoan Origination (Single Family Intergration) - The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) eLoan origination streamlines the single family integration insurance process. Prospective homebuyers seeking Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance and lenders are expected to benefit from this simplification. PIH eGovernment Application - The Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Information Center (PIC) is a current HUD eGovernment application allowing PIH business partners to collect 50 and process information in an Internet environment. HUD plans to enhance this initiative to automate paper-based transactions. Automated I-94 Process -Currently, the INS collects and stores arrival and departure information on certain non-immigrant classes. The INS collects this information via the Arrival/Departure Form I-94 and stores it in the Non-immigrant Information System (NIIS), which contains approximately 25 million non-immigrant files each year. The INS plans to eliminate the paper Form I-94 with electronic data created by the Advanced Passenger Information (API), which is currently submitted by several airlines. Electronic Reporting Initiative -Titles II and III of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) require the filing of various reports by labor organizations, union officers and employees, employers, labor relations consultants, and surety companies. This Department of Labor electronic reporting initiative will enhance the efficiency of agency information collection by permitting reporting entities to submit these reports electronically. This capability will allow reporting entities to better file reports on time and with improved accuracy. Student Verification of Enrollment -Currently, student enrollment verification imposes 146,000 annual burden hours on the public and generates 2,190,000 responses annually. Respondents are currently allowed to submit the verification of enrollment information using one of the several methods. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to encourage use of electronic submission, potentially reducing the annual respondent burden hours from 146,000 to 73,000 hours. VONAPP -Currently, most claimants now file for compensation, pension and vocational rehabilitation benefits using paper forms. VA has an Internet site, the Veterans On-line Applications (VONAPP), from which applicants can view, print and submit electronically various VA benefits application forms. Currently, VA is receiving five percent of total claims received via VONAPP. Through this initiative, VA's goal is to increase to 10 percent of total claims received via VONAPP during fiscal year 2002. TRI-ME -This Environmental Protection Agency initiative involves the Office of Environmental Information's Toxics Release Inventory-Made Easy (TRI-ME) software system. The TRI-ME software is an interactive, user-friendly intelligent software that guides facility managers through the entire process of completing their annual reports for their releases and waste management activities for over 600 toxic chemicals. This intelligent software eliminates much of the analysis required to determine if a facility is subject to the TRI reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). 51 Simplifying, consolidating, and reducing information collection. Agencies are reducing burden by consolidating information collections to simplify the information collection process and avoid collecting similar information several times from the same people. Special Nutrition Program Review - USDA's Food and Nutrition Service plans to undertake a review of all of the data elements that it currently collects from the State and tribal agencies that operate the Special Nutrition Programs and from the local organizations that deliver benefits. In addition to examining the datasets collected, the review will closely scrutinize the collection instruments and processes used to assemble and finalize program data. DOD Acquisition Process Review -This information collection encompasses 24 million hours of burden (about 26% of the Department's total) and involves applications for benefits/contracts, including the acquisition of goods and services under the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. The initiative will review these information collection requirements with the intent of reducing burden by 10 percent. Common Data Definitions -In order for the Department of Education (ED) to communicate between and among its external education partners and with its own programs, there needs to be a common language underpinned by common data definitions. The collections approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act and the data elements comprising them are being analyzed to develop consensus definitions and code sets. Both State and local education agencies will join ED as partners in this project. Ultimately, this effort will eliminate duplicative requests for information and reduce the total volume of data collected while ensuring that ED collects higher quality and more useful data. Well Permit and Report System Pilot -The Department of Interior's (DOI) Minerals Management Service's ( MMS's ) Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) program plans to conduct a pilot (Well Permit and Report System Pilot) that focuses on streamlining the information collections and operations associated with regulatory compliance and the conduct of well drilling/completion/workover operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). These efforts are expected to be one of several initial steps in OMM's e-Government Transformation Project. Mining Forms Consolidation - DOI's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is planning to improve program performance by enhancing the efficiency of agency information collections across agencies. An effort to combine forms related to coal tonnage and/or accident information at coal mining sites into a single mineral industry report system is being considered by OSM, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 52 Box 1.2 The Department of Transportation is undertaking a number of initiatives during FY2002 that will reduce burden: Registration Process Streamlining - Section 13908 of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA) directed the Secretary of Transportation to create a single, on-line Federal system to replace the systems for issuing DOT numbers, licensing/registration, financial responsibility, and single- state registration. very near future, will propose to make the regulatory changes necessary to comply with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 13908. identification (all motor carriers) and registration, insurance, and licensing (for-hire motor carriers). Aeronautical Study Project - The FAA currently conducts over 50,000 aeronautical studies a year. Obstruction Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA) program issues determinations with input from air traffic, flight procedures, flight standards, airports, airway facilities, and the military. OE/AAA automation program is a web-based application that is accessed through the FAA's Intranet via the user's workstation browser. aeronautical study. ACRA - ACRA is a computer based program that automates the airman certification process and allows Designated Examiners (DEs), FAA Aviation Safety Inspectors ( ASIs), and Aviation Safety Technicians (ASTs) to electronically capture and validate airman information. complete the airman application and the other certification documents including the appropriate temporary airman certificate, thereby ensuring an applicant meets all the most recent regulatory and policy requirements prior to conducting an airman certification and issuing the appropriate certification document. National Bridge Inventory (NBI) - The NBI system is under development and will replace an existing system that operates on a mainframe in Austin, Texas. be hosted on servers owned by FHWA. based system will make the system more user-friendly and efficient. National Transit Database - Each year, NTD data are used in statutory formulae to apportion over $4 billion in FTA funds to public transit agencies in urban areas of over 50,000 persons. transit agencies submit annual data to the NTD each year. A new NTD system will streamline reporting, thereby reducing burden. The new system has generated such interest that many States have volunteered to be participants. Electronic Hours of Duty Recordkeeping - Through this initiative, DOT plans to encourage increased use of electronic recordkeeping for railroads. longstanding, ongoing, and important initiative for the agency to improve the performance of this program while also reducing the burden on affected railroads. Electronic Waiver Recordkeeping - This Federal Railroad Administration project would involve converting waiver record retention from paper to electronic records. This conversion could reduce the burden total by an estimated 95,333 hours. Planned Burden Reductions at the Department of Transportation (DOT) A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which FMCSA expects to release in the This initiative would consolidate many of the collections that cover motor carrier The The new It is expected to reduce the normal 30-day timeframe associated with an This information is required to The NBI will be a web-enabled system that will A relational database, intuitive reporting tools and a windows- Approximately 600 It also provides new safety and security tracking systems for local agencies. Conversions of paper to electronic records has been a 53 Mine Act Regulation Streamlining -The Mine Act and Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations require the coal mine operator to continuously maintain an average concentration of respirable coal mine dust in the mine atmosphere. The Department of Labor's MSHA plans to publish a final joint dust rule that will result in a reduction in burden hours of 40,690. Currently, MSHA estimates that 96% (42,694) of mine operators do their own sampling. Another 1,779 mine operators contract the service. By MSHA taking the sampling, mine operators might save approximately 40,690 hours and $1,597,852 in costs. RCRA Review -The EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) recently completed a comprehensive review of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) program, and plans to propose a rule to streamline or eliminate many of these requirements. This OSW effort will streamline data collection for RCRA's Biennial Report, which is a major information collection mechanism for hazardous waste generation and management. Hours Needed for Information Collection Activities in FY 2001 In FY 2001, citizens spent an estimated 7.65 billion hours providing Federal agencies the information needed to fulfill agency responsibilities. Appendix B has a complete description of the burden hours required in FY 2001. Among the Cabinet departments and EPA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development reported the greatest percentage reduction due to agency actions or new statute (-3.9 percent). The Department of Justice reported the greatest increase at 8.3 percent, largely due to several new collections or modifications to existing collections that resulted from the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of 2000 (LIFE Act), Public Law 106-553. Significant Paperwork Reductions and Increases - FY 2001 and FY 2002 Similar to previous ICB reports, we asked agencies to identify significant paperwork reductions and increases for FY 2001 and FY 2002. In Appendix C, these agency examples are organized into various burden reduction or increase categories: streamlining regulations, eliminating redundancy, simplifying forms, using information technology, statutory reductions/increases, and other. By illustrating the broad range of agency information collection activities and burden reduction efforts, this Appendix provides a useful source of ideas and guidance on what agencies are doing to reduce paperwork burdens. Agency Compliance with the PRA The PRA requires Federal agencies to request OMB approval before collecting information from the public. OMB can approve a data collection for no more than three years, at which point the agency must resubmit the collection for re-approval. Sometimes, an agency fails to submit a request for re-approval before its existing approval expires. This is a violation of the PRA. Other times, agencies collect information without OMB approval or significantly modify 54 existing collections without receiving OMB approval. Both scenarios represent violations of the PRA. In last year's ICB (FY 2001), OMB documented 487 violations of the PRA, of which 191 remained unresolved as of the cut-off date for the ICB's publication. For the Departmental agencies and EPA, there were 161 unresolved violations at publication time for the FY 2001 ICB. While these figures do represent a continuation in the recent downward trend in the number of PRA violations, the situation cannot continue. To ensure that the Federal Government is in full compliance with the PRA, OMB has aggressively pushed agencies to fully comply with the information collection provisions of the PRA. In a November 14, 2001, Memorandum to agency Chief Information Officers and General Counsels and Solicitors, OMB asked the agencies to provide a timetable to resolve each violation listed in the FY 2001 ICB and to describe the procedures in place to prevent future violations. For the full text of this Memorandum, see Appendix E. Largely as a result of these efforts, we report only 109 unresolved violations as of March 12, 2002, the cut-off date for this year's PRA report (See Appendix D). As illustrated in the chart below, the Federal Government has made significant progress in reducing the number of PRA violations in recent years. While this reduction in violations does demonstrate some progress, we cannot be satisfied. OMB will continue to work with agency CIOs to resolve existing violations and take whatever steps are necessary to avoid future violations. Unresolved Departmental Agency and EPA Violations -- FY 1998-2001 400 300 200 100 0 1998 1999 2000 2001 55 56 Appendix A. Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility , and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies.38 I. OMB Responsibilities . Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2001 (Public Law 106-554) directs the Office of Management and Budget to issue government-wide guidelines that provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, disseminated by Federal agencies. II. Agency Responsibilities . Section 515 directs agencies subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3502(1)) to - 1. Issue their own information quality guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, disseminated by the agency no later than one year after the date of issuance of the OMB guidelines; 2. Establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with these OMB guidelines; and 3. Report to the Director of OMB the number and n ature of complaints received by the agency regarding agency compliance with these OMB guidelines concerning the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information and how such complaints were resolved. III. Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity o f Information Disseminated by Federal Agencie s. 1. Overall, agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) as a performance goal and should take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices. Quality is to be ensured and established at levels appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the information to be disseminated. Agencies shall adopt specific standards of quality that are appropriate for the various categories of information they disseminate. 2. As a matter of good and effective agency information resources management, agencies shall develop a process for reviewing the quality (including the objectivity, utility, and integrity) of information before it is disseminated. Agencies shall treat information quality as integral to every step of an agency's development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination. This process shall enable the 38 67 FR 369 (January 3, 2002). Corrections to the January 3 publication were published February 5, 2002 (67 FR 5365). The final guidelines were reprinted in corrected form on February 22, 2002 (67 FR 8452). 57 agency to substantiate the quality of the information it has disseminated through documentation or other means appropriate to the information. 3. To facilitate public review, agencies shall establish administrati ve mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or agency guidelines. These administrative mechanisms shall be flexible, appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the disseminated information, and incorporated into agency information resources management and administrative practices. i. Agencies shall specify appropriate time periods for agency decisions on whether and how to correct the information, and agencies shall notify the affected persons of the corrections made. ii. If the person who requested the correction does not agree with the agency's decision (including the corrective action, if any), the person may file for reconsideration within the agency. The agency shall establish an administrative appeal process to review the agency's initial decision, and specify appropriate time limits in which to resolve such requests for reconsideration. 4. The agency's pre-dissemination review, under paragraph III.2, shall apply to information that the agency first disseminates on or after October 1, 2002. The agency's administrative mechanisms, under paragraph III.3, shall apply to information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the agency first disseminated the information. IV. Agency Reporting Requirements . 1. Agencies must designate the Chief Information Officer or another official to be responsible for agency compliance with these guidelines. 2. The agency shall respond to complaints in a manner appropriate to the nature and extent of the complaint. Examples of appropriate responses include personal contacts via letter or telephone, form letters, press releases or mass mailings that correct a widely disseminated error or address a frequently raised complaint. 3. Each agency must prepare a draft report, no later than May 1, 2002, providing the agency's information quality guidelines and explaining how such guidelines will ensur e and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, disseminated by the agency. 39 This report must also detail the administrative mechanisms developed by that agency to allow affected persons to seek and obtain appropriate correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the OMB or the agency guidelines. 39 OMB changed the deadline for agency preparation of draft agency guidelines from April 1 to May 1, 2002 (67 FR 9797 (March 4, 2002)). 58 4. The agency must publish a notice of availability of this draft report in the Federal Register , and post this report on the agency's website, to provide an opportunity for public comment. 5. Upon consideration of public comment and after appropriate revision, the agency must submit this draft report to OMB for review regarding consistency with these OMB guidelines no later than July 1, 2002. Upon completion of that OMB review and completion of this report, agencies must publish notice of the availability of this report in its final form in the Federal Register , and post this report on the agency's web site no later than October 1, 2002. 6. On an annual fiscal-year basis, each agency must submit a report to the Director of OMB providing information (both quantitative and qualitative, where appropriate) on the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding agency compliance with these OMB guidelines and how such complaints were resolved. Agencies must submit these reports no later than January 1 of each following year, with the first report due January 1, 2004. V. Definitions . 1. \"Quality\" is an encompassing term comprising utility, objectivity, and integrity. Therefore, the guidelines sometimes refer to these four statutory terms, collectively, as \"quality.\" 2. \"Utility\" refers to the usefulness of the infor mation to its intended users, including the public. In assessing the usefulness of information that the agency disseminates to the public, the agency needs to consider the uses of the information not only from the perspective of the agency but also from the perspective of the public. As a result, when transparency of information is relevant for assessing the information's usefulness from the public's perspective, the agency must take care to ensure that transparency has been addressed in its review of the information. 3. \"Objectivity\" involves two distinct elements, presentation and substance. a. \"Objectivity\" includes whether disseminated information is being presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. This involves whether the information is presented within a proper context. Sometimes, in disseminating certain types of information to the public, other information must also be disseminated in order to ensure an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased presentation. Also, the agency needs to identify the sources of the disseminated information (to the extent possible, consistent with confidentiality protections) and, in a scientific, financial, or statistical context, the supporting data and models, so that the public can assess for itself whether there may be some reason to question the objectivity of the sources. Where appropriate, data should have full, accurate, transparent documentation, and error sources affecting data quality should be identified and disclosed to users. 59 b. In addition, \"objectivity\" involves a focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information. In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, the original and supporting data shall be generated, and the analytic results shall be developed, using sound statistical and research methods. i. If data and analytic results have been subjected to formal, independent, external peer review, the information may generally be presumed to be of acceptable objectivity. However, this presumption is rebuttable based on a persuasive showing by the petitioner in a particular instance. If agency-sponsored peer review is employed to help satisfy the objectivity standard, the review process employed shall meet the general criteria for competent and credible peer review recommended by OMB-OIRA to the President's Management Council (9/20/01) (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/oira_review -process.html), namely, \"that (a) peer reviewers be selected primarily on the basis of necessary technical expertise, (b) peer reviewers be expected to disclose to agencies prior technical/policy positions they may have taken on the issues at hand, (c) peer reviewers be expected to disclose to agencies their sources of personal and institutional funding (private or public sector), and (d) peer reviews be conducted in an open and rigorous manner.\" ii. If an agency is responsible for disseminating influential scientific, financial, or statistical information, agency guidelines shall include a high degree of transparency about data and methods to facilitate the reproducibility of such information by qualified third parties. A. With regard to original and supporting data related thereto, agency guidelines shall not require that all disseminated data be subjected to a reproducibility requirement. Agencies may identify, in consultation with the relevant scientific and technical communities, those particular types of data that can practicably be subjected to a reproducibility requirement, given ethical, feasibility, or confidentiality constraints. It is understood that reproducibility of data is an indication of transparency about research design and methods and thus a replication exercise (i.e., a new experiment, test, or sample) shall not be required prior to each dissemination. B. With regard to analytic results related thereto, agency guidelines shall generally require sufficient transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be undertaken by a qualified member of the public. These transparency standards apply to agency analysis of data from a single study as well as to analyses that combine information from multiple studies. i. Making the data and methods publicly available will assist in determining whether analytic results are reproducible. However, the objectivity standard does not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidentiality protections. 60 ii. In situations where public access to data and methods will not occur due to other compelling interests, agencies shall apply especially rigorous robustness checks to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken. Agency guidelines shall, however, in all cases, require a disclosure of the specific data sources that have been used and the specific quantitative methods and assumptions that have been employed. Each agency is authorized to define the type of robustness checks, and the level of detail for documentation thereof, in ways appropriate for it given the nature and multiplicity of issues for which the agency is responsible. C. With regard to analysis of risks to human health, safety and the environment maintained or disseminated by the agencies, agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) & (B)). Agencies responsible for dissemination of vital health and medical information shall interpret the reproducibility and peer-review standards in a manner appropriate to assuring the timely flow of vital information from agencies to medical providers, patients, health agencies, and the public. Information quality standards may be waived temporarily by agencies under urgent situations (e.g., imminent threats to public health or homeland security ) in accordance with the latitude specified in agency-specific guidelines. 4. \"Integrity\" refers to the security of information -- protection of the information from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification. 5. \"Information\" means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. This definition includes information that an agency disseminates from a web page, but does not include the provision of hyperlinks to information that others disseminate. This definition does not include opinions, where the agency's presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views. 6. \"Government information\" means information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of by or for the Federal Government. 7. \"Information dissemination product\" means any book, paper, map, machine-readable material, audiovisual production, or other documentary material, regardless of physical form or characteristic, an agency disseminates to the public. This definition includes any electronic document, CD-ROM, or web page. 8. \"Dissemination\" means agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public (see 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(d) (definition of \"Conduct or Sponsor\"). Dissemination does not include distribution limited to Government employees or agency contractors or grantees; intra- or inter-agency use or sharing of Government information; and responses 61 to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law. This definition also does not include distribution limited to correspondence with individuals or persons, press releases, archival records, public filings, subpoenas or adjudicative processes. 9. \"Influential\", when used in the phrase \"influential scientific, financial, or statistical information\", means that the agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions. Each agency is authorized to define \"influential\" in ways appropriate for it given the nature and multiplicity of issues for which the agency is responsible. 10. \"Reproducib ility\" means that the information is capable of being substantially reproduced, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision. For information judged to have more (less) important impacts, the degree of imprecision that is tolerated is reduced (increased). If agencies apply the reproducibility test to specific types of original or supporting data, the associated guidelines shall provide relevant definitions of reproducibility (e.g., standards for replication of laboratory data). With respect to analytic results, \"capable of being substantially reproduced\" means that independent analysis of the original or supporting data using identical methods would generate similar analytic results, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision or error. 62 Appendix B. Information Collection Budget Table In FY 2001, citizens spent an estimated 7.65 billion hours providing federal agencies the information needed to fulfill agency responsibilities. This appendix describes in aggregate terms how that number changed from FY 2000. It also provides further explanation of some of the terms used throughout this report to describe these changes. Information Collection \"Hours\" The aggregate totals presented in Table B are stated in terms of annual \"hours needed.\" In developing an information collection for public comment and OMB review, an agency estimates the amount of time a respondent will need to provide the requested information. The estimated hours needed include the time spent reading and understanding the information collection itself and any instructions, as well as time spent compiling, recording, reviewing, and submitting the information. Changes in the Hours Needed The total hours needed to complete an agency's information collections can change from year to year for a variety of reasons. OMB, through a computer system that tracks the information collections it reviews and approves, categorizes hour changes as resulting from either \"program changes\" or \"adjustments.\" The distinction between these two categories is the presence or absence of agency action. A program change results from an agency action of some type, such as adding or deleting questions from a form or reducing the frequency of reporting. An adjustment results from other factors that are beyond agency control. An example of an adjustment would be the increased number of people applying for Federal benefits because of greater needs. OMB tracks approved information collections over time using this distinction in why hours change. The sum of the changes in these two categories accounts for the change between one fiscal year total and the next. The tables in this appendix list program changes and adjustments for each agency for FY 2001. Program Changes: Program changes are hour changes that result from an agency action that affects the time required to complete an information collection. Such agency actions generally are deliberate. For example, an agency might change a regulation or re-design the collection form. The program changes include three different types of agency transactions: Changes due to New Statutes. These include the creation of new collections or the material revision or elimination of existing collections that an agency must undertake because a recent statute requires the action. Changes due to Agency Action. These include the creation of new collections or the material revision or elimination of existing collections that an agency undertakes without a specific and recent statutory mandate. This type of transaction includes changes due to new or revised policies and collections that are authorized but not explicitly required by statute. 63 Changes due to Lapse of OMB Approval. This kind of transaction occurs when an agency allows OMB approval for a collection to expire even though the agency continues to conduct or sponsor the collection. The figures include the hours for the collection removed from the computer tracking system upon expiration as well as the hours added upon reinstatement. These lapses are reported in Appendix D. OMB distinguishes among these three kinds of program changes through the preparation of the ICB and with the input of the agencies. In the tables in this report, however, only Changes due to New Statutes or Changes due to Agency Action are listed. The Changes due to Lapse of OMB Approval are not listed because they do not reflect changes to the time spent by the public on Federal information collections but rather agency failure to maintain OMB approval of an ongoing collection as required by the PRA. Again, these lapses are captured in Appendix D. Adjustments: Often the hours needed for a particular information collection will vary from year to year. For example, a strong economy leads to increased filing of tax returns. Increased immigration leads to a higher number of naturalization applications. Such circumstances can produce significant changes in aggregate burden hours. These changes are characterized as \"adjustments.\" Adjustments, while often having large effects on estimates, do not represent Government efforts either to expand or reduce an information collection. Explanation of the Table Table B starts with the FY 2000 Totals, as printed in the FY 2001 Information Collection Budget of the United States Government. The second column is \"FY 2001 Program Changes,\" as carried in the OMB computer tracking system and determined in consultation with the agencies. This column includes all program changes due to agency actions, due to new statutes, and due to lapses of OMB approvals. The third column is FY 2001 Program Changes expressed as a percentage of the FY 2000 Total Hours Needed. The fourth column, \"FY 2001 Changes Due to New Statute or Agency Action,\" represents the second column minus burden hour changes resulting from lapses of OMB approval, which are detailed in Appendix D. The fifth column is the FY 2001 Program Changes Due to New Statute or Agency Action expressed as a percentage of the FY 2000 Total Hours Needed. This calculation is a more accurate measure of agency activity with respect to information collection. The sixth column is \"FY 2001 Adjustments,\" as carried in the OMB computer tracking system and determined in consultation with the agencies. The sum of this column and the \"FY 2001 Program Changes\" is the difference between the FY 2001 Total and the FY 2000 Total. The seventh column presents FY 2001 Adjustments as a percentage of the FY 2000 Total. The eighth column gives the \"FY 2001 Total Hours Needed,\" the sum of the hours needed for all collections approved by OMB on October 2, 2001. 64 Table B: FY 2001 Information Collection Totals (millions of hours) FY 2000 Total Hours Needed FY2001 Total Hours Needed Government 130.77 FY 2001 Program Changes FY 2001 Changes Due to New Statute or Agency Action FY 2001 Adjustments *Note that a large portion of Commerce's decrease in burden is attributed to the periodic nature of Census collections. ** Due to a PRA violation, the program change total for FY 2001 includes a reduction of 42,464,327 hours. DOT inadvertently allowed OMB's approval of a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration collection, Driver's Record of Duty Status, to expire on September 30, 2001. DOT continued to use this collection in violation of the PRA until it obtained a reinstatement of OMB's approval on March 4, 2002. 65 66 Appendix C. Significant Paperwork Reductions and Increases\u2014FY 2001 & 2002 The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires the head of each agency, supported by his or her Chief Information Office (CIO), to be responsible for the agency's information collection activities. This includes reducing the amount of paperwork required of the public. Agencies are to develop and coordinate initiatives that will produce meaningful improvements for the public. This appendix highlights the significant improvements agencies have made and where further improvement is needed. The examples of significant burden reductions are organized into 6 categories: -Streamlining Regulations. Revising existing regulations to eliminate unnecessary requirements. -Eliminating Redundancy. Raising reporting thresholds to reduce the number of reports that need to be submitted, cutting the frequency of periodic reporting requirements, consolidating information collections, or working across agencies to share information. -Using Information Technology. Using automated systems to speed and simplify the exchange of information between the Government and the public and allowing respondents to use their own information technology to ease reporting burdens. -Statutory Reductions. Reducing burden because of recently enacted statutes. -Other. Any other agency efforts to reduce burden. The examples of significant burden increases are organized into two categories: -Statutory Increases. Increasing burden due to new statutory requirements. -Other. Increasing burden due to other factors. Using these categories to illustrate the broad range of agency information collection activities and burden reduction efforts, this appendix serves several important goals. First, the examples highlight agency accomplishments in improving how information is collected and reducing burden on the public. Second, the examples provide a source of ideas and guidance on what agencies can do to reduce paperwork. Third, the examples identify areas where more work can be done to yield further benefits. 67 FY 2001 Reductions Streamlining Regulations Agency: Department of Defense OMB Control No.: 0702-0112 Title: Report on the Use of Employees of Non-Federal Entities Purpose of the Collection: The info rmation collected provided the number of direct labor and indirect labor work year equivalents performed by contractors providing services. How Reduction Achieved: The collection was discontinued because the non-standard clause had a significant impact beyond the internal operating procedures of the Army, and might have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors. Change in Burden: -33,928 hours Agency: Department of Defense OMB Control No.: 0704-0363 Title: Reporting, Redistributio n, and Disposal of Contractor Property Purpose of the Collection: Information used by inventory managers, contractors, and contracting officers to ensure that military property is demilitarized to preclude its use for its originally intended military purpose. How Reduction Achieved: Discontinued information collection pending development of new procedures. Change in Burden: -56,250 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2050-0120 Title: General Hazardous Waste Facility St andards (EPA ICR #1571.06) Purpose of the Collection: Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, requires that EPA develop standards for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. The regulations implementing these requirements are codified in 40 CFR Parts 264 and 265. The collection of this information enables EPA to properly determine whether owners/operators or hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities meet the requirements of Section 3004(a) of RCRA. How Reduction Achieved: Burden decreased by eliminating need for certain hazardous waste generators to have a manifest. This decrease is reflected in a modification to the approved ICR. Change in Burden: -14,014 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2060-0104 Title: Motor Vehicle Emission Standards and Emission credits Provisions under the Tier 2 Rule (EPA ICR #0783.40) Purpose of the Collection: Insuring that vehicle designs meet applicable emission standards for their useful lives. How Reduction Achieved: Reductions in the number of durability demonstrations and tests required; increased flexibility in how demonstrations are conducted. Change in Burden: -445,918 hours 68 Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2060-0012 Title: NSPS for VOC Equipment Leaks in the Synthetic Organic Chemical Industry (EPA ICR #0662.06) Purpose of the Collection: Regulatory or Compliance. How Reduction Achieved: The reduction was achieved by promulgating a less burdensome rule [40 CFR Part 65 , the Consolidated Air Rule (CAR)] that may be used to comply with 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart VV (the underlying rule for OMB Control Number 2060-0012). Change in Burden: -280,495 hours OMB Control No.: 2060-0068 Title: NESHAP for Equipment Leaks (Fugitive Emission Sources) (EPA ICR #1153.07) Purpose of the Collection: Regulatory or Compliance. How Reduction Achieved: The reduction was achieved by promulgating a less burdensome rule [40 CFR Part 65, the Consolidated Air Rule (CAR)] that may be used to comply with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart V (the underlying rule for OMB Control Number 2060-0068). Change in Burden: -71,516 hours OMB Control No.: 2060-0074 Title: NSPS for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels - Subpart Kb (EPA ICR #1132.06) Purpose of the Collection: Regulatory or Compliance. How Reduction Achieved: The reduction was achieved by promulgating a less burdensome rule [40 CFR Part 65, the Consolidated Air Rule (CAR)] that may be used to comply with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart Ka (the underlying rule for OMB Control Number 2060-0121). Change in Burden: -54,138 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2060-0197 Title: Standards of Performance of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Industry (SOCMI), Air Oxidation Unit Processes, Subpart III (EPA ICR #0998.06) Purpose of the Collection: Regulatory or Compliance. How Reduction Achieved: The reduction was achieved by promulgating a less burdensome rule [40 CFR Part 65, the Consolidated Air Rule (CAR)] that may be used to comply with 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts III & NNN (the underlying rules for OMB Control Number 2060-0197). Change in Burden: -142,375 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2060-0269 Title: Standards of Performance of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Industry (SOCMI), Reactor Processes, Subpart RRR. Purpose of the Collection: Regulatory or Compliance. How Reduction Achieved: The reduction was achieved by promulgating a less burdensome rule [40 CFR Part 65, the Consolidated Air Rule (CAR)] that may be used to comply with 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart RRR (the underlying rule for OMB Control Number 2060-0269). Change in Burden: -15,287 hours 69 2070-0112 Title: Polychlorinated ICR #1446.07) Purpose of the Collection: Section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 USC 2605(e), specifically directs EPA to regulate the marking, disposal, manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs. Since 1978, EPA has promulgated numerous rules addressing all aspects of the life cycle of PCBs as required by the statute. All of the information collection activities associated with the PCB regulations found at 40 CFR Part 761 have been approved by OMB. The data are needed to ensure PCBs and PCB wastes are managed in an environmentally safe manner and that activities are being conducted in compliance with the PCB regulations. The data will be used to: assess the efficacy of disposal technologies, evaluate exemption requests and exclusion notices, target compliance inspections, ensure the proper management of PCBs, and ensure adequate storage and disposal capacity exists nationwide and that environmental releases are managed properly. Data will be made available to EPA regional inspectors, or their agents, for compliance purposes. Respondents include: owners/users of PCBs/PCB Items, individuals who generate PCB waste, PCB waste handlers (owners of PCB storage and disposal facilities, transporters), chemical analysis labs, and individuals engaged in PCB manufacturing, processing and distribution in commerce activities. How Reduction Achieved: In 1998, EPA promulgated significant changes to the PCB regulations to: 1) provide flexibility in selecting disposal technologies for PCB wastes and to expand the list of prescribed, self-implementing decontamination procedures; 2) provide less burdensome mechanisms for obtaining EPA approval for a variety of activities; 3) clarify and/or modify the regulations where ambiguity may exist; 4) modify the requirements in light of concerns associated with the use/maintenance, distribution in commerce, storage, and disposal of PCB equipment; and 5) address outstanding issues associated with the notification and manifesting of PCB wastes and changes in the operation of commercial storage facilities. At the time that these amendments were promulgated, since the information collection activities related to the PCB regulations were approved under six separate ICRs, EPA did not attempt to estimate the net program change in the ICRs related to these amendments, and did not therefore revise each of these ICRs. Instead, EPA submitted a new ICR to OMB that contained all of the new information collection activities related to the amendments, with a commitment to subsequently consolidate the new burden into the existing ICRs. In FY2001 EPA consolidated the following PCB related ICRs into this OMB# be consolidated: 1,998,248 70 As a part of the consolidation effort, EPA also reviewed the information collections contained in the regulations and reevaluated all the burden estimates. The results of the Agency's consolidation effort is a revised total burden of 741,261 burden hours for the PCB regulations, which results in a net reduction from the burden currently approved. OMB approved the consolidated ICR on 08/29/01. Change in Burden: -1,256,987 hours Agency: Department of Justice OMB Control No.: 1115-0192 Title: TVS Pilot Non-Citizen Employees Employment Status Rep Purpose of the Collection: The Telephone Verification System ( TVS) allowed employers to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired non-citizen employees. The system removed the guesswork from document review during the Form I-9 process and protected jobs for authorized U.S. workers. The TVS information was used by the INS to determine which regional center(s) should participate in the pilot program. How Reduction Achieved: This information collection was part of a pilot program which was terminated by the INS program September 2000. Change in Burden: -32,016 hours Agency: Department of Transportation OMB Control No.: 2115-0613 Title: Waste Management Plans, Refuse Discharge Logs, and Purpose of the Collection: The information is collected from owners, operators, masters, and persons-in-charge of vessels. This is a record-keeping requirement. Vessels operators of oceangoing ships of 40 feet in length or more are required to maintain refuse record books. How Reduction Achieved: Changes occurred when three collections were combined, which have been modified to harmonize with MARPOL 73/78. A proposed rulemaking titled \"Pollution Prevention for oceangoing Ships and Certain Vessels in Domestic Service\" would change the requirements in 33 CFR 151.55 from ships 12.2 meters in length and engaged in domestic and international voyages to ships that are 400 gross tons and engaged in international voyages. The rule decreased the annual number of respondents and responses. Change in Burden: -466,971 hours Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: 1215-0072 Title: OFCCP Record-keeping and Reporting Requirements. Purpose of the Collection: The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the administration of equal opportunity programs prohibiting employment discrimination and requiring affirmative steps to ensure equal employment opportunity. All record-keeping, forms, and reporting requirements originate from the regulations implementing these programs. The OFCCP regulations impose a record-keeping and a reporting burden on Federal contractors. Federal contractors must develop, update, and maintain Affirmative Employment Plans. Federal contractors also must file the annual required EEO-1 Report. How Reduction Achieved: Streamlining regulations. 71 Change in Burden: -2,835,510 hours Eliminating Redundancy Agency: Department of the Control No.: 1545-1512 Title: Form 1040 IRS e-file Collection: Revenue Procedure 98-50 inf ormed those who participate in the Form 1040 IRS e-file Program of their obligations to the Internal Revenue Service, taxpayers, and other participants. How Reduction Achieved: Revenue Procedure 98-50 along with Revenue Procedure 98-51 was eliminated. Change in Burden: -2,273,932 hours Agency: Department of the Treasury OMB Control No.: 1545-0092 Title: U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts Purpose of the Collection: Form 1041 is used by the IRS to determine that the estates, trusts, and beneficiaries filed the proper returns and paid the correct tax. How Reduction Achieved: Form 1041 (Schedule D) was revised and simplified to make it easier for taxpayers to compute capital gains and losses. Change in Burden: -4,549,925 hours Simplifying Forms Agency: Department of Interior OMB Control No.: 1010-0140 (replaces #1010-0022) Title: Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (Form MMS-2014) Purpose of the Collection: Form MMS-2014 is used for reporting oil and gas royalties, certain rents, and other lease-related transactions to MMS. How Reduction Achieved: During the reengineering of the Minerals Revenue Management's core business processes, the MMS developed a new Form MMS-2014 to incorporate revised reporting requirements that reduced the volume of lines reported and processed, and minimized errors and related error correction workloads. This new form will replace the existing Form MMS-2014 that is approved under OMB Control #1010-0022. Change in Burden: -55,229 hours Using Information Technology Agency: Department of Education OMB Control No.: 1845-0001 Title: Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Purpose of the Collection: Application collects identifying and financial information from students applying for Federal student aid for post-secondary education. How Reduction Achieved: Although ED adjusted the projected application volumes based on actual 2000-2001 data, a further reduction was due to the ongoing changes in the type of application filed. More students selected the electronic and/or Renewal formats in lieu of the more burdensome paper FAFSA. Change in Burden: - 402,118 hours 72 Agency: Department of the Treasury OMB Control No.: 1545-1309 Title: U.S. Individual Income Tax Re turn 1040PC Format Purpose of the Collection: Form 1040PC was a computer-generated tax return answer sheet format prepared by tax preparation software. Form 1040PC was an alternative method of filing Form 1040. It offered direct deposit for taxpayers to have their refunds deposited into their personal savings or checking accounts How Reduction Achieved: IRS dropped the paper 1040PC format in 2001 by a News Release dated May 23, 2000, so that the users would take steps to file electronically. Change in Burden: -1,875,681 hours Statutory Reductions Agency: Department of Agriculture OMB Control No.: 0584-0009 Title: Food Stamp Accountability Report, FNS-250 Purpose of the Collection\" Accounting for Food Stamp Program coupon inventory How Reduction Achieved: Congress mandated use of Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, which eliminates the need for coupons. Change in Burden: -40,032 Statute Title and PL#: P. L. 104-193, section 825, Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reform Act Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2050-0144 Title: Risk Management Program Requirements and Petitions to Modify the List of Regulated Substances under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (EPA ICR # 1656.06) Purpose of the Collection: Under Section 112(r) of the CAA, as amended, sources must register, document risk management programs, and submit risk management plans to EPA by June 21, 1999. These regulations are codified in 40 CFR Part 68. EPA modified the regulations to conform to the fuels provision of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Act. The rule revised the list of regulated flammable substances to exclude those substances when used as a fuel or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility. How Reduction Achieved: About half of the regulated universe was dropped because of this modification to the rule, therefore the burden was reduced. Change in Burden: -63,200 hours Statute Title and PL#: Chemical Safety, Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Act. Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: 1205-0308 Title: Planning and Reporting Requirements for JTPA, Section 401, Indian and Native American Grantees (Both Title IV-A and Title II-B) Purpose of the Collection: Used to evaluate the overall progress of the program and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. How Reduction Achieved: Program Change - Job Training Partnership Act Program Expired. Change in Burden: -95,935 hours Statute Title and PL#: Job Training Partnership Act, PL 102-367, 20 CFR, Part 632 Agency: Department of Labor 73 OMB Control No.: 1210-0114 Title: Disclosures by Insurers to General Account Policyholders Purpose of the Collection: The purpose of the information collection included in the regulation at 29 CFR 2550.401c-1 is to clarify which assets held by insurers constitute assets of the plan for purposes of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA. How Reduction Achieved: The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 amended the Em ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by adding a new section 401(c), which clarified the application of ERISA to insurance company general accounts. The new provision required that certain steps be taken by insurance companies that offer and maintain policies for private sector employee benefit plans where assets are held in the general account, and required the Department to issue interpretive guidance. The final rule requires that certain disclosures be provided at the outset of the contract and annually, and that other disclosures be provided on request. The burden reduction reflects the fact that the one-time disclosures required by the January 5, 2000 final rule would have been completed. The remaining burden is for ongoing disclosure requirements. Change in Burden: -737,702 hours Statute Title and PL#: Employee Retirement Income Security Act as amended (Pub. L. 93- 406), Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-188) Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: Program Standard - (29 CFR 1910, Subpart Y) Purpose of the Collection: Collection discontinued. How Reduction Achieved: Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress passed, and President signed, Public Law 107-5, disapproving OSHA's final Ergonomics Program Change in Burden: -40,582,309 hours Statute Title and PL#: Congressional Review Act, Public Law 107-5 Other Reductions Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0176 Title: Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs & Expenditures Purpose of the Collection: This survey collects information on capital expenditures and operating costs for pollution prevention and treatment from sample establishments in manufacturing, mining, and electrical utilities. How Reduction Achieved: The decrease in burden is attributable to the survey expiring during FY 2001. It will not be conducted during FY 2002. Change in Burden: -90,125 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0778 Title: Long Term Care Survey Purpose of the Collection: The LTC will seek to gather information from elderly persons interviewed in previous LTC surveys and newly included elderly sample respondents on their health and functional status, informal care support, socio-demographics, housing, health service use and economic status. Duke University will use the data and combine it with the data collected from prior LTC surveys to determine how people's health care 74 needs change over time. Duke will also link the survey data to Medicare Part A files and Medicaid files (under agreement with the Health Care Financing Administration) for additional analyses concerning the interrelationships between health status and use of services. Planners and policy makers also use data from the survey to conduct research to improve Medicare services and to plan for a sound future for the Medicare program. How Reduction Achieved: The decrease in burden is attributable to the survey expiring during FY 2001. It will not be conducted during FY 2002. Change in Burden: -10,131 hours Agency Department of Education OMB Control No.: 1840-0740 Title: Application Package for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (Gear-up) Purpose of the Collection: The application package requests programmatic and budgetary information needed to evaluate new applications, make funding decisions, and evaluate the performance of grantees. How Reduction Achieved: The application will not be needed since there will be no competition in 2002. Change in Burden: - 42,000 hours Agency: Department of Housing and Urban Development OMB Control No.: 2502-0082 Title: Recertification of Family Income & Composition Purpose of the Collection: The Secretary is authorized to make assistance payments to qualified homeowners annually (or more frequently as deeded necessary) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of assistance payments. The re- certification information is submitted by homeowners to mortgagees to determine their continued eligibility for assistance and to determine the amount of assistance a homeowner is to receive. How Reduction Achieved: The Section 235 Program has been eliminated due to lack of funding. Change in Burden: -92,287 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0809 Title: Generic Clearance for MAF & TIGER Updating Activity Purpose of the Collection: The Census Bureau maintains a generic clearance for a number of activities it conducts to create and update its Master Address File (MAF) and maintain the linkage between the MAF and the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database of address ranges and associated geographic information. The Census Bureau plans to use the MAF for post-Census 2000 evaluations and as a sampling frame for the American Community Survey and our other demographic current surveys. In the past, the Census Bureau has built a new address list for each decennial census. The MAF built during Census 2000 is meant to be kept current thereafter, eliminating the need to build a completely new address list for future censuses and surveys. The TIGER is a geographic system that maps the entire country in Census Blocks with applicable address range of living quarter location information. Linking MAF and TIGER allows us to assign each address to the appropriate Census Block, produce maps as needed and publish results at the appropriate level of geographic detail. How Reduction Achieved: The decrease in burden is attributable to reduced activity under the generic clearance since the conclusion of Census 2000. 75 Change in Burden: -234,509 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0856 Title: U.S. Census 2000 Purpose of the Collection: The United States Constitution mandates that a census of the Nation's population and housing be taken every ten years. Census data are used to reapportion the House of Representatives and redraw legislative district boundaries, ensuring that political representation is distributed accurately, and to determine funding allocations for the distribution of billions of dollars of Federal and State funds each year. Census data tell us what we know about our country; they are the definitive benchmark for virtually all demographic information used by State, local, and tribal governments, policy makers, educators, journalists, and community and nonprofit organizations.

The Bureau of the Census developed the ACE approach for measuring coverage of the population in the decennial census. In ACE, we independently count a sample of housing units and the people living in those units, then compare those results to the census. We then use this comparative information to produce final estimates of the coverage for Census 2000. How Reduction Achieved: The decrease in burden is attributable to the collection expiring during FY 2001. It will not be conducted during FY 2002. Change in Burden: -70,513 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control: 0607-0869 Title: Census 2000, Content Reinterview Survey Purpose of the Collection: As part of its plan to evaluate the quality of data collected in the Census 2000, the Census Bureau plans to conduct the Census 2000 Content Reinterview Survey (CRS). The evaluation of the quality of data collected in the Census 2000 is important for both data users and census planners. Data users must have knowledge of the accuracy and reliability of the data in order to make informed decisions about how errors in the data may affect the conclusions they draw from analyzing the data. Census planners require similar information to develop and test methods to improve the overall quality of the data produced in future censuses. The purpose of the CRS is twofold. First, it will be used to estimate response variance for most items on the census long form. To measure response variance, the reinterview will re-ask the same set of questions applying, to the extent possible, similar survey procedures and replicating a similar set of conditions. Secondly, the reinterview will be used to make historical comparisons to previous studies of census content error. How Reduction Achieved: The decrease in burden is attributable to the collection expiring during FY 2001. It will not be conducted during FY 2002.

This survey is critical to implementing the OMB guidance on Aggregate and Allocation of Data on Race for Use in Civil Rights Monitoring. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the survey being submitted as new in FY 2001. Change in Burden: +20,833 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0879 Title: Census 2000, Count Question Resolution Program Purpose of the Collection: After the release of Census 2000 redistricting data, some governmental entities may seek to challenge these official Census 2000 counts. The Census Bureau implemented the Census 2000 Count Question Resolution program (CQR) to address boundary, geocoding, and coverage errors that may arise through this challenge process. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the survey being submitted as new in FY 2001. Change in Burden: +15,600 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control: 0607-0883 Title: 2002 Economic Census Classification Report Purpose of the Collection: The Census Bureau implemented the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the 1997 Economic Census to replace the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. The NAICS has been revised for the 2002 Economic Census. Many of the revisions significantly impact the Construction Sector. In order to provide detailed construction industry statistics reflecting NAICS revisions for the 2002 Economic Census, the Census Bureau will use the NC- 99026, 2002 Economic Census Classification Report, to collect additional information from a sample of construction businesses. Specifically, the Census Bureau will select a sample from the following groups of establishments: (1) any single-unit 88 construction establishment that is only partially coded or (2) any single- unit construction establishment that is currently classified in a NAICS industry that will be split into two or more NAICS industries for the 2002 Economic Census. The information collected will be used to assign the appropriate NAICS codes, update the Business Register (Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL)) and mailing list, improve the sampling frame, and ensure that the correct form is delivered during the initial mailing for the census. This information will be collected in 2001 (prior to the census). During the 2002 Economic Census, the NC-99026 questionnaire also will be used to obtain classification information from partially coded small single-unit manufacturing, mining, and construction establishments, and construction establishments not receiving either a classification report form in 2001 or a more detailed Census of Construction form in the 2002 Economic Census. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the survey being submitted as new in FY 2001. Change in Burden: +13,333 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0884 Title: 2002 Economic Census General Classification Report Purpose of the Collection: Accurate and reliable industry and geographic codes are critical to the Census Bureau's economic statistical programs. New businesses are assigned industry classifications by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Approximately 4 percent of these businesses cannot be assigned industry codes because insufficient information is provided on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form SS-4. Since the 1997 Economic Census, the number of unclassified businesses has grown to almost 250,000. In order to provide detailed industry data for the 2002 Economic Census and the Business Register (Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SSEL)), these unclassified businesses must be assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. During the 2002 Economic Census, the NC-99023, 2002 Economic Census General Classification Report will be used to collect information from unclassified single-unit establishments. In 2001, the year prior to the census, this form will be used to collect information from: 1) establishments with a significant amount of receipts but no payroll; 2) new businesses with a large amount of payroll, but insufficient industry classification; and 3) establishments that have been previously classified as farms, but report large amounts of non-farm payroll. Establishments with significant receipts but no payroll are normally excluded from the economic census. This data collection will determine accurate NAICS codes and identify whether or not these establishments are within the scope of the 2002 Economic Census. New business classifications by the SSA are not always fully coded because of insufficient information. This operation will assign NAICS codes to the unclassified units and ensure that the appropriate form will be mailed to the businesses during the census. In addition, establishments currently classified as farms but reporting substantial amounts of non-farm payroll may be incorrectly classified and excluded from the 2002 Economic Census. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the survey being submitted as 89 new in FY 2001. +38,333 hours Change in Burden: Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0888 Title: 2002 Census of Governments, Local Govt. Directory Purpose of the Collection: The Local Government Directory Survey will be used to update the universe list of public sector entities for the 2002 Census of Governments.

The program uses animal identification, flock management strategies, restrictions on interstate movement, and indemnification to prevent the interstate spread of scrapie, an infectious disease of sheep and goats. Why Increase Occurred: Because the fin al rule contains an information collection requirement that was not included in the proposed rule. Additional requirements were placed on owners, changes in definitions expanded the number of animals affected by program requirements, and changes from a fixed rate indemnity procedure to a market value approach required increased information from producers. Change in Burden: +65,680 hours Agency: Department of Agriculture OMB Control No.: 0579-0158 Title: Importation of Fruits and Vegetables Purpose of the Collection: This collection provides assurance that fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. have been inspected, are considered to be free from plant pests, and are otherwise eligible for importation under U.S. phytosanitary laws and regulations.

Why Increase Occurred: New IC Proposed for year 2002 Change in Burden: +600,000 hours Statute Title and PL#: Accountable Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, USC 60102 Agency: Department of Transportation OMB Control No.: 2115-0633 Title: Licensing and Manning Requirements for Officers on Purpose of the Collection: The information is collected from Mariners licensed to operate towing vessels, prospective towing vessels' officers and companies employing these mariners. The information collection requires the crewmembers of towing vessels to maintain a training- and assessment-record book. Why Increase Occurred: This collection was revised for officers of towing vessels. The rulemaking creates new licenses with levels of qualification and with enhanced training and operating experience, including practical demonstration of skills. The rulemaking addressed public comments and recommendations by the Towing Advisory Committee (TSAC). This resulted in an increase in the population to require recording of towing officer assessment record. Industry comments prompted change, so that competent and established licensed mariners are not required to attend simulator training or other training mechanisms at a substantial cost. Change in Burden: +13,748 hours Statute Title and PL#: 46 CFR Parts 10 and 15 Agency: Department of the Treasury OMB Control No.: 1545-0074 Title: U.S. Individual Income Tax Return Purpose of the Collection: Form 1040 is used by individual taxpayers t o report their taxable income and calculate their correct tax liability. Why Increase Occurred: Changes were made throughout Form 1040, schedules and instructions by adding lines, new worksheets, and Code references and deleting lines and Code references due to legislation. Change in Burden: +18,744,806 Statute Title and PL#: Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 113 Agency: Department of the Treasury OMB Control No.: 1545-0085 Title: U.S. Individual Income Tax Return Purpose of the Collection: Form 1040A is used by individual taxpayers to report their taxable income and calculate their correct tax liability. Why Increase Occurred: Changes were made throughout Form 1040A, schedules and instructions by adding lines and new worksheets and deleting lines due to legislation. Change in Burden: +6,966,893 hours Statute Title and PL#: Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 P.L.. 107-16 Agency: Department of the Treasury OMB Control No.: 1545-0090 Title: U.S. Self-Employment Tax Return Purpose of the Collection: Forms 1040-SS and 1040-PR are used to determine whether the proper amount of self-employment tax is reported. Why Increase Occurred: Forms 1040-SS and 1040-PR were revised to allow bona fide residents of Puerto Rico to claim the additional child tax credit due to legislation. Also, due to a change in law, the number of filers increased. Change in Burden: +2,656,120 hours Statute Title and PL#: P.L. 105-34, Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Agency: Department of Treasury OMB Control No.: 1512-0129 OMB Control No.: Firearms Transaction Record, Part I, Over the Counter Title: ATF F 4473 is used to determine the eligibility of a person to receive a firearm from a Federal firearms licensee. Why Increase Occurred: The change in burden hours were necessary to address the new questions on the ATF F 4473 that pertain to non-immigrant aliens and other required information. Change in Burden: +586,765 hours Statute Title and PL#: Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 Relating to Firearms Disabilities for Non-immigrant Aliens, Public Law Agency: Department of Treasury OMB Control No.: 1557-New Title: USA Patriot Act Paperwork Requirements Purpose of the Collection: Records and disclosures needed to implement the various provisions of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act). Why Increase Occurred: OCC may issue regulations to implement new law. Change in Burden: +50,000 hours Statute Title and PL#: The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act), Public Law 107-56 ( Ctober 26, 2001). Other Increases Agency: Department of Commerce 0607-0368 Special Census Program OMB Control No.: Title: 114 Purpose of the Collection: The Special Census Program is a reimbursable service offered and performed by the Census Bureau for the government of any State; county, city, or other political subdivision within a State; for the government of the District of Columbia; and for the government of any possession or area over which the U.S. exercises jurisdiction, control, or sovereignty, and other governmental units which require current population. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the Special Census Program being reinstated during FY 2002 after a period of activity during the 2000. Change in Burden: +113,527 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0452 Title; Government Employment Forms Purpose of the Collection: The forms are used during census and non-census years to collect data on government employment, pay, and hours. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the forms' upcoming usage in the 2002 Census of Governments. Change in Burden: +61,083 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0585 Title: Government Finance Forms Purpose of the Collection: The forms are used during census and non-census years to collect data on government finances. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the forms' upcoming usage in the 2002 Census of Governments. Change in Burden: +92,278 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0810 Title: American Community Survey Purpose of the Collection: This survey will collect long-form data every month and provide tabulations of these data on a yearly basis. In the past, the long-form data were collected only at the time of each decennial census. The American Community Survey will allow the Census Bureau to remove the long form from the 2010 Census, thus reducing operational risks. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to an increase in sample size as a result of the ACS going to full implementation. Change in Burden: +1,322,200 hours Agency: Department of Commerce OMB Control No.: 0607-0 889 Title: 2002 Economic Census, Commodity Flow Survey Purpose of the Collection: The 2002 Commodity Flow Survey produces key information about the transportation of freight in the United States. This survey provides a crucial set of statistics on the value, weight, mode, and distance of commodities shipped by mining, manufacturing, wholesale, and selected other businesses. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden is attributable to the collection being submitted as new in FY 2002. Change in Burden: +400,000 hours Agency: Department of Agriculture 0584-0492 OMB Control No.: 115 Title: Repayment Demand and Program Disqualification Purpose of the Collection: Comply with the Food Stamp Act and Food Stamp Program Regulations by initiating collection action for repayment of over-issued benefits and proceed against those suspected of committing an Intentional Program Violation (ITP). Why Increase Occurred: Previous OMB approval did not include the requirement for IPV acquittal notices and the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem (DRS). Change in Burden: +12,079 hours Agency: Department of Agriculture OMB Control No.: 0584-0006 Title: 7 CFR Part 210, National School Lunch Program Purpose of the Collection: After School Snack. Implement pro visions to allow reimbursement for snacks served in after school care programs in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the National School Lunch Program. Why Increase Occurred: After School Snack. Burden hours increase is due to State agency processing claims for reimbursement and also sponsors and institutions meeting the eligibility requirements and complying with licensing/approval criteria. Change in Burden: +437,547 hours Agency: Department OMB Control No.: 0584- 0055 Title: 7 CFR Part 226, Child & Adult Care Food Program Purpose of the Collection: Integrity - Implements requirements designed to improve Program Operations and monitoring at the State and sponsor levels and to streamline and simplify Program requirements for State agencies and CACFP institutions. After School Snack - Implements provisions to allow reimbursement for snacks served in after school care programs in the NSLP and CACFP. The Disclosure of F/R Price - Establishes requirements for the disclosure of eligibility information to State Medicaid and SCHIP. Why Increase Occurred: Integrity - Burden hours increase is due to change in requirements when a State agency denies an application or terminates and institution that is seriously deficient and also sponsoring organizations must now provide a copy of the serious deficiency notice to their respective State agency. After School Snack - Burden hours increase in due to State agency processing claims for reimbursement and also sponsors and institutions meeting the eligibility requirements and complying with licensing/approval criteria. The Disclosure of F/R Price - Burden hour increase is due to State agency and childcare institutions entering into an agreement with the party requesting the information. The requesting party must obtain consent and give notice for the use of the information. Change in Burden: +104,442 hours Agency: Department of Education OMB Control No.: 1810-0576 Title: Consolidated State Application Purpose of the Collection: The purpose of this collection is to gather baseline information about a student's achievement and to provide a plan to improve that achievement. Why Increase Occurred: This is an increase in burden hours since it is a reinstatement of the Consolidated Application, OMB # 1810-0576 that expired several years ago. However, there is an actual reduction in burden for States that apply for funds on a consolidated application, as compared to the 116 burden of an individual application. If, as anticipated, a large number of States use this Consolidated Application (rather than individual applications), there will ultimately be a significant burden reduction. Change in Burden: +12, 000 hours Agency: Department of Education OMB Control No.: 1810-0614 Title: Consolidated State Performance Report and State Self-Review Purpose of the Collection: The Performance Report is used by the States for reporting annual school year data to the Department of Education (ED). Why Increase Occurred: Although ED has reinstated the previous 137,086 expired burden hours, it is important to note that there is a reduction of 2,318 burden hours from the revised collection. Certain portions of the collection have been eliminated or modified, and sections have been added to cover newly authorized programs. In FY 2002, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) will be developing a successor to this current Consolidated Report that will further reduce the amount of information States need to report. As a result of this effort, significant burden hour reductions are anticipated. Change in Burden: +134,768 hours Agency: Department of Education OMB Control No.: 1840-NEW Title: Annual Performance Report for Titles III and V Purpose of the Collection: In order for ED to make a determination if grantees have made substantial progress in obtaining their objectives, ED must receive a report on their progress. The purpose of this collection is to obtain information concerning the use of Federal funds that will assist in making determinations of progress/performance for Title III and V programs. Why Increase Occurred: This is a new collection. Change in Burden: +12,700 hours Agency: Department of Education OMB Control No.: 1850-NEW Title: Small Busi ness Innovation Research Program Purpose of the Collection: This collection will be a solicitation of discretionary grant applications. Small business firms, such as firms with strong research capabilities in educational technology, science, or engineering in any of the topic areas listed will be invited to submit research applications under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. The objectives of this program include stimulating technological innovation in the private sector, strengthening the role of small business in meeting Federal research and development (R&D) needs, increasing the commercial application of ED- supported research results, and improving the return on investment from federally-funded research for economic and social benefits to the Nation. Why Increase Occurred: This is a new collection for grants. Change in Burden: +10,000 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2040-NEW Title: Minimum Monitoring Requirements for Direct and Indirect Discharging Mills in the Bleached Papergrade Kraft and Soda Subcategory of the Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Point Source Category (EPA ICR #1878.01) 117 Purpose of the Collection: EPA has imposed minimum monitoring requirements on bleached paper-grade kraft and soda mills as part of the final Cluster Rules. These provisions require these mills to monitor their effluent for certain pollutants, including chloroform, at specified frequencies. (In as separate action, EPA also is amending the Cluster Rules to allow these mills to demonstrate compliance with applicable chloroform discharge standards by certifying to certain process conditions. The net result associated with voluntarily certifying is expected to be a substantial savings in burden and costs that would otherwise be incurred for minimum monitoring. See write-up for EPA ICR 2015.01). Why Increase Occurred: All mills are currently required to perform monitoring with minimum frequencies for pollutants controlled. Change in Burden: +36,858 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2040-0235 Title: Pollution Prevention Compliance Alternative; Transportation Equipment Cleaning (TEC) Point Source Category (40 CFR Part 442) (EPA ICR # 2018.01) Purpose of the Collection: This final rule included a regulatory compliance option which allows certain facilities to develop a Pollutant Management Plan (PMP) in lieu of meeting numeric standards. Facilities have the option to develop this plan if it would be a more beneficial compliance alternative. The PMP is only available for indirect dischargers, who have until August 14, 2003 to comply with the regulations. Why Increase Occurred: The Pollutant Management Plan includes requirements for record keeping and paperwork that were not previously included in the burden estimate for the TEC industry. The final rule was promulgated August 14, 2000. Change in Burden: + 19,144 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2040-0240 Title: 2000 Aquatic Animal Production Industry (detai led survey) (EPA ICR # 2038.01) Purpose of the Collection: The detailed survey or questionnaire is the second step of a two- step regulatory information collection effort to support the aquatic animal production effluent guideline development. The technical data collected with this survey will be used to determine technologies for consideration in developing standards for the industry including cost and the estimated economic impacts of the regulation. Why Increase Occurred: Court order deadline to develo p the rule and need to collect the information for rule development. Change in Burden: +19,840 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2040-0241 Title: Cooling Water Intake Structures New Facility Final Rule (EPA ICR #1973.02) Purpose of the Collection: On December 18, 2001, EPA published the New Facility Rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C., Section 1326(b). The information requested will be included in permit application and will be used by a permitting authority to assess the facility-level compliance with the requirements of the final rule. The information requested regarding location, design, and structure of cooling water intake structures, velocity, flow, technologies to minimize, to reduce 118 impingement mortality and entrainment and the restoration technologies would help the permitting authorities to determine whether a facility has minimized the adverse environmental impacts from the operation of the cooling water intake structure. Why Increase Occurred: The increase occurred because of regulating these new industries (regulation implements Section 316(b) of the CWA for new facilities). Change in Burden: +40,376 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2070-0033 Title: TSCA Existing Chemical Test Rules, Consent Orders, Test Rule Exemptions, and Voluntary Test Data Submissions (EPA ICR#1139.06) Purpose of the Collection: Test rules and consent orders collect the information which the Agency is required to collect under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 4 of the TSCA (40 CFR 790) was designed to assure that those chemicals which may pose serious risks to human health or the environment are tested by manufacturers and processors. If this information collection activity was not carried out after having determined that data was needed to assess risks associated with manufacture, processing, or disposal of a chemical, EPA would not have enough data to support necessary regulatory action and would be violating the requirements of section 4 of TSCA. Why Increase Occurred: The Chemical Right-to-Know Initiative was announced by Vice President Al Gore on the eve of Earth Day, 1998. This Initiative responds to an EPA study that found that very little basic toxicity information is publicly available on most of the high production volume (HPV) commercial chemicals made and used in the United States. Without this basic hazard information, it is hard to make sound judgments about what potential risks these chemicals could present to people and the environment. The HPV Challenge Program is a voluntary initiative under which manufacturers of HPV chemicals will voluntarily develop and/or submit certain Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) screening level studies for the chemicals they manufacture. EPA believes that the development and/or submission of such data represent costs and burdens not captured in existing information collections. OMB approved the ICR on 10/15/01. Change in Burden: +1,106,124 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2070-0033 Title: Final Rule Pending - Certain High Production Volume (HPV) Chemicals Test Rule [SAN #3990; RIN Purpose of the Collection: Test rul es collect the information that EPA is required to collect under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 4 (40 CFR Part 790) was designed to assure that those chemicals that may pose serious risks to human health or the environment are tested by manufacturers and processors. If this information collection activity was not carried out after having determined that data were needed to assess risks associated with manufacture, processing or disposal of a chemical, EPA would not have enough data to support necessary regulatory action and would be violating the requirements of section 4 of TSCA. This rule will require testing and record keeping requirements for certain chemicals for which industry does not voluntarily agree to 119 provide testing in a timely manner. The action is part of the Chemical Right-to-Know Initiative, which is described in the Regulatory Plan. Industry has volunteered to conduct needed testing on over 2,155 high production volume (HPV) chemicals. The first rule proposed testing for 37 unsponsored HPV chemicals with substantial worker exposure. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on December 26, 2000. Why Increase Occurred: This action is related to a challenge to industry announced by former Vice President Al Gore on the eve of Earth Day, 1998, to come forward quickly with needed test data on HPV chemicals. This responds to an EPA study that found that very little basic toxicity information is publicly available on most HPV commercial chemicals made and used in the United States. This encompasses approximately 2,800 chemicals that are manufactured (including imported) in the aggregate at more than 1 million pounds on an annual basis. Without basic hazard information, including acute toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, develop- mental and reproductive toxicity; mutagenicity; ecotoxicity and environmental fate, it is hard for EPA to make sound judgments about what potential risks these chemicals could present to people and the environment. This is an ambitious effort to tackle the problem by rapidly testing chemicals and making this important data available to scientists, policy makers, industry and the public. This first test rule will require testing 37 of these chemicals. The chemical testing program will require the submission of letters of intent to test (or exemption applications), study plans and test results. Change in Burden: +14,444 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2070-0155 Title: Final Rule Pending - Notification Requirements for Lead-Based Paint Abatement Activities and Training [SAN #4172; RIN 2070-AD31] (EPA ICR #1715.03) Purpose of the Collection: EPA is issuing this rule under the authority of Section 407 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to establish notification procedures for lead abatement professionals (certified under 40 CFR Part 745.226) conducting lead-based paint activities, and training programs (accredited under 40 CFR Part 225) providing lead-based paint activities courses. Specifically, this rule seeks to establish procedures to notify the Agency prior to commencement of lead -based paint abatement activities as required by 40 CFR part 745.227(e)(4). In addition, this rule seeks to establish provisions that would require training programs accredited under 40 CFR part 745.225 to notify the Agency under the following conditions: 1) prior to providing lead-based paint activities, training, and 2) following completion of lead-based paint activities courses. These notification require ments are necessary to provide EPA compliance monitoring and enforcement personnel with information necessary to track compliance activity and to prioritize inspections. This rule supports 40 CFR Part 745, subpart L to ensure that lead abatement professionals who inspect, assess and remove lead-based paint, dust or soil are well qualified, trained and certified to conduct these activities. Why Increase Occurred: As mentioned above, EPA developed standards for performing lead- based paint activities which include notification to EPA prior to the commencement of lead-based paint abatement activities (40 CFR part 745.227(e)(4)). However, EPA did not detail specific notification procedures, choosing instead to wait and formalized the notification 120 procedures at a later date. This rule introduces these notification requirements, and this ICR represents the additional burden associated with these requirements. The information provided under these requirements is vital to the successful implementation of lead-based paint activities regulations codified at 40 CFR Part 745 subpart L. Change in Burden: + 21,254 hours. Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2070-NEW Title: Final Rule Pending - Management & Disposal of Lead-based Paint Debris [SAN #3508; RIN 2070-AC72] (EPA ICR #1822) Purpose of the Collection: This ICR covers the information collection requirements contained in the proposed rule addressing lead-based paint (LBP) debris management and disposal (hereafter, the \"debris rule\"). The Agency is proposing this rule pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7402 and 404 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 404 allows any State that seeks to administer and enforce standards and regulations comparable to those developed under \u00a7402 to submit an application to EPA for authorization of a State program (Indian Tribes and Alaskan Native Villages may also submit such applications). The rule proposal requires: 1) program authorization application materials and reporting keeping from States/Tribes/Alaskan Native Villages (hereafter, the term \"States\" includes Tribes and Villages); 2) notification and record keeping for any party who transfers LBP debris to any other party for any reason; and, 3) record keeping for any party who receives LBP debris from another party for any reason. Why Increase Occurred: LBP debris is currently subject to RCRA Subtitle C and is therefore subject to the hazardous waste disposal requirements at 40 CFR parts 260 to 265. Included among the hazardous waste regulations are requirements for manifesting hazardous waste and for keeping and maintaining records of tests, analyses, and other waste determinations. Under the proposed RCRA exemption these requirements will no longer be applied to LBP debris, resulting in a reduction in paperwork burdens and costs for generators, transporters, and disposal facilities who handle LBP debris. This reduction is off-set by the paperwork component proposed under TSCA. Although the net result is a burden increase, the net result in costs is a significant reduction. Change in Burden: +1,590,980 hours. Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2070-NEW Title: Final Rule Pending - TSCA Amendments [SAN #3301; RIN 2070-AC61](EPA ICR #1884) Purpose of the Collection: This ICR covers the information collection requirements contained in the pending final rule to amend the Inventory Update Rule (IUR). The amendment modifies the types and amount of information collected and the number and types of respondents. The ICR represents the incremental estimated burden and costs associated with these amendments to IUR reporting. The burden and costs associated with the existing IUR ICR are already approved by OMB under OMB Control No. 2070-0070 (EPA ICR #1011). Once the amendments are finalized, the information collection requirements contained in the final rule will be incorporated into the ICR for the current IUR. The IUR requires submission of information on mostly organic chemicals produced or imported in volumes greater than 10,000 pounds per year. 121 Why Increase Occurred: EPA is proposing to amend the IUR for three principle reasons: (1) to tailor the chemical substance reporting requirements to more closely match the Agency's information needs without unreasonably increasing the reporting burdens on industry; (2) to obtain updated information relating to the potential human and environmental exposures of chemical substances listed on the TSCA Inventory; and (3) to improve the utility of the information reported under the IUR. The amendments contained in this proposal are intended to obtain critical information that will enable EPA and other government agencies, industry and the public to better screen and assess chemical exposures and risks. A primary user of this information will be EPA. Other Federal Agencies, States, industry groups and the public are also expected to use this information. EPA currently maintains the information collected through IUR on the Chemical Update System ( CUS) database. This database will be modified to incorporate the new information. Although this represents an increase for this ICR, EPA expects to be able to use this information to help set priorities for reviewing chemicals for further evaluation of potential risks, including the imposition of other collection mandates. Note that the burden associated with this collection can be off-set by 65,640 hours with the elimination of EPA ICR #1011, which will no longer be needed after this ICR is in place. Change in Burden: +564,000 hours Agency: Environmental Protection Agency OMB Control No.: 2070-NEW Title: Data Submissions for the [SAN RIN 2070-AC27] (EPA ICR# 2055) Purpose of the Collection: EPA is engaged in an effort jointly with stakeholders to design and develop a voluntary program to evaluate commercial chemicals to which children may have a high likelihood of exposure. The purpose of the voluntary program is to obtain toxicity and exposure data needed to assess the risk of childhood exposure to commercial chemicals. EPA launched a pilot of this program on December 26, 2000. Manufacturers of 23 chemicals have been asked voluntarily to sponsor evaluations of their chemicals in the pilot. This collection addresses the reporting activities necessary to effect a Voluntary Children's Chemical Evaluation Program as described above. Why Increase Occurred: This will be a new information collection activity to obtain voluntary submissions of toxicity and exposure data on chemicals to which children may be especially exposed. Change in Burden: +152,000 hours Agency: Department of Housing and Urban Development OMB Control No.: 2502-NEW Title: Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) Purpose of the Collection: The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. 2601 et.seq., and the implementing Regulation X, codified at 24 CFR 3500, require settlement providers to give homebuyers certain information disclosures at or before settlement and pursuant to the servicing of the loan or escrow account. The information collection will include a Special Information Booklet, a Good Faith Estimate, an Initial Servicing Disclosure, the Form HUD-1 or Form HUD-1A, and when applicable an Initial Escrow Account Statement, an Annual Escrow Account Statement, an Escrow Account Disbursement, and an 122 Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure. Why Increase Occurred: This information collection combines six disclosure requirements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Although the combination of these information collections resulted in over 12.7 million burden hours, as a result of certain regulations and statutes, the overall increase will only be 6.7 million burden hours. The combination of the information collections should result in timely reporting in the future. Change in Burden: +6,773,906 hours Agency: Department of Housing and Urban Development OMB Control No.: 2502-NEW Title: Computation of Surplus Case Distributions Purpose of the Collection: This information collection will review and monitor all projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-held mortgages, including the Section 202 Program projects. The information is collected 100% electronically from the HUD Chart of Accounts through the Financial Assessment Sub System. Why Increase Occurred: This is a new collection. A Project's Agreement provides that assets of the mortgagor, held under HUD control, can be disbursed when a Residual Receipts Account is maintained. Change in Burden: +40,000 hours Agency: Department of Interior OMB Control No.: 1024-0018 Title: National Register of Historic Places Registration Form; Continuation Sheet; Multiple Property Documentation Form -- 36 CFR 60 and 63 Purpose of the Collection: Application forms to add properties to National Register of Historic Places. Why Increase Occurred: Renewal of unintentionally expired collection in support of ongoing program, with adjustment. Change in Burden: +56,700 hours Agency: Department of Interior OMB Control No.: 1028-new Title: North American Breeding Bird Survey Purpose of the Collection: The North American Breeding Bird Survey is a long-term, large-scale avian monitoring program that tracks the status and trends of continental bird populations. These data provide an index of population abundance that can be used to estimate population trends and relative abundances at various geographic scales. Declining population trends act as an early warning system to galvanize research to determine the causes of these declines and reverse them before populations reach critically low levels. Why Increase Occurred: During a program review, the USGS discovered this collection in use without OMB approval. As such, the reported \"increase\" in burden hours is not actually new burden on the public, but more accurately reflects ongoing USGS collection activities. Change in Burden: +12,500 hours Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: 1205-0430 Title: Resource Justification Model Purpose of the Collection: This program would replace the current methodologies for budget formulation and grant allocation to the States for the unemployment insurance program. Why Increase Occurred: Program Change - Data used to build the Unemployment Insurance 123 budget from the bottom up and thus ties together formulation and allocation. +12,349 hours Change in Burden: Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: 1205-0431 Title: Unemployment Insurance Data Validation Program Purpose of the Collection: This program requires States to implement and operate a system for ascertaining the validity (adherence to Federal reporting requirements) of specified unemployment insurance data they submit to the ETA on certain reports they are required to submit monthly or quarterly. Some of these data are used to assess performance or determine States' grants for UI administration. Why Increase Occurred: Program Change - The Department will use the UI Data Validation information as a performance measure in the State Quality Service Plan (SQSP) process. States that inaccurately report data on which key UI PERFORMS or GPRA measures are based will be required to include a corrective action plan to ensure their accuracy as part of the SQSP. Change in Burden: +30,187 hours Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: 1218-0176 Title: Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illnesses -- 29 CFR Part 1904 Purpose of the Collection: To develop and maintain an effective program of collection, compilation, and analysis of occupational safety and health statistics. This collection is the Nation's only comprehensive collection of occupational injury and illness data. Why Increase Occurred: Through the rulemaking process, OSHA revised the injury and illness record-keeping requirements. Change in Burden: +2,196,002 hours Agency: Department of Labor OMB Control No.: 1220-0032 Title: The Annual Refiling Survey (ARS) (formerly called the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) forms) Purpose of the Collection: To verify the accuracy of industry codes for business establishments covered by State Unemployment Insurance (U.I.) programs. Why Increase Occurred: The increase in burden hours for FY 2002 reflects a return to the normal ARS survey criteria of verifying one-third of approximately 7.8 million responses. Change in Burden: +53,852 hours Agency: Department of Transportation OMB Control No.: 2120-0673 Title: Criminal History Records Check 14 CFR 107/108 Purpose of the Collection: PL 106-528 provided for fingerprinting of all in dividuals on and after 12/23/2000 who receive unescorted access and those individuals who perform certain screening functions at Category X airports. This emergency rule requires that the airport operators and aircraft operators fingerprint those covered individuals at all categories of airports who before 11/14/01 were not subject to a criminal history records check. Why Increase Occurred: Terrorists attacks of 9/11/01 caused the FAA to expand the population from which fingerprints were collected. Change in Burden: +123,471 hours 124 Agency: Department of Transportation OMB Control No.: 2120-New Title: Certification of Airports 14 CFR part 139 Purpose of the Collection: The information will be used by the FAA to determine an airport operator's compliance with part 139 safety and operational requirements.

Paperwork Reduction Act Compliance Section 5(C) of OMB Bulletin No. 02-02 (October 17, 2001) asked each agency to documents its compliance with the information collection provisions of the PRA. Appendix C of OMB Bulletin No. 02-02 indicated that OMB is required to report to Congress all violations of the PRA and its implementing regulations. Agencies were asked to report (1) the title of the information collection, (2) the nature of the violation, and (3) how the violation was discovered and remedied. The violations reported are described in three lists. This document lists 406 violations of the Paperwork Reduction Act, only 109 of which remain unresolved as of March 12, 2002 (the cut-off date for preparing these lists). This is a substantial improvement over the number of violations identified in the FY 2001 ICB. The first list, \"FY 2001 Lapses in OMB Approval, Resolved as of March 12, 2002,\" identifies by agency (and agency division) those ongoing collections of information for which OMB approval had expired. The Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development had a significant number of entries on this table, 76 and 40 respectively. These high numbers reflect significant progress during the last year resolving previously identified problems. The second list, \"FY 2001 Lapses in OMB Approval, Unresolved as of March 12, 2002,\" identifies ongoing agency use of an expired information collection. Agencies with a large number of entries include the Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs with 21, 37, and 11 respectively. The third list, \"FY 2001 Violations: Collections without OMB approval or modified without OMB approval,\" identifies 28 agency uses of an information collection (or substantive or material modification thereof) 40 without having first obtained OMB approval under the PRA. 40 \"An agency may not make a substantive or material modification\" of an already approved collection of information without obtaining OMB approval for that modification. 44 U.S.C. 3507(h)(3), 5 CFR 1320.5(g). 127 Table D.1: FY 2001 Lapses in OMB Approval Resolved as of March 12, 2002 OMB Control Date of Date of

PRA Violations Memorandum 151 We are writing to you to emphasize the importance of the Federal Government complying fully with the information collection provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), and to ask for your assistance in eliminating existing PRA violations and preventing future violations. The PRA requires agencies and OMB to ensure that information collected from the public minimizes burden and maximizes practical utility. The Act assigns to each agency's Chief Information Officer (CIO) the responsibility for ensuring that the agency complies with the PRA. The attached paper summarizes the PRA and its requirements for public, agency, and OMB review of collections of information. OMB's review is conducted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). In this year's Information Collection Budget (ICB), OMB documented 487 violations of the PRA, of which 191 remained unresolved as of the cut-off date for the ICB's publication. While these figures do represent a continuation in the recent downward trend in the number of PRA violations, we cannot allow this situation to continue. Our objective is to ensure that the Federal Government is in full compliance with the PRA by no later than the end of this fiscal year. OMB would therefore like to work with each of your agencies to resolve existing violations and take whatever actions are necessary to avoid future violations. 152 As a first step, we are asking the CIOs of the 27 agencies identified in the Information Collection Budget to provide the following information to your agency's OIRA desk officer: For each violation of the PRA described in Appendix B.2 (i.e., the continued use of collections for which OMB approval has expired), please indicate affirmatively whether your agency (1) has already requested a reinstatement of the OMB approval, (2) is planning to request a reinstatement of the OMB approval, or (3) has discontinued its use. Each of these collections that falls into categories (1) or (2) represents a violation of the PRA until its approval is reinstated. Provide a timetable for resolution, including publication of all relevant Federal Register notices and submission to OMB, for each collection that your agency plans to continue using. For each violation of the PRA described in Appendix B.3 (i.e., for collections for which OMB approval has never been given), provide a timetable of resolution, including publication of all relevant Federal Register notices and submission to OMB. Describe the procedures that you (and your agency) have in place to prevent future violations, both through your monthly review of OMB's computer- generated reports and through your general oversight and participation in the agency's programmatic functions. Please provide this information to your OIRA Desk Officer by December 14th. In addition, as part of this effort, we are asking agency General Counsels and Solicitors to take whatever actions you can to assist the CIOs in ensuring your agency's full compliance with the PRA. Please inform personnel in your agency that OMB-OIRA is approving a very high percentage of the well-supported information collection requests and thus concern about OMB approval is not a legitimate basis for avoiding OMB review of a worthy information collection. We are aware that OIRA has not always responded to PRA requests in a timely fashion. We are working diligently to correct this problem and to respond to all requests within the time frame described in the statute. If you have any questions about this effort, please contact us directly or have agency staff contact your OIRA Desk Officer. Attachments cc: Lloyd A. Blanchard James Capretta Robin Cleveland Marcus Peacock 153 Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35 ; see 5 CFR Part 1320) requires that the Office of Management and Budget approve all collections of information by a Federal agency from the public before they can be implemented. Collections of information include (1) requests for information for transmission to the government, such as application forms and written report forms, (2) reporting or recordkeeping requirements, and (3) third-party or public disclosure requirements. Many information collections, recordkeeping requirements, and third-party disclosure requirements are contained in or authorized by regulations as monitoring or enforcement tools, while others appear in questionnaires and their accompanying instructions. An underlying goal of the Act is to minimize the Federal paperwork burden on the public. The Act also recognizes the importance of information to the successful completion of agency missions, and charges OMB with the responsibility of weighing the burdens of the collection on the public against the practical utility it will have for the agency. In general terms, the 1995 Act requires agencies to plan for the development of new collections of information and the extension of ongoing collections of information well in advance of sending the proposal to OMB. Advance planning is necessary because agencies need to estimate potential burdens on respondents, prepare to disclose certain additional information to the public (e.g., time limits for recordkeeping requirements), seek public comment through 60-day notice in the Federal Register , and thereafter submit their clearance requests to OMB for review and approval. In developing a paperwork clearance request, the agency needs to demonstrate to OMB that the collection of information is the least burdensome way of obtaining information necessary for the proper performance of its functions, that the collection is not duplicative of others, and that the collection has practical utility. Additionally, the agency is required to certify that a proposed collection of information \"reduces to the extent practicable and appropriate the burden\" on respondents, including, for small business, local government, and other entities, the use of the techniques outlined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. To alert the public that OMB review has begun, agencies publish a notice in the Federal Register of the agency's submission to OMB of a request for approval and tell the public how to comment to OMB regarding the request. The public -- during OMB's review and at any other time -- is to have full opportunity to make its views known concerning any Federal data collection, both as to its perceived practical utility and the reporting burdens involved. Under the Act, OMB approval for an agency to use each data collection instrument can last for a maximum of three years. Approval is evidenced by OMB granting an OMB control number for the information collection instrument. The Act prohibits agencies from penalizing those who fail to respond to Federal collections of information that do not display valid OMB control numbers. The Act also prohibits agencies from penalizing those who have not been informed that a response is not required unless the collection of information displays a valid control number. Both of these public protections \"may be raised in the form of a complete defense, bar, or 154 otherwise at any time during the agency administrative process or judicial action applicable thereto\" (44 U.S.C. 3512(b)). Recent court cases discussing the Act and its \"public protection\" provision include Center for Auto Safety v. NHTSA , 244 F.3d 144 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and Saco River Cellular Inc. v. FCC , 133 F.3d 25 (D.C. Cir. 1998). 155 156 Appendix F. Examples of Economic Surveys and Censuses Conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census The Economic Census -- This census is the major economic statistical program of the United States. It constitutes the chief source of data about the structure and functioning of the Nation's economy, and provides the foundation and framework for a host of other statistical endeavors by public and private sector alike. The Economic Census profiles the U.S. economy every five years, from the national to the local level. The 2002 Economic Census forms will be sent to 5 million businesses in December 2002, asking for information about business activity during calendar 2002. The Census of Governments -- This census provides the primary source of facts about the structure and function of the public sector of the U.S. economy. Data are obtained on government organizations, finances, and employment. Organization data include location, type, and characteristics of local governments and officials. Finances and employment data are the same as in comparable annual surveys and include revenue, expenditure, debt, assets, employees, payroll, and benefits. The public sector universe is a major economic force, totaling about 11 percent of the Gross Domestic Product and 13 percent of the civilian labor force population. The New Residential Construction Survey -- This survey provides statistics on the five phases of a residential construction project. For construction of new privately-owned residential structures in the U.S., data are collected for housing units authorized to be built by a building or zoning permit, housing units authorized to be built, but not yet started, housing units started, housing units under construction, and housing units completed. New residential construction statistics exclude group quarters (such as dormitories and rooming houses), transient accommodations (such as transient hotels, motels, and tourist courts), \"HUD-code\" manufactured (mobile) homes, moved or relocated buildings, and housing units created in an existing residential or nonresidential structure. Statistics are based upon reports submitted by local building permit officials in response to a mail survey. The Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders Survey -- This survey provides broad-based, monthly statistical data on economic conditions in the domestic manufacturing sector. The survey measures current industrial activity and provides an indication of future business trends. Data are used by various Federal agencies for developing economic, fiscal, and monetary policy, the Bureau of Economic Analysis as components of the gross domestic product estimates, and trade associations, corporate economists, and other members of the business community as an analytical tool for assessing the current and future economic condition of the country. U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services -- The foreign trade statistics programs provide official monthly statistics on imports, exports, and balance of trade for all types of merchandise and commodities moving between the United States and its international trading partners. It is unique among the Census Bureau's economic statistics 157 programs in that the information is not collected from forms sent to respondents soliciting responses as in the case of surveys. Rather, the information is compiled from forms and automated reports filed initially with the U.S. Customs Service or, in some cases, directly with the Census Bureau, for virtually all shipments leaving (exports) or entering (imports) the United States. The trade statistics are a principal economic indicator for the U.S. and provides national performance indicators critical to understanding our economy as well as our economic relationship with the rest of the world. They are released within 50 days of the data month. The Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM ) -- The ASM collects information from a sample of 52,000 manufacturing plants and presents comprehensive information on over 474 manufacturing industries. Data include employment, payroll, fringe benefits, costs of materials, capital expenditures, fuels consumed, value of shipments by product class, and inventories by stage of fabrication. Beginning with calendar year 1999, the program also collected data on e-commerce shipments and purchases. Shipments and employment data are also provided at the State level. This program is the primary source of comprehensive data on the manufacturing sector for the years between Economic Censuses. The Services Annual Survey (SAS) - The SAS collects information from a sample of 51,000 service businesses and provides revenue and other measures for some 250 service industries. The industry coverage and detailed information have been expanded over the past decade and now cover about two thirds of the industries covered in the Economic Census. Data include information on operating revenue for both taxable and tax-exempt firms, sources of revenue and expenses by type for selected industries, and operating expenses for tax-exempt firms. Starting with the 1999 survey we also collect information on on-line sales. SAS is the primary source of information on the rapidly changing service sector of our economy. The Annual Finance Survey - The Annual Finance Survey collects data from approximately 8,000 State and local government entities and presents comprehensive information on their expenditures, revenues, indebtedness, and assets. The revenue data include detailed tax data by the major categories of property, sales, income, and licenses. The annual report also provides detailed information on intergovernmental receipts by source of funds; the expenditures data also are shown by functional category. This survey is the only source of detailed information on the activities of the Nation's 90,000 governmental units. 158 "}
