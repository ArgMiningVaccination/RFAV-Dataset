Dr. Murphy talks about the need for taking a balanced approach to healthcare as per Hahnemann and Asclepius that Hahnemann wrote about in the article \"Asclepius in the Balance\" (Aeskulap auf der Wagschale). Transcript So, Hahnemann wrote a book, now, Hahnemann was in his forties, or something when he discovered Homeopathy. He gave up medicine for 20 years there's no Homeopath - I was in India, had 2-3000 people in the audience, all the professors and all these people there, I taught and said, \"How many people read the article Aesculapius in the Balance?\" Not one hand rose up First I said, \"How many people follow Hahnemann?\" 100%. Okay? And no one ever read, in Homeopathy, that work of Hahnemann before he became a homeopath. Okay? So, Aesculapius in the Balance, the first principle of homeopathy is we have to have a balanced approach to diet, nutrition and all this stuff, plus the therapeutic part. Okay? [So, ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Asklepios_-_Epidauros.jpg) [Aesculapius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius), now, the story of Aesculapius is very interesting. Who was Aesculapius? The Greek god of medicine. Okay? And he had two basic approaches to treating people. One is hygiene, clean, diet, exercise, meditation, lifestyle. And the other is remedies. You will never have a complete system of medicine if you only do drugs or remedies or herbs. That is not a system of medicine. That's a system of therapeutics Allopathic medicine is not a medical system. It's a therapeutic system. There's no diet in it. There's no exercise in it, there's no cosmology, there's no paradigm. There's no principle. It's not a system of medicine. It's a system of therapeutics. Homeopathy is not a system of medicine. Even though we keep saying the language. It's a therapeutic system. So, homeopathy is the panacea approach; looking to cure people. Hygiene is looking for prevention and enhancement and longevity and beautifying the human being. Okay? And Hahnemann wrote this before he became a homeopath. So, I followed the whole Hahnemann, from his beginning of his medical studies to the end of his life. Everyone else I call half Hahnemann, they only follow his homeopathic part. In those 20 years before he was a homeopath, Hahnemann was going barefoot, he was using brandy, charcoal, vinegar to cure people, food, spices in the kitchen, fresh air. This was Hahnemann's approach. He gave up medicine, he refused. He said it was barbaric. It's even more barbaric today. And that leads to health and a balanced approach. Now, here's the Greek mythology, Aesculapius, there's a statue, Greek god of medicine, is the god of all medical healing arts and health. Okay? He had two daughters. They did not like each other. Does that sound familiar? One daughter called Panacea, the goddess of healing, remedies, and cures. She was the daughter of Aesculapius and she is flying around the universe with a vial of what? Oil. She has a vial of oil and wherever she puts her grace and drops the vial of oil, the person gets cured. So, for a thousand years, the Greek physicians were trying to find this oil. So, they got into oils because of this mythology. There's even movies about it. There's a movie about this healing oil or some man's name oil, I forgot the name. Cancer Kid or something. Lorenzo's oil, this type of thing? Yes, snake oil. Okay? Now, her sister, there beautifying, cleaning herself was named Hygieia, where we get the word Hygiene. So, Homeopathy has both of these. But [in] Homeopathy, the remedies are here, symbiotic medicine is both. Now, today, this is alternative medicine, and this is standard medicine, and there's no balance. Now, I don't want to say too much, but if we were back in time and you went to a hospital, you would not recognize it as a hospital. You want to go to a real hospital? I tell you what a real hospital is like. A real hospital is a spa, a health spa, and you walk into a hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. You walk in, they take all your clothes off, they bathe you, they oil you, they put you in a white robe. They feed you raw foods, they give you herbs and it's just dreamy. And you're treated like a royalty. You're massaged, you're waited on, you're relaxed, you're calm, there's flowers, there's music. That's how you promote healing versus steel beds and lights and needles and poking, and that. People say \"oh, I get to go to the hospital. That, to us, is a vacation. There should be a place for healing versus a place where you're most likely to get diseases and pain and stuff. Okay? So, she was also the goddess of longevity. So, longevity is ruled by hygiene. Okay? So, hygiene practice, diet, fresh air, oil, spices. So, day one, I've never given that stuff. [They say] \"yeah, you're not a classical homeopath.\" So, what does that mean? This is the word they spit out to you. I'm sure some of the people that spoke before - that's a big word, classical. I said, what's classical mean? They say, historical. I said, well, let's look at clinical homeopathy is historical, because I use all the different things and they just chose one of the techniques that's classical according to one technique [that gives] one dose and waits weeks or months. Okay? So, Hahnemann recommended all this stuff sunshine, fresh air, and all this stuff. He follows a natural philosopher called Rousseau ( [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://amzn.to/3Indm45), 1712-1778). Okay? So, the first principle is we have to have a balanced approach. Not according to me, according to the father of homeopathy. "}
