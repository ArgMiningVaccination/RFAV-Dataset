Last updated on Sep 3, 2023. What is the nasal flu vaccine? This vaccine is sprayed into your nose to help prevent influenza (the flu). The flu is caused by a virus. The virus spreads from person to person through coughing and sneezing. Several types of viruses cause the flu. The viruses change over time, so new vaccines are made each year. The vaccine begins to protect you about 2 weeks after you get it. Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. What should I tell my doctor before I get the nasal flu vaccine? - You have any serious allergies, such as an egg allergy that causes a severe reaction. The flu vaccine may contain a small amount of egg protein. The amount is so low that it is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. Egg-free vaccines may be available. - You have a chronic health problem, such as diabetes, a heart or lung disease, or a blood disorder. - You have kidney disease or receive dialysis. - You have chronic liver disease or alcoholism. - You developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of getting a flu vaccine. You may not be able to get any flu vaccine unless your provider feels the benefits outweigh the risks. Who should not get the nasal flu vaccine or should wait to get it? - You are 50 years or older. - You are sick or have a fever of 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C) or higher. - You had an allergic reaction to the nasal flu vaccine or any part of it. - You have a weak immune system, or you care for someone else who does. - You do not have a spleen, or your spleen does not work properly. - You are pregnant. - You took antiviral medicine for the flu in the past 3 weeks. - You have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak or a cochlear implant. - You have tested positive for COVID-19 or are in quarantine after exposure to COVID-19. What are the risks of the nasal flu vaccine? The vaccine may cause mild symptoms, such as a fever, headache, and muscle aches. You may still get the flu after you receive the vaccine. You may have an allergic reaction to the vaccine. This can be life-threatening. Call your local emergency number (911 in the US) if: - Your mouth and throat are swollen. - You are wheezing or have trouble breathing. - You have chest pain or your heart is beating faster than normal for you. - You feel like you are going to faint. When should I seek immediate care? - Your face is red or swollen. - You have hives that spread over your body.
