This normally heals spontaneo usly following comp letion of the radiotherapy treatment however serious radiation- related comp lications can develop months or years later (Bennett et al 2016). This can result in fibrosis, ulceration or areas of cell death (radiation necrosis). Late tissue radiation damage can s ignificantly reduce quality of life and can be life threatening (Bennett et al 20 16). Areas that are particularly sensitive to soft tissue radiation damage are the pelvis, especially the rectum, and the skin and mucosa of the he ad and nec k (Hoggan & Cameron 2014). Pelvic radiation disease is defined as \"transient or long-term probl ems ranging from mild to severe, arising in non-cancerous tissues resulting from radiotherapy treatment to a tumour of pelvic origin\" (van de Wetering et al 20 16). Radiation proctopathy is the most commonly investigated late-radiation effect to the pelvis with common symptoms including rectal urgency, rectal incontinence, pain, strictures, mucus discharge and rectal bleeding (van de Wetering et al 2016). Symptoms associate with pelvic radiation can also include bloating, flatulence a nd diarrhoea (Glover et al 2016). and symptomatology radiation proctopathy are c omplex because different anorectal sub-regions can be involved (van de Wetering et al 2016). Haemorrhagic cystitis is \"a diffuse inflammatory condition of the bladder due to an infectious or non-infectious aetiology resulting in bleeding from the bladder mucosa\" and is a \"relatively common and potentially severe comp lication of high-dose chemoradiother apy for the treatment of pelvic malignancies\" (Shao et al 2011). The clinical manifestation of this condition can vary from microscopic haematuria to severe haemorrhage with clot formation and urinary tract obstruction. This can lead to \"hydronep hrosis and acute renal failure when it becomes chroni c and recurrent\" (Shao et al 20 11). Symptoms can include urinary frequency, urgency and pel vic pain (Shao et al 20 11). Existing guidance from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) NICE have not published any guidance on the treatment of soft tissue radiation dam age or the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The indication an d epidemiology Late radiation tissue injury affects between 5% and 15% of long time survivors who received radiother apy with the incidence varying with dose, age and treatment site (Bennett et al 20 16). In patients who have received radiother apy for pelvic cancer, up to a third subsequently develop chroni c moderate or severe gastrointestinal symptom s (Glover et al 2016)..Between 4% and 22% of pa tients receiving pelvic radiotherapy will develop significant soft tissue radiation injury affecting quality of life, however the true incidence is likely to be higher due to insufficient long-term follow-up, frequent lack of recognition and social stigma (NHS England 2017). No data were identified for the proportion of patients that have symptoms that are not relieved or rendered manageable by standard interventions. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 5 of 37 Standard treatment and pat hway of care Treatments for late tissue radiation damage include symptom management and surgery to remove or repair the affected area (Bennett et al 20 16). Surgical intervention in an area that has received radiation therapy is associated with an increased incidence of delayed healing, infection or breakdown of the surgical wound (Bennett et al 20 16). Non-surgical options include aminosalicylic acid derivatives (such as sulfasalazine and oxygen retinol palmitate and Chinese traditional medicine in comb ination with Western medicine (van de Wetering et al 20 16). Management strategies for patients whose condition fails to respond to standard interventions remain unclear and lacking in good quality evidence (NHS England 2017 ). The intervention (and licensed indication) In hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO T) patients receive 100% oxygen inside a pressuris ed treatment chamber (Hoggan & Cameron 2014). Treatments typically involve pressuris ation of between 2.0 and 2.5 atmosphere absolute (ATA) (203 to 253 kilopascal (kPa)1) for between 60 an d 120 minutes once or t wice dail y for a total of 30 to 60 sessi ons (Bennett et al 2016). Rationale for use The aim of HBO T is to increase the number of blood vessels in irradiated tissue, improve tissue quality, promote healing and prevent breakdown of irradiated areas (Bennett et al 2016). 2 Summ ary of results This evidence review found two randomised controlled trials comp aring HBO T to sham treatment, one randomised controlled trial co mparing HBO T to intravesical hy aluroni c acid and one compari ng HBOT to argon plasma coagulation (APC). The studies considered different outcomes and reported outcomes at different time periods following treatment. Outcom es most commonly related to changes in the symptom s experienced by patients. The most recent trial with 84 patients considered outcomes of gastrointestinal symptom s, rectal bleeding and bowel dy sfunction. This study did not find any significant differences in the outcomes for patients receiving HBOT and patients receiving sham treatment 12 months after the treatment (Glover et al 20 16). The largest trial with 150 patients found a greater improvement in LENT SOMA score (a scori ng system for severity of radiation-induced complications) for the HBOT group than the sham group immediately following treatment (an improvement of 5.00 points for HBO T and 2.61 points for sham) (Clarke et al 20 08). 1 1 ATA = 101.3 kPa NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 6 of 37 This study also found that a great er proportion of HBOT patients showed at least some improvement on clinical evaluation imme diately following treatment (89% vs 63%) (Clarke et al 20 08). Four categories were used for clinical improvement : healed, significant improvemen t, moderate improvement or no improvement. The propor tion of patients that were considered healed in each group was 8% for HBO T and 0% for sham. No definition was provided to explain what was meant by a moderate or significant improvemen t. Quality of life outcomes were reported in one trial (Clarke et al 2008). This found no difference between HBOT and sham patients in general well-being assessed imme diately after treatment. The study did find that the HBO T group had a great er improvement from baseline (14%) than the sham group (5%) on a bowel bother scale. However the HBOT group had a lower score at baseline and the bo wel bother scores were similar for both groups immediately following treatment (approximately 60%). The evidence review also found two small studies that compared HBO T to other treatments. These were intravesical hyaluroni c acid instillation (HA) in patients with haemorrhagic cystitis (Shao et al 2011) and argon plasma coagulation (APC) in patients with radiation proctopathy (\u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 20 11). Shao et al (2011) found no significant difference between HBO T and HA in the proportion of patients showing a partial or comp lete response to treatment (75% in bo th groups at final follow-up 18 m onths after treatment). No direct comparison of the two groups was done for the other outcomes reported by Shao et al (2011) of voiding (urinating) frequency a nd pelvic pain. An improvement from baseline was seen in both groups for voiding frequency at six months (by approximately one to three voids per day from a baseline of approximately 10 voids per day). However this improvement was not sustai ned over the 18 month follow-up period. An improvement in pelvic pain from baseline was seen in both groups at six, 12 and 18 months. This improvement was approximately one point on a 10-point pain scale from a baseline of approximately two to three points. \u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al (2011) found no significant difference between HBOT and APC for change in haemoglobin level at one, two or three months follow-up. For the other two outcomes assessed (number of transfusions and tissue toxicity) the improvement was greater in the APC group in the first two months. By three months the HBO T group had also improved and there was no significant difference between the groups. In both groups the number of transfusions required ranged from approximately four to five at baseline to less than one at three months follow-up. The time period ov er which transfusions were received was not specified. One study reported a significantly higher incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the HA group (43%) compared to the HBO T group (10%) at six months follow-up (Shao et al 2011). There was no significant difference between the groups at later follow-up with a UTI incidence of 50% for the HA group and 30% for the HBOT group at 18 months follow-up. Other studies did not report any analysis compari ng the number of adverse events between HBOT and sham or other treatments. Common adverse events in patients receiving HBO T were eye changes including myopia (30% in one s tudy) and ear pain (28% in one study). No studies assessing the cost effectiveness of HBOT for soft tissue radiation damage were identified. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 7 of 37 There were limitations in the studies reported. The two trials compari ng HBOT to sham did not include all patients in their analysis, reducing confidence in their results, and the study authors did not always include enough information to enable the reader to understand the importance of their results. Direct comparison between the studies is not possible due to the different comp arators used, the different outcome measures reported an d the different time periods used for the assessment of outcomes following treatment. At present there is inconsistent evidence ab out the efficacy of HBOT compared to sha m in the treatment of soft tissue radiation dam age following pel vic irradiation. Further adequately powered trials comparing HBOT to sham may be warranted. 3 Methodolog y The methodol ogy to undertake this review is specified by NHS England in their 'Guidance on conducting evidence reviews for Specialised Commissioning Products' (2016). A description of the relevant Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (PICO) to be included in this review was prepared by NHS England's Policy Working Group for the topic (see s ection 9 for PICO). The PICO was used to search for relevant publications in the following sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, TRIP and NHS Evidence (see section 10 for search strategy). The search dates for publications were between 1st January 2007 and 24th April 2 017. The titles and abstracts of the results from the literature searches were assessed using the criteria from the PICO. Full text versions of papers which appeared potentially useful were obtained and reviewed to determine whether they were appropri ate for inclusion. Papers which matched the PICO were selected for inclusion in this review. Systematic reviews on HBOT for soft tissue radiation damage were identified by the literature search (Bennett et al 20 16; Hoggan & Cameron 2014). When systematic reviews are available they would norm ally be used as t he primary source of evidence for a review. However, the two systematic reviews identified were not specific to patients who had received pelvic irradiation, used different comparators and did not include any pooled or meta-analysis relating to radiation tissue da mage from pelvic irradiation. In addition, not all of the pelvic irradiation studies included in the systematic reviews met the criteria for the population specified in the PICO for this review. Therefore the evidence presented in this review is taken from individual studies meeting the PICO rather than from the systematic reviews. Evidence from randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled studies was available. Therefore uncontrolled observational studies, such as cohort studies and case series, were not included in this review. Evidence from all papers included was extracted and recorded in evidence summary tables, critically appraised and their quality ass essed us ing the National Service Framework for Long Term Conditions (NSF-LTC) evidence ass essment framework (see section 7) . The body of evidence for individual outcomes identified in the papers was graded and recorded in grade of evidence tables (see section 8). NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 8 of 37 4 Results A total of four papers matchi ng the PICO were identified: one randomised do uble-blind sh am- controlled trial (Glover et al 2016), one randomised double-blind sham-controlled crossover trial (Clarke et al compari ng HBOT to intravesical hyaluroni c acid instillation (HA) (Shao et al 2011) and one non-randomised controlled study compari ng HBO T to argon plasma coa gulation (APC) (\u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011). Two review papers were used for additional ba ckground information (Bennett et al 20 16; Hoggan & Cameron 2014). The studies ranged in size from 31 to 150 participants, with patients receiving at least 30 HBOT treatments at between 2.0 and 2.5 ATA (203 to 253 kPa) for 60 to 90 minutes. Full details of the study designs and outcomes are summarised in the ev idence tables in s ection 7. Clinica l effectiveness 1. In the population of interest, what is the ef fect of adding HBOT into the stand ard mana gement plan on the sp ecified outcomes? The outcome measures used varied between the studies. The ou tcomes reported in the studies compari ng HBO T to sham included gastrointestinal symptom s, rectal bleeding, LENT SOMA score, clinical evaluation, bowel dysfunction and quality of life. The outcomes reported in the study comp aring HBOT to HA included improvement in symptoms, voiding frequency and pelvic pain. The outcomes reported in the study compari ng HBO T to APC included haemoglobin level, number of transfusions and tissue toxicity. Further details of the ou tcome measures us ed are provided in t he tables in sections 7 and 8. Gastrointestinal symptoms One study reported c hange in gastrointestinal symptom s (Glover et al 2016). This found no significant difference between HBOT and sham at 12 months follow-up (p=0.50). Rectal bleeding One study reported change in rectal bleeding (Glover et al 2016). This found no significant difference between HBOT and sha m at 12 months follow-up (p=0.09). LENT SO MA score One study reported change in mean LENT SOMA score (Clarke et al 2008). This found a significant improvement in mean LENT SOMA score from baseline to imme diately following treatment for both the HBOT and sham groups (p<0.0001) with a greater improvement for the HBO T group (p=0.0019). The improvement in the HBO T group was 5.00 points and in the sh am group the improvement was 2.61 points from baseline scores of 12.55 and 12.84 respectively. In a direct comparis on between the groups, HBOT had significantly better average scores (p=0.0150) with an estimated difference between the groups of 1.93 (95%CI 0.38 to 3.48). The mean scores of the sham group i mproved after they had crossed over to HBOT treatment. Clinica l evaluation One study reported the propor tion of patients showing at least some improvement on clinical evaluation imme diately following treatment (Clarke et al 2008). This found that a significantly greater proportion of HBO T patients (89%) showed at least some improvement on clinical evaluation compared to sha m patients (63%) (p=0.0009) (OR 5.93 95%CI 2.04 to 17.24). The propor tion of patients that were considered healed in each group was 8% for HBOT and 0% for sham. No definition was provided for the other categories of improvement (moderate or significant). NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 9 of 37 Bowel dy sfunc tion One study reported change in bowel dysfunction (Glover et al 2016). This found no significant difference between HBOT and sham for rectal (p=0.12) or intestinal (p=0.20) adverse effects at 12 months follow-up. Quality of life One study reported analysis of quality of life outcomes immediately following treatment (Clarke et al 2008). This found no difference between HBOT and sham in general well-being (p value not reported). A significant improvement from baseline on a bowel bother scale was reported for the HBO T group (14%) (p=0.0007 ) but not for the sham group (5%) (p=0.1521). However the HBOT group had a lower score at baseline so the b owel bother scores were similar for both groups imme diately following treatment (approximately 60%). Change in bowel function score was described but no s tatistical an alysis was reported. No statistic al analyses compari ng HBO T to sham was reported for quality of life outcome s. Improve ment in symptoms One study reported the proportion of patients showing a partial or comp lete response to treatment (Shao et al 2011). The definitions used for a partial or comp lete response are provided in the tables in sections 7 and 8. This found no significant difference between HBO T and HA instillation at six, 12 or 18 months follow-up (p>0.05), with 75% of both groups showing a partial or complete response at final follow-up 18 months after treatment. Voiding frequency One study reported cha nge in bladder voiding frequency (number per day) (Shao et al 20 11). This found a statistically significant improvement from baseline in both the HBOT and HA instillation groups at six months follow-up (p<0.01). For the HBOT group the number of voids per day decreased by a mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 1.2 \u00b1 1.1 from a baseline of 9.8 \u00b1 1.7. For the HA group the number of voids per day decreased by 2.9 \u00b1 1.7 from a baseline of 10.4 \u00b1 1.8. This improvement was reduced but still statistic ally significant at 12 months for the HA group (p<0.01) but not for the HBOT group. By 12 months the mean improvement in voids per day had decreased to 0.2 for the HBO T group. For the HA group the mean improvement in voids per day had decreased to 0.2 by 18 months follow-up. No direct comp arison between HBOT and HA instillation was reported for voiding frequency. Pelvic pain One study reported change in pelvic pain using a scale of one to 10 (Shao et al 2011). This found a statistically significant improvement from baseline for both HBO T and HA instillation at six months, 12 months and 18 months (p<0.05). For the HBO T group the mean \u00b1 standard deviation improvement at six months was 0. 9 \u00b1 0.8 from a basel ine of 2.5 \u00b1 2.2. The mean impr oved further at 18 months to 1.2 \u00b1 1.2. For the HA group the greatest improvement was seen at 18 months with an improvement of 1.5 \u00b1 1.2 from a baseline of 2.8 \u00b1 2.2. No direct comparison between HBO T and HA instillation was reported for change in pel vic pain. Haemoglobin level One study reported change in haemoglobin level (\u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011). This found no significant difference between HBOT and APC at one, two or three months follow-up (p>0.05). Numbe r of transfusions One study reported cha nge in number of transfusions (\u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011). This showed that APC had a statistically significantly greater reduction in mean number of transfusions required compared to HBOT at one an d two months follow-up (p<0.05). At three months follow-up the nu mber of transfusions required had reduced in bot h groups from a baselines of 4.8 \u00b1 7.8 NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 10 of 37 (APC) and 3.8 \u00b1 2.9 (HBOT) to 0.6 \u00b1 0.9 (APC) and 0.8 \u00b1 1.2 (HBO T). The difference be tween the groups was no longer statistic ally significant at three months (p>0.05). Tissu e toxicity One study reported change in tissue toxicity (\u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011). This showed that APC had a statistically significantly greater reduction in mean tissue toxicity compared to HBO T at one and two months follow-up (p<0.05). At three months follow-up tissue toxicity had reduced in both groups and the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant (p>0.05). By three months tissue toxicity had reduced from 12.2 \u00b1 2.9 to 4.8 \u00b1 3.5 in the HBO T group and had reduced from 13.3 \u00b1 2.9 to 3.0 \u00b1 3.5 in the APC group. Safety Only one study pro vided statistical analysis compari ng adverse events between their two groups (Shao et al 2011). This study only reported incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) which was significantly higher in the HA group than the HBOT group at six months follow-up (43% vs 10%, p=0.03). At 12 and 18 months follow-up there was no statistic ally significant difference in UTI between the groups (p=0.1). At final follow-up at 18 months the proportion of UTIs was 50% for the HA group and 30% for the HBO T group. Two studies reported the propor tion of adverse events for each of their groups but did not report any statistic al analysis compari ng safety outcomes for the two groups (Glover et al 2016; \u00c1lvaro- Villegas et al 2011). Glover et al (2016) reported six seri ous adverse events in six HBOT patients and two serious adverse events in two sham patients but did not consider that any of these related to treatment. Common adverse events reported by Glover et al included eye refractive changes including myopia affecting about 30% of the HBO T group and 11% of the sham grou p; increased fatigue or tiredness affecting 4% of the HBOT group and 11% of the sham group; and ear pain or barotrauma affecting 28% of the HBO T group and 21% of the sham group. Two patients in Glover et al stopped treatment due to anxiety (group not specified). Adverse events reported by \u00c1lvaro-Villeg as et al (2011) for the APC group included APC-related rectal ulcers (21%), rectal pain (14%) and pe rsistent rectal bleeding (21%). For the HBO T group only persistent rectal bl eeding was reported affecting 18% of the group. Clarke et al reported adverse events for the whole study population but did not specify treatment group. Adverse events experienced included ear pain or discomfort (16%), transient myopia (3%) and con finement anxiety (2%). 2. Is there evidence that the effect of adjunct HBOT differs in the following three sub- groups: a) In patients in whom there is no evidence of cancer recurrence? Evidence of or history of cancer recurrence was an exclusion criteria for the Glover et al (2016) RCT. Therefore their study population provides evidence for the effecti veness of HBO T in patients in whom there is no evidence of cancer recurrence. In Glover et al's study there was no significant difference between HBOT and sham for any of the out comes assesse d. These ou tcomes included gastrointestinal symptom s, rectal bleeding and bow el dysfunction. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 11 of 37 Descri ptive results for a subset of patients who experienced cancer recurrence during a study are discusse d in response to the next question. b) In patients who are treated in palliative circumstances, in the presence of tumo ur recurrence, for control of genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal symptoms? None of the included studies spec ifically recruited patients who were in palliative circums tances or had tumour recurrence. However Clarke et al (2008) provided a descriptive su mmary of outcomes for 14 patients within their study population who experienced cancer recurrence during the treatment or follow-up phase (five years). This noted that approximately 45% of patients who did not show a treatment response were diagnosed with local recurrence. Clarke et al also noted that the LENT SOMA scores of these patients deteriorated by an average of nine points (range 4 to 17) by the time the cancer was diagnosed. These results are from a description of a subset of patients who took part in an RCT. This was not a formal subgroup within the study and no statistical a nalysis was performed. All of the included studies recruited patients with genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal symptoms as sp ecified in the PICO. The results of the studies descri bed in response to question on e therefore apply to this subgroup. The included studies do not support a comparison of the evidence for patients with different symptoms prior to receiving HBO T due to differences in the outcome measures reported ov er different time periods. c) In patients who receive 30 or more hyperbari c oxygen treatments? The protoco ls for all of the included studies involved 30 or more hyperbaric oxygen treatments. The results of the studies described in response to question one therefore apply to this subgroup . The studies did not r eport separate analyses bas ed on the nu mber of HBO T treatments received. 3. What evidence is there that any effects are sustained in the medium and longer term? The follow-up period varied between the studies with three of the four studies following patients for at least 12 months. However Glover et al (2016) only reported outcomes at one time period (12 months) and did not find an y significant benefit for HBO T comp ared to sham treatment. Clarke et al (2008) had the longest follow-up period of up to five years. The improvement in mean LENT SOMA score from baseline and the proportion of patients showing at least some improvement on clinical e valuation appeared to be sustaine d during the follow-up period. However the number of patients participating in follow-up assessment dropped steeply over the study period with, for example, 105 patients at 12 months, 61 patients at two years and 14 patients at five years. As this was a crossover trial it was not possible to assess longer term differenc es between groups. Shao et al (2011) followed patients up for 18 months. In their study the propor tion of patients showing a comp lete or partial response to treatment decreased over the 18 month period. For example, the propor tion sho wing a comp lete response was 75% and 88% in the HBO T and HA groups respectively at six months and app roximately 50% in both groups at 18 months. Cost effectiveness 4. What is the cost effectiveness of HBO T for the treatment of soft tissue radia tion damage ? No studies assessing the cost effectiveness of HBO T for soft tissue radiation damage were identified. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 12 of 37 5 Discus sion Two well-designed double-blind RCTs have compared HBO T to sham. One of these trials (Glover et al 2016) reported direct comp arisons of HBO T to sham at 12 months follow-up and found no significant differences between the two groups for outcomes of rectal bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel dysfunction. The other crossover trial only reported statistical analysis for outcomes imme diately following treatment (Clarke et al 2008). In direct comparisons between the groups this trial reported statistically significantly better outcomes for HBO T com pared to sha m for mean LEN T SOMA sco re and the propor tion of patients showing at least some improvement on clinical ev aluation. There were limitations in both of these trials, particularly relating to the analyses and scori ng of outcome measures. The prima ry results reported for these studies were not based on intention-to- treat analyses with both studies excluding patients from the analyses due to missing data and/or failure to adhere to treatment protocols. For example, the primary analysis reported by Glover et al is based on 69 patients of 84 randomised and the primary a nalysis reported by Clarke et al is based on 120 patients of 150 randomised. The power calculation for Glover et al required 75 evaluable patients suggesting that this study may have been underpowered to detect changes. No pow er calculation was reported by Clarke et al. Direct comparis on between the studies is not possible due to the different outcome measures reported and the different time periods used for the assessment of outcomes following treatment. However, Glover et al di d describe an exploratory analysis conducted at two weeks post- treatment that did not show any difference between their HBOT and sham groups. No numerical or statistical de tails were provided for this time period. It is difficult to interpret the clinical meaningfulness of some of the statistically significant results observed du e to a lack of detail in the reporting of the outcome measures used. Two studies comp aring HBO T to other treatments were also identified. The results of these studies generally showed no statistic al difference between the two study groups or favoured the alternat ive treatment of either hyaluroni c acid instillation (Shao et al 20 11) or argon plasma coagulation (\u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al (2011). These were small, single-centre studies, only one of which (Shao et al) randomised patients into treatment groups. It was not clear what alternat ive treatments had been received pri or to recruitment into the study. The included studies do not support a comp arison of the evidence for patients presen ting with different symptoms pri or to receiving HBOT due to differences in the outcome measures reported over different time periods. Given the discrepancy in the results of the two sham-controlled trials identified and the limitations of these studies, further adequately powered trials comparing HBOT to sham may be warranted. 6 Conclusion The evidence identified for HBO T for the treatment of soft tissue radiation damage after pelvic irradiation included three randomised co ntrolled trials and one non- randomised controlled study. Studies reported improvemen ts from baseline following HBO T treatment. However, only one of the two studies comp aring HBOT to sham provides evidence of better outcomes with HBO T treatment. This was the largest study identified, but only reported compar ative outcomes imme diately following treatment and the clinical meaningfulness of the improvements observed with HBOT is unclear. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 13 of 37 Two small studies co mparing HBO T to other treatments also show ed improvement with HBOT but HBO T was not sup erior to the alternative treatments. At presen t there is inconsistent evidence about the efficacy of HBO T compared to sham in the treatment of soft tissue radiation damage following pelvic irradiation.

Each question was graded o n a scale of 1 (more than eve r before) to 7 (no rmal/ not a t all).This would give a summed score of between 10 ( most severe) and 70 (least severe) . An improvement of 7 (SD 10 ) from baseline to 12 month follow- up was considered c linically relevant. An improvement in median chang e from baseline IBDQ score for gastrointestinal symptoms was seen in both the H BOT (by 3.5 points) and sham groups (by 4 poi nts). However, there was no significant difference between t he grou p receiving H BOT and t he group receiving sham at 12 months follow-up (p=0.50). An exploratory anal ysis at 2-weeks post treatm ent also found n o difference between the groups . No analysis on chang e from baseline was repor ted. There was no difference in the improvement s een with HBOT compared with sham treatment and the size of the improvement seen in both group s was less than t he 7 point improvement that would be considered clinically re levant. This was a well-designed, doubl e-blind, However, the primary anal yses repor ted in this study did not include all patients and not all results were repor ted.

NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 28 of 37 Chang e in mean LENT SOMA score Clarke et al 2008 8 /10 Direct B The LENT SOMA scale is an anato mic-specific mo rbidity scoring system for severity of radiation- induced complications. Symptoms ar e scored from grade I (least severe) t o grade 4 (most severe). There are 14 par ameters within the subjective (5), objective (3) and managem ent (6) sections plus a n analytic section w hich includes 6 tests (e.g. MRI and ultrasound) but is not score d. The authors describe a first 'LENT score' as being t he sum of the scores for t he 14 param eters in the subjective, objective and manage ment sections and a second 'LENT score' as being the summed score divided by 14. It is likely that it is the second LE NT score is that is u sed for the mean LENT SOMA scores presented in the study however this is not clearly stated. A statistically significant improvement in mean score from baseline was repor ted for both the HBOT (5.00 95%CI 3.96 to 6.03) an d sham groups (2.61 95%CI 1.51 to 3.70) (p<0.0001) immediate ly after treatme nt. At baseline the scores were 12. 55 and 12 .84 for HBOT and sham respectively. The improvem ent for HBOT was reported a s significantly grea ter than for sham (p=0.0019) . A direct comparison between the group s repor ted a significantly lower average scor e for HBOT than sham (p=0.0150) , however t his was based on an estimated differen ce. It is n ot clear why an est imated differenc e was used. The mean scores of the sham group i mprove d after the crossover to HBOT treatment. The i mprovement in mean LENT SOMA scores appeared to be sustain ed during the 5 year follow-up period, however the number o f patie nts providing follow-up dat a dropped st eeply after 1 year. As this was a crossover trial it is not possible to assess longer t erm differenc es between the treatment groups . This was a well-designed, doubl e-blind, However, the primary yses repor ted in this study only in cluded 120 o f the 150 patients recruited. Limited information about the severity of patients' symptoms makes it difficult to interpre t the clinical significance of the results.

The propor tion o f patients considered healed was 7.9% for HBOT and 0% for sham. In contrast the propor tion o f patients with no improvement was 11.1% for HBOT and 37.5% for sham. No significance tests were repor ted for individual clinical evalu ation categories. This was a well-designed, doubl T. However, the primary yses repor ted in this study only in cluded 120 o f the 150 patients recruited. A great er propor tion o f patients s howed improvement with HBOT but only 7 .9% (5/63) were considered heale d.

It is not clear how many patients were included in this analysis. The study may hav e been underpowere d to det ect change s. Quality of life Clarke et al 2008 8 /10 Direct B Quality of life measurements were taken from survey s including the bowel function and bow el bother subscales of the Expand ed Prostate Cance r Index Composite Bowel Domain and the SF-12 General Health Function survey . The bo wel bother and bowel function scales ar e repor ted as a percentage (i.e. a 0-100 scale) with higher scores repres enting bett er qual ity of life. The aut hors repor ted that no differences were observed in general well-being, however no results or anal ysis of the SF-12 were repor ted. Both groups s howed an improvem ent in mean bowel bother an d bowel function scores from bas eline to immediately following treatment. A great er, and statistically significant improvement from baseline was repor ted for the bowel bothe r scor e (p=0.0007 ) for the HBOT group but not for the sham group (p=0.1521). However, the score for the HBOT group was lower at baseline and the scores immediately following treatm ent were similar for both group s. No direct comparison of the scores between group s was repor ted. No statistical analysis for bowel function was repor ted. The i mprovement in mean bow el bother and bowel function scores appeared to be sustained dur ing the 5 year follow-up per iod, however the numb er of patients prov iding follow-up data dropped st eeply after 1 year. As this was a crossover t rial it is not pos sible to assess longer term differen ces bet ween the treatm ent groups . The results avail able do not s uggest that there was any meanin gful difference in quali ty of life between the HBOT and sham groups following treatment. This was a well-designed, doubl e-blind, sham-controlled RCT. However, the primary analyses repor ted in this study only in cluded 120 of the 150 patients recruited and no t all results are reported. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 30 of 37 Safety Glover et al 2016 9 /10 Direct A Neither study repor ted any statistical analysis on differences in safety outcomes between HBOT and sham. O nly Glover et al (2016) reported s afety outcomes by treatment group. Glover et al (2016 ) repor ted 8 serious adver se events in 8 patients (6 HBOT and 2 s ham) but did not consider any of these to be treatment related. Common adver se events were repor ted by Gl over et al (2016) . The propor tion of patients repor ting ey e refractive changes (including myopia) an d ear pa in or barot rauma was higher in the HBOT group (30. 2% and 28 .3%) than in the sham group (10.7% an d 21. 4%). A higher propor tion o f patients repor ted increased fatigue or tirednes s in the sham group (10.7%) than the HBOT group (3.8%). Differenc es were repor ted bet ween the HBOT and sham groups in the propor tion of patie nts repor ting ey e refractive s, ear pain, baro traum a, and f atigue or tiredness. However, it is not clear if th ese differences were statistically significant. In the absence of significance tests or further details on the seriousness or impact of the common adver se event s obs erved (e.g. treatm ent required) the clinical significance is not c lear.

The propor tion o f patients showing a par tial or complete response was high at the first follow-up point (6 months) for both the HBOT and HA group s but decreased over t ime. There was no significant difference bet ween t he groups at any of the follow-up points (p >0.05) . For H BOT, 95% of patie nts showed a re sponse at 6 months with most of these being a c omplete respons e. At 18 months this had reduc ed to 75% sho wing a respons e with appro ximately half sho wing a c ompete response. For HA, the respons e was 100% at 6 months with the majority complete responses, and 75% at 18 months with half complete responses. This was a small, single centre study. At baseline, pa tients had ha emorrhagic cystitis of grade II (macroscopic h aematuria) or grad e III (macroscopic haem aturia with the presence of clots and/ or decrease in haemoglobin leve ls necessitating b lood transfusions). At final follow-up after 18 months symptoms had d isappeared in appro ximately half of the patients in both groups sugges ting a similar effect for both treatments. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 31 of 37 Chang e in voiding frequenc y Shao et al 2011 8 /10 Direct B Frequen cy of voiding is the number of times that the patient urinates per day. Both groups showed a statistically significant improvem ent in voiding frequenc y at 6 months (p<0.01). For the HB OT group the number o f voids per da y decreased by a mean \u00b1 SD of 1.2 \u00b1 1.1 from a baseline of 9.8 \u00b1 1.7. For t he HA group t he nu mber of voids per day decreased by 2 .9 \u00b1 1.7 from a bas eline of 10.4 \u00b1 1.8. No direct comparison between the groups was repor ted. For bo th HBOT and HA groups , voiding frequenc y reduced by 6 months but the improvement was not s ustained over t he 18 month follow-up per iod. In the HBOT group the improvement from baseline was no longe r significant by 12 months follow-up with a mean decreas e of 0.2 voids per day . In the HA group the improvement from baseline was still significant at 12 months follow-up with a mean de crease of 1.5 voids pe r day but was no longer significant by 18 months when t he mean de crease in number of voids per da y was 0.2. This was a small, single centre study. The i mprovement in number of voids per day was statistically significant but re latively small at 6 months follow-up and the improvement seen was not s ustained over the follow-up per iod. By 12 months the mean improvement for the HBOT group was less than 1 void per day which is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Change in pelvic pain Shao e t al 2011 8 /10 Direct B Pelvic pain was assessed using the visual analo gue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10. No descriptors for level of pain were prov ided but 0 typically repre sents no pain and 1 0 the worst pos sible p ain on a VAS. The i mprovement in pain from baselin e was statistically significant for both groups at all follow-up points (p<0.05). No d irect comparison bet ween t he groups was repor ted. For the HBOT group t he mean \u00b1 S D improvement at 6 months was 0.9 \u00b1 0.8 from a baseline of 2.5 \u00b1 2.2. The mean improved f urther at 1 8 months to 1.2 \u00b1 1.2. For t he HA group the grea test improvement was seen a t 18 months with a mean (SD) improvement of 1.5 \u00b1 1.2 from a baseline of 2.8 \u00b1 2.2. This was a small, single-centre study. Pain scores i mproved significantly for both group s and this improvement was sustained ove r the follow-up period. However the size of the improvement was relatively small at between approximately 1 and 1 .5 points on a 10-point scale and t he mean baseline scores were at the lower end of the scale. Safety Shao e t al 2011 8 /10 Direct B Incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) was repor ted. The inc idence of UTI was significantly higher in the HA group than t he HBOT group at 6 months follow-up (43% vs. 10%) (p=0.034). The propor tion of patients with UTI increased ove r the follow-up per iod for both groups . There was no significant difference between t he groups at 1 2 or 18 months (p=0.1). At 18 months the incidence of UTI was 30% for the HBOT group and 50% for the HA group . The only s ide eff ect repor ted was UTI which was described as the main side effect of HA instillation. No side effec ts typically associated with HBOT were repor ted and t he first follow-up point was 6 months after treatment completion. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 32 of 37 Therefore the extent of treatment-related complications is unclear.

A normal haemoglobin level is between 13.8 and 17.2 g/dL for men and 12. 1 to 15.1 g/dl for women. At final follow-up 3 months after treatm ent the mean \u00b1 SD haemoglobin level had improved from 10.3 \u00b1 2.6 to 12.0 \u00b1 2.1 for the HBOT group and had improved f rom 10.1 \u00b1 2.1 to 11.3 \u00b1 2.0 for the APC group. There were no significant differences between the HBOT and APC groups at any of the follow-up points . No significance tests were performed on the improvem ent from baseline. The gender of the patients was not repor ted. This was a small, non- random ised controlled study with patients who were receiving transfusions due to haem orrhage associated with rectal bleeding at baseline. The clinical significance of the improvement from baseline observed in both groups is not clear. Number of transfusions \u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011 6 /10 Direct C Transfusion was required in these patients due to blood loss from rectal bleeding. The nu mber of transfusions requ ired dec reased in both group s. A greater improvem ent was seen ear lier in the APC group which had statistically significantly bett er results than the HBOT group at 1 and 2 months follow-up (p<0.05). At 1 month follow-up the number of transfusions requ ired by t he APC group had dec reased from a mean \u00b1 SD of 4.8 \u00b1 7.8 to 0.6 \u00b1 1.1. This improvem ent was sustained at 2 and 3 months follow -up. In the HBOT group the number of transfusions required dec reased at each month follow-up an d at the final 3 month follow-up had dec reased to 0.8 \u00b1 1.2 from 3.8 \u00b1 2.9 at bas eline. No significance tests were per formed on the improvement from baseline. This was a small, non-randomised controlled study with patients who were receiving transfusions due t o haemorrhag e associated with rec tal bleeding a t baseline. The time period ove r which the number of blood transfusions repor ted was received was not s pecified. A reduc tion is the number of blood transfusions required is likely to be of clinical benef it but the significance of the improvem ent seen i s both groups is not clear. NHS England Evidence Review: HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury after pelvic irradiation Page 33 of 37 Tissue toxicity \u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011 6 /10 Direct C Tissue toxicity was assessed by the LENT SOMA tissue toxicity score. No information on the scoring of this scale was provided in this study, however individual LENT SOMA items are generally score d on a scale of 1 to 4 and then s ummed, with higher scores sugges ting more severe symptoms. Both groups showed an improve ment in mean scores over t he 3 month follow- up per iod. A greater improvement was seen in the APC group at 1 and 2 months (p<0.05) but there was no significant differenc e between t he groups by 3 months. By 3 months the mean \u00b1 SD tissue toxicity for the H BOT group had improved f rom 12.2 \u00b1 2.9 at baseline to 4.8 \u00b1 3.5. For the APC group t his improvem ent was from 13.3 \u00b1 2 .9 to 3.0 \u00b1 3.5. Both HBOT and APC groups showe d improvement in mean scores for tissue toxicity ove r 3 months, with greater improvements in the APC grou p at one and two months follow up. Without c lear information o n the scoring system used the clinical significance of the improvem ents observed is unc lear.

Safety \u00c1lvaro-Villegas et al 2011 6 /10 Direct C Adverse even ts repor ted for the APC group included APC-associated rectal ulcers and rec tal pain affecting 3 and 2 pat ients respectively (appro ximately 15-20%). Persistent rectal bleeding was in observed in 2 APC patients (21%) and 3 HBOT patients (18%). Two patients (from the HBOT group ) had to undergo terminal colostomy for refractory other 3 ents (e .g. from APC to HBOT or vice versa) and showed clinical improvem ent. No other adver se events were repor ted for HBOT. No significance tests were repor ted comparing number o f adver se events for the 2 groups .
