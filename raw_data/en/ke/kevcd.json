The good news is that taking a comprehensive, holistic approach to treatment, and making some simple changes in your diet and/or habits can help. There are also a number of recommended essential oils for yeast infections. (If you're new to using essential oils, be sure to download our free ebook, Listen to Your Nose - An Introduction to Aromatherapy.) If you suspect that you have a candida overgrowth it is important to first consult with your healthcare provider to explore all possible treatment options. They may recommend changes to your diet, as well as natural antifungals or probiotics (\"friendly\" bacteria) to improve the body's ability to keep candida in check. We find many people are looking for complementary and alternative therapies to either treat or prevent yeast infections. (We found this post by St. Luke's hospital to be informative.) Many studies support the use of essential oils in treating candida. Below you will find suggested essential oils for yeast infections, candida, and thrush as well as simple recipes you can use. But first, let's do a quick overview of what candida is and why it can be a real problem to our overall health and wellness. What is Candida albicans? Candida albicans lives on the skin, the mucosal lining of the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract, and genitals. Candida, along with a variety of other friendly microorganisms, is part of the normal bacterial population, \"microflora\", of the intestinal tract. However, when our bodies become out of balance due to diet, prolonged stress, illness, antibiotic use, hormonal shifts, some birth control pills, obesity, disease, or certain cancer treatments, an overgrowth of Candida can occur resulting in a condition called candidiasis, or in the most severe cases candidemia. The most common form of candidiasis is called thrush, affecting the mucosal membranes of the mouth and vagina but can also show up on areas of skin (usually in folds of the skin such as in the groin or under breasts). An overgrowth of candida weakens the intestinal wall and allows the fungus to enter into the bloodstream. The bloodstream then carries the toxic byproducts of candida (i.e. acetaldehyde) throughout the body. These byproducts can cause damage to tissues, organs, and cause the immune system to become compromised. Acetaldehyde promotes free radical activity in the body and is converted into ethanol by the liver creating the common \"hungover\" feeling and extreme fatigue often experienced by those with candidiasis.
