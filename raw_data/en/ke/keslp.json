The continued evolution of variants of concern (VOC) like Delta and Omicron has increased infections even in countries with high vaccination coverage. This is due to commercial vaccines being unable to prevent viral infection in the upper airways and exclusively targeting the spike (S) protein that is subject to continuous evolution facilitating immune escape. Here we report a multi -antigen, intranasal vaccine, NanoSTING- NS that yields sterilizing immunity and leads to the rapid and complete elimination of viral loads in both the lungs and the nostrils upon viral challenge with SARS -CoV-2 VOC. We formulated vaccines with the S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins individually to demonstrate that immune responses against S are sufficient to prevent disease whereas combination immune responses against both proteins prevents viral replication in the nasal compartment. Studies with the highly infectious Omicron VOC showed that even in vaccine- na\u00efve animals, a single dose of NanoSTING- NS significantly reduced transmission. These observations have two implications: (1) mucosal multi- antigen vaccines present a pathway to preventing transmission and ending the pandemic, and (2) an explanation for why hybrid immunity in humans is superior to vaccine- mediated immunity by current IM vaccines. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The evolution of variants of concern (VOC) like the Omicron VOCs has caused a massive increase in infections even in countries with high vaccination coverage 3. This increased frequency of infections combined with laboratory data that supports increased infectivity and immune escape by the variants has seeded concerns that we will end up in the cumbersome perpetual cycle of immunization trying to keep pace with evolving variants 4-7. There are two primary concerns with the commercial vaccines against SARS -CoV-2. First, while the IM route of administration elicits robust systemic immunity leading to the prevention of disease, they do not prevent viral infection in the upper airways. Unsurprisingly, the IM vaccines have demonstrated var iable protection against upper-airway infection in preclinical models, with some offering no protection8,9. In humans, this led to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people harboring virus in the nostrils that facilitates transmission even by immunized individuals10,11. Moreover, the ability of the upper airways to serve as reservoirs facilitate s viral evolution, and with the waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time, can enable the priming of new infections in vaccinated hosts12,13. The second concern is that the S protein dominates the vaccine landscape against SARS- CoV-2 as the immunogen14. Since the S protein is essential for viral entry into host cells, it serves as the preferred target for eliciting neutralizing antibo dies14,15. Although correlates of vaccine- induced protection have not been established , there is strong evidence that neutralizing antibodies, and specific antibodies targeting the receptor- binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, are likely predictors of vaccine efficacy and disease prevention16,17. The S protein, however, by being on the surface of the virion, is under constant evolutionary pressure to escape the host immune system while preserving viral entry18,19. Unsurprisingly, as the virus has spread globally, variants less susceptible to antibodies elicited by vaccines have evolved, necessitating modified vaccine manufacturing and continued booster immunizations19-21. Among other potential viral protein targets, the nucleocapsid (N) protein is expressed at elevated levels during infection and is highly immunogenic22. Studies tracking convalescent patient sera confirm robust antibody and T -cell responses against the N protein23-26. The primary function of the N protein is to package the viral genome into ribonucleoprotein complexes and to facilitate transcription while promoting escape from innate immunity (suppression of Th 1 type I interferons, IFNs)22. Since the N protein performs multiple essential functions for the virus, it tends to accumulate fewer mutations resulting in t he N protein of SARS -CoV-2 having 90 % homology to SARS- CoV27. These attributes make the N protein a candidate for vaccine -induced immunity28. Indeed, T -cell-dependent mechanisms can confer at least partial protection against the original Wuhan strain after IM vaccine candidates immunizing with the N protein29. However, preclinical studies have shown that transfer of anti -N immune sera failed to protect against SARS - CoV-2 infection in an adapted mouse model30 which is consistent with antibodies against the N protein not being neutralizing as this protein is unassociated with viral entry. Furthermore, intradermal vaccination with the SARS -CoV N protein worsened infection and pneumonia due to was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

This concern of enhanced respiratory disease mediated by Th2 responses has shifted the focus away from the SARS -CoV-2 N protein- based vaccines despite the potential for protective T -cell responses. Mucosal vaccin es can stimulate robust systemic and mucosal immunity, but the quality and quantity of the immune response elicited upon mucosal vaccination depends on the appropriate adjuvant . We had previously reported mucosal adjuvant that elicits strong humoral and cellular immune responses upon intranasal vaccination32.

We confirmed the ability of NanoSTING to induce IFN responses (IRF) using the THP -1 monocytic cells modified to conditionally secrete luciferase downstream of an IRF promoter. We stimulated THP -1 dual cells with NanoSTING and measured luciferase activity in the conditioned supernatant ( Figure S1D) to show that secretion was maximal at 24 hours. We used recombinant trimeric S -protein to formulate the vaccine based on the SARS - CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta VOC) as the immunogen34 (Figure 1A ). SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions showed that the protein migrated between 180 and 250 kDa confirming extensive glycosylation (Figure S 2A). Upon incubation with NanoSTING, the S protein was adsorbed onto the liposomes with NanoSTING-S displaying a mean particle diameter of 144 nm (PDI 25.9 %) , and a mean zeta potential of 5 4.8 mV ( Figure s S2B & S2 C). Unlike the trimeric S protein known to aggregate in solution, we tested NanoSTING- S after 9 mont hs of storage at 4 \u00b0C . We found no evidence of aggregation , concluding that vaccine formulation is stable at 4 \u00b0C (Figures S2 D & S2 E). Single-dose immunization of mice with NanoSTING -S vaccine yields cross -reactiv e humoral and cellular immunity against SARS -CoV -2 We immunized Balb/c mice with a single intranasal dose of NanoSTING-S ( Figure 1B ) and observed no clinical symptoms, including weight loss, during the entire 28- day period (Figure S3). We conducted ELISA on day 28 to quantify binding to both full- length S proteins and the RBDs, with the latter serving as a surrogate for neutralization. We observed robust serum IgG titers not only against Beta (B.1.351) but also (B.1.1.7), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2) , and Omicron observed high serum IgG titers against the RBDs from both the Beta and Alpha VOCs and high IgG titers against the full -length Beta Delta bronchoalveolar , Figure 1C-D ). As IgA -mediated protection is an essential component of mucosal immunity for respiratory pathogens, we confirmed the role of intranasal N anoSTING -S as a mucosal adjuvant . We detected elevated serum IgA responses against all spike protein variants tested , although BALF IgA titers against -length spike protein were weaker ( Figure 1E & 1F). At day 28, immunized mice showed robust and significant Th1/Tc1 responses by ELISPOT in both the spleen and the lung (Figure s 1G & 1H). We stimulated the spleen and lung cells with a pool of peptides containing mutations (B.1.351) in the S protein that differ s from the Wuhan S protein. We observed a significant Th1 response against these mutation -specific S peptides confirming a broad T -cell response that targets both the conserved regions and the mutated regions of the S protein ( Figure s 1G & 1H). In contrast to the Th1/Tc1 responses, the Th2 responses were weaker but detectable ( Figures 1G & 1H). Collectively, these results established that NanoSTING acts as a mucosal adjuvant and that even a single- dose immunization with NanoSTING-S yielded robust IgG, IgA , and Th1/Tc1 responses that are cross - reactive against multiple VOCs. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

This animal model replicates COVID -19 severe disease in humans with infected animals demonstrating rapid weight loss, very high viral loads in the lungs, extensive lung pathology, and even features of long COVID35,36. Additionally, unlike the K18 - hACE2 transgenic mouse model, hamsters recover from the disease and hence offer the opportunity to study the impact of treatments in the lungs (disease) and nasal passage (transmission)35,37. We chose the Delta VOC to infect the animals for two reasons: (1) this VOC causes severe lung damage, and (2) Delta -specific S -mutations, including L452R and T478K within the RBD are absent in our immunogen ( Figure 1A) and provided an opportunity to assess cross- protection. We administered t wo doses of intranasal NanoSTING -S 24 days apart to hamsters which were subsequently challenged with the Delta VOC through the intranasal route (Figure 1I ). Animals in the sham- vaccinated group showed a mean peak weight loss of 8.3 %. By contrast , animals vaccinated with NanoSTING -S were largely protected from weight loss ( Figure 1J, mean peak weight loss of 2.3 %), consistent with the results obtained by adenovirally vectored IM vaccines challenged with either the Wuhan or Beta strains 38. We sacrificed half of the animals at day 2 (peak of viral replication) and the other half at day 6 (peak of weight loss in unimmunized animals) to quantify viral titers . NanoSTING -S reduced infectious viral loads in the lung by 300- fold by day 2 compared to sham- vaccinated animals , and by day 6, infectious virus was undetectable in all animals ( Figure 1K). Viral replication in the lung of the animal models clinical human disease and death, while viral replication in the nasal compartment models human transmission. Immunization with NanoSTING -S reduced infectious viral loads in the nasal compartment by 380-fold by day 2 compared to unimmunized animals. By day 6 , vaccinated animals showed a further significant reduction in the infectious virus ( Figure 1L). To examine the pathobiology of viral infection, we analyzed the lung tissue on day 6 after the challenge using an integrated scoring rubric (range from 1- 12) to quantify host immune response and disease severity. We recorded immune cell infiltration and widespread viral pneumonia in the lungs of sham-vac cinated hamsters, whereas vaccinated animals revealed minimal evidence of invasion by inflammatory cells or alveolar damage ( Figure s 1M & 1N). In aggregate, hamsters vaccinated with NanoSTING -S when challenged with the Delta VOC were protected in the lung against heterologous VOC and partially protected in the nasal passage . The reduction in viral loads in the nasal compartment suggests an advantage of mucosal vaccination to reduce transmission39. Modeling of the immune response against both S- and N- proteins predict synergistic protection The results from the NanoSTING- S experiments demonstrated that the immune responses protect against disease in the lung but are in sufficient to eliminate viral infection/ replication in the nasal passage as a surrogate for transmission. A mathematical model was used to help understand if a multi -antigen vaccine comprising both S- and N- proteins (NanoSTING -NS) can offer improved protection40. We established the model to track the viral load in the nasal passage by fitting the parameters to reflect longitudinal viral titers from infected patients ( Figure 2A). Vaccine- induced neutralizing antibody responses against the S- protein serve as de novo blockers of viral entry and impede viral production through immune effector mechanisms.

T he model revealed a reduction in viral load between 35 % to 90 % when the S- vaccine efficacy in the nasal compartment varied from 40 to 80 % ( Figure 2B ). Anti- S vaccine efficacy >80% in the nasal compartment is difficult to accomplish even with mucosal immunization (some IM vaccines offer no significant nasal immunity) and can hence explain the inability to prevent nasal replication8,9. We next modeled a mucosal vaccine based exclusively on the N - protein. For the mucosal N -protein vaccine, we anchored to a mechanism of protection through induction of cytotoxic T cell responses that kill virally infected cells , thus reducing the number of cells capable of producing/propagating the virus. Under this scenario , the model predicted that the killing rate constant of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) would have to be 8.5 per day to achieve a 99% reduction in viral loads (Figure 2C). This value is at-least 10- fold higher than the predicted/measured killing capacity of CD8+ T cells in vivo, and hence it is not surprising that single -antigen N-based vaccines do not confer protection41,42. To quantify if multi -antigen vaccines can offer synergistic protection, we model ed combined protection by including S- directed vaccines that offer partial protection (primarily antibody -mediated) in the nasal compartment with the cytotoxic T cell responses against the N protein. We tested a range of S - protein vaccine efficacies (40 to 100 %) in the nasal compartment in combination with cytotoxic N responses ( Figure 2D). The model predicted that a physiologically relevant CTL killing rate of 0.4 and 0.6 day per day would lead to a 1,000- and 10,000- fold reduction in peak viral load, respectively, when the efficacy of the spike vaccine was only 80% ( Figure s 2D-red box & S4). Indeed, studies in humans infected with COVID -19 have demonstrated a robust and long -lived CTL response in the nasal compartment and that CD8+ T cells specific for the N protein can directly inhibit viral replication43,44. Collectively, these results from modeling predicted that combination vaccines targeting S and N proteins can mediate synergistic protection in eliminating viral replication in the nasal compartment. Sing le-d ose immunization of mice with NanoSTING -NS vaccine yields balanced humoral and cellular immunity and sterilizing immunity We formulated vaccines containing both antigens to test the model that the immune response against both the S and N proteins can be synergistic ( Figure 3A). We initially performed immunogenicity experiments in mice with 10 \u00b5g each of the recombinant N and S proteins adjuvanted with NanoSTING . We observed that while 100% of animals seroconverted and showed IgG responses against the S protein, seroconversion against the N protein was variable (40- 80 %) [not shown] . We accordingly modified the mass ratio of N:S protein (2:1) and adjuvanted it with NanoSTING to formulate NanoSTING -NS (Figure 3A). The NanoSTING-NS displayed a mean particle diameter of 142 nm (PDI 26.2 %) and a mean zeta potential of 48.4 mV ( Figures S5A & 5B). We tested NanoSTING- S after 9 months of storage at 4 \u00b0C , and confirmed that it displayed excellent stability, like the NanoSTING -S vaccine (Figures S5C & S5D NanoSTING S6 ) and yielded robust serum IgG titers against the N protein and full -length S protein variants at day 35 (Figure 3B). We documented robust antigen- specific, cross- reactive IgG the BALF (Figure and cross- reactive IgA responses in the serum and BALF at day 35 (Figure s 3D & 3E). We measured Th1 and Th2 responses against the N - and S- proteins in both the spleen and the lung at day 51 (Figur es was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Based on these promising immunogenicity data in mice, we evaluated the protective efficacy of NanoSTING- NS in hamsters. We vaccinated hamsters intranasally with two doses of NanoSTING -NS and challenged the immunized hamsters with the Delta VOC through the intranasal route ( Figure 3H). Animals immunized with NanoSTING -NS were completely protected from weight loss (mean peak weight loss of 0.8 %) [ Figure 3I]. Like the results of the NanoSTING -S vaccine, NanoSTING-NS eliminated viral replication in the lung by day 6 post -challenge ( Figure 3J), suggesting that S -specific immune responses are the dominant factor in providing immunity in the lung. In the nasal compartment, NanoSTING -NS showed a significant reduction in infectious viral particles by day 2 even in comparison to NanoSTING -S, and significantly , by day 6 there was a complete elimination of infectious vi ral particles in the nasal tissue of the NanoSTING -NS vaccinated animals ( Figure 3K). Pathology also confirmed that vaccinated and challenged animals had minimal evidence of invasion by inflammatory cells or alveolar damage ( Figure s 3L & 3M). In aggregate, these results illustrate that NanoSTING -NS can provide sterilizing immunity. Immunization of mice with NanoSTING -N yields durable humoral and cellular immunity but is not sufficient to confer protection against Delta VOC To quantify the role of anti -N immunity in mucosal protection, we characterized the immune response elicited against the N protein by formulating Nano STING -N and testing it in mice . Independent studies with K18- hACE2 mice immunized with viral vector- based N protein and challenged the early lineage variants (Wuhan and Alpha VOC) revealed mixed results with either partial or a complete lack of protection 29,45. The predicted structure of the SARS-CoV -2 N protein comprises an RNA binding domain, a C -terminal dimerization domain, and three intrinsically disordered domains that promote phase separation with nucleic acids46 (Figure S 7A). We confirm ed the functional activity of the protein by assaying binding to plasmid DNA based on the quenching of the fluorescent DNA condensation probe DiYO -1 (Figure S 7C)47. To formulate the vaccine, NanoSTING-N, we mixed the N protein with NanoSTING to allow the adsorption of the protein onto the liposomes ( Figure 4A ). The formulated NanoSTING-N had a mean particle diameter of 107 nm (PDI 20.6 %) , and zeta potential of -51 m V (Figures S7E & S7F). Although the recombinant N protein showed a strong propensity for aggregation upon storage at 4 \u00b0C for 6 months, NanoSTING-N was stable with no change in size or zeta potential ( Figures S 7G & S7H). Consistent with our NanoSTING-NS studies, we immunized two groups of mice by intranasal administration with either 10 \u00b5g ( NanoSTING -N10) or \u00b5g s 4A, and S8). The serum IgG responses at both doses were similar at day27, although the IgG titers elicited by the NanoSTING- N20 were higher than NanoSTING -N10, the difference was not significant ( Figure 4B ). In contrast to vaccination with the trimeric NanoSTING- S (early response at day 7), the kinetics of IgG responses were delayed, and responses were only observed at day 14 ( Figure S 9). Both, NanoSTING- N10 and NanoSTING- N20 yielded antigen- specific IgG responses in the BALF IgA response in serum ( Figures 4C & 4D). We examined the activation and function of N - protein- specific memory CD8+ T cells in the lung s and spleen using granzyme B (GzB) and the activation S10A ).

The overall frequencies of the lung resident CD8+CD103+ and CD103+CD69+CD8+ T cells were no different between the immunized animals and the control group ( Figure S10E). NanoSTING -N10 immunized significant splenic and lung T h1/Tc1 responses ( Figure s 4G & 4J). We did not observe a measurable IL4 (Th2) response upon immunization with NanoSTING- N10 and NanoSTING -N20 (Figures 4 G & 4J). Collectively, these results established that intranasal vaccination elicited strong Th1/Tc1 responses with no evidence of Th2 responses. To test the durability of the response, we immunized mice with NanoSTING-N 20 and monitored the animals for 62 days ( Figure S 11A). NanoSTING -N20 vaccinated animals reported no weight loss ( Figure S 11B) and revealed robust serum IgG and IgA titers at day 62 (Figure S 11C & S11D) . We also confirmed that the N -reactive Th1 responses were conserved in the spleen and lung at day 62 ( Figure S 11E & S 11F). These results can be summarized as immunization with NanoSTING -N results in IgG and IgA immune responses and long -lived Th1/Tc1 but not deleterious Th2 immune responses. Based on the immunogenicity data in mice, we evaluated the protective efficacy of NanoSTING -N in hamsters. We intranasally vaccinated hamsters with two doses of NanoSTING-N and challenged the immunized hamsters with the Delta VOC through the intranasal route ( Figure 4K). Animals in both the vaccinated and sham- vaccinated groups showed significant weight loss (Figure 4L) . Consistent with the lack of protection from weight loss, infectious viral titers were no different in the lung or nasal passage on either day 2 or day 6 in both vaccinated and sham- vaccinated animals ( Figures 4M & 4N ). In addition, we observed that the aggregate pathology score of NanoSTING-N treated hamsters was not significantly different from sham -vaccinated animals, although the distribution of pathology scores appeared bimodal ( Figure s 4O & 4P). Collectively, the immunization and the challenge data are aligned with our mathematical model and illustrate that while NanoSTING-N elicits strong Tc1 responses, these responses are insufficient to prevent viral expansion in the absence of S- directed immunity. A single dose of NanoSTING -NS significantly reduces direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC The current Omicron variants are transmitted very efficiently, and we next wanted to directly investigate if single immunization with NanoSTING-NS can mitigate the transmission of highly infectious VOC. We established a transmission experiment using the Omicron VOC (B.1.1.529) and two groups of Syrian golden hamsters. For group 1, we immunized the index hamsters with a single dose of NanoSTING- NS, and three weeks later, we infected with index hamsters with SARS-CoV -2 Omicron VOC. One day after infection, each index hamster was paired with a c o-housed contact (unimmunized) hamster for 4 days, permitting transmission with direct contact (Figure 5A ). We quantified the viral titers in the index and contact hamsters. As with the other strains of SARS -CoV-2 that we tested, immunization with NanoSTIN G-NS significantly reduced the viral titers in the nasal tissue of contact hamster s as compared to sham-vaccinated controls ( Figure 5B). The index hamsters also showed reduced viral titers in nasal tissue at day 5 (Figure 5C ).

We demonstrate that the NanoSTING-NS intranasal vaccine candidate NanoSTING -NS can eliminate viral loads both in the lung and in the upper airways of hamsters challenged with the Delta VOC. In direct transmission models, even a single dose of our vaccine was sufficient to significantly reduce transmission of the highly transmissible and currently dominant Omicron VOC in vaccine- na\u00efve animals . An alternative intranasal vaccine candidate based on a viral vector expressing the S protein ( ChAd -SARS- CoV-2-S) showed results similar to NanoSTING- S, demonstrating reduction but also variability in viral loads in the upper airways of K18- hACE2 mice challenged with chimeric viruses with spike genes corresponding to SARS -CoV-2 VOC (B.1.351 and B.1.1.28)48. It is predictable that the intranasal N protein-based vaccine (NanoSTING -N) is highly immunogenic but failed to protec t the Delta VOC. Investigations with K18-hACE2 mice immunized with viral vector -based N protein and challenged with the early lineage variants (Wuhan and Alpha) show either a partial or complete lack of protection, similar to our results29,45. Remarkably, by combin ing the N- and S- proteins in the intranasal vaccine, NanoSTING-N S eliminat ed the virus not only in the lung ( like NanoSTING- S) but also in the upper airways. We propose a model based on our mice and hamster data (mechanistic studies are difficult to accomplish in hamsters due to the unavailability of appropriate hamster- specific reagents, and challenge models in K18- hACE2 mice are lethal with limited opportunity to study transmission). In the lung, the S -specific Ig (IgG and IgA) is sufficient to neutralize the virus. However, only IgA is present in the nasal cavity, which is insufficient to prevent viral entry into cells. In this context, the N -specific T- cell responses are hypothesized to be responsible for eliminating the residual virally infected cells, thereby achieving sterilizing immunity. An outcome of sterilizing immunity is reducing incidence of viral transmission between the infected and the uninfected , which we successfully demonstrated. The ability to elicit mucosal immune responses and directly dampen transmission even with the Omicron VOC differentiates NanoSTING- NS from IM multi -antigen vaccines 49,50. The ability to elicit multifactorial immunity in the nasal cavity has several implications for SARS- CoV-2 vaccines. First, since respiratory viruses like SARS- CoV-2 can access the brain through the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity, immunity in this compartment can prevent viral seeding to the brain. This, in turn , can prevent the entire spectrum of neurological complications ranging from the immediate loss of smell and taste to long- term complications like stroke51,52. Second, eliminating the virus in the nasal cavity of vaccinated recipients reduces the chance of viral evolution leading to breakthrough disease, especially in the context of waning immunity53. Allowing the virus to persist is a risky experiment in vi ral evolution with likely tragic consequences54. Eradicating the SARS- CoV-2 viral reservoir in humans provides the only reasonable path to moving past the pandemic and the perpetual cycle of repeated booster vaccinations. History provides a powerful example of the importance of vaccinating to prevent infections, not just d isease, and sets a clinical precedent.

The availability of multi -antigen mucosal vaccines provides a pathway for humanity to move past SARS -CoV-2 outbrea ks. Systematically quantifying the immunity against multiple proteins also has important implications for understanding the nature of the immune response elicited upon infection versus vaccination targeting single proteins (all approved COVID -19 vaccines) . Preclinical studies with hamsters show that intranasal challenge with the ancestral Wuhan strains results in 100% seroconversion and protects from subsequent reinfection by the Delta VOC55. Several observational studies profiling millions of humans support that hybrid immunity (one or more doses of vaccines and infection) is superior to two or even three doses of vaccines in preventing severe infection/hospitalization with emerging variants56-58. The superiority of hybrid immunity has been documented when the primary infection was with the Delta VOC , and now , more recently, with the Omicron VOC59-62. Mechanistic studies have uncovered important observations about the quality/quantity of the immune responses that explain the superiority of hybrid immunity over vaccine- induced immunity: (1) potent antibody responses with increased coverage that can neutralize multiple variants63,64, (2) the ability to elicit superior Fc-dependent functions65, and (3) unique subsets of T cells with the secretion of IFN and IL1066. Unfortunately, most mechanistic studies have focused on the immune response against the S protein, likely because the approved IM vaccines only target this protein. Human studies have routinely documented that infection provides reliable anti -N protein antibody and T cell responses 67-69. As our results with quantitative modeling and the NanoSTING- N vaccine illustrate, immunity solely against the N protein in the absence of robust antibody responses against the S protein is not protective against the SARS- CoV-2 viral challenge. The disadvantage of the immunity elicited by natural infections in humans is that the antibody response against the S protein is variable and depends on the type of SARS -CoV-2 variant and the severity of infection 70. By contrast, vaccine- induced responses against the S protein are much more reliable and uniform. Multiple doses of vaccines ensure strong immunity (both antibodies and T cell responses) against the S protein. Our data with NanoSTING -S and data from multiple immunization studies illustrate that robust immunity against the S protein prevents severe disease. Hybrid immunity is thus able to derive the multifactorial benefit of responses in different anatomical comp artments (mucosal vs systemic), against multiple antigens, and potentially against multiple variants (if infection was with any strain besides the ancestral strain). Evidence of the importance of this multifactorial immunity is available in human studies that document T- cell responses against multiple antigens and preclinical studies that have used multi- antigen vaccines 45,71,72. With our data, we submit that the immunity elicited by NanoSTING -NS (multi - antigen) models hybrid immunity: it ensures mucosal immune responses against the N protein while preserving the strong systemic responses against the S protein. In summary, we have developed and validated a multi -component intranasal NanoSTING - NS subunit vaccine candidate that eliminat es SARS- CoV-2 in the upper airways, preventing transmission and provides a route for sterilizing immunity in humans. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

To prepare the liposomes, we mixed the lipids in CH 3OH and CHCl 3, and used a vacuum rotary evaporator to evaporate them at 45\u00b0C . We dried the resulting lipid thin film in a hood to remove any residual organic solvent . Next, w e added pre- warmed cGAMP (Chemietek) solution (3 mg/mL in PBS buffer at pH 7.4) to hydrate the lipid film . We mixed the hydrated lipids for an additional 30 min at an elevated temperature of 65 \u00b0C and subjected them to freeze- thaw cycles. U sing a Branson Sonicator (40 kHz), w e next sonicated the mixture for 60 min and used Amicon Ultrafiltration units ( MW cut off 10 kDa) to remove the free untrapped cGAMP. Finally, we used PBS buffer to wash the NanoSTING (liposomally encapsulated STINGa) three times. We measured the cGAMP concentration in the filtrates against a calibration curve of at Cytation final concentration of cGAMP in NanoSTING and encapsulation efficiency by subtracting the concentration of free drug in the filtrate. To prepare NanoSTING adjuvanted subunit protein vaccine, we used a simple \"mix and adsorb\" approach. Briefly, (i) NanoSTING-S vaccine was prepared (Wuhan) (BEI, # NR -53797): Two different concentrations of the Nucleocapsid protein were taken: NanoSTING -N10 (10 \u00b5g of N and NanoSTING -N20 (20 \u00b5g of N protein ) were mixed separately with 20 \u00b5g of 20\u00b5g of NanoSTING. All the vaccines were left on ice for a minimum of 1 h with constant slow shaking on the rocker. Stability stud ies for the form ulated vaccines We stored the NanoSTING -S, NanoSTING- NS at 4\u00b0C for 6 -9 months to check their stability. We measured the average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of NanoSTING and all vaccine formulations using DLS and zeta sizer on Litesizer 500 (Anton was cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 and grown in RPMI 1640, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat THP- 1 Dual cells were grown in the presence of respective selection agents [100 every other passage to maintain positive selection of reporters. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

First, we seeded the cells in 96 well plate at 1 x 105 cells/well in 180 L growth media. We then incubated the cells with 5 \u00b5g of NanoSTING at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h . To detect IRF activity, we collected 10 L of culture supernatant/well at 12 h and 24 h and transferred it to a white (opaque) 96 well plate. Next, we read the plate on Cytation 7 (Cytation 7, Bio -Tek Instruments, Inc.) after adding 50 L QUANTI- Luc (Invivo Gen) substrate solution per well , followed b y immediate luminescence measurement, which was given as relative light units (RLU). DNA Binding Assay We performed the DNA binding studies as previously published47. To check the applicability of the assay for detecting DNA condensation, we used branched -chain PEI (Polyethylenimine) as a positive control (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO # 408727). DiYO -1 (AAT Biorequest #17579) and plasmid (pMB75.6) mixed in equal volumes (in 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH = 7.4) to achieve a final concentration of 400 nM DNA phosphate and 8 nM DiYO -1, respectively. The solution was left at R T for 5 h before use. Next, we added PEI at different concentrations (R = 0, 1, 2, 5 where R is the molar ratio of PEI Nitrogen to DNA phosphate) to DNA -DiYO -1 solution, mixed for 1 min, and left for 2 h to equilibrate. We measured the fluorescence intensity of the solution at excitation and emission wavelength of 470 nm and 510 nm, respectively. We repeated the same procedure with SARS -CoV-2 N protein instead of PEI. To the DNA -DiYO -1 solution, we added t he N protein at concentrations of 0.1 \u00b5M and 0.5 \u00b5M. Mice and immunization All the animal experiments were reviewed and approved by UH IACUC. We purchased the female, 7-9-week -old BALB/c mice from Charles River Laboratories. Before immunization, we anesthe tized the groups of mice (n=4 -6/group) by intraperitoneal of ketamine (80\u00b5g/g of body weight) and xylazine (6\u00b5g/g of body weight) . Then, we immunized the animals with (i) NanoSTING - S vaccine (ii) NanoSTING -N (iv) NanoSTING -NS. All vaccines were freshly prepared. Bodyweight monitoring and sample collection We monitored the bodyweight of the animals every 7 days until the end of the study after immunization. In addition, we collected the sera every week post -vaccination to detect the humoral immune response. We kept the blood at 25 \u00b0C for 10 min to facilitate clotting and centrifuged it for 5 min at 2000 xg. We collected the sera, stored it at 80\u00b0C, and used it for ELISA. We harvested BALF, lung, and spleen at the end of the study essentially as previously described73,74. We kept the sera and other biological fluids [ with protease inhibitors (Roche, #11836153001] at -80 \u00b0C for long -term storage. After dissociation, the splenocytes and lung cells were frozen in FBS+10% DMSO and stored in the liquid nitrogen vapor phase until further use. ELISA We determined the anti -N and anti-S antibody titers in serum or other biological fluids using ELISA. Briefly, we coated 0.5 g/ml S protein (A crobiosystems, DE, USA) and 1 g/ml N protein (Sino Biological, PA, USA) onto ELISA plates (Corning, NY, USA) in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C or for 2 h was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The plate was then blocked with PBS+1% BSA (Fisher Scientific, PA, USA) +0.1% Tween 20TM (Sigma- Aldrich, MD, USA) for 2 h at RT. After washing, we added the samples at different dilutions. We detected the captured antibodies using HRP -conjugated anti -mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1 in 6,000; PA, USA), Goat anti -mouse IgA biotin (Southern Biotech, 1: 5,000; AL, USA). Streptavidin- HRP (Vector Laboratories, 1 in 2500, CA, USA) was used to detect the anti -IgA biotin antibodies. For BALF IgG ELISAs, antigens were coated onto plates at 0.5 g/ml (S protein) and 2 g/ml (N protein). We obtained the positive controls (anti -N and anti - S IgG) from Abeomics (CA, USA) Processing of s pleen and lungs for ELISPOT and f low cytometry To isolate lung cells, we perfused the lung vasculature with 5 ml of 1 mM EDTA in PBS without Ca2+, Mg2+ and inject ed it into the right cardiac ventricle. Each lung was cut into 100- 300 mm2 pieces using a scalpel. We transferred the minced tissue to a tube containing 5 ml of d igestion buffer containing collagenase D (2mg/ml, Roche #11088858001) and mg/ml, Sigma #DN25) in 5 ml of RPMI for 1 h and 30 min at 37 \u00b0C in the water bath by vortexing after every 10 min. We disrupted the remaining intact tissue by passage (6- 8 times) through a 21- gauge needle. Next, we added 500 \u00b5L of ice cold-stopping Buffer (1x PBS, 0.1M EDTA) to stop the reaction. We then removed tissue fragments and dead cells with a 40 \u00b5m disposable cell strainer (Falcon) and collected the cells after centrifugation at 400 x g. We then lysed the red blood cells (RBCs) by resuspending the cell pellet in 3 ml of ACK Lysing Buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated for 3 min at RT, followed by centrifugation at 400 xg. Then, w e discarded the supernatants and resuspended the cell pellets in 5 ml of complete RPMI medium (Corning, NY, USA). Next, we collected the spleen in RPMI medium and homogenized them through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer using the hard end of a syringe plunger. After that, we incubated splenocytes in 3ml of ACK lysis buffer for 3 min at RT to remove RBCs, then passed through a 40 \u00b5m strainer to obtain a single- cell suspension. We counted the lung cells and splenocytes by the trypan blue exclusion method. ELISPOT IFN ELISpot performed basic kit (ALP) and Mouse IL4 ELISPOT basic kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Mabtech, VA, USA). For cell activation control, we treated the cultures with 10 ng/ ml phorbol 12-myristat e 13- acetate (PMA ) (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) and 1 \u00b5g/ ml of ionomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA). We used the complete medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS) as the negative control. We stimulated splenocytes and lung cells (3 x 10 5) in vitro with either N -protein peptide pool (Miltenyi Biotec; #130-126-699, Germany) or S- protein pool (Genscript, # RP30020, USA) or S- protein (B.1.351) mutation peptide pool (Miltenyi Biotec, # 130-127-958, Germany) at a concentration of 1.5 g/ml/peptid e at 37 \u00b0C for 16- 18 h in pre- coated ELISpot plate coating antibody. The next day, we washed off the cells and developed the plates using biotinylated R4 -6A2 6-250) detection antibody, respectively. Then, we washed the wells and treated them for 1 h at RT with 1:30,000 diluted Extravidin- ALP conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA). After washing, we developed the spots by adding 70 \u00b5L/well of BCIP/NBT -plus substrate (Mabtech #3650-10) to the wells.

Cell surface staining, intracellular cytokine staining for flow cytometry We stimulated the spleen and lung cells from immunized and control animals to detect nucleocapsid protein-specific CD8+ T cell responses with an N protein- peptide pool at a concentration of 1.5 Biotec; 130- 126-699, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C for 16 -18 h followed by the addition of Brefeldin A (5 g/ml BD Biosciences #BD 555029) for the last 5 h of the incubation. We used 10 ng/ml PMA (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) and 1 \u00b5g/ml ionomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) as the positive control. Stimulation without peptides served as background control. We collected the cells and stained with Live/Dead Aqua (Thermo Fisher #L34965) in PBS, followed by Fc -receptor blockade with anti -CD16/CD32 (Thermo Fisher #14-0161- 85), and then stained for 30 min on ice with the following antibodies in flow washed the cells twice with the FACS buffer. We then fixed them with 100 L IC (intracellular) fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at RT. We permeabilized the cells for 10 min with 200 L permeabilization buffer (BD Cytofix solution kit). We performed the intracellular staining using the antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 interferon 4 \u00b0C. Next, we washed the cells with FACS buffer and analyzed them on LSR -Fortessa flow cytometer ( BD Bioscience) using FlowJo software version 10.8 (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR, USA). We calculated the results as the total number of cytokine- positive cells with background subtracted. We optimized the amount of the antibodies by titration. See Figure S 10A for the gating strategy. Viruses and biosafety Viruses. Isolates of SARS -CoV-2 were obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA) and amplified in Vero E6 cells to create working stocks of the virus. The virus was adapted to mice by four serial passages in the lungs of mice and plaque purified at Utah State University (USU). Biosafety and Ethics. The animal experiments at USU were conducted in accordance with an approved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of USU.

Lung tissue and nasal tissue samples from hamsters were homogenized using a bead- mill homogenizer using minimum essential media. Homogenized tissue samples were serially diluted in a test medium, and the virus was quantified using an endpoint dilution assay on Vero E6 cells for SARS -CoV-2. A 50% cell culture infectious dose was determined using the Reed -Muench equation75. Histopathology Lungs of the Syrian golden hamsters were fixed in 10% neural buffered formalin overnight and then processed for paraffin embedding. The 4- m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examinations. A board -certified pathologist evaluated the sections. Quantification and statistical analysis Statistical significance was assigned when P values were <0.05 using GraphPad Prism (v6.07). Tests, number of animals (n), mean values, and statistical comparison groups are indicated in the figure legends. Analysis of ELISA , ELISPOT , viral titers and pathology score s were performed using a Mann -Whitney test .
