The Bachelor of Science with a Major in Herbal Sciences is designed to provide a thorough, scientifi-cally rigorous and inspiring exploration of herbalism and its applications. The curriculum of the herbal sciences major does not include the diagnosis and treatment of disease, but rather introduces the stu-dent to concepts of disease prevention and health maintenance using medicinal herbs. The curriculum addresses economic, historical and sociopolitical perspectives regarding herbal sciences. Addition - ally, issues related to herbal product manufacturing and quality assurance/quality control introduce the analytical aspects of herbs and herbal products. This program offers a substantial breadth of perspectives and approaches in the herbal sciences. The program is based upon scientific inquiry in the herbal sciences. Students take courses in Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Botany during the first year of this program. Beginning in the first year and heavily concentrated in the second year are courses exploring various as-pects of the herbal sciences. Introduction to Herbal Sciences, Herbal Preparations, and Herbal Medicine History and T raditions lay a foundation in the junior year. In Research Methods for Herbal Sciences, students learn to interpret scientific literature on me-dicinal herbs. In Ethnobotany, the door opens to the connection between people and plants in indigenous cultures, old and new. The senior year includes Phar-macology, Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Actions of a core of Materia Medica, deepening the knowledge school of naturopathic medicineSchool of naturoP athIc medIcIne73 base. Northwest Herbs and First Aid for Herbalists lend hands-on experiences. In additional courses, stu-dents become familiar with environmental, economic and political issues surrounding the herbal sciences. There are electives available that cover a wide array of topics including diverse field courses.

The U.S. Department of Labor defines naturo- pathic physicians as doctors who \"diagnose, treat, and help prevent diseases using a system of practice that is based on the natural healing capacity of individuals. May use physiological, psychological or mechanical methods. May also use natural medi-cines, prescription or legend drugs, foods, herbs, or other natural remedies.\" Most naturopathic physicians provide natural medicine primary care through office-based, pri-vate practice. Many receive additional training in School of naturoP athIc medIcIne76 disciplines or modalities such as acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Naturopathic diagnosis and therapeutics are supported by scientific research drawn from peer-reviewed journals from many disciplines, including naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complementary medicine, clinical nutri-tion, phytotherapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. Information technology and new concepts in clinical outcomes assessment are particularly well-suited to evaluating the effec-tiveness of naturopathic treatment protocols and are being used in research, both at naturopathic medical schools and in the offices of practicing physicians. Clinical research into natural therapies has become an increasingly important focus for naturopathic physicians. progrAM outcoMeS A naturopathic medicine graduate of Bastyr University's School of Naturopathic Medicine will: Demonstrate an appropriate level of knowledge in both basic medical and clinical sciences Demonstrate the ability to apply clinical skills in the care of patients to the standards of a primary care naturopathic physician as defined by the profession Demonstrate the ability to apply the philoso- phy and principles of naturopathic medicine in the care of patients Demonstrate a commitment to the highest levels of ethics and professionalism by behaving with honesty and integrity in all interactions with patients, their families, other health care professionals, and others they interact with in the course of their professional career expected leArning outcoMeS A naturopathic medicine graduate of Bastyr University's School of Naturopathic Medicine is expected to be a:I.

The following policy has been adapted from the American Association of Medical Colleges guidelines to ensure that prospective students have the physical and mental capacities to perform the required duties of a naturopathic physician. A candidate for the naturopathic medicine degree must be able to demonstrate appropriate observational and communication skills, motor function, intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Observation: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal School of naturoP athIc medIcIne79 communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.), re-position a patient, carry out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and read ECGs and x-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing work loads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and educational processes.AdMiSSionS criteriA The admissions committee of the naturopathic medicine program determines the processes and procedures that guide the selection of candidates for the naturopathic program. The committee reviews undergraduate and graduate (if applicable) academic records and performance in the required prerequisite courses. The personal statement, references, resumes and in-person interviews are also evaluated for evidence of the abilities and skills required of naturopathic physicians. The interview also explores the candidate's awareness of the practice of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program is academically challenging. While no minimum GPA is specified, the mean GPA for entering students in the last five years has exceeded 3.3. interviewS Qualified applicants who submit complete ap- plications and meet the prerequisites may be invited to interview. Applicants are expected to interview at the campus to which they apply, either in Kenmore, Washington, or San Diego, California. A limited number of exceptions are made to accommodate special circumstances. trAnSfer Student S Bastyr University accepts transfer students from natu- ropathic, medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools and other accredited professional programs on a space-available basis. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency or from an institution accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). T ransfer students are considered for admis-sion in accordance with the following general guidelines: Applicants must meet the same entrance re- quirements as candidates for the first-year class. Applicants who wish to transfer credits from prior coursework must demonstrate satisfactory completion of courses that are equivalent in con-tent and quality to courses given at the University. Satisfactory completion equals a grade of achieved competency, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. Applicants must provide an official transcript from the college or program from which the transfer is being requested, demonstrating that they are leaving in good academic standing, and they should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Transfer applicants must submit a $75 transfer evaluation fee.School of naturoP athIc medIcIne80 AdvAnced StAnding StAtuS BASed on prior MedicAl educA tion Applicants who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced stand- ing status. Those applicants who graduated from accredited chiropractic, medical or osteopathic col-leges may be eligible for advanced standing in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. All advanced standing students must complete at least two-thirds of the program and do all of their clinical work at Bastyr University. They are eligible for a maximum of 103 credits toward advanced standing. In those instances where the maximum number of advanced standing transfer credits is granted, it will take a minimum of three years (11 quarters) to complete the program. Placement de-pends upon the amount of coursework completed in the original program, similarity of the course content and credits, age of the courses and perfor-mance in these courses. A student must provide documentation which shows the competencies of the Bastyr University course have been met. Course waivers and/or credit transfers are considered only for those courses in which applicants demonstrate a grade of achieved competence, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. An exam to determine competency may also be required. Advanced standing applicants must complete all of the course and credit require-ments in effect at the time of their enrollment in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. Final waiver and/or transfer credit decisions rest with the dean of the school in which the curriculum is taught. Advanced standing is determined on a case by case basis and depends on the type of degree program completed, the courses taken and the number of years in practice. Applicants who are eligible for advanced standing must submit a $75 advanced standing evaluation fee. Applicants must submit a catalog of course descriptions for the years they attended their pro-fessional program and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. If an advanced standing student is found to be deficient in some area(s) of study, s/he may be required to complete additional courses at Bastyr University. For more information on advanced standing status admission policies and procedures, contact the admissions office.BASic ScienceS curriculuM within nAturop Athic Medicine Basic science modules within the naturopathic medicine program provide integration across sci-ence disciplines and with clinical coursework. First year basic science modules provide a foundation of core principles in anatomy, histology, embryology, biochemistry and physiology that are integrated in the context of body systems. Second year modules use the systems approach to integrate the principles of pathology, immunology and infectious diseases. Throughout the curriculum, science concepts are applied to clinical situations through integrated case discussions. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr Uni-versity's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become to-tally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers science courses that satisfy prerequisite requirements, including courses in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. counSeling And heAlth pSychology curriculuM within nAturop Athic Medicine The counseling and health psychology cur- riculum serves naturopathic medical students in understanding and effecting change in the emo-tional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human functioning.

Departments Within the Naturopathic Medicine Program BotAnicAl Medicine (For Department of Botanical Medicine Mission and Vision, see page 72.) Botanical medicine is a core modality for naturo- pathic physicians to use in optimizing the health and well-being of their patients. Medicinal plants have been used as food and medicine by all peoples on all continents. The importance of plants to humans has been recorded in cave paintings 60,000 years old. A contemporary renaissance in herbal medicine weds traditional use and wisdom with modern analytical methodologies for optimal medical applications for today. Empirical knowledge of plant therapeutics is based on Western and holistic thought rather than reductionist paradigms and is linked with contempo-rary scientific knowledge. The core curriculum in botanical medicine for naturopathic medical students covers fundamental plant identification and nomenclature, pharmacog-nosy, therapeutic actions, extraction principles, dosage considerations, contraindications, toxicology, herb-drug interactions, clinical applications and treatment regimens. Clinical therapeutics draws from traditional uses, naturopathic formulae and use, and from in-ternational scientific and clinical research, as well as advances in phytotherapy. Several of the materia medica courses are linked with a laboratory experience in the botanical medicine lab on campus. Completion of the required curriculum, along with the required clinical experience, prepares the student for effective and safe clinical utilization of preventive and thera-peutic botanicals. A variety of botanical medicine elective and special topic courses are offered to students in the naturo-pathic medicine program and other programs, along with independent study options. The Bastyr garden is managed by the botanical medicine department, with support from the Uni - versity and donations. It is maintained primarily by a staff garden supervisor and work-study students. The botanical medicine department continues to build an herbarium, although the vast University of Washington herbarium is used as one of Bastyr's teaching venues. The department supports a botanical medicine lab to expand class experience and provide a space for students to continue exploring their work and passion for herbs. hoMeop Athic Medicine Homeopathic medicine is a broad therapeutic modality that is integral to naturopathic medicine. Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. This principle states that a substance that is capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure an ill patient presenting a similar pattern of disease symptoms. Homeopathic medicines stimulate a person's inherent defense mechanism. The entire range of mental, emotional and physi-cal symptoms is considered with each patient. A single medicine is then chosen that addresses the complex pattern of the patient, while emphasizing the uniqueness of the individual. The homeopathic curriculum at Bastyr Univer- sity includes the basic principles and philosophy of homeopathy, materia medica of commonly used homeopathic medicines, use of the homeopathic repertory, taking a homeopathic case, homeopathic case analysis and practical therapeutics for common medical situations. phySicAl Medicine Physical medicine is an integral part of naturo- pathic medicine. It includes various modalities such as hydrotherapy, osseous and soft-tissue manipula-tion, sports medicine and therapeutic exercise. The course of study and clinical training in physical medicine enable students to develop a solid foun-dation for entry into the practice of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum offers sufficient hours in manipulation to satisfy the state of Washington's licensing requirement as a naturopathic physician.School of naturoP athIc medIcIne82 The physical medicine curriculum begins by teaching students the art of touch and palpation, introduction to basic Swedish massage techniques and soft-tissue manipulation, and then progresses to osseous manipulation. SuMMer MASSA ge intenSive Bastyr University and Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts offer students a summer massage training program that allows them to ap-ply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington state requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. Students interested in further information may meet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office or with their department's program supervisor to discuss the program availability and the course prerequisites. nAturop Athic Medicine clinic entrAnce prerequiSiteS Naturopathic medicine students must complete and achieve competency in all required classes prior to entering clinical training. Questions about didac-tic prerequisites for clinical ND training should be addressed to the registrar's office on campus. Students must also have completed TB screening, received a hepatitis B vaccination or signed a waiver, have a current CPR card, and submit to a national criminal background check. The criminal background check will be conducted prior to enrolling in clinical shifts. For more information, see \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. clinic requireMent S Students in the four-year program will begin clinical training in their first year. Students in the five-year program will begin clinical training in the fall quarter of their second year. Clinical training begins with observation, in which the student fol-lows supervisors through their rotations. The next year clinical training builds to active observation, with clinical skills demonstrated by the student and evaluated by the supervisor. The training supports the students to gradually and continually develop and expand their clinical skills and competence throughout their roles as novice, intermediate and experienced student clinicians. Students are required to successfully complete a minimum of 1,208 hours of clinical training.grAdu Ation requireMent S The curriculum of the naturopathic medicine program requires completion of 309.5 credits for graduation. This includes 252.5 core course credits, 8 elective credits and 49 clinical credits. Students must achieve competency (grade of AC) in all 309.5 credits required in the curriculum. Students must complete all required clinical competencies in order to gradu-ate. Students must complete at least two-thirds of their credits in residence at Bastyr University. electiveS Students in the naturopathic medicine program are required to complete 8 elective credits (included in the 309.5 credit totals) during their course of study. Up to five of these credits may be satisfied by independent study. It is recommended that elective credits be spread out over the length of the student's program. Courses designated as elective and special topics may fulfill this 8-credit requirement, as well as additional clinic shifts during the student's clini-cal training. A maximum of 5 elective credits from any one discipline may be used to satisfy the natu-ropathic medicine program elective requirement. The rule of a 5-credit maximum does not apply to elective credits being taken to satisfy waived credits. Elective credits covering waived course credits may be from any discipline. A student may take elective credits from any program/department. nAturop Athic Medicine progrAM trAckS Students who are accepted into the program and decide not to complete the program in four years must choose one of the following approved options: Extended Track-Option Extended Dual-Track OptionAt the time of enrollment, most naturopathic medicine students are registered for the four-year track. Students who wish to change to an extended track must complete the ND change of status form (available in the registrar's office) and then meet with an advisor/evaluator, room 249. Changes may affect financial aid packages as well as the sequencing of courses. Naturopathic medicine students wanting to add a second program must switch to the extended dual track. As long as a student remains on an approved program track, there will be no course-scheduling conflicts. Students must remain on track in order to graduate on time. Students may not register off track or register ahead of track without approval from the dean's office.School of naturoP athIc medIcIne83 For additional information regarding combining naturopathic medicine with acupuncture and Oriental medicine, counseling psychology or midwifery, please contact the admissions office.

This requires a formal application to the acupuncture and Oriental medicine program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the AOM and ND schools. ND students who are considering applying to the School of AOM as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of attendance. In essence, the dual-track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre-clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the AOM program must switch their naturopathic program to the five-year track in order to carry a combined program load. Students with advanced medical training, e.g., DC, DO or MD, must successfully complete the first year of study in their original program before acceptance into dual status. Dual program applicants are able to utilize their basic science coursework in the natu-ropathic program toward their MSA or MSAOM. Please note that some states require Chinese herbal training for acupuncture licensure. Please see the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine master's program description for complete informa-tion on degree and licensing requirements. duAl-trAck elective credit S ND/MSAOM students must complete ten elec- tive credits. ND/MSA students must complete 13 elective credits. For all dual-track students, five of the elective credits must be from disciplines other than OM or CH. If a dual-track student has waived a required course from either program, core course credit from the opposite program cannot be used to cover the waiver. Use of core credits would result in a shortage of overall credits. The following curriculum tables list the ten- tative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course is the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total School of naturoP athIc medIcIne87 contact hours for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). doctor of nAturop Athic Medicine / MASter of Science in Acupuncture (MSA) or Acupuncture And orient Al Medicine (MSA oM) 2012-2013 Note: Since a naturopathic medicine student enters the dual program after completion of the second year of the NM program, the curriculum that follows reflects the NM curriculum from the 2010/2011 catalog and the MSA/MSAOM curriculum from the 2012-2013 catalog.

This requires a formal application to the counseling and health psychology program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the counseling and health psychology department and the ND school. ND students who are considering applying to the counseling psychology master's program as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of attendance. In essence, the dual-track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre-clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the MACP program must switch their naturopathic program to the extended track in order to carry a combined program load. nAturop Athic Medicine /Midwifery duAl trAck Students in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program who are academically in good standing have the opportunity to apply to the Master of Science in Midwifery (MSMW) program in February of their second year of the four-year track. This requires a formal application to the Department of Midwifery through the admissions department, followed by an interview for qualified applicants by the admissions committee of the Department of Midwifery. ND students who are considering applying to the Department of Midwifery as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of atten-dance. In essence, this dual-track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre-clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the Midwifery program must subsequently switch their naturopathic program to the extended track in order to carry a combined program load. Please see the department of midwifery's program overview for complete information on education objectives and blended curriculum model. Because this model entails mandatory intensive onsite at-tendance, dual-track students will need to have ND courses that meet during those times videotaped with the assistance of the ND department. The following curriculum tables list the ten- tative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact hours for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). fAculty with higheSt degreeS , licenSeS oBtAined And depArtMent Al AffiliA tion Key (AOM) Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine (BS) Basic Sciences (BTM) Botanical Medicine (EXS) Exercise Science (HO) Homeopathy (HS) Herbal Sciences (IS) Interdisciplinary Studies (MW) Midwifery(NM) Naturopathic Medicine (NTR) Nutrition(PM) Physical Psychology Brammer, Debra, ND, Bastyr University (NM) Bradley, Ryan, ND, (MA, Bastyr University (NM, PM)Littleton, Kent, ND, Bastyr MS, Washington (BS) Mann, Richard, ND, Bastyr University (HO)Martzen, Mark, PhD, University of South Dakota School of Medicine (BS) Messner, Don, PhD, University of Washington (BS)Modell, Harold, PhD, University of Mississippi Medical Center (BS) Neary, Dean E., Jr, ND, Bastyr University (PM, NM)Olehausen, Joni, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Parkinson, Andrew, ND, Bastyr University (NM)Raymer, Katherine, ND, MD, Southwest College of Natu- ropathic Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine (NM) Rosen, Daniel, PhD, Arizona State University (PSY) Rubinstein, Joshua, ND, Bastyr University (NM)Spicer, Diane, MIT, University of versity of Wisconsin (BS) Standish, Leanna, ND, Bastyr University of Massachusetts, LAc (NM) Staruch, Arianna, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Steward, Rebecca Love, DVM, Washington State Univer- sity (BS) Takakura, Masahiro, ND, LAc, Bastyr University, DC, National College of Chiropractic (PM) Thomas, Aleyamma, PhD, University of Manitoba (BS) Wallace, James, ND, Bastyr University (NM) Wenner, Cynthia, PhD, Washington University, (BS) Eric, ND, RH, University (NM)Anderson, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Auerbach, Marisha, BA, The Evergreen State College (CHLD) Anderson, Robert, MD, University of Washington (NM)Barry, David, ND, DC, Bastyr Nancy, Johns Hopkins University (BS)Berman, Lisa, Heilpraktiker, Berlin University (HS)Boehnlein, David, BS, University of Minnesota - T win Cit- ies (CHLD) of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Elmore, \"Durr\" Nesbitt, ND, DC, National College of Evershed, ND, Deborah, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, RN, Edward J.
