B1 iii Executive Summary The Planning for Healthy Babies Program\u00ae (P4HB\u00ae), Georgias s ection 1115 (a) Medicaid Demonstration, expands the provision of family planning services to uninsured women , ages 18 through 44, who have a family income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) , and who are not otherwise eli gible for Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Demonstration also provides Interpregnancy Care (IPC) services to women who meet the same eligibility requirements above and who deliver a very low birth weight (VLBW) infant (less than 1,500 grams) on o r after January 1, 2011. In addition, w omen ages 18 through 44 with a family income at or below 200 percent of the FPL, who have a VLBW delivery on or after January 1, 2011, and who qualify under Georgias Low Income Medicaid (LIM) Class of Assistance or the Aged , Blind and Disabled (ABD) Classes of Assistance are eligible for nurse case management/ Resource Mothers Outreach only services under the Demonstration . Georgia expects to achieve the following w ith this D emonstration : Reduce Georgias low birth weight (LBW) and VLBW rates ; Reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the state ; Reduce Medicaid costs by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies by women who otherwise would be eligible for Medicaid pregnancy -related serv ices; Provide access to IPC health services for eligible women who have previously delivered a VLBW infant; and, Increase child spacing intervals through effective contraceptive use. iv A unique aspect of Georgia s Demonstration is that services are delivere d through the Georgia Families Care Management Organizations (CMOs) and their networks of providers . Three CMOs - Amer igroup , WellCare of Georgia , Inc. , and Peach State Health Plan - participate in the Georgia Families program and receive a capitated per m ember per month (PMPM) payment for each Demonstration participant. These capitation rates were approved by CMS and serve as the basis for calculating the expenses in the quarterly budget neutrality worksheet. The CMOs provider networks provide clinical, l aboratory, pharmacy and other Demonstration services to the P4HB participants and each of the three CMOs has nurse case managers and Resource Mothers who provide the case management services for the IPC participants. Title X clinics, largely public health departments in Georgia, are also included in the CMO s networks. The implementation of the P4HB program followed a multi -pronged communication plan, with engagement of the CMOs, professional associations, and the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) as well as direct engagement of consumers via printed and other media. DCH projected (based on 2008 survey data ) that 276,548 women would be eligible for services under the Demonstration and that by the end of Year 1, 110,620 of those women would be enrol led and 33,186 would be using services. D espite multiple engagement efforts by DCH and providers in the community, there has been a lower than expected take -up of the program and even lower take -up of the programs benefits although participation rates inc reased in this second year . Using an estimate from the American Community Survey of uninsured women < 200% FP L in Georgia in 2011, approximately 12% of this estimated eligible population was enrolled in the FP only componen t at the end of CY2012 . If the number of eligible women is adjusted for the percentage of women in need of family planning services, the percentage enrolled in the family planning only component increases to 22.5%. This percentage includes th e large number of women auto -v enrolled int o the family planning only component of th e P4HB program; some of the data in this report indicate these auto-enrolled women had less interest in the program and tended to use services at a lower rate than those initiating their own enrollment. The PMPM payments to the CMOs totaled $14,776,646.80 for the second program year resulting in a total of $16,123,033.37 across the two years since implementation of the P4HB program . The PY2 total included $14,528,929.15 for services, $211,200 for IPC servi ces, and $36,517.65 for Resource Mother Only services . The PMPM for each of these program components included an administrative load amount of 13 %. These PY2 expenditures reflect a growth in enrollment during this period and represent a ten -fold increase in total spending during PY2 when compared with the expenditures for the first year of the program ($1,346,386 ). As reported in the third quarter 2013 P4HB Quarterly Report to CMS , the member months for the FP only enrollees continued to increase through t he second year while the number of participant s enrolled, member months , and expenditures for the IPC component of the Demonstration began to decline. Some of this decline may have been the result of a finding identified in this PY 2 report that as many as 7% of the IPC enrolled women experienced a new pregnancy , one experienced a repeat live birth , and one experienced a still birth in 2012 . Once the pregnancy determination was made, these women would have been transferred to a new eligibility category wi thin the Georgia Medicaid program . In preparation for this report, t he evaluation team examined early effects of the P4HB program on: 1) use of family planning services among Medicaid enrolled women and among women in the income range targeted by P4HB ; 2) trends in Medicaid paid births and birth weight distributions; 3) pregnancies and births among P4HB enrollees and birth weight outcomes; 4) comparisons of birth outcomes between P4HB participants and non-participants; 5) time to next pregnancy for vi Righ t from the Start Medicaid (RSM) enrollees with an index birth between 2009 and 2012; and 6) evidence of increased management of chronic conditions among IPC enrollees. As noted on the title page, this report uses corrected enrollment data for P4HB enrollee s and update eligibility data . Since P4HB enrollees can only receive P4HB services once they are enrolled into a CMO this is the enrollment date that must be used for assessing subsequent outcomes such as pregnancies and/or births. Our outside evaluator d id not have the CMO enrollment date in the data they originally used for the Annual Reports. This has now been corrected and the counts of P4HB enrollees used for assessing outcomes reflect this. This report presents data that support the following key findings: Use of Family Planning: Use of any family planning services at Title X clinic s from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter 2013 increased among uninsured women in the income range targeted by P4HB (>25% but < 200% FPL) ; Use of contracept ives at Title X clinics shifted toward long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARC s) based on descriptive and multivariate analysis ; Use of family planning services among all Medicaid enrolled women ages 18 -44 increased between 2009 and 2012; The growth i n family planning services paid for by Medicaid or Title X did not increase enough to result in a growing percentage of all women < 200% FPL with a family planning or birth control visit over the 2009 -2012 time period ; but Users in both the Medicaid and Ti tle X sectors shifted toward greater use of LARC s by 2012 . vii Trends in Births/Costs: Medicaid paid births were declining prior to implementation of the P4HB program and they have continued to decline through CY2011 but rose in CY2012 following overall patte rns at the state level ; Average paid amount s for infant s at delivery increased only slightly from $ 3,274 to $3,889 over the 2009 -2012 years ; The p ercentage of very l ow birth weight infants remained close to 2.0% each year between 2009 -2012 based on Medica id claims ; and between 2009 -2011 based on linked claims and vital records . Pregnancy/Birth of P4HB Enrollees: An estim ated 6.6% of FP only demonstration participants experienced a pregnancy after 3 months of continuous enrollment in P4HB and 1.5% had a delivery paid by Medicaid after enrollment ; Total births to P4HB enrollees was 562 in 2012, still far less than expected given the fertility rates cited in the DCH Planning for Healthy Babies Concept Paper used in the application process1; Birth outcomes of infants born to the FP only demonstration participants included a somewhat higher percentage of VLBW infants but a higher percentage LBW infants, than those infants born to RSM women in 2012 who were not enrolled in P4HB ; Two IPC enrollees experienced a delivery after enrolling in the P4HB program . One had a live born de livery and one had a still born delivery paid by Medicaid in CY2012 ; 1http://dch.georgia.gov/sites/dch.georgia.gov/files/imported/vgn/images/portal/cit_1210/33/52/156793595PlanningforHealthyBabie sProgram121709Final.pdf viii Repeat pregnancies among women with a VLBW birth on Medicaid in CY20 12 equaled 13.6% within 12 months fo r those not p articipating in IPC but were lower at 7.3%, for those participating in IPC ; There were no repeat VLBW births am ong the IPC enrollee s but there was one repeat VLBW birth among women in a RSM comparison sample. Changes in Other Outcomes: The percentage of all RSM enrollees with a repeat pregnancy within 6 months of the index birth ranged from 3.2% to 3.7 % during the 2009 -2011 time periods and was lower at 3.4% in 2012 ; Infant first year of life costs after the ir delivery hospitalization averag ed $2,355 in 2012 versus $1,851 in 2011 ; and Small percentages of IPC women were using services in 2011 but this increased in 2012 with most of them using services for acute conditions . The use of services by IPC participants for chronic conditions increas ed and the most common service was for the management of hypertension . The numbers we present in this second annual report are based on claims and encounter data from 2009 -2012 with linkages to the Georgia vital records for CY20 09-CY20 11. As the updated 2 011 and new 2012 extracts were delivered to the evaluation team , it was realized that DRG coding , as reported by the CMOs, was markedly less complete than in prior years. As these new data came in, Emory conducted comparisons of counts of infants/deliveri es and birth weight distributions using ICD -9 versus DRG codes and, using the linked 2009 -2011 claims and vital records , concluded that the agreement between claims and vital records was similar for ICD -9 and DRG ix coding . However, when using either coding system in comparison to the vital records , the claims data consistently demonstrate d that: 1) a smaller percentage of infants were categorized as LBW ; and 2) within those categorized as LBW , a larger percentage were categorized as VLBW than reported in the vital records for the same set of infants. Emory assign ed the lowest birth weight observed in claims since, from a scientific viewpoint, this will provide a more conservative approach and if an effect is seen using this method we can be more confident it is a real/true effect. Ultimately, Emory will use the vital records data as the gold standard for measuring birth weight once they are available and linked. The evaluation team also noted that the claims led to an apparent undercount of infants in CY2 011 and an undercount of deliveries in CY2012. The latter is most important for the measures reported here since deliveries to women enrolled in P4HB in the first full year after the implementation year will be understated. This should be kept in mind as the results presented here a re reviewed. We recognize the lack of standardization in the definition of Medicaid -financed births across states and hope that our effort in Georgia will contribute toward a common set of definitions and standards for comput ing these measures using Medicaid claims data, vital records, and once completed, linked claims -vital records. Based on the updated data with the corrected CMO enrollment dates , Emory found that significant number of women c ame into the program most like ly already pregnant . Based on this and other outcomes presented in this report, Emory University make s the following recommendations to DCH : Based on some positive signs in Year 2, we encourage DCH to seek a n extension of the P4HB program beyond its schedu led end . The patterns observed near the end of th e second x year indicate that P4HB may be reaching maturity in terms of achieving sustainable levels of enrollment, use of effective family planning methods , and management of women with very low birth weight infants. It is important for the state to strengthen these trends . Continue to work with Title X as a n active partner in the enrollment of eligible women into the P4HB program and in the provision of family planning services to uninsured and under insured women who, if pregnant, are eligible for Medicaid coverage. A continued monitoring of the Title X quarterly data will inform DCH about the trends seen in the most recent quarters that indicate increased use of birth control methods and in turn, more use of LARC s. An added benefit of such a partnership is that these efforts can help Title X clinics leverage Medicaid funds to increase revenues and allow for the use of Title X funding to further expand outreach, access and the provision of more effective methods of birth control to non -Medicaid eligible individuals . Increase efforts to retain the auto -enrolled women . Many of them will be coming up for recertification through out the coming year. These women have account ed for a large portion of the total number of women enrolled in the family planning only component. Continue working with the IPC enrollees to ensure their awareness and utilization of the range of services available to them and, in particular , the management of chronic conditions in additi on to the family planning services intended to help them prevent a repeat pregnancy or birth within a short time period. Explore opportunities to decrease the time between the eligibility determination and actual CMO enrollment for P4HB. While most women who eventually come into a CMO for P4HB services do so within two months from the date of the eligibility determination, this is a time period when women do not have access to P4HB services so unintended pregnancies may occur. There were 1,043 pregnancies observed among women enrolled xi less than the three months required for inclusion in the full analysis. These can perhaps be seen as failure s of women to understand the program and/or failure of the delivery system to get the women in for family planning c ounseling and services in a timely fashion . Consider a renewed market ing campaign for P4HB. The large number of women who appear to come into the program already pregnant is perhaps indicative of a misunderstanding of the preventive nature of the progra m. There were 1,035 pregnancies and 215 births among women who eve ntually enrolled in a CMO for three continuous months who apparently came into P4HB already pregnant and as noted above, an additional 1,043 pregnancies among those enrolled in a CMO for le ss than two months. This campaign should target : media outlets (TV, radio) as well as social media (texts, Face Book , Twitter) and; eligible FP only enrollees as well as eligible IPC enrollees. In addition, a provider component of this renewed marketing c ampaign should be included that targets a broad range of provider types (OBGYN, family physicians, nurse practitioners, Title X womens health coordinators, neonatal ICU providers and social workers ). Previously collected qualitative information indicated that providers were confused about the status of P4HB, with many be lieving the program was ending in December 2013. This renewed marketing campaign would clarify that P4HB is continuing and should include clear information about eligi bility, enrollment, an d program benefits. 1 I. OVERVIEW OF THE PLANNING FOR HEALTHY BABIES PROGRAM (P4HB) In response to the persistent high rate of low birth weight (LBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born to women in Georgia, the DCH designed a Section 1115 (a) Dem onstration and was granted authority by CMS to expand access to family planning services under the P4HB program. This program became available in January 2011 and eligible women must be: U.S. citizens and residents of Georgia who are otherwise uninsured and not eligible for Medicaid ; 18 through 44 years of age; not pregnant but able to become pregnant; and with incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The P4HB program also provides Interpregnancy Care (IPC) services to women who meet t he above eligibility criteria and who deliver a very low birth weight (VLBW) infant on or after January 1, 2011 . The program also offers n urse case management and Resource Mother outreach services to women receiving IPC services and to women enrolled in the Georgia LIM or ABD (Aged, Blind and Disabled) Medicaid programs who deliver a very low birth weight infant on or after January 1, 2011 . DCH identified the following as key goals for th e P4HB Demonstration : Primary : Reduce Georgias LBW and VLBW rates; Secondary: Reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in Georgia; Tertiary : Reduce Georgias Medicaid costs by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies by women who otherwise would be eligible for Medicaid pregnancy - related services . 2 When p regnancie s occur among th e near -poor group of w omen at or below 200% FPL they qualify under Georgias pregnancy (\"Right from the Start\") Medicaid eligibility criteria. Since women in this income range are made newly eligible for family planning services under P4HB , it is possible that the costs of deliveries paid for by the Georgia Medicaid program under the RSM eligibility category will begin to decline. A key objective o f the Demonstration , as noted, is to reduce the proportion of unintended pregnancies/births a nd increase interpregnancy intervals among this targeted group of near -poor women . Given the increased risk of repeating an adverse pregnancy outcome such as a VLBW delivery, t he provision of IPC services for women at or below 200% of the FPL who delive r a VLBW infant is important to the overall success of P4HB in lower ing the states rate of VLBW births . The combined FP and IPC components of P4HB may also provide positive influences on birth weight by expanding the use of effective birth control method s among women in this income range, thereby decreasing unintended pregnanc ies and lengthening interpregnancy intervals. In particular , the FP only component may play a major role in influencing the birth weight distribution since the majority of very low birth weight births are first births , and this component of the Demonstration provides increased access to family planning for nulliparous women who would not otherwise be Medicaid el igible . Family planning services available through the P4HB program include all family planning services covered by the Georgia Medicaid program as noted below : Comprehensive annual exam ; Pap smear including follow -up testing with colposcopy as indicated , clinical breast examination; Follow -up contraceptive visits (4 per yea r); 3 Pregnancy testing ; Provision of FDA -approved contraceptive methods and supplies, evaluation and management of contraceptive -related problems ; Sterilization ; Treatment of major complications of delivered services ; Diagnostic treatment and follow -up of STIs ; Drugs, supplies, devices related to womens health services (genital tract infections, UTIs, etc ); Multivitamin with folic acid or folic acid ; HepB and Td vaccination s for 19 and 20 year -olds; Education and counseling (with referral as needed) relat ed to reproductive health, preventive and preconception care, pregnancy timing and spacing, risk reduction for sexually transmitted infections, tobacco and substance abuse, domestic violence, and benefits and risks of contraceptive methods ; and Counseling and referrals to social services and primary health care providers. While the expansion of eligibility for these family planning services under P4HB should increase low-income women s access to a full spectrum of family planning services by permitting wom en within a higher income range to have coverage and by allowing access through private health care providers as well as county health departments and community health centers , this expanded access depends in large part on enrollment of eligible women and in turn, encouraging their use of available services. These services are available to eligible women for twenty -four (24) months as long as the woman remains eligible for P4HB. 4 The IPC services under the P4HB program are also available (for twenty -four (24 ) months) to eligible women who deliver a live born, VLBW (< 1,500 grams or 3 pounds, 5 ounces) infant. The goals of this program component are to delay conception of the womens next pregnancy for 18 to 23 months from delivery of the index VLBW infant and to improve womens underlying health status by addressing their health and preconception needs and managing their chronic and other health conditions. Women qualifying for the IPC component of the Demonstration receive the following services in addition t o family planning services: Primary care visits (5 outpatients visits annually); Chronic disease management; Prescription medications for treatment of chronic diseases; Substance abuse treatment; Limited dental services; Resource Mother/Nurse case ent (through CMO staff); and Non-emergency transportation. Resource Mother/Nurse case management (through CMO staff) outreach is available to Medicaid eligible women enrolled in the LIM and ABD classes of assistance who deliver a VLBW infant. All of their other service need s are met through their full Medicaid eligibility. A unique aspect of the P4HB program is that participants must select a CMO , with its affiliated provider network , through which their family planning and IPC services are delivered . On ce deemed eligible for the Demonstration , women have 30 days in which to choose a CMO. Women already enrolled in a Georgia Families CMO , who are losing Medicaid or CHIP 5 coverage , may cho ose to stay with their current CMO or choose a new CMO if desired . Women enrolled in the IPC program have access to the CMOs primary care and family planning providers as well as a nurse case manager and Resource Mother. Nurse case managers and Resource Mothers take part in coordinating care for the women in the IPC and the Resource Mother only components of the program and linking them with community -based resources and programs . Demonstration Objectives The primary goal of the Demonstration is to r educe Georgias LBW and VLBW rates . The following related objective s were identified to effect achievement of the goals of the Demonstration: Improve access to family planning services by extending eligibility for these services to the newly eligible women noted above during the three years of the Demonstration. Provide acc ess to interpregnancy primary care health services for eligible women who deliver a VLBW infant during the three year term of the Demonstration. Decrease unintended and high -risk pregnancies among Medicaid eligible women. Decrease late teen pregnancies by reducing the number of first or repeat teen births among Medicaid eligible women ages 18 -19 years. Decrease the number of Medicaid -paid deliveries from the number expected to occur in the absence of the Demonstration beginning in the second year. Increase child spacing intervals through effective contraceptive use to foster reduced LBW rates and improved health status of women. 6 Increase consistent use of contraceptive methods by providing wider access to family planning services and incorporating care coor dination and patient -directed counseling into family planning visits. Increase family planning utilization among Medicaid eligible women by using an outreach and public awareness program designed with input from family planning patients and providers as we ll as women needing but not receiving services . Decrease Medicaid spending attributable to unintended births and LBW and VLBW babies. These objectives point to several quantifiable performance measures that will be gauged pre - and post- implementation of t he demonstration as discussed in the next section. Demonstration Evaluation Objectives This Demonstration s evaluation use s a quasi -experimental design , where possible, to test for changes pre and post the Demonstration in the following performance measur es: Total family planning visits per poor and near poor woman; Use of contraceptive services/supplies per poor and near poor woman ; Use of interpregnancy care services (primary care and outreach) by women with a VLBW delivery; Average interpregnancy int ervals for poor and near poor women ; Average interpregnancy intervals for women with a VLBW delivery ; Teen and repeat teen births for poor and near poor 18 and 19 year olds; Rate of LBW and VLBW deliveries among the Medicaid population with comparisons to the statewide rates for LBW and VLBW deliveries ; 7 Rate of LBW and VLBW deliveries2 among poor and near poor women and among Medicaid enrolled women compared to other populations within the state; Rate of infant mortality among the Medicaid population wit h a comparison to the statewide rate for infant mortality; Rate of infant mortality3 among poor and near poor women and among Medicaid enrolled women compared to other populations within the state. The objective s of the evaluation are to test not only for changes in the performance measures pre and post P4HB but to assess whether there is evidence of a causal pathway through the expanded acces s P4HB provides. In order for P4HB to achieve significant changes in these measures , sufficient numbers of eligibl e women in the community must enroll such that there is an increase in the overall use of family planning services/supplies among low -income women or an increase in consistent use of more effective contraceptive methods than would otherwise occur . Increas ed use of contraceptives and, in particular, use of methods of higher effectiveness among the Demonstration s participants should lead to reduced rates of unintended pregnancies and in turn, unintended births among this population of women (as well as impr oved interpregnancy intervals). Since teens are at high risk of unintended pregnanc ies, another anticipated effect should be that the rate of unintended births and repeat teen births fall s post the Demonstration . A key hypothesis is that these changes will be sufficient to lower the number of overall Medicaid paid pregnancies and deliveries/births and hence, costs, such that the state and federal government will ultimately realize a net cost savings despite increased spending on family 2 While we include assessment of t he rate of very low birth weight deliveries as a performance measure, we note that our power to detect differences will be limited due to the smaller number of IPC participants, the relatively short time period of the Demonstra tion over which these downst ream outcomes can be observed, and potentially low participation rates. 3 While we include assessment of the rate of infant mortality as a performance measure, our power to detect differences in this outcome will be limited by its relatively low incidence and the issues noted above. 8 planning and inte rpregnancy care related services. Since Medicaid birth rates are highly variable and can be affected by external factors (such as unemployment, wage/income changes) estimates of averted births used in budget neutrality tests in most states demonstration programs are based in part, on births actually observed within the demonstration enrollee or participating (users) group of women. While th e P4HB evaluation will include this measure, the real budget neutrality test for the P4HB program is whether there is an overall shift in the distribution of infants across birth weight categories. If the Demonstration causes changes such that there are relatively fewer low birth weight and very low birth weight infants born to Medicaid enrolled women in Georgia, tota l expenditures should be lowered for the state and federal government. II. SUMMARY OF SECOND YEAR ACTIVITIES Communication and Outreach During the second program year of the Demonstration (PY2), DCH and each of the participating Care Management Orga nizations (CMOs) continued their efforts to increase awareness of the P4HB program as well as encourage participation by both consumers and providers. We summarize these communication and outreach efforts below. DCH Supported Activities In PY2, DCH conti nued to follow its multi -pronged communication plan which incorporates five (5) specific phases for the marketing of P4HB throughout the state: 1) educate providers and CMOs; 2) leverage strengths and assets of partners; 3) implement consumer -based outreac h; 4) use existing resources for support and coaching; and 5) annual evaluation. Two new activities 9 related to provider education were added to Phase 1. Each of these phases is described in the table in Appendix A and discussed below. The DCH link for the P4HB program is: CMOs . DCH continued to conduct provider education and outreach throughout the state. These related activ ities included distributing numerous educational and training materials to the CMOs, the Georgia Family Planning Programs (Georgia Title X Grantee) staff, and numerous provider organizations throughout the state. In May 2012, DCH staff members made a pre sentation to the Medical Care Advisory Committee of DCH about P4HB. In June 2012, these same staff members presented an update regarding P4HB to the states Title X Womens Health Coordinators during their meeting in Macon, Georgia. In addition, DCH added two new provider activities (Phase 1), including 1) adding the provider handbooks to the P4HB website and 2) u pdating the P4HB website to include additional program information. In addition, DCH continued to work with the CMOs to refine and implement two additional provider surveys. These surveys, implemented in April and September 2012 , helped to inform DCH a nd the CMOs about their network providers knowledge and understanding of the P4HB program and potential barriers that existed in the first two years of the program. The results of the provider surveys are discussed in section IV of this report. 2. Leverage Strengths and Assets of Partners. DCH provided additional training and educational materials (blast fax, P4HB materials) to the following provider or ganizations: Georgia Primary Care Association; Georgia Association of Family Physicians (GAFP); 10 Georgia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (G AAAP); and the Georgia Obstetrical and Gynecologic Society (GOGS). In May 2012, D CH staff members conduc ted site visits to view the CMOs IPC case management tracking systems and discuss any concerns regarding the IPC component of the P4HB program. These visits were well received by the CMOs staff members. DCH and Emory University also worked to develop and implement webinar s for staff members of the NICUs in Georgia with the goal of encouraging them to inform eligible women about the IPC component and facilitate their completion of program application materials . Each webinar describe d the P4HB program, the IPC services available through P4HB for women who deliver a VLBW infant , and the enrollment process with emphasis upon ways in which the NICU social workers and staff could facilitate eligible womens enrollment in the program . Three webinars were delivere d during 2012. 3. Consumer -Based Outreach . DCH continued to conduct extensive client outreach during 2012. RSM staff made over 1,600 presentations about the P4HB program to interested individuals throughout the state. P4HB client outreach activities ranged from health fairs to radio public service announcements to church meetings and visits to childrens hospitals and youth development centers. RSM staff made one -on-one presentations as well as presented at large -scale group information sessions. Attendance at most outreach activities was high, with several activities being attended by over 1,000 people. Examples include: RSM workers promoted P4HB in January 2012 at a Harlem Globetrotter Benefit Basketball game attended by over 1,000 people. In March 2012, RSM workers promoted P4HB to over 2,000 participants of the Belks KIDS FEST in Lowndes County. 11 In April 2012, RSM workers promoted P4HB in Fulton County to 1,000 people at the Georgia Dome and at Atlanta Technical College. In May 2012, RSM workers pro moted P4HB in Clayton County to 1,000 people at the Swing into Spring at Star Park event In July 2012, RSM workers promoted P4HB in Jeff Davis County to 1,300 people at the Back to School - Focus on the Family event. In August 2012, RSM workers promoted P4 HB to 2,000 people at the Fannin County Rodeo. In October 2012, RSM workers promoted P4HB to over 10,000 people at the Paulding County Trick or Treat Village. In December 201 2, RSM workers promoted P4HB in Jones County to 1,000 people at the Annual Christ mas Parade celebration. A detailed list of all DCH specific outreach activities has been included in the quarterly reports submitted during PY 2 to CMS. Examples of additional outreach activities that occurred during PY 2 include: o Maintain ed ongoing comm unication with family planning and OB/GYN providers : DCH communicated with family planning and OB/GYN providers to inform them about P4HB. o Ongoing engagement of providers involved in High Risk Pregnancies : The Georgia Families CMOs were continually encour aged to increase their outreach to their network providers who provide d care for these high risk pregnant women. o Ongoing engagement of Georgias Title X Family Planning Program: Georgias 12 Title X Family Planning Program share d data on a quarterly basis with the P4HB evaluation team at Emory. o Ongoing collaborations with the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Georgia Department of Human Services Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS): These collaborations aim ed to further outreach to teens and young women who were uninsured and either paying out of pocket for family planning services/supplies or going without needed services. Our partnerships help ed us reach women in the local public health department clinics and the DFCS offices. Some of these efforts were reflected in the local meetings held by RSM workers across the state. o Develop and implement an interview/survey for the IPC enrollees: DCH worked with Emory to develop interview questions for the IPC enrollees that focus ed on: reproductive health/birth spacing; birth control methods and barriers to getting them; nutrition; chronic conditions; protection from infections; management of stressors and social issues; substance abuse; and dental health. These questions were included i n the 2013 surveys. 4. Using Existing Resources for Support and Coaching. The goal of this activity was to use current and available resources in Georgia to promote prenatal care, healthy lifestyles before and during pregnancy, and smoking cessation. DCH acc omplished this goal by contacting Georgias WIC program as well as POWERLINE, a telephone resource sponsored by Georgias Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies program, to inform them about the P4HB 13 program. DCH also included these resources on the P4HB program s website and in other marketing materials. CMO Supported Activities The CMOs individually developed their own client and provider education action plans related to P4HB. To date, the Georgia CMOs have posted information about the P4HB program on their respective websites efforts included: new member wel come calls to all newly enrolled P4HB members ; telephonic outreach to members with VLBW deliveries to educate them on the IPC program ; mailing of program materials (including contraceptive benefit information) to all new and existing P4HB members ; enhanced call scripting for call center staff to educate P4HB members on the importance of understanding their benefits and services ; home visits to outreach members unable to be reached by phone; distribution of a postcard to new members that emphasize d the impor tance of utilizing contraception and reporting such use on the member secure web portal ; on hold messaging to include information about types of contraception covered in the plan; quarterly incentives to members to encourage them to report birth control methods; hiring new Resource Mothers to conduct expanded IPC outreach and enrollment; and baby showers held with community members to educate them about P4HB. 14 The CMO s provider and community related outreach efforts included: telephonic outreach to provi ders to educate them on the P4HB program; local face to face outreach to community partners (DFCS, WIC, Health Departments, and Birthing centers); and collaboration with the March of Dimes for the Southeast region for outreach to NICU staff who would inter face with the Medicaid eligible women delivering infants who were subsequently admitted to the NICU. Major Changes in the Year In December 2011, DCH implemented a system to auto -enroll women who had delivered babies under the RSM eligibility criteria int o the FP only component of P4HB. These RSM women were automatically eligible for the family planning only component of the Demonstration . This system also began auto -enrolling 19 year olds as they aged out of the PeachCare for Kids\u00ae program - Georgias stand -alone CHIP program. RSM and PeachCare for Kids\u00ae women received a letter informing them about P4HB, their option to opt out of the program and their option to select a new CMO. If a new CMO was not chosen, the women would remain in the current CMO to receive their P4HB services. In April 2012, DCH began auto -enrollment of IPC eligible women. Each of the three CMOs provide d DCH quarterly data that reflect ed the women who ha d delivered a VLBW infant. Based on these monthly reports, DCH sen t a letter to each IPC-eligible woman informing her that she w ould be auto -enrolled in P4HB unless she opt ed out. Based on our 2012 statistics, this auto -enrollment process expanded knowledge of the P4HB program and increased enrollments as women did not need to submi t a new application for the 15 P4HB program but instead their enrollment into the P4HB program was considered to be a Continued Medicaid Determination. III. ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPATION In our first year report , we provided a summary of the P4HB enrollment process and the barriers to enrollmen t that could occur as well as the auto -enrollment process . We note that the auto - enrollment of P4HB family planning only enrollees continued throughout the second year and hence, affe cted the numbers and patterns seen in the data presented here in the Year 2 Annual Report . Enrollment Trends There was evidence of continued interest in the P4HB in the form of calls to the call center, enrollee applications and the number of women deemed eligible by RSM staff through the second year of the program. As shown in Chart 1, the number of women deemed eligible for the family planning only component of P4HB grew through the end of the 3rd quarter of 2012 and then leveled off at just below 40,000. Toward the end of PY2, ther e was a slight decline in women ages 18 -22 deemed eligible; the number deemed eligible in this age range peaked at almost 28,000 in the 3rd quarter and declined to a little over 26,000 in the 4th quarter 2012. The 16 only age group for which there was contin ued growth in numbers deemed eligible through the end of 2012 was the 23 -35 year old group. This group grew from 9,023 in the 1st quarter 2012 to 11,316 in the last quarter . The number of women deemed eligible for the IPC component of the Demonstratio n, as shown in Chart 2, grew markedly during the second year of P4HB and resulted in a total of 173 deemed eligible by the end of the second year. The great majority of these women were in the 23 -35 year old age group and their number s grew from 18 in the first quarter of 2012 to 120 by the end of the 4th quarter 2012. There were a total of 34 women in the 18 -22 year old age group and 19 in the oldest age group, deemed eligible for the IPC component of P4HB by the end of this second year. By the end of PY2, t he number of women actually enrolled in one of the CMOs to receive family planning only services (34,184) was less than the 39,889 deemed eligibile for th is component as depicted in Chart 3 by age group. The data in this chart are shown for two age groups which reflect a change in reporting made toward the end of the Demonstrations first program year . The original counts of women enrolled in the family planning and IPC 17 components were generated from ad hoc and member services reports. Toward the e nd of CY 2011, DCH staff created new report specifications for the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) so that it would accurately reflect the Demonstrations membership. The data contained in this new report was used for the fourth q uarter 2011 Demonstration Report and all four quarter ly reports for 2012 . As shown in Chart 3 , the patterns of enrollment indicate an upturn in the fourth quarter of 2011 that continued for the 21 -44 year old group through all of 2012. The steep increases in enrol lment for those in the 18-20 year old group continued through the 3rd quarter of 2012, peaking at 22,679 . Unfortunately, those increases were not sustained and an enrollment decline was evident by the end of the 4th quarter 2012 , with enrollment for this a ge group dropping to 19,831 . The gap between th e number of women deemed eligible and th e number enrolled in the family planning component of P4HB seen in the first year was narrowed markedly . This trend will be monitored during the third year of the Demon stration to see if it continues. We also note that the overall increase in enrollment during the second year of P4HB was driven in part by the auto-enrollment policy. Using a list of study IDs for women auto -enrolled in t he P4HB family planning only comp onent at some point during 2011 or 2012 , we found a total of 61% were auto - enrolled into the program during this time period . Given this high percentage, i f these enrollees 18 exhibit different behaviors regarding the use of family planning services or pregna ncy during their time enrolled , the overall patterns among family planning only enrollees in P4HB will be affected. We therefore provide some separate statistics for these women at certain points in the remainder of this report. Over 80% of the Demons tration participants deemed eligible for the IPC component were actually enrolled in a CMO by the end of 2012 (144 of 173 deemed eligible ) as we see in Chart 4 . All of the enrolled women were in the 21 -44 age range and the overall growth reflected the grow th in enrolled women in this age group. Some of this growth was due to auto -enrollment into the IPC component which was instituted as of April 1, 2012. This process involve d the CMO s reporting on very low birth weight deliveries to DCH who then worked wit h its enrollment broker to enroll these women into the IPC component of P4HB. Letters were also sent to the se women notifying them that they w ould be auto-enrolled once their pregnancy eligibility status end ed. The numbers enrolled in the Resource Mother s only component of the P4HB program totaled 77 by the end of PY2. Combined with the 144 women enrolled in the IPC component, there were 221 women who had delivered VLBW infants and were now receiving nurse case management 19 and Resource Mother services , in addition to the primary care and other IPC services, by the end of PY2. Participation Rates In order to fully assess the rate of enrollment that occurred in PY 2 for the P4HB program , we have to again consider the total numb er of women likely eligible for P4HB in the communities across Georgia. Since the program largely targeted women ages 18 -44 not otherwise insured and under 200% FPL, we used data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 20 11 to estimate the number of uninsured women in this age and income range in PY 2. While some of these uninsured women were eligible for traditional Medicaid in Georgia (and apparently not taking up these benefits) , they were only eligible for family planning only benefits under P4HB . This number excludes women who were non -citizens and hence, not eligible for the Demonstration . As shown belo w in Table 1 , we estimated that the P4HB program enrolled less than 3% of the total number of women estimated to be eligible and in the community based on income, age and c itizenship (256,979 from ACS ) in 2011 . The ACS data have been more readily available as the survey has grown in size and timeliness ; using data from its three year 2011 public use micro sample we estimate 279,308 uninsured women citizens in Georgia in the age and income group targeted by P4HB in 2012 . Using this as the denominator , we estimate around 12% of the eligible population was enrolled in the family planning only component of P4HB in PY 2. 20 Table 1 Enrollment of Population Eligible in the Commu nity Demonstration Group Enrolled in 4th Quarter Population Eligible in Community1,2 Percent Eligible Enrolled FP 1,522 14.5% 1Those eligible for family planning only benefits are uninsured female citizens ages 18 -44 with income < 200% FPL and residing in Georgia . The estimated number of uninsured women in this age and income range was estimated at 256,979 for 2010 and 279,308 for 2011 . 2Those eligible for IPC include uninsured women 18 -44 with income < 200% FPL residing in Georgia with a liveborn infant under 1500 grams at delivery. Women enrolled in RSM with a VLBW infant should be the denominator for this calculation . Those eligible for Resource Mother only include LIM and ABD Classes of Eligibility women with a VLBW infant . We combine the enrollment counts for IPC and Resource Mother for the numerator and use all Medicaid paid VLBW births (n = 1, 522 in Table 3 shown later ) as the denominator. We use th e 34,184 number enrolled as of the 4th quarter for consistency with the earlier parts of the report . 4 This denominator adjusts for women in need of family planning services based on a report from the Guttmacher In stitut e. Their estimate is that 54.5% of women in the age group 13 -44 were actually in need of family planning services. We multiplied the \"in the community \" population by .545 to get the 152,223 in row 3, column 3. See: http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/win/contraceptive -needs -2008.pdf . While th is family planning only participation rate is not as high as desired, it does show significant improvement in terms of outreach and enrol lment of eligible women as the percentage of eligible women enrolled quadrupled from around 3% to over 12% in this second year. When we consider th at only an estimated 54.5% of the eligible population may be in need of family planning services (sexually active, able to get pregnant, not currently pregnant or trying to get pregnant) the estimated percentage enrolled jumps to 22.5%. A caveat is that a larger percentage of these enrollees were auto -enrolled , as noted earlier. We also note that a large number of women in need of family planning continue to be served by the Title X program in Georgia and we report on changes seen in this program pre and post implementation of the P4HB program in terms of Medicaid coverage, rates of use of contraceptives and types of contraceptives used. We also estimate unduplicated counts of family planning visits in both Title 21 X and Medicaid in order to assess whether the P4HB program increased the use rates across the two programs as shown later. The P4HB program also en rolled a much larger percentage of women with a VLBW infant into the IPC and Resour ce Mother only components of the program. Of the total 1,522 births estimated to be in the VLBW category (see Table 1) in Year 2 , a total of 221 were enrolled in one of the se two components. This means almost 15% of these women were enrolled, up from only 1.6% in Year 1. While this is a m ajor improvement , there is still the need for intensive education and outreach to health care providers who care for or interface with w omen with a very low birth weight delivery (e.g., obstetrical care providers and nurses, neonatal care providers and nurses) a s well as significant efforts to keep the application process user-friendly and accessible in the community . IV. PROVIDER SURV EYS ROUNDS 1 -3 As part of the P4HB program the CMOs, in collaboration with the DCH, monitor ed member and provider overall knowledge and understanding of P4HB approximately bi -annually through an analysis of member and provider surveys. Analyses of these s urveys serve d to help the CMOs and DCH better understand and improve member and provider experiences with the P4HB program, as it is important to both the CMOs and DCH to identify any area that could negatively impact the satisfaction of their members and providers who participate in the program. We briefly describe the survey methods used by the CMOs below and include in Appendix B the full set of responses to the provider and member surveys in each round . As of the end of 2 012, the 22 member and provider sur veys ha d been administered in three waves -- in December 2011, April 2012, and September 2012 . The CMOs administered the first two waves of surveys to their members and providers then contracted with The Myers Group to administer the third and subsequent waves of the surveys. We note that the surveys continue to be affected by low response rates among both members and providers and that due to the lack of information regarding the rosters used by the CMOs and The Myers Group, we were not able to discern how many of the same members or providers were responding to the survey across all 3 wavers. To the extent the same enrollees respond with each wave, the answers may be biased toward longer term enrollees. We also note that the second through third wave s of the member surveys are affected by the large percentage of auto - enrolled members during the 2012 time period. We summarize here the key findings from these surveys for providers; we note that results for members were reported in the 2013 third Quarter ly Report to CMS . Summary of Provider Survey Results Rounds 1 -3 For each of the three waves of the survey administration, a total of 1140, 1140, and 1292 providers met the selection criteria for the survey; of those eligible, a total of 62, 104, and 31 participated in the survey for each of the three waves, respectively, for a participation rate of 5.4%, 9.1%, and 2.4% . The respondents to the health care provider survey represented the range of CMO affiliations (with providers being affiliated in most cases with multiple CMOs): 79%, 80%, and 94% respectively, were affiliated with Amerigroup for each of the three waves of the 23 survey; 81%, 82%, and 71% with fee-for-service Medicaid. Among the responding providers, the provider type varied across the surveys. The percentage of responding providers who were MD/DOs were 52%, 59%, and 90% respectively, for each of the three waves of the survey. For the first and second wave of the survey, respondents reported the following areas of specialization (with the option of selecting one or more specialty areas of practice): 22% and or primary care, 13% and 15% family planning, 11% and 8% pediatrics, 6% 4% practice, 5% and 4% internal medicine, 11% and 10% other. For survey waves 1 and 2, the majority of respondents reported they provided health care services in private practice (58% and 63%, respectively), but substantial percentages reported providing services in community health clinics or federally -qualified health centers (17% and 15%), public health departments (17% and 16%), or other settings (8% and 7%). The thir d wave of the survey did not ask providers about their provider type or site of practice. For each of the three waves of the survey, 81%, 83%, and 90% of the responding providers, respectively, indicated they were accepting new Medicaid patients; and 71%, 78%, and 84% indicated they were providing family planning or primary care services to women of reproductive age (ages 18 -44 years); however, only 61%, 64%, and 61% respectively, reported being aware of the Georgia P4HB program despite the CMOs sending the survey to those they believed to be participating providers. 24 Only the first and second waves of the survey asked providers about how they learned about the program. Of the 38 and 67 provider respondents, respectively, who were aware of the P4HB program, they reported learning of the program in the following ways: 42% and 45% mailings from the -mails meetings hosted by 24% from information initiated by DCH, 12% telephone calls with CMOs, 11% websites of the CMOs, and 8% and 7% patients asking about the program. Key findings of the provider survey are summarized below, according to major themes explored by the survey: Provider knowledge of eligibility criteria : For all three waves of the survey, fewer than half of all providers had correct knowledge about all of the eligibility criteria; From the first through the third waves of the survey, there were improvements in the percentages of providers correctly identifying the el igibility criteria of age between 18-44 years (from 40% to 45%), being a Georgia resident (from 42% to 48%), being a U.S. citizen (from 39% to 42%), not otherwise eligible for Medicaid or CHIP -Peach Care for Kids\u00ae (from 31% to 32%), and not otherwise covere d for family planning services (from 26% to 32%). Less than one -third of responding providers knew that the delivery of a VLB W infant since January 1, 2011, is an eligibility criterion for the IPC component with some improvement across the three waves of t he survey (24%, 21%, and 26% respectively). Provider knowledge of covered services : From the first through the third surveys, there were improvements in the percentages of providers with knowledge of all of the covered family planning services; 25 Provider k nowledge of covered interpregnancy care services was more variable across the three waves of the survey: o 19%, 16%, and 23%, , services; o 9%, 11%, and 6%, respectively, for management and follow -up of chronic conditions; o 8%, 9%, and 10%, respectively, for prescription medications for chronic conditions; o 5%, 5%, and 3%, respectively, for detoxification and outpatient rehabilitation; o 6%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, for limited dental services; o 16%, 14%, and 19%, respectively, f or nurse case management and resource mother outreach; o 8%, 6%, and 16%, respectively, for non -emergency transportation. Provider perception of barriers : From the first through the third surveys, the percentage of providers reporting perceived barriers t o client participation in the P4HB program increased: o 26%, 26%, and 35%, respectively, perceived lack of coverage of the full range of family planning services as a barrier; o 27%, 27%, and 39%, respectively, perceived lack of coverage of referrals or follow - up care; o 26%, 26%, and 26%, respectively, perceived lack of coverage of complications of family planning services. Provider information needs and preferences : Across the three waves of the survey, one -third to nearly two -thirds of providers reported a need for more information about enrollment eligibility criteria and covered services for the Family Planning and the Interpregnancy Care components; 26 The most favored routes of receipt of information according to the first two waves of the survey (the questio ns were not included in the third wave of the survey) were websites of the CMOs (100% and 9%, respectively), e -mails to the practice (34%, and 37%, respectively), and direct mailings (32% and 28%, respectively). V. DATA ON DELIVERIES AND INFANTS In this section we report on t he total counts of deliveries and infants by birth weight category as derived from the administrative claims/encounter data provided by DCH to Emory through its data sharing agreement . We begin with the data for CY2012 to refle ct the second year of the P4HB . As in our Year 1 Annual Report , we provide details of the methods in t he footnotes of the following tables on the s pecific billing codes found within the Medicaid claims data that were used to de fine deliveries (unduplicate d using the mothers ID) , to categorize them by liveborn, stillborn ( 22 weeks gestation) or fetal deaths (<22 weeks gestation) and to further categorize liveborn infants (unduplicated using the infants ID) according to the birth weight categorie s as found on the infants records. We have changed, as noted in our Execut ive Summary, the codes used in this process. Specifically, we use ICD -9 diagnosis codes predominantly through this process instead of DRG s as this coding was incomplete in the CMO encounters starting in 2011. Again, we are not able to capture informati on on the birth weight of all infants from the administrative records and hence, can only categorize the birth weight of those deliveries for which we had a linkage between the mother and infant ( provided by Truven Health Analytics ). 27 As the P4HB program and its evaluation has moved forward, the se administrative records have been linked to data from the D epartment of Public Healths (DPH) vital records unit for 2009 - 2011 and used to confirm birth weight and gestational age and will be used to obtain additi onal information on the mother (socio -demographics, evidence of chronic health conditions and complications of the pregnancy , smoking, etc .). We report on trends in births and birth weight for the 2009 -2011 time periods in later tables in this report. Counts of Deliveries and Costs 2012 The data in Table 2 below show that there were a total of 78, 190 Medicaid paid deliveries occurring in calendar year 201 2 based on the claims data ; we note that this count omits an additional 3,176 deliveries for which there was an indicator of private third party liability (including Medicare ) at time of delivery or the amount Medicaid paid was zero . Based on the count of deliveries paid fully by Medicaid , 69,643 of the total 78, 190 could be categorized as liveborn deli veries while 7,505 or 9. 6 % of the total were coded as fetal deaths of < 22 weeks gestation and 1,042 were coded as stillborn deliveries. The 69,6 43 liveborn deliveries paid fully by Medicaid were estimated to cost the Georgia Medicaid program a lmost $360 million with an average of $5,175 per delivery. 28 Table 2 Medicaid Deliveries for Calendar Year 2012 (CY2012) MEASURE Counts Total $ Paid Mother Average $ Paid Mother All Medicaid Deliveries1 Total Deliveries2 Liveborn deliveries Stillb orn deliveries Deliveries Liveborn deliveri es Stillborn deliveries (>= deliveries 4 deliveries Stillborn deliveries (>= 22 only5 Liveborn deliveries Stillborn deliveries (>= 22 weeks)1 Fetal deaths < 22 weeks1 664 562 12 90 561 11 90 1 1 0 0 2,989 973 6,609 1,729 0 0 0 0 1 Deliveries were defined as human conceptions ending in live birth, stillbirth (>= 22 weeks gestation), or fetal death (< 22 w eeks). Ectopic and molar pregnancies and induced termination s of pregnancy were NOT included. Deliveries of Live births were identified in the claims by using: ICD -9 diagnostic codes 640 -676 plus V27.x OR ICD-9 procedure codes 72, 73, or using ICD -9 code 656.4x (intrauterine fetal death >= 22 weeks OR specific V -codes [V27.1 (delivery singleton stillborn, V27.3 stillborn), V27.6 (delivery multiples, some stillborn), V27.7 (delivery multiples, all stillborn)]. Deliveries associated with Fetal deaths < 22 weeks were identified by using ICD -9 codes 632 (missed abortion) and 634.xx (spontaneous abortion). In the case of a twin or multiple gestations, the delivery was counted as a live birth delivery if ANY of the fetuses lived. Costs were accumulated over the pregnancy and attributed to the delivery event if there was a fetal death (632) that preceded a l ive birth. 2 This count of total deliveries omits those with $0 Medicaid dollars, private third party liability or Medicare coverage (n = 3,176). If these records were included the number of deliveries would be 81,366 with 72,340 liveborn deliveries, 1,1 05 stillbirths and 7,921 fetal deaths. 3 Family planning only participants were identified using Aid Eligibility Code = 181; all deliveries that occurred to these wom en were after their first three month s of continuous enrollment in the P4H B. Women who came into the program pregnant should not be counted and our methods for omitting them are described in the text . 4 IPC participants were identified using Aid Eligibility Code = 180. Only the deliveries and births to IPC women subsequent to their 3rd month of enrollment are reported in these tables . 5 Participants in the Demonstration with Resource Mother only benefits are LIM and ABD classes of eligibility with a delivery a nd VLBW birth weight infant in the year. They were identified using Aid Eligibility Codes 182 (LIM) and 183 (ABD). Only the deliveries and births to women with LIM and ABD classes of eligibility subsequent to their 3rd month of enrollment are reported . Because the great majority of infants receive their own Medicaid ID at birth, th e Medi caid amounts paid shown in Table 2 are largely representative of those expenses incurred for care of the mother at the time of the delivery hospitalization. In addition to the costs for the deliveries with liveborn infants, Georgia Medicaid incurred costs totaling just over $11 million for deliveries ending in fetal death or stillborn infants in CY2012. Since overall trends in fertility 29 affect the changes from Year 1 to Year 2, we report later on the trends in counts of births and average amounts paid by M edicaid over the full 2009 -2012 time period for which we have data. In the bottom portion of Table 2 , we show the counts and costs of any deliveries observed for women enrolled in the FP, IPC or Resource Mother only components of P4HB. Our first step in defining P4HB enrollees in this table was to identify the subset of women with a P4HB eligibility code who ha d three months of continuous enrollment in a CMO . The program staff assumed the member would have their family planning appointment within the firs t month of CMO enrollment and if the woman started on some form of contraception at the beginning of the second month, two months are allowed for the method to be come effective before any subsequent pregnancy is considered a failure - hence the required 90 days of continuous CMO enrollment. We also omitted women with an indication of a pregnancy using ICD and/or RSM eligibility codes in these first 3 months of CMO enrollment and those with a delivery < 245 days after enrollment in a CMO since they most like ly came into the CMO in a pregnant status. The number of pregnancies (1, 035) and birth outcomes (21 5) found in this process c an be seen as a failure of women to understand the program and/or failure of the delivery system to get the women in for pregnancy testing/services in a timely fashion. After making these omissions we have P4HB enrollees who we believe were not pregnant when they came in and for whom the CMO had 3 months to reach/serve. We then count pregnancies [ICD/RSM codes] in the 91st day forwa rd and any delivery outcome [fetal death/live birth/stillbirth] after the 245th day among these women as a failure of the program. The counts of outcomes for P4HB enrollees shown here and in later tables are to women enrolled 30 starting in January 2011 and running through October 2012; we stopped in October 2012 in order to allow for measurement of the 3 months of continuous enrollment. We note that any system of classification of pregnancies as occurring before or after P4HB enrollment that is based upon claims data could result in misclassification of the timing of occurrence of these pregnancies. We have attempted to minimize the potential for this misclassification by applying the above rules . Importantly, o nce the claims/enrollment data are linked to vital records we will have a measure of gestational age of the birth and fetal death events such that we can more accurately define whether the pregnancies were conceived before or after P4HB enrollment . By counting deliveries/births which occur for thes e women only after the 245 day cut -off, we allow for births with a short gestation ( ~5 months) after the first 90 days of enrollment but will also include births with a longer gestation that may have begun in the first 3 months of enrollment but for which there were no pregnancy or RSM codes seen in the data we used to make omissions . Using these methods, t here were an estimated 561 liveborn deliveries in 2012 to women in the FP only component of the P4HB with total costs of over $ 3.0 million . There were an additional 90 fetal deaths and 11 stillbirths among the women enrolled in this component of P4HB with Medicaid costs of about $ 130,000. These outcomes in the second year of the Demonstration could be seen as failures to prevent pregnancies and birth s among women enrolled since they are eligible for a wide range of family planning services and have been enrolled in a CMO continuously for 3 months . These women either decided to become pregnant or if wishing to avoid pregnancy, did not access and use birth control methods e ffectively. However, w e cannot discern from claims data whether or not pregnancies are intended. We discuss later in this report 31 how the birth rate observed here compares to that expected for women in the income range targeted by t he P4HB program and to those observed in other states family planning programs. Also shown in the bottom section of Table 2 are births to the IPC and Resource Mother only enrollees. We identified that IPC enrollees only had one live birth and one stillbirth during 2012 after th ree months of enrollment in the program. It is important to note that the live birth was of normal birth weight but the delivery costs were higher than average at $6,609. We note corrections to the counts reported in our Year 1 report are now possible with the additional claims run -out but will also be affected by the correct ion on data regarding the month of P4HB enrollment and updated eligibility files . We originally reported no liveborn deliveries or stillbirths observed f or the P4HB participants and a total of 6 fetal death deliverie s (< 22 weeks gestation) among women enrolled in the FP only component of P4HB in CY2011 . With the new version of extract ed claims/enrollment data we foun d no fetal deaths or live births amon g family planning enrollees in the program for three or more months. Counts of Infants and Costs 2012 In Table 3 below , we show the counts of infants identified with their own Medicaid ID s and categorized as a liv e birth or still birth . Note that the nu mber of liveborn infants (7 8,824) is far greater than the n umber of live born deliveries shown in Table 2 (69,643 ). This may be due to multiple gestations but also an apparent undercount of total deliveries in the 2012 claims data available at this time. T hese numbers will be updated in future reports as more claims data are made available . 32 Given our new methods of classifying infant birth weight (see footnotes to Table 3), all liveborn infants have been classified . Previously, we had not categorized those with a missing DRG code. Of the 78,824 live births , a total of 1, 522 or 1.9% were categorized as VLBW and 6,060 (1,522 plus 4,538) or 7.7% were categorized as LBW. We have noted that c laims data tend s to underestimate the percent age of LBW but overesti mate the percent age of VLBW within this group. We will not get a reliable measure of the distribution of birth weight until more years of data are linked to vital records. We report later on the birth weight distributions for 2009 -2011 where the data ha ve been linked. The data in Tabl e 3 indicate that the costs of all live births w ere approximately $306 million and averaged to $3,889 per infant (Column 5) . These costs are for the delivery hospitalization of the infant. We do see the anticipated patter n of higher costs for those infants born LBW or VLBW relative to those born normal weight . Average costs for infants of normal weight were estimated to be $ 1,750 (Column 5) while for those infants born LBW , costs were estimated at $1 1,651 . Very low birth weight i nfants born during 2012 had an average delivery hospital cost of $82,949 . The difference in cost s for VLBW or LBW versus normal birth weight infants illustrates the cost savings that could occur by lowering th e percentage of infants born VLBW . In Table 3, we also include data for the delivery costs of the mothers by the birth weight category of their infant for those mothers who could be linked to an infant (Truven Health Analytics). These data indicate that the delivery costs for the mother also follow the pattern of higher costs for LBW and VLBW infants at the delivery hospitalization ; the mothers costs at a delivery of a 33 normal birth weight baby were estimated at $5, 214 while the mothers costs at delivery of a VLBW delivery were estimated at $6,558 . Table 3 Infant Counts and Costs for Mother and Infant at the Delivery Hospitalization Calendar Year 2012 (CY2012) MEASURE Counts Average $ Paid Mother3 Total $ Paid Infant Delivery Hospitalization Average $ Paid Infant Delivery Hospitalizatio n All Medicaid Live births 1 VLBW were identified and further categorized according to infant birth weight as very low birth weight (VLBW) < 1500 gra ms, low birth weight (LBW) 1500 - 2499 grams, and normal birth weight >= 2500 grams). Birth weight categories for liveborn infants were then defined using ICD-9 codes in the encounter data as follows: VLBW (< grams): V21.3 that or V21.3 to weight 1500 249 grams ( grams): V21.3 that pertain to weight 2500 grams or not otherwise classified as VLBW, LBW or stillborn. 2 Stillborn infants V35.xx, 768.0, 768.1, or 779.9 . 3 Amounts paid for mothers at the time of delivery were summarized for all deliveries in Table 2 and are summarized here by birth weight of the infant for the subset of mothers (n =57,317 ) who could be linked to an infant based on the SSN of the head of the ho usehold. In Table 4, we provide the estimated costs to the Georgia Medicaid program of infan ts in their first year of life i n the program. These costs are counted beginning with the claim s and encounters for the first service dat e occurring after their delivery hospitalization discharge date in order to isolate the delivery ver sus first year of life costs. We can only analyze those 3 6,776 infants born in the first six months of 201 2 due to the lag in claims data. The estimate is extrapolated based on t he averages by birth weight category, applied to the infants born in the second half of the year based on their birth weight category and added to the actual total for those born in the first six months. As the costs are based on claims paid through June of 2013 , estimates may not be complete even for these infants. The total amount paid for infants regardless of their birth weight was estimated at $185.5 million. There w as very little change in the average per infant costs when we adjusted for their 34 disenrollment from Medicaid (due to death or other causes) . When total costs are estimated based only on the 35,412 of the 36,776 infants born in the first six months who were still alive and continuously enrolled through December 31, 2012 , it is $182 million . There is the expected pattern of higher first year of life costs for infants of lower birth weight ; costs for normal birth weight infants was estimated at $ 2,199 while costs for LBW infants was estimated at $ 3,710 and for VLBW infants, at $ 5,759 . These cost patterns by birth weight hold for those not disenrolled due to death/other reasons as shown in the last column .

Paid claims for infants born in CY2012 were complete through June of 2013; expenses paid aft er this date will not be counted in their first year costs. 4Costs for the full first year of the infant's life were only available for those infants born in the first six months of 2012 (and based on claims paid only through June 2013). We used the average costs for this cohort of infants born in the first part of 2012 (n = 36,776) to extrapolate to an annual estimate for CY 2012. 5 Costs for all infants born in the first six months of CY2012 are included only for those 35,412 alive and continuously enroll ed (data on enrollment were only available through Decem ber 31, 2012).

SERVICE USE IPC Service Use A key goal of the IPC component of the demonstration is to help these mothers maintain or improve their health by providing access to the expanded set of services noted earlier. The administrative data can be used to ascertain the types of conditions for which these women are seeking and receiving care under the P4HB program. Among the IPC component s participants, the claims data indicate that 157 of the 235 women enrolled (67%) utilized services . The number of encounters for s ervices by IPC component participants ranged from 1 to 70 with a mean of 6.8 encounters. Additionally, the claims data indicate that 61 of the 86 women enrolled (71%) in the Resource Mother only component of P4HB utilized services , with the number of encou nters ranging from 1 to 62 with a mean of 13.1encounters. The ICD -9 diagnosis codes that appear in the claims data for these members are summarized below, separately for the IPC and Resource Mother only participants. According to ICD -9 diagnostic codes within the Medicaid claims data, t he use of services by women enrolled in the IPC component reflected the receipt of care for preventive services , acute gynecologic conditions or other gynecologic testing , dental conditions, other acute co nditions, contra ceptive services, and chronic health conditions. Examples of preventive health care services received were routine well-woman and gynecologic exam ination s (10), routin e medical check -ups and other screenings (3), and vaccinations (3) . Among the most commo n services utilized were those for acute gynecologic conditions or gynecologic testing (65), including for pelvic inflammatory disease (1), cervicitis (1), vaginitis (12), abnormal Pap smear and cervical dysplasia (15), as well as screening for sexually tr ansmitted infections (3). Dental services that 36 were utilized included care for gingivitis or periodontitis (3) or other tooth infections (2). Services for care of acute conditions ( 132) were the most commonly utilized services. Examples of common acute co nditions for which care was sought include d respiratory tract infections and disorders (23), dysuria or urinary tract infection (18), abdominal pain (8), headache (6), and fatigue (5) . Contraceptive management services were received by 8 of the enrolled w omen . Table 5 below summarizes the specific ICD-9 codes reflecting chronic health conditions that were present in the Medicaid claims data for IPC and Resource Mother only participants.

It is important , as we move forward to further analysis , that we look over the full pre and post period of P4HB for which we now have claims data. It is also helpful to co mpare the information gained from the claims data regarding birth outcomes to that which we will eventually have from the linked Medicaid and vital records data. To this end, we provide a brief summary of the changes we are seeing in the numbers of delive ries and liveborn infants in the study years. As shown below (Table 6) , the number of Medicaid paid births wa s declining prior to the Demonstration , declining from 85,370 in 2009 to 81,463 in the two years prior (2009 -2010) and to a low of 75,087 in the fi rst year (2011) of the P4HB program . Birth counts increased again in 2012 to 78,824. Table 6 Number of Medicaid Paid Births by Year (2009 -2012) 2009 2010 2011 2012 Weight Category N Percent N Percent N Percent N Percent VLBW 1,718 2.0 1,650 2.0 50 0.1 Total 85,370 81,463 75,087 78,824 While these trends are consistent with the overall trends in the vital records data, the drop in 2011 is larger than seen in overall patterns and indicates perhaps an undercount of infants in the claims. In addition, the ratio of infants to deliveries was 1.05 and 1.06 in 2009 and 2010 , respectively, but drops to 1.01 in 2011, a further indication of undercounts of infants. This ratio 38 climbs to 1.10 in 2012, an indication of an under count of deliveries in 2012 as noted throughout the report . These issues will be kept in mind as the eva luation proceeds. Based on the claims data, the average paid amount for the infant s at delivery increased only slightly from $3, 274 in 2009 to $3,889 in 2012. Important to the evaluation of P4HB , we found that t he percentage of these infant records link ing to the vital records is similar in 2009 and 2010 at about 89% but decreased to 82% in 2011 . This is likely due to the lack of fetal death records at this time and this will be updated once th ose files are available. As shown in Table 7 below, we found that t he birth weight distribution using claims only is very close to that using the linked vital records for the percentage of very low birth weight at about 2% but differs from the vital records on the percentage low birth weight and hence, on the perc entage of normal birth weight . Table 7 Birth Weight Distribution (2009 -2011) 2009 2010 2011 Birth Certificate Weight Category Claims Weight Category % Birth Certificate Weight Category Claims Weight Category % Birth Certificate Weight Category Claims Weight Category both sources reflect a very stable percentage of Medicaid eligible VLBW infants, we will treat the vital records as the gold standard when measuring birth weight and work primarily with linked records when completing the final evaluation of P4HB. Averted Births . As opposed to earlier Section 1115 Family Planning waivers in other states, the P4HB program in Georgia has a budget neutrality requirement that is based on a shifting of the 39 birth weight distribution such that the total costs to the Medicaid program supported by the federal matching rate is lowered from what it would otherwise be by lowering th e percentage of all Medicaid births that are LBW and VLBW . Th is shifting of the distribution should occur from the increased use of family planning services by those brought into the family planning component of the Demonstration as well as from the manag ement of contraceptive use and health conditions that affect reproductive outcomes among those women in the IPC and Resource Mother only components of the Demonstration which should help lengthen their interpregnancy interval s. Additionally, the treatment of acute and management of chronic conditions of women enrolled in the IPC component should lead to better health of the women , and in turn better birth outcomes, if they become pregnant . While the count of averted births is therefore not central to th e calculation of budget neutrality on a quarterly or annual basis under P4HB , we present in Table 8 below an estimate of the number of births that would have been expected among participants in the family planning only component of the Demonstration . Based on the DCH Planning for Healthy Babies Concept Paper submitted to CMS in the application process, the fertility rate among women 18 -44, < 200% FPL and uninsured in the second year of the Demonstration was estimated at 169 per 1,000. If this expected fertility rate is applied to all women enrolled in the family planning and other program components by the end of PYs 1 and 2 (as reported from Georgias MMIS data shown above), expected births would be 5,814 in Year 2. 40 Table 8 An Estimate of Averted Bir ths Among P4HB Demonstration Population Number of Expected Births Among Participants1 Number of Deliveries/Live Births in 2012 to Participants2 Number of Averted Births 5,814 562 5,252 1Based on fertility rates from the concept paper developed in application process: http://dch.georgia.gov/sites/dch.georgia.gov/files/imported/vgn/images/portal/cit_1210/33/52/156793595PlanningforHealthyBabie sProgram121 709Final .pdf 2Reflects the count of all deliveries of a live born in all three components but includes only thos e counted based on the methods described earlier in the text. If stillbirth and fetal deaths to women in all three components of the program are count ed the total in 2012, would be 66 4. The number of actual births in Year 2 to participants fell far below that at 562. Averted births are then estimated at 5,252 in Year 2 which indicates potential savings to the state from a lower - than-expected birth rate among those enrolled. It is also helpful to compare the P4HB experience to that of other states with family planning waivers. In a study of six study states (Bronstein, Adams and Edwards , 2003 )4, states reported that births to participants in one to t wo years post the program implementation , ranged from a low of 11% (AR, SC) of the expected number of births to as high as 80% (NM). The 562 births in 20 12 among Demonstration participants in Georgia constitute about 10% of the number expected which puts the P4HB program well at the lower end of the other states experiences. Budget Neutrali ty. The budget neutrality requirement for Georgia s P4HB program, as noted, is based on the potential of the Demonstration to shift the birth weight distribution . Specifically, the budget neutrality spreadsheet requires that the total federal costs for all low and very low birth weight babies plus normal birth weight babies born to IPC enrollees in each Demonstration year must be less than the total federal costs for all low and very low birth weight babies in the base year for the P4HB program to be considered budget neutral . These measures will be derived 4 See Bronstein, J, Adams EK and J Edwards. Evaluation of Medicaid Family Planning Demonstrations . Final Report under CMS Contract # 752 -2-415921 completed by CNA Analysis and Solutions, Alexandria, VA, November, 2003. 41 for calendar years 2009 -2011 in the same manner as those rep orted here for 2012 and compared to the 2008 esti mates in our budget neutrality worksheet in our upcoming Quarterly Report . We anticipate that these cost data can be better used to gauge whether the Demonstration prevented enough unintended first births and through better management of the health of wome n with very low birth weight babies, prevent ed enough repeat births among this group, such that the distribution of all Medicaid births shifted away from the low and very low birth weight categories . However, we cannot attribute such an outcome to the Demo nstration until we review the CY2012 data in this way. Family Planning Service Use A key goal of the P4HB program is to increase access to family planning services for wome n in the income range targeted . In Georgia, the targeted income range was largely uninsured women > 25% FPL but < 200% FPL. In the absence of P4HB , women in th is income range could access family planning services free or on a sliding scale basis, at Title X clinics throughout the state . In Georgia , these clinics are largely public healt h departments and all of them are included in one or more of the Medicaid CMO networks . In order for the P4HB program to increase overall access and use of services , we need to observe that newly funded Medicaid services do not displace services otherwis e available and used at Title X clinics. Title X Analysis . As part of the evaluation, the team assembled data by quarter , on all visits to the Tit le X clinics in the state over the pre and post P4HB time periods shown in Table 9 below . 42 Table 9 Quarterly Data 2009 - 1st Quarter 2013 on Percentage of Uninsured Women in the Income Range Targeted by P4HB Using Any Birth Control and Type by WHO Tiers Use Rates of Family Planning Services at Title X Clinics from Q1 2009 to Q1 2013 Qtr Data are for Pre P4HB Qua rters Data are for Post P4HB Quarters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 BC After Visit - Any (N=464,645) % - Any - Not Using at Entr y (N=50,512) % Any 26.3 25.7 BC After Visit - WHO Tiers - Using at Entry ( N=414,133) % Tier 1 (High Effect) 9.7 9.9 8.7 8.1 9.2 9.6 9.2 8.5 9.0 9.7 9.9 9.5 10.1 9.9 10.1 9.4 10.2 % Tier 2 (Med 3 (Low Effect) 11.0 11.3 10.1 10.0 12.1 11.8 11.8 11.0 11.4 11.8 12.2 11.5 12.1 12.0 11.0 10.1 11.3 % No Method 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.4 BC After Visit - LARC - Using at Entry (N=414,133) % LARC 5.2 5.3 4.6 4.7 5.3 5.5 5.5 5.1 5.8 6.5 6.8 6.5 7.2 7.2 7.7 7.4 8.4 % Non of contraceptive effectiveness: Tier 1 (High eff ectiveness): implants, intrauterine devices, sterilization Tier 2 (Medium effectiveness): injec table method s, patch, pills, and vaginal ring Tier 3 and 4 (Low effectiveness): condoms, diaphragms, fertility awareness methods, spermicides Long -acting re versible contraceptive methods (LARC) are a subset of Tier 1 methods that are reversible and include implants and intrauterine devices. As the descriptive data in Table 9 indicate: Across all visits, the percent using any method after their visit is hig her in the latter quarters of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 , at 97 .4%, than all of the preceding quarters of the pre and post P4HB period shown in the data; There was also an increase in those visits where the woman entered as a non -user (those using no method) and left as a user of any method, but here too, the gains appear to be focused in the latter quarters of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 when the percentage of non-users at entry leaving with any method began to exceed 72%; and 43 Among those who were using a method of contraception before their visit, there is only slight indication of moving toward more effective methods (i.e., moving from a WHO Tier 3 or 4 to a Tier 1 or 2) but a strong indication of moving toward long -acting reversible contrac eptive methods, or LARC s (a subset of Tier 1 methods that are reversible). At the beginning of 2009 only 5.2% of the visits were for women using LARC s upon entry; in the last two quarters of 2012, this percentage exceeded 7% and in the first quarter of 20 13, equaled over 8%. While these patterns indicate increased use , they could also be a reflect ion of seasonal patterns and/or changes in the composition (age, race/ethnicity) of women seeking services at Title X clinics over this time period. To further t est for effects of P4HB , we used regression analysis , as summarized in Table 10, to control for womens characteristics . We tested for significant differences in the changes across the 17 quarters of data in the : 1) the probability more women reported Med icaid coverage; and 2) birth control use by type of method among wom en in the income range targeted (> 25% FPL and < 200% FPL) as the program matured . We controll ed for Age, Race, Ethnicity, English Proficiency, Family Size, Marital Status, Education Leve l, and Urban /Rural Status . The r esults are shown below in Table 10 ; if the P -value is < .05, this indicates a significant change across the 17 quarters . 44 Table 10 Changes in Insurance and Contraceptive Use at Title X Clinic s among Women Targeted by P4HB Quarterly Trends Quarterly Trends >25%, < 200% FPL1 P-value Mprobit Client Insurance Status Private No FP vs. Uninsured 0.0042 0.047 0.0038 -0.0009 0.116 Probit Birth Control After No Method 0.0051 <0.001 0.0049 0.001 Probit Birth Control After Visit Among Those Not Using at Entry Any Method vs. No Method 0.0158 <0.001 0.0153 <0.001 Mprobit Birth Control Type After Visit -Among Those Using At Entry Tier 1 (High Effect) vs. Tier 3/4 (Low Effect) -0.0050 <0.001 -0.0043 <0.001 Tier 2 (Medium Effect Effect) 0.0105 <0.001 0.0096 <0.001 Probit LARC After Visit - LARC vs. Non LARC 0.0014 <0.001 between 50% and 200% FPL (N=124,543) Insurance: Excludes those with Private -FP Coverage, Private -UK FP Coverage and Unknown Insurance Cont rolling For: Age, Race, Ethnicity, English Proficiency, Family Size, Marital Status, Education Level, Urban/Rural Status Sample: Includes only the last or most recent visit for each woman in the dataset Quarters: Q1-Q17 are being treating as a continuous v ariable in the model to capture time trends WHO Tiers of contraceptive effectiveness: Tier 1 (High effectiveness): implants, intrauterine devices, sterilization Tier 2 (Medium effectiveness): injectable methods, patch, pills, and vaginal ring Tier 3 and 4 (Low effectiveness): condoms, diaphragms, fertility awareness methods, spermicides Long -acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARC) are a subset of Tier 1 methods that are reversible and include implants and intrauterine devices Data from this analysi s show the following statistically significant (p < . 05) changes over the quarters : 45 There was a small increase in the number of Title X clients covered by private insurance that did not carry family planning coverage vs. being uninsured . In comparison, the re was no significant change in the number of women reporting Medicaid vs. uninsured . There was a small increase in the probability of using any method vs. no method after the visit among all women at these clinics and a significant increase in the probabi lity (1.53- 1.58 percentage points ) of using any method among those entering as non -users . There was an i ncrease in the use of medium vs. low effect birth control methods with a corresponding decrease in high vs. low effect birth control . Among the high eff ect methods, there was a small increase in the use of LARC s vs. non -LARC methods . We repeated this type of analysis using just a Pre/Post P4HB time indicator and found that only the movement toward LARC usage remained statistically significant. We also us ed women with household incomes < 25% FPL as a comparison group for those made newly eligible under P4HB and again, the only significant finding that remained was the increase in the use of LARC s vs. non -LARC methods. We will follow up with more analysis o f this type as more quarters of Title X data become available and explore methods for better defining t he treatment and control groups. Title X and Medicaid Analysis . While Title X providers are central to providing access to the women in the income range affected by the Demonstration , we need to examine the effects of the P4HB program on the use of family planning services through Title X, Medicaid and in the two programs together. To d o this we combined the visit data from the Medicaid claims with the non-Medicaid paid visits funded by Title X. The data in Table 11 shows the changes over the pre/post P4HB period in the percent of Medicaid enrolled women ages 18 -44 receiving any 46 family planning visit and in turn, the percent for which the visit/service ( drug claims are included) was for some form of birth control. As more of the Medicaid enrolled women are in the P4HB program we would anticipate these use rates to increase. The percentage of Medicaid women with any family planning visits increased from a bout 36% in 2010 to almost 40% in 2011 and remained close to that in 2012. The number of visits per enrolled woman was higher in 2012 than in 2009 but there was not a consistent upward trend in this or in the percentage with a visit/service for birth cont rol. In the next bank of data in Table 11, we see that visits paid by Title X for non-Medicaid enrolled women ages 18 -44, as a percentage of all women < 200% FPL in Georgia , followed a downward trend over the pre/post period while visits per woman increa sed only slightly. When the visits paid through Medicaid are added to those paid through Title X (omitting those Medicaid paid) visits , the percentage of women < 200% FPL in Georgia with a family planning visit in either program declined over this time pe riod. Hence, the growth in family planning visits within Medicaid was not sufficient when accompanied by insufficient growth in Title X family planning visits, to lead to an increasing percentage of use in the overall population of women with household i ncomes < 200% FPL in Georgia. 47 Table 11 Use of Family Planning and Birth Control Visits among Medicaid Enrolled, Title X Non -Medicaid Enrolled and Combined Usage, 2009 -2012 Use Among Medicaid Women Ages 18 - 44/All Medicaid Enrolled Use At Title X Clinics a mong non - Medicaid Enrolled Women Ages 18 - 44/All Women < 200%FPL Total Use (Title X Non Medicaid Plus Medicaid)/All Women < 200% FPL Any Family Planning Visit1 Mean Visits Per Woman Any Visit /Service for Birth Control1 Any Family Planning Visit2 Mean Visits Per Woman Any Visit /Service for Birth Control2 Any Family Planning Visit3 Any Denominator is all women ages 18 -44 enrolled in Medicaid during year. 2 Denominator is all women ages 18 -44, citizen, and < 200% FPL in Georgia during year. 3 Denominator is all women ages 18 -44, citizen, and < 200% FPL in Georgia during year; numerator is sum of use among Medicaid enrolled women and Title X non-Medicaid enrolled women ages 18 -44. Another way the system could affect the rates of unintended pregnancies and births is to move those women using some form of birth control toward the use of more effective methods. In Table 12 below , we show the composition of the birth control methods used with the Medicaid enrolled and the Title X, non -Medicaid enrolled user groups. Table 12 Composition of Contraceptive Use among Users in Medicaid and Title X Non -Medicaid Groups, 2009 -2012 Composition of Medicaid Birth Control Methods Used Composition of Title X (Non -Medicaid) Birth Control Methods Used Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3/4 LARC Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier Tier 1 (High effectiveness): implants, intrauterine devices, sterilization Tier 2 (Medium effectiveness): injectable methods, patch, pills, and vaginal ring Tier 3 and 4 (Low effectiveness): condoms, diaphragms, fertility a wareness methods, spermicides Long -acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARC) are a subset of Tier 1 methods that are reversible and include implants and intrauterine devices. 48 These data indicate a stable composition of usage across the four WHO tie rs within both the Medicaid and Title X, non -Medicaid enrolled groups. With respect to use of LARC methods , there was a decline among Medicaid enrolled women between 2009 -2010 that was reversed after the P4HB program was implemented leaving the percentag e of all users in Medicaid at 38.5% in 2012. Use of LARC s at Title X clinics steadily increased from about 6% in 2009 to 9.0% of all users in 2012. The increased use of LARC methods , especially near the end of PY2, may mean that the effects of the P4HB program on reductions in unintended pregnancies and births will be even more evident in the coming year s. Finally, in Table 13 below we show the same patterns of usage among the P4HB enrollees with the required three months of continuous enrollment ; here w e have combined women in all components (FP only, IPC and RM) of the Demonstration but provided separate data for those auto-enrolled versus not. Table 13 Use of Family Planning and Birth Control among P4HB Demonstration (FP only, IPC, and RM ) Participa nts, Auto -enrolled and Not Auto -Enrolled, 2011 -2012 Year Use Among P4HB Women Ages 18 -44 Composition of P4HB Birth Control Methods Used Any Family Planning Visit1 Mean Visits Per Woman Any Visit /Service for Birth Control1 Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 0.67 9.0% 43.0% 46.3% 10.7% 37.1% Auto - enrolled * * * * * * * Not Auto - Enrolled 30.4% 0.66 10.5% 40.5% 1Denominator is all women enrolled in aid category codes 180 -183 at least three months of continuous enrollment. *<5 family planning visits were found in the data for these women in 2011. Over all, we see the percentage of participants in the P4HB program who had any family planning visit remained stable at 30.1% in 2011 and 29.8 % in 2012 . The overall percentage with 49 a visit/service for birth control remain ed low at almost ~9% in 2011 and 2012. There is a marked difference , however, in the utilization patterns for those auto and not auto -enrolled. Whereas 20.2% of those auto -enrolled had any family planning visit in 2012 and 5.4% had a visit/service for birth control, the corresponding percentage s for those not auto -enrolled into P4HB were 44.8% with a family planning visit and 13.5% with a visit/service for birth control. Overall , from 35 - 37% of P4HB enrollees using a birth control method were using LARC s in 2011 and 2012. In 2012 this percent age was higher among those not auto -enrolled at 40.5% compared to approximately 27% among those auto -enrolled. VII. Births and Birth Outcomes a mong Waiver Participants In the following table we report on the number of deliveries inclusive of liveborn infants, still births and fetal deaths, in 2012 observed among Demonstration participants enrolled sometime in 2012 ; we also present counts of pregnancies for the women enrolled in PY2 through the first six months of 2013 as these claims data were available and are indic ative of outcomes for women enrolled during the second year of the Demonstration and likely to be paid by the Georgia Medicaid program . We again present data separately for the auto -enrolled an d not auto -enrolled women. It is important to again note that classification of deliveries/births occurring before or after enrollment in P4HB based upon claims data , from which accurate gestational dating of any pregnancy is not possible , could be subject to misclassification, particularly of those pregnancies that end at an early gestational age . In counting pregnancies among Demonstration participants 50 for presentation in Table 14 below, we again use pregnancy codes as well as an RSM aid eligibility code s as evidence of a new pregnancy among Demonstration participa nts. We also note that the denominator s for the percentage with a pregnancy or delivery in Table 14 include any woman who met our requirements ( three plus months of continuous enrollment, no pregnancy during that time, no l ive birth , stillbirth , or fetal death within 245 days of enrollment ) and enrolled in the family planning or IPC components sometime during 2011 and 2012. Table 14 Pregnancies and Deliveries to Unique P4HB Participants after their Enrollment in 2011 or 2012 by Auto - Enrollment Status Dem onstration Participants1 Number, % with Pregnancy after Enrollment in the Demonstration1 Number, % with Delivery in 2012 after Enrollment in the Demonstration1 Family Planning Only Enrollees N = 43,428 2,860 (6.6%) 662 (1.5%) IPC (7.3%) 2 (1.6%) Auto -Enrolled Demonstration Participants Family Plan ning Only Enrollees N =26,277 1,605 (6.1%) 178 (0.7%) IPC Enrollees N = 78 6 (7.7%) 0 Not Auto -Enrolled Family Planning Only Enrollees N =17,151 1,255 (7.3%) 484 (2.8%) IPC Enrol (6.7%) 2 (4.4%) 1 FP Only and IPC enrollment must start with at least 3 consecutive months to be included in this denominator. See earlier notes on methods used to count deliveries/births. As the data in Table 14 indicate , the percentage o f FP only enrollees with at least three months of consecutive enrollment that had evidence of a pregnancy after enrollment was 6.6% with the not auto-enrolled slightly higher (7. 3%) then the auto -enrolled (6.1%) . There is also a higher percentage of the n ot auto-enrolled group with a delivery in 2012 . The number of deliveries to these women equaled 484 or 2.8% of those not auto -enrolled while the 178 deliveries to the auto - enrolled e qualed only 0.7%. 51 While the number of total IPC enrollees is small, the data indicate 7.3% experienced a repeat pregnancy after enrollment and this was higher among the auto -enrolled versus not auto - enrolled. As noted earlier , two IPC participants experienced a repeat delivery. Both of these deliveries were among those wome n not auto -enrolled in the IPC component of P4HB . Participants vs . Non-Participants While we do observe births to FP only participants , their fertility rate is lower than the expected number from calculations in our Planning for Healthy Babies Concept Paper and indeed, may have been planned pregnancies and births with good outcomes. Since the P4HB participants who become pregnant are already enrolled in a Medicaid program they may detect their pregnancy earlier and gain access to timely and adequate pr enatal care whereas RSM women likely come into Medicaid from an uninsured status . One way to examine this possibility is to compare the birth outcomes of the Demonstration participants to other women with Medicaid paid births (RSM) during the same time pe riod. In Table 15 below, we compare out comes for Demonstration participants to RSM women with Medicaid paid live births during the same period and who were not enrolled in the P4HB program at any time. All classifications of outcomes (live birth, birth weight) are derived as in Table 3 and based on those delivery records that can be matched to an infant . We note that only 528 of the total 561 deliveries with live births to FP only participants matched to infants in the claims data . 52 Table 15 Infant Counts and Costs for Mother and Infant at the Delivery Hospitalization in 2011/2012, Waiver Demonstration Participants and Non -Participants MEASURE Counts and Percentage Average $ Paid Mother Total $ Paid Infant Delivery Hospitalization Average $ Paid Infant Delivery Hospitalization Family Planning Only Participants VLBW LBW birth weight for t he FP only participants is different from that of non - participants but in an unexpected direction. Whereas non -participants exhibit a rate of VLBW of 1.4% that is lower than the states average of ~2.0% , those participating in the FP only component of P4HB exhibit a higher percentage of infants with VLBW at 2.1%. The percentage of LBW infants among women in the Family Planning Only P4HB program, however, is lower at 4.5% compared to non-participants at 5.5%. The higher percentage of VLBW infants among P4HB participants may reflect a selection of women into P4HB who were at higher risk of poor birth outcomes . Under this assumption we would expect their expenses to be higher and on average they are for infants ($3,462 compared to $3,310). On the other hand both mother and infant costs at delivery are generally lower for women in the FP only component of the Demonstration than other RSM women and infants within the LBW category. Since there are differences in the characteristics of mothers in these two groups that affect birth outcomes, we estimate d the p robability of LBW and VLBW outcomes among these two groups, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, poverty level of county of residence and months enrolled in 53 Medicaid since January 2011 . We also control led for auto -enrollment. In preliminary results age, race and county poverty levels were all significant explanatory variables ; more work will be done to explain these patterns as participants can be observed over longer periods and more control variable s (e.g. smoking) can be brought into the analysis from vital records ; vital records will also provide the most accurate measure of birth weight category . We can also make a comparison of the IPC P4HB participants to other women in Medicaid giving birth to a VLBW infant during the same time period. In Table 16 below we present data on the number and percentage with a repeat pregnancy within 6 or 12 months and in turn , a repeat delivery within 12 months. We also report on the outcomes of the deliveries resul ting in a live birth. Table 16 Number and Percent of Women with VLBW Infant with Repeat Pregnancy and Deliveries within Six or Twelve Months, IPC Waiver Demonstration Participants and Non -Participants N Pregnant within 6 months Pregnant within 12 months Delivery within 12 months Delivery Outcome Birth Weight RSM random sample1 220 16 (7.3%) 30 (13.6%) (0.8%) Live Birth NBW 1Within 6 months or 12 months after Delivery in RSM plus 60 days. 2Within 6 months or 12 Months after Enrollment Start Date in IPC Component of Waiver using methods to identify deliveries/births as described for Table 2. 3The stillbirth to the IPC participant shown in Table 2 occurred after 12 months of enrol lment These data indicate that IPC women had lower repeat pregnancies within six months ( 5.7% vs. 7.3%) of enrollment in IPC than the women in a random sample of RSM mothers within six months of losing their Medicaid coverage. When a 12 month window is used IPC women again had lower rates of repeat pregnancies (7.3% vs . 13.6%) than the RSM (non -IPC) comparison group. Important to the goals of the P4HB program , the live birth to the IPC participant was 54 normal birth weight ; however, for the repeat birth s to the RSM (non -IPC) comparison group , one was normal birth weight and one was very low birth weight . Pre/Post Analysis of RSM Women With two years of data post the implementation of the Demonstration, we can now look at some measures for two years pre and two years post, the program s implementation . One outcome that could be affected by the P4HB program is the number of repeat pregnancies and deliveries among women with an index del ivery/birth paid by Medicaid (RSM) as more of these women are enroll ed in P4HB after a birth on Medicaid . In T able 17, we provide data on the percentage of RSM women who have a pregnancy/birth within six months and twelve months of the index birth that was paid by Medicaid. Births will be understated due to the lack of f ull run out of claims in 2013 and as noted earlier, we know that deliveries in 2012 are understated due apparently, to incomplete claims in the currently available extract of claims. Table 17 Percent of RSM Women with a Repeat Pregnancy/Birth Paid by M edicaid within Six/Twelve Months Pre and Post the Demonstration Number and Percent of RSM Delivering Mothers with Pregnancy within 6 Months Number and Percent of RSM Delivering Mothers with Pregnancy within 12 Months Number and Percent of RSM Delivering Mothers with Delivery within 12 Months Pre 2012 2,332 3.4% Not enough claims run -out Not enough claims run-out As the data in Table 17 indicate, the percentage of RSM women with a repeat pregnancy within six months ranges from 3.2% to 3.7 % during both the pre and post periods although slightly lower in 2012 (at 3.4%) than 2009 . Longer run out of claims data will help us assess whether the 55 percentages with repeat pregnancies and/or deliveries within the next 12 months changes in 2012 and multivariate analysis will help us assess whether these patterns are indicative of a n effect of the P4HB program itself . We will also complete sensitivity analysis by treating the first six months of 2011 as being in the pre period due to the slow roll out and take -up of P4HB benefits. VIII . CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The innovative P4HB program was implemented in the state of Georgia on January 1, 2011 with extensive efforts at both the DCH and local levels to market the benefits of this Demonstration . While the DCH used all available resources to make women and providers aware of the program across both the ur ban and rural areas of the state, the numbers expected to enroll in either the first or second year did not meet the expectation that half of those eligible would enroll . As shown in the data presented in this report , the percent enrolling in the FP compon ent by the end of the second year of the Demonstration was 12%, far lower than expectations and most other states experiences. However, we do find that the use of family planning services among Medicaid enrolled women has increased over the 2009 -2012 pre /post period and that those using some form of contraceptives from visits to Title X clinics and/or other Medicaid paid providers have shifted toward the use of highly effective, LARC contraceptive methods. This is important for the success of the program . By the third quarter of 201 1, DCH recognized the need to undertake efforts to increase enrollment and during the fourth quarter of CY2011 initiated auto -enrollment of all RSM women 56 whose Medicaid coverage was ending post -delivery as well as young women aging out of PeachCare for Kids\u00ae into the P4HB program . The effect of this effort was reflected in the sharp increase in enrollment at the beginning of CY 2012 and these increases did continue into CY 2012. As noted, declines were seen toward the end of CY 2012 and it may be that when it was time for recertification , these women did not follow through with this process . As noted i n this report , we found lower usage rates among those women auto-enrolled versus not auto -enrolled. Given the large numbers of auto -enrolled women , it is still important for the CMOs to ensure that the women who are auto-enrolled fully understand the benefits to which they are entitle d and that these services will still be available to them if they recertify their eligibility an d remain enrolled . Recommendations Given the growing number of uninsured women < 200% FPL in Georgia over our study period as seen in the data presented here, it is importan t for the state to consider an extension of the P4HB program beyond the schedu led end date of December 2013, in order to provide women in this income range a safety net for access to preventive and family planning services . Given the evidence that enrollment and service use in P4HB has increased; the Title X and Medicaid provider systems appear to be moving more women toward use of LARC methods; births to participants are lower than expected and savings are evident; and the program succeeded in preventing repeat VLBW births among the IPC enrollees, it appears the P4HB program is on track to move further toward its stated goals and objectives. Specific recommendations in this regard are: 57 1. The patterns seen near the end of this second year indicate the program may be reaching maturity in terms of sustainable levels of enrollment, use of effective family planning methods and management of women with VLBW infants. It is important for the state to strengthen these trends . 2. Continue to work with Title X as an active partner in the enrollment of eligible women into the P4HB program and as a provi der of family planning services to uninsured and under insured women who, if pregnant, are eligible for Medicaid coverage. A continued monitoring of the Title X quarterly data will inform DCH about the trends seen in the most recent quarters that i ndicate increased use of birth control methods and in turn, more use of LARC s. An added benefit of such a partnership is that these efforts can help Title X clinics leverage Medicaid funds to increase revenues and allow for use of Title X funding to fur ther expand outreach, access and provision of more effective methods of birth control. 3. Evaluate the continued role of auto -enrollment as a means of increasing participation in the P4HB program. 4. Work diligently to retain and enhance service utilization for those women who were auto - enrolled in the P4HB program through increased mailings, CMO outreach and dissemination of information regarding the ease of re -enroll ment and the wide array of preventive and family planning services available to enrollees at no cost. In this process, continue to outreach and train providers to as sess and help women develop and achieve a reproductive health plan while they are enrolled. 5. Continue working with the IPC enrollees to assure their use of all available services and in pa rticular the management of chronic conditions in addition to the family planning 58 services intended to help them prevent a repeat pregnancy or birth within a short time period. 6. Renew the marketing campaign for P4HB to target : media outlets (TV, radio) as w ell as social media (texts, Face Book , Twitter) and; eligible FP only enrollees as well as eligible IPC enrollees. Increas e the placement of advertising materials on radio stations and printed materials in human service and public transportation venues. Ma terials could include pamphlets and brochures to reach eligible but not yet enrolled women. 7. To help enrolled women understand the benefits of the program, as well as to educate women not yet enrolled about the preventive nature of the program , DCH might consider including a list of the covered services for each component of the program. Podcasts and videos on the DCH website are also options. In addition, listing the specific services on the back of the \"Pink\" and \"Purple\" cards which are sent to women on ce they are enrolled may help both enrolled women and their providers better understand the services they are eligible to receive. Education programs could also be completed with videos in the clinic setting. The large number of women co ming into P4HB alr eady pregnant indicates the preventive nature of the program is not well understood. 8. A provider component of this renewed marketing campaign might target a broad range of provider types (OBGYN, family physicians, nurse practitioners, Title X womens healt h coordinators, neonatal ICU providers and social workers ). This renewed marketing campaign should include clear information about eligibility , enrollment, and program benefits. 59 9. Explore opportunities to decrease the time between the eligibility determinat ion and actual CMO enrollment for P4HB. While most women who eventually come into a CMO for P4HB services do so within two months from the date of the eligibility determination, this is a time period when women do not have access to P4HB services so uninte nded pregnancies may occur. There were 1,043 pregnancies observed among women enrolled less than the three months required for inclusion in the full analysis. These can perhaps be seen as failures of women to understand the program and/or failure of the delivery system to get the women in for family planning counseling and services in a timely fashion . A-1 Appendix A: P4HB Communication Plan Communication Plan (Revised for Year 2) Phase Activities Status Phase 1: Educate Providers and CMOs Focuses on e ducating health care providers and CMOs about P4HB. These are the major stakeholders identified through the Communication Plan as having \"the most potential to positively influence and impact the behaviors of patients through preventative care measures.\" 1) Introducing a revised P4HB Communication Plan to the Work Group and the CMOs; 2) Develop a page on the DCH website for the P4HB program that provides specific information about the program, benefits, provider network, client eligibility and enrollment and program application; and 3) Introduce the P4HB program and program -related materials to the CMOs (including program logo, poster and postcards). 4) Added CMOs handbooks to the DCH P4HB website. 5) Update DCH P4HB website to include additional program information. 1) through 3). Completed initial education. Re - education is ongoing. Web page developed and updated as needed. CMOs utilizing program -related materials. Handbooks (#4) added to P4HB website in June 2012. P4HB website updated in June 2012 (#5). Phase 2: Le verage the Strengths & Assets of Partners Purpose is to use local experts to champion LBW prevention by encouraging eligible women in their respective communities to enroll in the P4HB program The Improving Birth Outcomes Work Group will identify local ex perts at the district level. Additional organizations and providers also identified as potential collaborators, including MCH staff, WIC staff, family practice providers, pediatricians, faith community leaders, nursing and medical schools, nurse midwives, health care professionals, OBGYNs, policymakers, media representatives, civic and cultural leaders, and tobacco program coordinators. Ongoing meetings with the Improving Birth Outcomes Work Group now held bi - monthly. Communication is ongoing with provide rs, MCH staff, pediatricians and public health staff. Outreach occurring via the RSM Outreach Project staff Phase 3: Implement Consumer -Based Outreach (Statewide and Locally) Purpose is to inform consumers and providers about P4HB using media, messagin g, and an organized set of communication activities 1) Introduce campaign to 18 public health districts 2) Outline marketing proposal and estimated costs 3) Determine overall budget and process in which marketing materials will be purchased 4) Buy billboards, radio a nd print ads. Advertisement will occur in 2 1) through 12). Completed. The RSM Outreach Project staff from the Department of Family and Children Services has been instrumental in our \"grassroot s\" outreach efforts within the 18 public health districts. A-2 Phase Activities Status phases over the course of the program, and counties with highest LBW rates will be targeted first for billboard ads. 5) Finalize copy for poster/postcard design 6) Replace postcard with brochure in summer 2011. 7) Obtain approval of printing cost for brochures, posters/postcards; obtain shipping addresses 8) Provide RSM, PH departments, and DFCS officials with notice that postcards/posters and brochures will be distributed and guidance about how to use them. 9) Draft/distribute press release announcing launch of P4HB program. 10) Pitch background sessions to identified reporters from the Atlanta Journal & Constitution. 11) Begin brainstorming a newsworthy event for Summer 2011 12) Other activities: theater ads, health fairs, participating i n cause -related charitable events, articles in provider organization newsletters; news releases, media advisories, op-eds, podcast messages placed on PH4B website, Face Book and Twitter pages. In addition, the Plan calls for media advisories, op -eds and co nducting \"background sessions\" with area reporters to discuss the states efforts to reduce its LBW rate. A-3 Phase Activities Status Phase 4: Use Existing Resources for Support and Coaching Goal is to use current available resources in Georgia to promote prenatal care, healthy lifestyles before and during pregnancy, and smoki ng cessation. Reach out to WIC staff and Georgia Quit Line team and inform them of P4HB and that P4HB will reference them on the P4HB website and possible future marketing materials. Completed. Phase 5: Annual Campaign Evaluation To analyze on an annual basis the strengths and weakness of the P4HB program. Four types of evaluation are suggested: 1) formative; 2) process; 3) outcome: and 4) Impact 1) Assess the strengths and weaknesses of campaign materials and strategies 2) Measure effort and the direct outpu ts of campaign 3) Examine the campaigns implementation and how the activities involved are working 4) Measure effect and changes that result from the campaign. (Assess outcomes in the target populations or communities that come about as a result of the campa igns strategies and activities; measure policy changes.) 5) Measure community -level changes that are achieved as a result of the campaigns aggregate effects on individuals behavior and the behaviors sustainability. Attempts to determine whether the camp aign caused the effects. 6) Make recommendations for Year 2 of the campaign based on data gained from the annual evaluation; implement necessary changes in Year 2 Ongoing. Emory University is assisting with the evaluation.
