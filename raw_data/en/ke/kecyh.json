Saving Katie: An unexpected emergency leads to wonderful care at the Webber Heart Center. A Letter from the President Dear friend, Every day I am inspired by your generosity and commitment to the patients of Munson Healthcare. In the past year alone, your support made it possible to provide individuals in northern Michigan with access to state-of-the-art health facilities, skilled physicians, life-saving equipment, and the resources they needed to face a health-related crisis close to home. As you page through the latest edition of our newly redesigned Focus newsletter, which showcases the work you made possible, please know you have made a world of difference not only in the lives of patients near and far, but in the lives of your family, friends, and neighbors in need of healthcare services. This past year and a half have presented challenges we never imagined, making your support more critical than ever before. Thank you for your continued commitment to the people of northern Michigan. With gratitude, Debra Henderson President MHC Foundations Contact Munson Healthcare Foundations: 231-213-1150 | foundation@mhc.net Funded by Philanthropy Munson Healthcare Cadillac Hospital Your generosity brought nuclear medicine to Cadillac Hospital, which enables visualization of organ and tissue structure through nuclear imaging.

You have made it possible for countless patients in the Manistee community to continue receiving expert emergency care close to home. Because when an emergency strikes, having nearby access to timely care is critical. Michelle VanVoorst, a Manistee community member, understands this better than most. On a Friday afternoon, Michelle received a text from her son, Colin, complaining of pain in his side and difficulty walking. She left work immediately and took him straight to the Manistee Hospital Emer - gency Department. It was there Colin received his diagnosis - appendicitis - and required immediate surgery. \"The team was organized, welcoming with professionalism, and fast!\" Michelle shared. \"From the moment we walked through the ER doors, until Colin was released the next afternoon, we encoun- tered nothing but helpful, calm, and caring people working for the hospital. I am very thankful that we have such a wonderful hospital in our back yard.\" The renovated Emergency Department will feature larger, more private exam rooms for patients like Colin, a redesigned layout with an improved traffic flow, and additional leading-edge diagnostic and monitoring equipment. Creating this healing, state-of-the-art environment for patients undergoing crisis would not be possible without you. Thank you for making this vision a reality! You Enhanced Emergency Care at Manistee Hospital The Munson Healthcare Manistee Hospital Emergency Department Renovation Campaign, which launched in 2019, aimed to address critical needs such as patient safety, privacy, and comfort, while delivering an enhanced patient experience from start to finish. Timeline of Manistee ED Campaign: $2.5 million project December 2019: $1M fundraising campaign kick-off September 2021: Campaign reaches $1M fundraising goal Renovation plans are currently underway; we look forward to sharing updates with you soon! 226 donors supported this campaign (nearly 1,000 gifts total). 3 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUSHonoring a Legacy Through Philanthropy The Albrecht family felt a special calling to support the Emergency Department renovation. Donating offered a way for their family to honor their late brother, Donald J. Albrecht, MD, who served as director of the West Shore Medical Emergency Department from 1993 to 2009. Today, Don's family is carrying on his legacy and dedication to healthcare in the Manistee community with a gift from the heart. \"I loved my brother, and I am honored to be able to contribute to his name. Medicine was so important to him; it was his life. He loved what he did and was a very good doctor. Don was good with patients, attentive to detail, and loved talking to people. I think that was his strong suit - that he saw the person, not just the illness. \" - Suzanne Albrecht, MD, sister of Don Albrecht Together with Suzanne's sisters Christine, Dorothy, Joanne, Camille, Carolyn, and Don's widow, Barb, the family raised $25,000 to sup- port the renovation of the Emergency Department. The department, which hasn't been renovated since the nineties, now sees approximately 15,000 patients every year. \"Enhancing the Emergency Department is so critical as technology has changed and the community has expanded,\" added Suzanne. \"The Emergency Department is a main entry point and it's important for the community to have an up-to-date and technologically-con- nected Emergency Room.\" You Enhanced Emergency Care at Manistee Hospital - Continued Top photo: Don spends time with is nephews. Bottom photo: Don poses for a photo with his wife, Barb, while on vacation. 4 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUSA Family Calling Don's parents, a physician and a registered nurse, were first-gener - ation Americans and emphasized the importance of education to their seven children from a young age. \"When we were little, my grandmother - who was a seamstress - cut down my father's lab coats that said 'Dr. Albrecht' on them,\" recalled Suzanne. \"One Christmas all of us lined up with our little doctors' bags, glasses, and 'Dr. Albrecht' [sewn] on our coats. We grew up playing doctor, and four of us went on to become physicians.\" Don went on to become the first board certified emergency room physician at West Shore Medical Emergency Department, and later the medical director. He was influential in the development of local emergency services and played a key role in the construction of the first EMS building in Manistee, which was later named after him. \"Prior to the building's construction, there was no garage for the am- bulances,\" said Suzanne. \"Snow and ice had to be removed before first responders could answer a call. This made a huge difference that ambulances could respond faster to community needs.\" Two of Don's sisters went on to become Chief Medical Officers both nationally and internationally, with one beginning a clinic in Africa focused on nursing education. Suzanne herself went on to become a psychiatrist, with time spent practicing at Munson Medical Center in Traverse City. Carrying on Don's Legacy \"Don was a very playful person. He loved what he did. He was passionate about good, quality medical care, and very passionate about building the Emergency Department.\" Outside of medicine, Don's talents included photography, gardening, cooking, juggling, and spending time with his family, nieces, and nephews. \"It brings tears to my eyes to honor him this way,\" said Suzanne. \"He was so committed to developing and maintaining the Emergen- cy Department - it was his life. We're honoring our brother, we're staying connected to him in our own way, and seeing his legacy live on.\" Why We Give Paul and Katy O'Hara Rady heard the Manistee Hospital Emergency Department campaign was nearing its fundraising goal and knew they wanted to help. The couple made the final gift to bring the total raised for this campaign to $1 million. When asked why they chose to support this project, they shared the following: \"The O'Hara family has been visiting the Emergency Department in Manistee for over 50 years. Though we are not full-time residents of the area, we have always benefited from the impeccable level of care and the kind and thoughtful treatment from the staff at West Shore - now Munson Healthcare Manistee Hospital. We have witnessed the area grow and change and we are so grateful to support these well- deserved improvements. \" To view a full list of individuals who contributed to this campaign, scan the QR code. 5 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUSA healing environment with coordinated cancer care under one roof: this was the vision of the Cowell Family Cancer Center, which your generosity brought to life on April 16, 2016. This $45 million facility serves as the \"Hub\" of cancer care across Munson Healthcare. Nearly 2,500 donors contributed $18.5 million to the project, including a $5 million lead gift from Traverse City resident and businessman Casey Cowell. \"Much more than a place for treatment, Cowell Family Cancer Center is a positive institution in our community,\" Cowell said. \"A key metric for me is the obvious sense of pride and commitment that everyone there displays. From volunteer greeters in our lobby to our most highly trained oncologists. It's contagious, inspiring, and never lets up.\" Celebrating Years of Cancer Care CFCC Ribbon-cutting ceremony held April 16, 2016 Five years later, you have touched the lives of thousands of patients through state-of-the-art coordinated cancer care in northern Michigan. Here are a few things your generosity has accomplished in the last five years: Regional Cancer Network by the Numbers 986 patients received help from the Cancer Patient Needs Fund $1.6 million+ raised to support patient needs, programs, services, and research 9,130+ northern Michigan cancer survivors 71,566+ total radiation treatments at CFCC 324,900+ new infusion services patients treated 103 total infusion chairs 197 oncology staff members and 30 oncology providers 83,000 square feet Services 27 northern Michigan counties 2,500 donors $18.5 million contributed to the project 6 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUS Nurse Celebrates 50 Years in Charlevoix You might recognize Mary Terryberry, RN, from Munson Healthcare Charlevoix Hospital's Maternal/Newborn Department. Mary is celebrating an exciting work anniversary this year: 50 years of nursing at Charlevoix Hospital! Mary, who is the manager of Charlevoix Hospital's Maternal/Newborn Department, has helped introduce dozens of local residents into the world over the years. \"Being with a new baby is such an emotional feeling. It is just such a privilege to work with patients during this time in their life, \" said Mary . \"Even after 50 years, being in a delivery still feels like 'this is the greatest' in being able to share the experience with them. Her commitment to patients is shown not only in her years of service, but also through charitable giving. Mary, who has been a donor to Charlevoix Hospital since 1991, has witnessed philanthropy in action. \"When I first started, the OB department was not much of a department. Just being part of developing this department into what it is today and it being a place where people want to come and have their babies is rewarding.\" Central Fetal Monitoring System You provided vital monitoring for every birth at Charlevoix Hospital. The central fetal monitoring system assists in overseeing both the mother and baby's vitals in real time through digital transmission during labor, delivery, and recovery. \"We are grateful for your support on this project!\" Mary shared. \"The fetal link enables digital transmission from the monitor into the electronic patient record, which reduces the risk of lost or faded monitor strips and charting for our staff. Physicians also can view monitor strips from anywhere, improving response time and care for mothers and babies\" Spotlight on Employee Giving Munson Healthcare Charlevoix Hospital nurse, Mary Terryberry, RN.

Support from donors like you and Mary make it possible to provide the best possible care experience for new and expecting families at Charlevoix Hospital.

Your charitable support ensured the vital detection babies need for testing or treatment before leaving the hospital. 7 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUSJune 27, 2021, began as a normal day for Katie Eicher. She went to church with her husband, Alex, and mother, Mary, then went to her job as an occupational therapist. Fifteen minutes into her shift, Katie went into cardiac arrest and was taken by ambulance to Munson Medical Center. She spent the following 12 days receiving treatment at the Webber Heart Center, five of which were spent in a medically induced coma. Thanks to your generosity, Katie had access to the innovative tech- nology, state-of-the-art facilities, and the skilled healthcare provid- ers she needed to recover. Katie's physicians used Artic Sun technology, brought to Munson Medical Center in 2019 by donor support, to cool her body and slow bodily function. This allowed her brain to focus on healing and reduce possible brain injury after the sudden cardiac arrest. Staying Together Mike Adkins, Katie's father, credits Katie's positive experience as a patient to her dedicated healthcare team: \"The doctors and nursing staff were comforting, supportive, and helpful,\" he shared. \"They answered a lot of the questions about what they were doing, what the process was, [and] explained the cooling and what it did. They understood what we were going through and allowed us to be with Katie. That really was important to us, just being together with her.\" During Katie's hospitalization, her family stayed at Munson Manor Hospitality House on Munson Medical Center's campus. \"It was nice to come and go as needed, and that we were only min- utes away,\" explained Mary Adkins, Katie's mother. Along with support from family, staff at the Webber Heart Center were with Katie during every step of her recovery. From sharing encouragement during difficult procedures to ensuring Katie and her husband could watch the 4th of July fireworks from her hospital floor, Katie's care team always had her best interests in mind. On the Road to Recovery After finishing inpatient rehabilitation at Munson Medical Center, Katie was strong enough to return home. Today, she continues Saving Katie Katie poses for a photo with her husband, Alex, and parents, Mike and Mary. 8 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUS rehabilitation with Mary Free Bed at Munson Healthcare, a unique rehabilitation partnership for patients in Traverse City. Katie's doctors have continued to monitor her progress and also helped refer her to various specialists for additional genetic testing and treatment. \"If I could say one thing to the doctors, nurses and staff who cared for me, I would say thank you so much for all the support and wonderful care over the last few months, \" said Katie. To honor the team that saved Katie's life, and to pay it forward for future patients and families, the Adkins donated to the Webber Heart Center. \"I really think it was a miracle that Katie recovered so well,\" ex- pressed Mike. \"The excellent care the staff provided, the decision making, and the technology that was available - like the cooling blanket - made all the difference. Thank you for saving Katie.\" Remembering Wayne Webber Michigan philanthropist Wayne Webber passed away in August of 2021. Presiding over The Wayne and Joan Webber Foundation, Wayne was critical in supporting endeavors in healthcare, education, and more. In June of 2013, the Webbers donated $8 million to Munson Med- ical Center's heart center, later named the Webber Heart Center. This gift is the largest single donation in the hospital's history and allowed for the expansion of programs and technology. \"We've always tried to help people,\" Wayne had shared previously. \"In my retirement, we've directed our attention to philanthropy. It's something I was taught by my parents. You were taught to take care of people.\" Scan the code to learn more.

Chris first joined Munson Healthcare in 2013 as the vice president of professional and ancillary services, eventually serving as interim president of Otsego Memorial Hospital beginning in May 2021. We asked Chris a few questions to help you get to know him better. Tell us about your career background. I was raised in southwest Wisconsin in a rural community. I received my Bachelors in Community Health Education and started my career in patient education at Olmstead Medical Center in Rochester, MN. I subsequently attended graduate school and received both an MBA and an MHA from the University of Iowa, leading me down a progressive leadership pathway over the last 17 years to my existing position. What inspired you to pursue a career in healthcare? An injury in my youth that required multiple surgeries and extensive rehabilitation exposed me to a host of inpatient and outpatient care settings and the wonderful personnel that helped me navigate the period of my life. It was an eye-opening introduction to healthcare that shaped who I am, today.What are you most excited to accomplish as you settle into your new role? Connecting with staff, providers, and the community to clarify their respective needs and understand how we mutually grow as an or - ganization. Primary care access and availability of specialty care are both critical to keeping care close to home across our service area. What have you been focused on so far? Primarily communication as we navigate the pandemic and work on service delivery in a safe manner for all involved. What do you see as the biggest challenges and opportunities for Otsego Memorial Hos- pital? Recruitment and retention across all disciplines at all levels of the organization. Acknowledging the hard work we've continued to do while focusing on how we continue to move forward as an organiza- tion. What hobbies do you enjoy pursuing in your free time? Hiking, biking, snowshoeing, skiing, ice fishing; pretty much anything outdoors and taking advantage of each seasonal change. I spend the majority of my free time with my spouse (Erica) and two girls (Adeline and Sophia) exploring northern Michigan.Getting to Know Chris Squire Chris Squire Community President Munson Healthcare Otsego Memorial Hospital 10 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUS 7th Annual Hospice Breakfast This virtual event held on May 12, 2021, celebrated the important work of Munson Healthcare Hospice and the patients and families served.

I went to the Paul Oliver Emergency Room last year and was diagnosed with pneumonia. To my surprise, I was asked if I preferred going to Munson in Traverse City or staying at Paul Oliver. Of course, I said I would prefer to stay in Frankfort, as long as I could get the same quality of care. The care there was incredible. I was so pleased to be able to be treated in Frankfort and not have to go to Traverse City. So I'm passing the word in case someone else needs to make that choice in the future. I'm sure you would receive the same great care. - Joyce KirshnerDid you, or someone you know, receive great care at a Munson Healthcare facility?
