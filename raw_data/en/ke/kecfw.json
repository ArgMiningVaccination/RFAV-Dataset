Anthroposophic Medicine \"If the doctor can become aware that every illness is a threshold experience, an unconscious encounter with the \"Guardian of the Threshold,\" then a completely new view of not just illness and health but also the relation between soul-spiritual and physiological-physical processes arises. The doctor has the task of \"raising up\" every unhealthy physiological process into the light of the spirit as he comprehends the illness. Meanwhile the patient, through the insight that something is now at work in his body which he had not been able to maintain in the region of his spiritual light through his own strength, can become aware of concrete indications for his development. Through this perspective he can contribute to his own healing in a meditative way. In addition to external measures to prevent illness he can gain access to inner meditative instruments \" Ruldolph Steiner 100 years ago Rudolph Steiner (known for the creation and development of Waldorf schools, biodynamic farming, and anthroposophy) developed an integrative medical system that considers humans in relationship to their environment and rethinks illness and disease. Today, Anthroposophic medicine is practiced in 80 countries world wide and integrates the spiritual dimension to the natural science of medicine. In a complete system of care, Doctors, Nurse Practitioners/Physician's Assistants, Nurses, and therapists work together to treat everything from general family medicine to specialized pediatrics to acute and chronic management of disease. In seeing illness as the path to development, the intention is to strengthen the physical, emotional, spiritual, and social aspects of the human in order to treat the disease. By making illness and healing personal, we invite an innovative perspective into the practice of medicine; AM practitioners look to the pt to involve their own resources for healing. They consider how the emotional spiritual impulses the human encounters affect their physical wellness and how their physical wellness influences their emotional and spiritual wellbeing. Therapeutic Modalities Homeopathic Preparations An aray of natural remedies have been made available by 3 anthroposophic pharmacies. Homeopathic preparations of mineral, plant, and animal substances may be prescribed in the form of pellets, liquid tincture, subcutaneous injections, creams, and gels. Anthroposophic Nursing Supports medical therapies by offering hands-on therapies that include compresses, full immersion, and foot baths as well as rhythmic massage called Einreibung. Eurythmy Considered by many to be a movement therapy, Eurythmy was actually developed in 1912 as a form of artistic expression. Shortly after, it was found to support healthy development in children and eventually was used in conjunction with anthroposophic medicine to address imbalances in the human that are known to be the root of illness.
