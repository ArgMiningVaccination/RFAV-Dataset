A good patient-doctor relationship is the basis for being able to look at, listen to and help a sick person. Anthroposophic Medicine understands the human being to be a physical, ensouled and spiritual being, and bases diagnostics and therapy on this comprehensive understanding. The following therapeutic methods are used in Anthroposophic Medicine: medicines, nursing and external applications, body therapy, eurythmy therapy, art therapy and psychotherapy. The task of Anthroposophic Pharmacy is to go beyond the view of medicinal substances as just dead material and pay attention to their formative processes and potentials. Anthroposophic medical research is carried out in institutions worldwide and uses established methods that follow general guidelines or develops new methods. Basic concepts of illness and recovery, the patient-doctor relationship and ethical decision-making all depend on the doctor's view of the human being. For both patients and therapists, Anthroposophic Medicine combines inner development with the healing process. We can only meet patients competently if we have relationship skills and ethical-spiritual competence, as well as professional competence. We outline 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine, from its founding in 1920 to the present day. "}
