In order to keep your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being in tiptop shape, it's vital to study how your body functions and how you can provide its systems with what they need to function at optimum capacity. Naturopathic doctors treat the body in its entirety and focus on enhancing physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. Dr. Maura Henninger - Naturopathic Doctor Philadelphia There is a growing interest in naturopathic medicine and the various holistic treatments that it offers. Naturopathic medicine is based on the belief that the body has the ability to heal itself. This type of medicine focuses on treating the whole person, rather than just the symptoms of a disease. Naturopathic medicine also looks at the lifestyle and environmental factors that may be contributing to a person's health condition. Naturopathic treatment is typically low-risk, as it does not involve the use of synthetic drugs. Naturopathic medicine is a holistic approach to healthcare. It is primarily concerned with prevention, as opposed to treating disease once it occurs. Naturopaths treat the whole person, and look at factors such as diet, stress, lifestyle and environment in order to achieve optimal health. Naturopathic treatments aim to stimulate the body's own healing mechanisms, so as to maintain wellness, and prevent disease from occurring. This is accomplished through the use of natural therapies such as botanical medicines, homeopathy, and lifestyle counseling.
