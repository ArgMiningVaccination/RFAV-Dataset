The survey holds importance at a time when questions are being raised on both the safety and efficacy of the vaccines being developed at a phenomenal rate as the world struggles to find a silver bullet to end its pandemic woes. The big question is, how many Indians are ready to take the vaccine?

With the news, the aggregate percentage of citizens in India hesitant about the vaccine reduced by 2 percent to 59 percent in the survey conducted from November 23-28. Citizens' reluctance to get the COVID-19 vaccine was compared with previously conducted surveys on the subject to understand the change over time. In the aftermath of several developments in place and the possibility of an affordable vaccine by February 2021, LocalCircles decided to conduct another survey on the subject to understand if citizen's hesitancy levels have reduced, increased, or been maintained. The survey received more than 18,000 responses from citizens across 242 districts of India. Sixty-six percent of respondents were men, and 34 percent were women. Fifty-five percent of respondents were from tier 1, 26 percent from tier 2, and 19 percent were from tier 3, 4, and rural districts. The first question on willingness to take the vaccine received 9,458 responses from citizens. Of whom, four percent said, \"I am a healthcare worker and will get it on priority through the Government,\" while 27 percent said, \"Will wait 3-6 months after it comes to get it\". Fifteen percent of respondents said that they would wait for 6-12 months after it comes, whereas eight percent said that they would take it in 2022 and six percent said that they would not take it at all. However, five percent said that they would take it as quickly as it is available via private healthcare channels, 22 percent said that they would take it once it is available via any healthcare channels, and 13 percent were not sure about taking it or not. The aggregate percentage of responses indicated that 69 percent of Indians still will not rush to take the vaccine even if it is available in the near future. The percentage of citizens hesitant was 61 percent in October, dropped to 59 percent in November, and rose to 69 percent in December 2020. From the discussion, it appears some of the key reasons for citizens to become hesitant are limited information about side-effects, efficacy levels, and a growing belief in parts of the population that Covid-19 cannot infect them because of their high immunity levels. As many as eight Covid vaccine candidates are under different stages of clinical trials, which could be ready for authorization in the near future, including three indigenous vaccines. It includes AstraZeneca and Oxford university developed, and Serum Institute of India manufactured Covishield, Covaxin by Bharat Biotech ZyCoV-D candidate Sputnik-V, NVX-CoV2373 by SII, HGCO19 by Geneva, and two unlabeled vaccines-Recombinant Protein Antigen based vaccine by Biological E Limited-and Inactivated rabies vector platform by Bharat Biotech.
