In 2009, the Institute of Medi-cine (\"IOM\") called for changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule.19 The IOM recommended replacing the Privacy Rule with an unspecified \"new approach\" for regulating privacy and access to data for use in health research.20 HHS recently published an advance notice of pro-posed rulemaking (\"ANPRM\"),21 which called for changes to the Common Rule but offered few specifics, instead posing seventy-four broad questions for public comment.22 Rather than reforming the regulations, other proposals seek legis-lation to clarify data ownership.23 Ownership of the data held in ad- gy for Economic and Clinical Health Act, 75 Fed.

Patient data ownership advocates often ground their posi-tion in the claim that privacy is a state in which patients exercise full control over their own health information. See Peel, supra (framing privacy as \"control of personal information\" and \"consumer control over [personal health information]\"). Patients want assured access to the data about themselves that are maintained or stored by others. See Richard H. Thaler, Show Us the Data. (It's Ours, After All.), N.Y.

Another desired aspect of privacy is for patients to be able to control others' access to and use of the patients' data). See A Declaration of Health Data Rights, HEALTHDATARIGHTS.ORG, http://www.healthdatarights.org (last visited Dec. 21, 2011) (advocating a \"self-evident and inalienable\" entitlement not only to \"[h]ave the right to our own health data\" but also to \"have the right to share our health data with others as we see fit\"). 74 Harvard Journal of Law & Technology [Vol. 25 research.27 Still others call for public (governmental) ownership to enhance researchers' access to data.28 While differing in details, data propertization proposals seem to agree that property rights in data are important and that clarifying them should be high on the legislative agenda.29 Ominously, this view is starting to infect policymakers,30 raising a real risk that what began as an abstract scholarly debate may end in ill-advised legislation. The urge to propertize health data needs to be weighed skeptically and with a clear understanding of how property rights actually work. If pursued, data ownership may disappoint many of its proponents because of a surprising truth: the framework of patient entitlements and protections afforded by the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Com-mon Rule is strikingly similar to what patients would enjoy if they owned their data.31 Part II challenges the claim that private data own-ership would improve privacy protection. It finds that both regimes \u2014 patient ownership of data, on the one hand, and the federal regulatory protections, on the other \u2014 provide pliability-rule protection32 that strikes a balance between patient control and the public's need for data access. Both regimes allow some unconsented uses of patients' 27. See Hall, supra note 23, at 651; see also Mark A. Hall & Kevin A. Schulman, Own-ership of Medical Information, 301 JAMA 1282, 1283-84 (2009) (discussing advantages of patient-controlled longitudinal health records and suggesting that one way to foster the development of such records would be to \"give patients the rights to sell access to their records, rights that are superior to the property rights held by [entities that currently hold patients' data]\"). 28. See Marc A. Rodwin, The Case for Public Ownership of Patient Data, 302 JAMA 86, 87-88 (2009) (arguing for governmental ownership of de-identified patient data). 29. See, e.g., Hall, supra note 23, at 637 (\"The law's uncertainty over ownership and con-trol of medical information is widely regarded as a major barrier to effective networking of [electronic medical records], and policy analysts consider the legal status of medical infor-mation to be a critical question at or near the top of issues needing resolution.\"); id. at 631 (\"How this issue is resolved can determine how or whether massive anticipated develop-ments in electronic health records will take shape.\"); Rodwin, supra note 23, at 586 (\"How the law defines ownership of patient data will shape whether its benefits can be developed and also affects patient confidentiality.\"). 30. See, e.g., H. COMM. ON PUB. HEALTH, INTERIM REP. TO THE 82ND TEX. LEG., H. 82-C410, 1st Sess., at 17, 20-21 (2010) (stating as its first recommendation that \"[t]he Legisla-ture should determine clearly in law who is the owner of medical records\"). 31. See discussion infra Part II; see also Hall & Schulman, supra note 27, at 1282 (ac-knowledging that \"the effect of other legal regimes may sometimes resemble property law\"). 32. See Abraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, Pliability Rules, 101 MICH. L. REV. 1 (2002). The important feature of pliability rule protection, for purposes of this discussion, is that it offers a dynamic scheme of entitlements in which a baseline rule of consensual order-ing of data access can shift to nonconsensual access under specified circumstances. See id. at 5 (\"Pliability, or pliable, rules are contingent rules that provide an entitlement owner with property rule or liability rule protection as long as some specified condition obtains; howev-er, once the relevant condition changes, a different rule protects the entitlement \u2014 either liability or property, as the circumstances dictate. Pliability rules, in other words, are dy-namic rules, while property and liability rules are static.\"). No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 75 data, and the grounds for nonconsensual data use are substantively similar under either regime. This similarity suggests that property rights may not be the right locus for reform. Creating property rights in data would produce a new scheme of entitlements that is substan-tively similar to what already exists, thus perpetuating the same frus-trations all sides have felt with the existing federal regulations. Part III challenges the claim that clarifying data ownership would improve access to useful data resources for clinical care, public health,33 and research. This claim was central to the recent debate be-tween Professors Hall and Schulman34 and Professor Rodwin,35 who disagreed whether private or public ownership of patients' data would better promote data access. Data propertization proposals fail because patients' raw health information is not in itself a valuable data re-source, in the sense of being able to support useful, new applica-tions.36 Creating useful data resources requires significant inputs of human and infrastructure services, and owning data is fruitless unless there is a way to acquire the necessary services.37 Part IV considers the impact of the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (\"HITECH\") Act,38 which authorized data hold-ers39 to supply the needed services commercially, subject to regulated 33. Public health data uses include tracking the spread of communicable diseases, report-ing injuries that suggest child abuse, and conducting postmarket surveillance to monitor the safety of approved drugs. See LAWRENCE O. GOSTIN, PUBLIC HEALTH LAW 4 (2d ed. 2008) (characterizing public health law as focusing on population-oriented (as opposed to patient-specific) efforts \"to ensure the conditions for people to be healthy (to identify, prevent, and ameliorate risks to health in the population)\" and \"to pursue the highest possible level of physical and mental health in the population, consistent with the values of social justice\"); Paul J.

A major challenge in twenty-first century privacy law and research eth-ics will be to come to terms with the inherently collective nature of knowledge generation in a world where large-scale informational re-search is set to play a more prominent role.42 Informational research differs starkly from interventional research, exemplified by random-ized, controlled clinical trials,43 which were the major workhorse of late twentieth-century biomedical discovery.44 A person's refusal to participate in a clinical trial does not jeopardize the broader clinical research enterprise, which can move forward using other willing re-search subjects; only 600-3000 people are needed for a typical clini-cal drug trial.45 In contrast, a person's refusal to participate in informational research may bias the dataset and reduce its statistical power for everyone.46 Many important types of informational research must be done collectively with large, inclusive datasets.47 An individ-ual's wish not to participate, perhaps motivated by privacy concerns, potentially places other human beings at risk and undermines broader public interests \u2014 for example, in public health or medical discov-ery \u2014 in which the individual shares.48 Existing regulations lack tools to resolve this complex dilemma. 40.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 77 Part V identifies two fundamental defects of the current HIPAA Privacy Rule and Common Rule. First, these regulations conceive the state's police power to use data to promote public health much more narrowly than the police power is conceived in all other legal con-texts. This has the effect of thwarting legitimate uses of data to im-prove the public's health. Second, the existing provisions for approving nonconsensual research uses of data fail to incorporate any public use requirement \u2014 that is, a requirement that unconsented data uses must be justified by a publicly beneficial purpose. As things stand, persons whose health data are used in research have no assur-ance that the use will serve any socially beneficial purpose at all.49 The 2009 IOM recommendations,50 the more recent ANPRM,51 and the ongoing clamor of data propertization proposals all fail to address these problems. Reaping the full benefit of interoperable health in-formation systems requires coming to grips with them. It is time to reframe the debate. The right question is not who owns health data, nor is it any of the seventy-four queries that erupted from the recent ANPRM. Instead, the debate should be about appropriate public uses of private data and how best to facilitate these uses while adequately protecting individuals' interests. II.

Nonconsensual Access to Patient Data Under a Property Regime Data propertization proposals fall into two broad categories: pro-privacy proposals that portray private ownership as a way to bolster patients' power to block unwanted uses of their data and pro-access proposals that aim to promote wider availability of data for clinical, research, and public health uses.52 The pro-privacy proposals rest on a mythical view of private property. Three centuries ago, Sir William Blackstone noted how the human imagination is drawn to the idea of property as \"that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over external things of the world in total exclusion of 49. See discussion infra Part V.B (explaining the complete absence of a public use re-quirement in the Common Rule and HIPAA waiver provisions, which allow nonconsensual access to data for research). 50.

See supra notes 23, 26-28 and accompanying text (providing examples of various pro-privacy and pro-access proposals). 78 Harvard Journal of Law & Technology [Vol. 25 the right of any other individual in the universe.\"53 This idea resonates with the \"autonomy \u00fcber alles\" strand of privacy advocacy that as-serts that a patient's right to control access to health data should trump all other interests, even society's interest in conducting studies that might save or improve other people's lives.54 Blackstone, however, was merely describing how people imagine property. He himself did not espouse this view,55 nor has American law ever done so.56 Different assets call for different forms of ownership, and propo-nents of patient data ownership do not always specify what they have in mind.57 Data ownership might, for example, need to look some-thing like the nonexclusive rights riparian owners have in a river that runs by their land \u2014 a right to use the river oneself but not to interfere with others' simultaneous uses for fishing and navigation58 \u2014 or like a copyright, which expires after a fixed term of years and allows fair use by others even during that term.59 Pro-privacy proposals seem to draw on the ideal of property reflected in the saying, \"one's home is one's castle.\"60 In the usual course of events, access to a person's home requires a consensual transaction with the owner, and uncon-sented uses can be enjoined.61 This package of rights and remedies 53. 2 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *2, available at http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk2ch1.asp (spelling conformed to modern conventions). 54.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 79 corresponds to property-rule protection,62 and it is what privacy pro-ponents seem to be seeking in their calls for data ownership: consen-sual ordering of data access and the power to stop unconsented uses. The fatal flaw in pro-privacy proposals is this: having a property right does not ensure property-rule protection. Law recognizes that there are many situations where consensual transactions cannot be relied on as a way of ordering an owner's relations with the larger community.63 In many circumstances, a property owner only receives liability-rule protection,64 which means the owner can be forced to give up her property in return for compensation that is externally set, often by a court, legislature, or administrative agency.65 That compen-sation may be zero. The government \u2014 when acting under its police power to protect the public's health, safety, morals, or welfare \u2014 has broad power to confiscate or interfere with property without compen-sating the owner.66 Dating back to colonial times, the state's police power has been used not just to prevent property owners from injuring others, but also to pursue broader public welfare objectives for the benefit of the community.67 \"[T]here was no single paradigm of pub-lic welfare that confined what we now call the police power. Then, as now, lawmakers pursued a shifting amalgam of goals . . . . Legislation coercively promoted uses of private land that were viewed as condu-cive to the community's well-being.\"68 Consistent with this tradition, the government can require nonconsensual access to data for use in public health activities, which long have been viewed as a legitimate exercise of the state's police power.69 This would remain true even if data were patient-owned. 62.

Takings require \"some showing of 'public-ness'\" of the intended use,72 and takings that lack the requisite public quality can be enjoined.73 Public uses traditionally involved placing the property under public ownership or transferring it to a private company, such as a utility or railroad, that is obligated to serve the public, often but not always for a regulated price.74 There was never a requirement that the fruits of a taking be made freely available to the public: railroads and stadiums built on taken land routinely require users to buy tickets.75 Modern courts, somewhat controversially,76 allow takings that transfer property to new private owners for com-mercial projects that need not be open to the general public77 and for projects that offer only indirect public benefits, such as boosting local tax revenues or aiding urban renewal or land reform.78 The possibility of eminent domain appears to have been lost on privacy advocates who view data ownership as a way to halt uncon-sented, private-sector research use of data.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 81 would allow privately owned health data to be taken for use in aca-demic and commercial research that offers a prospect of developing a beneficial therapy. This is true even if the new therapy, when success-fully developed, would be available only to patients who can pay for it. It seems doubtful that patients would be entitled to compensation when their data were taken for use in research. Courts construe \"just compensation\" to mean payment of market value79 \u2014 what the prop-erty would fetch in an alternative, consensual sale on the open mar-ket.80 There is no compensation for subjective value, such as the emotional attachment an owner has to a particular home, or for unde-veloped use rights \u2014 what the undeveloped property might have been worth if the current owner had chosen to develop it.81 There also is no compensation for consequential costs of the taking, such as an own-er's moving expenses.82 These same limitations presumably would apply if patient-owned data were taken for public use in research. When patients wish to have their data \"lie fallow\" because of privacy concerns, the fair market value of the data arguably is zero: if patients oppose having their data used in research at all, there is no alternative consensual use by which to gauge the data's market value. The value of unused data is largely subjective, reflecting an emotional attach- 79. See Abraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, The Hidden Function of Takings Com-pensation, 96 VA. L. REV. 1673, 1677 (2010) (noting that eminent domain only compen-sates market value, not emotional attachment or subjective valuation). 80.

Nonconsensual Data Access Under the Existing Federal Regulations The HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule offer a frame-work of patient entitlements and protections that is strikingly similar to what patients would enjoy if they owned their data. Under ordinary circumstances, both regulations require consensual ordering of data access: they require a privacy authorization85 or informed consent86 before data can be used. However, both regulations contain exemp-tions, exceptions, and definitional nuances that shift to a regime of liability-rule protection under certain circumstances.87 The recent ANPRM would adjust specific provisions but preserve this same overall structure.88 Under the current regulations, certain activities that are consid-ered to have high social value \u2014 such as using data for judicial, law enforcement, and public health purposes \u2014 are not subject to the usu-al consent and authorization requirements.89 Nonconsensual research 83. See, e.g., ALAN F. WESTIN, HOW THE PUBLIC VIEWS PRIVACY AND HEALTH RESEARCH 13 (2007) (suggesting that the fifty percent of surveyed individuals who ex-pressed concern about research access to their health data \"are expressing the 'pure privacy' position \u2014 a sense of violation or intrusion if their sensitive health information is seen by an unknown third party, . . . even if a promise of anonymity is offered; and even if no actual harm to reputation is likely to result from such research activity\"). 84. See Hall, supra note 23, at 659; Rodwin, supra note 23, at 609. Hall and Rodwin both argue that patients have no property interest in de-identified data; therefore, research uses of such data would not constitute a taking and, hence no compensation would be owed. My point is different: even if the data were identifiable or fully identified, and even if the patient had a property interest in the data, and even if research use of the data were deemed to be a taking, it is still true that no compensation would be owed, because takings doctrine does not compensate subjective value \u2014 and the perceived value of keeping data unutilized is a subjective value. 85.

Private delegations of eminent domain power are justified under three circumstances, all of which are present in the area of informational research. First, they make sense when there are holdouts or other strategic barriers to consensual transac-tions107 \u2014 in other words, when obtaining consent is \"impractica-ble,\"108 which happens to be one of the conditions109 for granting a waiver of patient consent under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule. Second, private takings are appropriate in situations where justice and efficiency are better served by transferring the taken property to a subsequent private owner rather than to the govern-ment.110 This is the case, for example, if a private-sector research in-stitution has a greater capability for unlocking the scientific and public health potential of the data than government agencies pos-sess.111 Third, private takings make sense when a repeated pattern of 104.

Under a property regime, patients' ability to control uses of their data might be very similar to the substantive entitlements they enjoy under the existing federal regulations. There could, of course, be pro-cedural differences, with the property regime imposing higher \"due process\" costs114 on nonconsensual uses of data. Yet high due process costs are themselves a factor that tends to justify private delegations of takings power. If patients owned their data, it is quite possible that some scheme of private eminent domain \u2014 perhaps resembling the waiver provisions of the federal regulations \u2014 would be necessary to address the high due process costs of securing access to data. Based on precedents in the railroad and utility industries,115 it would not be out of line for the government to delegate eminent domain power to private actors \u2014 such as healthcare data environments and research institutions \u2014 that are repeatedly involved in transactions to supply or acquire data for use in informational research. It is hard to make a case that data ownership would give patients any more control than they now have. III. WHY DATA OWNERSHIP CANNOT RESOLVE DATA ACCESS PROBLEMS Turning to the pro-access proposals, the health information pri-vacy community was puzzled recently by a debate in which several of lic/Private Partnership Program, Biomarker Consortium (BC), U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN., http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/PartnershipsCollaborations/PublicPrivate PartnershipProgram/ucm231115.htm (last visited Dec. 21, 2011) (describing a public-private partnership the FDA has formed with twenty-eight private corporations and thirty-four independent research foundations and institutions to accelerate progress in biomarker-based technologies). 112.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 87 our most admired scholars drew divergent conclusions about the op-timal scheme of ownership for patient data. Divergent conclusions are not puzzling in themselves, but they are so when two analyses that embrace similar objectives, similar methodologies, and similar as-sumptions give rise to the divergence. Both analyses \u2014 one by Pro-fessors Hall and Schulman,116 the other by Professor Rodwin117 \u2014 favor the objective of making health data more widely available for use in medical treatment, public health, and research.118 Both employ resource classification as their methodology \u2014 a method in which analysts \"classify infrastructure resources as public goods, network goods, natural monopoly, or some combination thereof\"119 to explain why \"markets may fail to efficiently supply such goods, and then pro-ceed to analyze the form of institutional intervention by the govern-ment to correct the failure.\"120 Both analyses state many of the same assumptions: that the use of health data is nonrivalrous,121 health data resources generate public goods,122 interoperable data systems exhibit network effects,123 data holders such as insurers and healthcare pro-viders enjoy rights somewhat equivalent to ownership of patient data amid the present legal ambiguities,124 and control of data resources is 116. Professors Hall and Schulman argue in favor of patient ownership of health data. See Hall & Schulman, supra note 27; see also Hall, supra note 23 (making similar argu-ments in a longer legal analysis). 117.

Rodwin calls for public ownership of patients' anonymized data.126 He argues \"that treating patient data as private property precludes forming comprehensive databases required for many of its most important public health and safety uses\" and pro-poses \"that federal law require providers, medical facilities and insur-ers to report key patient data in anonymized and de-identified form to public authorities, which will create aggregate databases to promote public health, patient safety, and research.\"127 Rodwin's proposal is, in effect, a scheme of nonconsensual access to patients' anonymized data, although he does not label it as such. Data holders, such as healthcare providers and insurers, would be required by statute to re-port data to public authorities.128 Implicit in this scheme is that pa-tients have no say in the matter. This nonconsensual ordering of data access is a critical feature of Rodwin's proposal.129 Hall and Schulman, on the other hand, call for consensual order-ing of data access. They suggest that it would stimulate market devel-opment of interconnected electronic medical records (\"I-EMRs\")130 if patients had a right to enter commercial transactions to license access to their medical information that is in the custody of insurers, healthcare providers, and other data holders.131 In his longer analysis, Hall argues that the U.S. healthcare system's fragmentation is \"chron-ic and deeply entrenched\"132 such that patients' medical information is widely scattered among data holders who may lack incentives to de-velop I-EMRs. Patients have rights of access to their own data,133 but in Hall's view, lack clear entitlements to transfer these rights on commercial terms to \"compilers\" that could assemble the patient's scattered data into I-EMRs. \"If patients were given ownership of their complete medical treatment and health histories, they could license to compilers their rights to that information in a propertized form that could be more fully developed and commercialized.\"134 125. See Hall, supra note 23, at 647 (noting that the data holders' \"[m]ultiple ownership of different pieces of a patient's medical history . . . makes it difficult for anyone to assem-ble a complete record\"); Rodwin, supra note 23, at 606 (discussing fracturing of control over patient data at the level of physicians, hospitals, and insurers, and noting a second level of fracturing of control at the level of individual patients). 126.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 89 Hall's analysis is sometimes characterized as a call for private ownership of data.135 It should not, however, be confused with the demands for property rights sometimes voiced by privacy advocates with the aim of blocking data access.136 Hall offers a nuanced analy-sis, recognizing that the precise scope of the patient's entitlement would need to be carefully defined and acknowledging a risk that giv-ing patients additional legal rights could add new strategic barriers in a market that already, in Hall's view, exhibits an anticommons prob-lem at the level of data holders.137 Hall and Schulman present their proposal as \"one potential solution.\"138 Under their proposal, the pa-tient would be able to grant a license to a trusted intermediary, which in turn would be able to (1) compel the various data holders to make the patient's medical information available for compilation into an I-EMR (subject, of course, to reimbursing the data holder's costs of complying with such requests)139 and (2) act as the patient's agent for purposes of arranging commercial transactions with third parties that desire to use the patient's I-EMR.140 The patient would control the terms under which the trusted intermediary could license the patient's I-EMR to prospective data users, and patients would have a \"nonwai-vable right to revoke any permission they give for access or use.\"141 This scheme of patient-controlled I-EMRs would differ from familiar \"ownership of houses and cars.\"142 Both of these analyses are insightful and have advanced the scholarly debate about data ownership, access, and privacy. The comments offered here aim to build on, rather than quibble with, these two proposals. This section examines why neither of the proposals just discussed would fix the data access problem. To explain why the-se proposals fail, it is necessary to explore some of the implicit as-sumptions on which they rest. This section focuses on two basic questions that can generate divergent assumptions. The first question is, \"What types of health data constitute useful data resources \u2014 in 135. See, e.g., Rodwin, supra note 23, at 608 (\"Professor Mark Hall argues that private ownership can overcome anticommons problems that block the adoption of integrated EMRs and networks.\"); Who Should Own Electronic Medical Records?, ALLBUSINESS (2009), http://www.allbusiness.com/print/13276486-1-22eeq.html (labeling the Hall and Schulman analysis as \"the case for private ownership\" and presenting it as \"the opposing view\" to Rodwin's \"case for public ownership of data\"). 136.

Hall & Schulman, supra note 27, at 1282. 90 Harvard Journal of Law & Technology [Vol. 25 other words, data in a form that can support useful applications in clinical care, public health, and research?\" Part III.A defines four cat-egories of health data resources that differ markedly in their utility for these various applications. The second question is, \"How are useful data resources made?\" Making some types of data resource, as dis-cussed in Part III.B, requires access to identifying information about patients. Part III.C explains that making one particularly useful type of data resource requires a scheme of nonconsensual access to pa-tients' data. Making data resources also requires significant inputs of human and infrastructure services, as described in Part III.D. Simply owning data will not ensure an adequate supply of data resources without access to the necessary services. Proposals that fail to address these realities cannot resolve the data access problem. A. Identifying the Valuable Data Resources In ordinary usage, terms like \"medical information\" and \"health data\" can refer to several distinct types of information resource: 1. Records of a Patient's Various Encounters with the Healthcare System This discussion will use the terms \"encounter-level patient data\" or \"raw patient health data\" to refer to records of a patient's various encounters with the healthcare system, such as paper charts or elec-tronic files stored by the healthcare providers, payers, clinical labora-tories, pharmacies and other sellers of medical products with which the patient has done business in the course of receiving healthcare. Hall's \"medical information\"143 and Rodwin's \"patient data\"144 often patient data. Hall's electronic health records (\"EMR\") are electronic records of a patient's encounters with a single healthcare site, such as a hospital or a physician's office.145 2. The Patient's Longitudinal Health Record (\"LHR\") An LHR compiles a patient's encounter-level data from disparate sources to form an extended chronological record that tracks the pa-tient's illnesses, treatments, and outcomes over multiple encounters with the healthcare system.146 Hall and Schulman refer to these as 143. Hall, supra note 23, at 646. 144. Rodwin, supra note 23, at 586. 145. Hall, supra note 23, at 643-44. 146. See Deborah Shatin, Nigel S.B. Rawson & Andy Stergachis, UnitedHealth Group, in PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY, supra note 9, at 271, 273 (discussing \"longitudinal histories\" No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 91 \"longitudinal patient records\"147 or \"a consolidated medical record for each patient.\"148 Hall's I-EMRs would produce LHRs by \"facili-tat[ing] the compilation of a patient's entire medical treatment and health history from among multiple independent records holders.\"149 3. Longitudinal Population Health Data (\"LPHD\") LPHD gathers LHRs from many patients to create a dataset that reflects the long-term healthcare experiences of a large number of people.150 Hall's trusted intermediaries would be able to enter transac-tions that gather patient-specific LHRs together to form LPHD. Rod-win's \"national patient database\" is intended to generate LPHD. 4. Unbiased LPHD This is a subcategory of LPHD that, in addition to the characteris-tics just described, has a valuable attribute: the LPHD provides a rep-resentative sample151 of a larger population about which researchers or public health authorities (together, \"investigators\") are trying to draw conclusions. The individual LHRs included in the unbiased LPHD constitute a representative sample of a larger population of interest. Studying unbiased LPHD will let investigators draw scientif-ically valid conclusions that are generalizable to that larger popula-tion.152 LPHD obviously is unbiased if it includes LHRs for all members of the larger population in question, for example, if it in-cludes data for all Americans or data for everyone in the world. Rod-win's concept of \"national, longitudinal patient data\"153 is a form of in which \"[i]nformation on diagnosis, treatments, and the occurrence of adverse clinical events, as coded on [insurance] claims, can be tracked across time\"). 147.

Rodwin, supra note 23, at 587. 92 Harvard Journal of Law & Technology [Vol. 25 unbiased LPHD. Unbiased LPHD also can be created using smaller samples of individuals' LHRs, so long as a random, representative sample is obtained. Hall's statement that \"population health data can be mined to improve the quality and outcome of care for all\"154 pre-sumes the use of unbiased LPHD. Encounter-level patient data and individual LHRs are useful for purposes of treating the individual patient. For example, LHRs can answer questions about a patient's medical history that are relevant to the current treatment encounter, or they can notify physicians about treatments that other care providers have administered to the same patient for the same illness so that duplicative or conflicting treat-ments can be avoided. Encounter-level patient data and individual LHRs, which include data for just one person, have limited or no di-rect use as resources for public health studies and research, since it is hard to draw general conclusions from the experiences of one per-son.155 However, encounter-level data and LHRs are raw material from which useful data resources for research and public health can be derived. The useful resource for public health and research activities is LPHD.156 For the vast majority of research and public health stud-ies, there is a further requirement to use unbiased LPHD that can sup-port valid, generalizable scientific conclusions.157 There are some research and public health applications that can work with biased LPHD. For example, biased LPHD may be useful in preliminary stud-ies to generate hypotheses for later, more rigorous study. In general, however, research and public health studies that use LPHD need un-biased LPHD. 154. Hall, supra note 23, at 635-36. 155. See U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVS.

See discussion infra Part III.C. No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 93 B. The Problem of Linking Data Across Healthcare Data Environments Rodwin calls for encounter-level patient data to be \"anonymized or de-identified\"158 at the source by each data holder, which then would report the anonymized data to a centralized, national database that would somehow \"create aggregate databases to promote public health, patient safety, and research.\"159 This proposal runs into a seri-ous technical problem: it is impossible \u2014 not merely costly or diffi-cult, but impossible \u2014 to make longitudinal health records out of encounter-level patient data that have been anonymized.160 Linking data longitudinally to create a patient's LHR requires at least some identifying information to establish that raw data received from vari-ous data holders relate to the same patient.161 If the goal is to make an anonymized LHR, the order of operations matters: first, identifiable encounter-level patient data are linked together to make an identifia-ble LHR; then the identifiable LHR is anonymized.162 The linkage must precede the anonymization. Rodwin's proposal would let each data-holding facility report its data in coded163 form \u2014 that is, with an individual tracking number that allows data from the patient's subsequent encounters with that facility to be linked to data already reported.164 Unfortunately, these facility-level tracking numbers would not let a patient's data from one facility be linked with data from other facilities where the patient has received care.165 Each facility maintains its own coding system,166 and a patient would be assigned different tracking numbers by the various facilities with which she interacts. Sharing of code keys, which relate the tracking numbers to specific individuals, amounts to sharing of 158. Rodwin, supra note 23, at 589. 159. Id. 160.

[that] isn't linked to anything else.\"). 94 Harvard Journal of Law & Technology [Vol. 25 identifiable data under the Privacy Rule and Common Rule.167 Rod-win's proposal, which only allows sharing of de-identified patient data, thus would not allow sharing of the code keys. Suppose Mary Smith visits Dr. Brown for arthritis pain and is prescribed rofecoxib (Vioxx). Two months later, she is treated at the emergency department of Central Hospital for a stroke. Six months later, she visits Dr. Brown again for a skinned knee. Under Rodwin's proposal, the national database would contain the following infor-mation: Dr. Brown treated anonymous patient 13275 for arthritis and prescribed Vioxx. This same patient (identified by Dr. Brown's track-ing number 13275) was later treated for a skinned knee. Central Hos-pital treated anonymous patient 999345 for a stroke. There is no way to link Mary's data from Dr. Brown and Central Hospital into a com-plete LHR unless they divulge that tracking numbers 13275 and 999345 both refer to Mary Smith. If the data in the national database are \"mined\" for information about Vioxx safety, investigators will see a possible association between taking Vioxx and skinning one's knee, but they will not be able to detect the possible association between taking Vioxx and having a stroke. Under Rodwin's proposal, the national database would not be able to compile LHRs for each patient, since it would lack the identi-fying information needed to link the patient's encounters across mul-tiple facilities and data holders. Unable to create LHRs, the national database could not produce the \"[n]ational, longitudinal patient da-ta\"168 (LPHD) that are needed for public health activities and research. The proposed national database would merely contain a second, anonymized copy of the same fragmented, unlinked, disorganized data that already exist. Unless encounter-level patient data are shared with the government in identifiable form \u2014 a policy that is far more problematic169 than the one Rodwin has proposed \u2014 it is difficult to see how a national database would add any value. 167. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.514(b)(2)(i)(R), 164.514(c)(2) (2010) (stating that \"de-identification\" of data under the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires removal of codes, but mak-ing an exception for codes that comply with the standard set in section 164.514(c), which forbids disclosure of the \"mechanism for re-identification\" (i.e., the code key)); see also OHRP Guidance, supra note 10 (noting that if code keys are shared with investigators, the study will be considered human-subject research that requires consent under the Common Rule). 168.

See IOM, PRIVACY REPORT, supra note 3, at 82 (reporting results of multiple sur-veys that found \"[p]atients were much more comfortable with the use of anonymized data (e.g., where obvious identifiers have been removed) than fully identifiable data for re-search\"). No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 95 C. Consent Bias and the Need for Nonconsensual Access to Patients' Health Data The proposal by Hall and Schulman solves the data-linkage prob-lem by relying on consensual ordering.170 The patient could authorize a trusted intermediary to obtain identifiable encounter-level data, which then could be linked to create the patient's LHR. The resulting LHR would be useful for purposes of the patient's own care.171 It is not clear, however, that this proposal could generate data resources for research and public health activities. The problem relates to the consensual ordering inherent in Hall and Schulman's scheme of pa-tient-controlled health records. The Hall and Schulman proposal al-lows the trusted intermediary to use a patient's LHRs to form LPHD and to license the LPHD to third-party users \u2014 but only on terms con-trolled by the patient.172 Multiple empirical studies have documented that people who are willing to consent to letting their data be used in research differ medi-cally from the population at large.173 The underlying reasons are not well understood, but the impact is clear: conditioning the creation of LPHD on patient consent produces datasets that may be unreflective of the general population, thus biasing study results. Similar problems also exist outside the biomedical context. Burstein notes that infor-mation security researchers, when studying threats to our nation's critical information infrastructures, need access to realistic data about people's Internet usage patterns and electronic communications.174 Internet service providers that possess this information can share it with researchers, but only if the affected Internet users consent.175 People willing to consent to research with their private information \u2014 potentially including the content of their e-mails \u2014 may not provide a 170.

The Hall and Schulman proposal envisions that licensing fees paid by third-party data users would help finance the informational infrastruc-ture for compiling patients' LHRs.176 Given the low quality of LPHD a patient-controlled system can generate, demand from research and public health users may be limited, and licensing fees may not be a reliable source of funding for the system.177 Consent bias is a potential problem under any scheme of consen-sual ordering, and this is true whether it is an opt-in or opt-out consent scheme. An opt-in approach allows data to be used only if the patient affirmatively consents.178 Common Rule consents approach.179 An opt-out approach presumes patients' data can be used, unless the patients take active steps to exclude their data from use.180 Both schemes let patients ex-ercise control over uses of their data, although the level of effort in-volved in keeping one's data from being used differs in the two schemes. Whenever patients can control uses of their data, there is a risk that those who exercise control may differ from those who do not, causing the resulting data set to be unrepresentative of the population as a whole. A scheme of nonconsensual ordering avoids this problem because patients cannot self-select for inclusion or exclusion from the data set. Rodwin's analysis excels in its exposition of supply-side factors that call for nonconsensual ordering of access to data for research and 176.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 97 public health applications.181 Hall and Rodwin both acknowledge that diffusion of control among multiple data holders can give rise to a tragedy of the anticommons.182 Rodwin explores an additional tragedy of the anticommons that arises when control over data is diffused at the level of individual patients.183 Likening the problem of assembling \"comprehensive patient databases\" to the problem of assembling con-tiguous parcels of land for real estate development, he explores strate-gic barriers that make consensual access to data unworkable.184 Rodwin frames his discussion as a comparison of private and public ownership. This framing obscures an essential feature of his proposal: it is a scheme of nonconsensual access to patients' data, insofar as it requires compulsory reporting of patients' data to the government.185 The flaw in Rodwin's analysis is that it conflates non-consensual access and governmental ownership. He states that \"treat-ing patient data as private property precludes forming comprehensive databases required for many of its most important public health and safety uses.\"186 This statement is true only if property rights are mod-eled as conferring property-rule protection (pure consensual ordering). It discounts the possibility that the needed public access to privately owned data could be obtained nonconsensually through exercises of the police or eminent domain powers.187 As Bell has remarked in dis-cussing takings that transfer property into public ownership, such ac-tions are \"warranted only where two issues are resolved in favor of the government: (1) the government is the preferred owner for reasons of justice or efficiency, and (2) coercion is the preferred transfer mechanism.\"188 The need for nonconsensual access does not neces-sarily imply a need for governmental ownership. There are various reasons why the government may not be the most efficient data owner. For example, federal agencies such as the HHS, which would own the data under Rodwin's proposal,189 are reg-ulated by the Privacy Act,190 which protects the privacy of records held by federal agencies.191 This is an added layer of regulation on top of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule. This heightened 181. See Rodwin, supra note 23, at 603-06. 182. Hall, supra note 23, at 647-48; Rodwin, supra note 23, at 606. 183. Rodwin, supra note 23, at 606. 184.

It is thus unclear whether public data ownership is a good idea. On the other hand, there is a strong case for nonconsensual access to data for at least some research and public health applica-tions \u2014 specifically, those that require unbiased LPHD. Because of the patient-level anticommons problem Rodwin explored192 and con-cerns about consent bias, consensual approaches cannot reliably pro-duce unbiased LPHD. D. The Role of Infrastructure and Demand-Side Factors Statements such as \"[w]hoever owns patient data will determine whether its benefits can be tapped\"193 overstate the importance of con-trolling one raw material input to a complex, multistage production process. This statement is true in the same way that the statement \"whoever owns iron ore will determine the fate of the shipbuilding industry\" is true. Certainly, iron ore is a critical input to building a ship, but it is just one of many factors that influence the development of facilities that turn iron ore into a valuable asset \u2014 steel \u2014 and the steel into ships. In the same way, raw health data are just one of many inputs for creating useful data resources. This Part explains the im-portance of other critical inputs \u2014 specifically, human and infrastruc-ture services. There are multiple system architectures that can convert encoun-ter-level patient data into valuable data resources for research and public health.194 Hall's proposal does not embrace any particular sys-tem architecture for implementing I-EMRs. He merely states that \"[t]he primary barriers are not technological\"195 and turns to analysis of the perceived legal barriers. Rodwin's analysis implicitly assumes that a centralized database is necessary in order to assemble encoun-ter-level patient data into LHRs and LPHD.196 His preference for pub-lic ownership may have been influenced by the assumption \u2014 which 192.

The investiga-tor would send queries to the various data holders (for example, \"Please locate records for any person in your data system who (1) has ever taken statins, or (2) has ever suffered from rhabdomyolysis.\"). Records for such patients could be conveyed in identifiable form to a network coordinating center (a trusted intermediary) that would per-form longitudinal linkage of data received from the various data hold-ers. This linkage would make it possible to identify patients who both took statins and suffered rhabdomyolysis, even if the records of these two occurrences are scattered across multiple data holders. The trust-ed intermediary would use the linked data to compile lists of patients who took statins with and without subsequently developing rhabdo-myolysis.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 101 Distributed architecture offers a number of advantages over cen-tral databases.214 It avoids the need to invest in duplicative storage capacity because data reside with the original data holders and are not redundantly stored at a central location. It also offers advantages in privacy and data security because the data continue to reside behind the privacy firewalls of the original data holders, with movements of data minimized to what is necessary to respond to specific queries (as opposed to moving all the data to a central repository in anticipation of unspecified future uses).215 Perhaps the most important advantage, in terms of data quality, is that distributed networks allow the encoun-ter-level data to be interpreted and processed by the data holders' own personnel, who regularly work with the data and are familiar with its quirks.216 Data holders do not all use standardized record formats.217 Different healthcare providers and insurers describe the same medical condition in different ways, just as law professors use different termi-nology to refer to similar concepts (for example, LHR, I-EMR, com-plete patient record, and longitudinal patient data). Answering a simple question, such as whether a patient actually had rhabdomyoly-sis, requires familiarity with how the particular data system records data. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (\"P-CAST\") is pessimistic that a standard record format will ever emerge: \"[A]ny attempt to create a national health IT ecosystem based on standardized record formats is doomed to failure . . . . With so many vested interests behind each historical system of recording health data, achieving a natural consolidation around one record for-mat . . . would be difficult, if not impossible.\"218 The notion that a national database operator could make sense of raw, encounter-level patient data reported in disparate formats is fanciful. In a distributed data network, data holders are not just suppliers of data; they also act as service providers.219 These services may include, for example, searching the data holders' records to locate data rele-vant to the particular query, retrieving data, converting data to a 214.

It no longer can be said that \"[w]hoever owns patient data will determine whether its benefits can be tapped.\"223 Tapping the benefits requires both data and services, and control over data is unavailing without the services. Some argue that health data resources are nonrivalrous.224 It is probably fair to say that encounter-level patient data are nonrivalrous because many peo-ple can use raw data without exhausting the supply. However, these data have few uses except in the patient's own care, so it is not clear why large numbers of people would want to use them. LHRs and LPHD, which do have many potential uses, are subject to potential supply constraints: there is a finite supply of the services needed to convert raw data into LHRs and LPHD. Data holders do not have un-limited personnel and data processing resources to respond to queries. Preparing LPHD to respond to one query may diminish the availabil-ity of LPHD for another query. The most valuable information re-sources for clinical, research, and public health applications are LHRs and LPHD, and these can only be supplied by a constrained infra- 220.

These resources are only partially nonrivalrous \u2014 that is, they are nonrivalrous only within capacity constraints.225 The fact that the necessary services are costly and in finite supply has ramifications for system design. A key design decision is whether a system needs to be able to produce LHRs and LPHD ahead of de-mand, as opposed to satisfying demand after it arises. The answer de-pends on whether the planned applications \u2014 clinical care, research, and public health studies \u2014 are latency-sensitive.226 The concept of latency (colloquially understood as \"delay\") has been a concern in discussions of Internet policy.227 Some Internet applications are laten-cy-sensitive \u2014 that is, small delays in delivery of information will disrupt their functionality \u2014 while others are latency-insensitive. \"Consider that it doesn't matter whether an email arrives now or a few milliseconds later. But it certainly matters for applications that want to carry voice or video.\"228 Clinical uses of LHRs are potentially laten-cy-sensitive: clinicians treating a patient in the emergency department cannot afford to wait for compilation of the patient's LHR. On the other hand, the use of LHRs in scheduled clinical care may not be latency-sensitive: when a patient makes a doctor's appointment, a request could be made to compile the patient's LHR for delivery on the date of the scheduled appointment. Many research and public health uses of LPHD are latency-insensitive: it does not destroy the validity of a study if it takes a few days or weeks to supply the neces-sary data resources. Because of these differences, the optimal infrastructure to supply data resources for one use may not be optimal for supplying other uses. For latency-sensitive applications, data resources need to be compiled ahead of the demand for them. Patient-controlled I-EMRs, such as those proposed by Hall and Schulman, are thus a potentially useful tool for clinical care. Patients can request compilation of their LHRs in advance so that they will be available in emergencies, and then patients can periodically update their LHRs. For latency-insensitive applications, such as most research and public health stud-ies, compilation can be deferred until there is an identified demand. This distinction affects the required system design and can drastically affect system costs when, as here, compiling the information re-sources requires inputs of scarce, costly services. There would be little advantage \u2014 and an enormous cost disadvantage \u2014 in developing a centralized, national database containing every person's compiled 225. See Frischmann, supra note 75, at 951 (defining partially nonrivalrous resources). 226. See Tim Wu, Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, 2 J. ON TELECOMM. & HIGH TECH.

Compiling information resources (LHRs and LPHD) in antici-pation of all conceivable research and public health uses may be as ill-advised as it would be to manufacture false teeth for every American in anticipation that they may eventually need them. A distributed architecture can respond to queries as they occur, and this attribute offers important economic advantages in latency-insensitive research and public health applications. In the future, the development of new infrastructure may reduce the latency itself \u2014 in other words, reduce the delays associated with locating relevant pa-tient data and converting them to a consistent format for assembly into LHRs and other useful data resources.229 At present, these services are labor-intensive. The recent P-CAST report calls for creation of a uni-versal exchange language and infrastructure to facilitate assembly and sharing of patient data across data holders.230 Data holders would con-tinue to operate a variety of systems, including the old legacy systems in operation today and new recordkeeping systems and formats.231 The \"syntax for such a universal exchange language will be some kind of extensible markup language (an XML variant, for example) capa-ble of exchanging data from an unspecified number of (not necessari-ly harmonized) semantic realms.\"232 Individual data elements \u2014 such as a person's X-ray or clinical observations about the patient \u2014 would be annotated with metadata tags containing enough identifying infor-mation to let the patient's records be located, recording information about the patient's privacy preferences, and explaining the provenance of the data (such as which healthcare providers were involved and what type of test or equipment they used).233 A national infrastructure would support searches and deliver results appropriately compiled and processed to protect privacy. Locating all of a patient's data, wherever stored, would work similarly to the way an Internet search engine works today.234 Until such a solution is implemented, LHRs and 229.

The hope, eventually, is to replace some of the human services with more capi-tal-intensive infrastructure services. Installing new infrastructure requires money. P-CAST acknowl-edges that federal leadership will be required; \"market forces are un-likely to generate appropriate incentives for the necessary coordination to occur spontaneously.\"235 This view is far more pessi-mistic than the view, expressed by Hall and Schulman, that altering patient's entitlements to their health data \"will help stimulate market development of interconnected EMRs.\"236 The problem with clarify-ing ownership of health data is that it is a supply-side solution \u2014 and this remains true whether ownership is clarified in favor of patients (as in Hall and Schulman's proposal) or the public (as in Rodwin's proposal). In contrast, health information infrastructure \u2014 like any infrastructure \u2014 exhibits problems both on the supply and demand sides.237 An example is the P-CAST proposal just described. The pro-posal could reduce delays in supplying LHRs and LPHD, but the market may not value the incremental speed because many health data applications are not latency-sensitive. Researchers who can afford to wait for a good data set may not be willing to pay more for a good data set delivered sooner. That is a demand-side issue. There are other demand-side issues. The price users would be willing to pay for health data resources may not reflect the true value of those resources because so many uses of health data (such as re-search and public health activities) themselves produce public and nonmarket goods.238 In this situation, data users are unable to appro-priate the full value their activities create; thus, they cannot afford to pay a price that reflects the data's true value.239 Frischmann has noted that market failure for infrastructure is more complex than supply-side analysis suggests.240 \"For both traditional and nontraditional infra-structure emphasize supply-side issues . . . and lished and highly developed technology that is the basis of web search engines, to support indexing and retrieval of metadata-tagged health data across large numbers of geographical-ly diverse locations); id. at 42 (indicating that the data-element access services in P-CAST's proposed system \"would act much like today's web search engines\" but with additional privacy protections). 235.

Id. at 930. 106 Harvard Journal of Law & Technology [Vol. 25 assume that the market mechanism will best generate and process de-mand information.\"241 Data propertization proposals assume that if encounter-level patient data were simply assigned to the right owner, the market would be able to figure out the right price to pay for useful data resources such as LHRs and LPHD, and this price would cover the cost of necessary infrastructure and services to create those re-sources. This is not a safe assumption. E. Why Data Propertization Proposals Fail To summarize, encounter-level patient data are an input that can be transformed into high-valued data resources \u2014 LHRs and LPHD \u2014 for use in clinical care, research, and public health activi-ties. Making these data resources also requires inputs of human and infrastructure services \u2014 that is, data provisioning services. In theory, it is possible to produce LHRs for use in clinical care under a patient-controlled system. Such a system would subject all transfers of en-counter-level patient data to consensual ordering, which would require permission of the patients whose data are involved. There are major limitations to such a system, however. Because of consent bias, the system cannot supply unbiased LPHD for use in research and public health projects. Research and public health users thus cannot be counted on to cross-subsidize the costs of developing patient-controlled LHRs. Unless the costs of developing patient-controlled LHRs are justified by the value they create in clinical care, a patient-controlled system may not be financially viable. Creating high-valued data resources for research and public health requires a framework of nonconsensual access to patients' raw health data. The HIPAA Priva-cy Rule and the Common Rule both allow nonconsensual access to patients' data for public health and research uses.242 If patients owned their encounter-level data, nonconsensual access for these uses still would be possible through exercise of the police and eminent domain powers. The nub of the problem with data propertization is that it is a sup-ply-side solution that neglects important infrastructural and demand-side issues. Access to raw patient data is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure an adequate supply of useful data resources. Data provision-ing services also are required. The prospective provision of services is inherently consensual in our system of law. The state's police and eminent domain powers only allow nonconsensual transfers of proper-ty; there is no similar mechanism to compel nonconsensual provision 241. Id. 242. See discussion supra Part II.B.

Nonconsensual ac-cess to data is possible whether under a property regime or under the regulatory regime provided by the Common Rule and HIPAA Privacy Rule. Nonconsensual access to services is not possible under either regime. Access to infrastructure services, rather than the unresolved status of data ownership, is thus the key impediment to data availabil-ity. 243. See Susan W. Brenner with Leo L.

THE HITECH ACT'S STRATEGY FOR PROMOTING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT This Part challenges claims248 that the HITECH Act, which Con-gress passed as part of the 2009 economic stimulus legislation,249 did little to promote interconnection of health information systems. It is true that the HITECH Act does not expressly require interconnection or data sharing. However, it does something arguably more important: it clarifies the price of data provisioning services, and it authorizes data holders to conduct commercial transactions for sale of those ser-vices.250 In doing so, it lays groundwork for a commercial market in data provisioning services and provides a mechanism to finance pri-vate-sector development of health information infrastructure. The HITECH Act accepts that access to data provisioning services is in-herently consensual. It authorizes a pricing structure that, if properly implemented, will create incentives for data holders and other poten-tial service providers to \"come to the market\" by supplying data pro-visioning services within existing capacity constraints and by investing to expand capacity. A. The Regulated Price of Infrastructure Services At first glance, the HITECH Act purports to restrict sales of health data.251 It states a general rule that it is unlawful for HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates to exchange a person's protected health information for direct or indirect remuneration \u2014 in other words, to sell data \u2014 unless the person authorizes the transac-tion.252 However, this restriction is tempered by a list of exceptions.253 One exception pertains to research: data holders that supply data to researchers pursuant to a HIPAA waiver254 can charge a price that \"reflects the costs of preparation and transmittal of the data.\"255 In July 2010, the Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\") within the HHS pro- 248. See, e.g., Hall, supra note 23, at 635 (\"[T]he economic stimulus act contains no le-gal requirement that funded systems actually interconnect to form a consolidated medical record for each patient . . . .\"); Rodwin, supra note 23, at 595 (discussing the goal of \"shar-ing of patient data for research and public uses\" and noting that the \"HITECH does not appear to authorize creating regulations that can achieve that goal\"). 249.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 109 posed a regulation implementing this provision.256 The proposed regu-lation tracks the statute closely and would permit the sale of data for use in research under a HIPAA waiver so long as the entity supplying the data receives only \"a reasonable cost-based fee to cover the cost to prepare and transmit\" the data.257 The individual's permission is re-quired only if the data supplier wishes to charge a price higher than this cost-based fee.258 To be clear, these provisions do not \"monetiz[e] medical infor-mation.\"259 The cost-based fee for data preparation and transmittal260 is not a price for data; it is a price for data-provisioning services. In-surers, healthcare providers, and other entities that operate health da-tabases own infrastructure, such as computer systems and software, in which they have invested to support their regular lines of business. With the aid of this infrastructure, it is possible to sift through large volumes of data, select information that meets a researcher's specifi-cations, and process it for transmission to the researcher. The fee de-scribed in the HITECH Act261 is for these sorts of infrastructure services. Technically speaking, the data are supplied at no charge and the fee is for services provided in responding to the data request. The HITECH Act has another exception for public health uses of data: when supplying data for public health activities, data holders can charge a fee for data preparation and transmittal, and this fee is not subject to the cost-based cap.262 It may at first seem wrongheaded for data holders to charge higher fees when supplying data for public health uses, which traditionally have been viewed as having a greater social value than research.263 Yet this policy makes sense if you as-sume that the data supply is infrastructure-constrained.

By letting public health users pay more than researchers, Congress is helping ensure adequate flows of data for public health purposes. Later, when the United States has completed installation of its basic health information infrastructure, it may make sense to cap the fees for public health as well as research uses, and the HITECH Act envisions this possibility.265 B. Why the HITECH Act's Approach Offers Promise In common parlance, \"cost-based\" means \"at cost,\" so this new pricing scheme may not initially sound promising as a way to spur investment in interconnected data systems. However, the OCR's \"rea-sonable, cost-based fee\"266 for data provisioning needs to be judged in light of precedents from other infrastructure industries. Health infor-mation systems are infrastructure,267 and the HITECH Act's cost-based fee echoes cost-of-service pricing traditionally used in many other American infrastructure industries such as electric power trans-mission and telecommunications.268 Historically, many of these indus-tries exhibited natural monopoly characteristics or other structural problems that made it unwise to let prices be set by market forces.269 264.

The modern critique of cost-of-service pricing focuses on its potential to be inefficient and cumbersome to administer.283 This critique emerged late in the twentieth century, when the major policy challenge was to optimize utilization of exist-ing infrastructures, as opposed to financing and building new infra-structures.284 Chen notes that traditional cost-of-service infrastructure regulation may actually be the more efficient approach under econom-ic conditions that existed earlier in the twentieth century.285 At that time, policymakers' central challenge was to develop new infrastruc-tures.

More than a cen-tury of Supreme Court cases have examined cost-of-service pricing in many different infrastructure contexts.287 Under these precedents, a reasonable, cost-based fee for infrastructure services must \u2014 in order to be constitutional \u2014 let infrastructure owners recover: (1) their vari-able and fixed operating costs of providing services, (2) their capital investment in the infrastructure itself, and (3) a reasonable profit mar-gin.288 The HITECH Act's cost-based fee structure, if implemented in accordance with these precedents, would foster creation of a commer-cial market in the infrastructure services that are needed to convert encounter-level patient data into valuable data resources for research and public health. In July 2010, the OCR sought public comments on how, precisely, it should define the cost-based fee289 and has not, as of this writing, issued final regulations clarifying what the fee will cover. However, the OCR presumably must heed past Supreme Court deci-sions that addressed cost-based pricing in other infrastructure con-texts.

Rather than have the gov-ernment build big databases or otherwise own health information infrastructure, the HITECH Act presumes the infrastructure will be developed, owned, and operated by the private sector subject to cost-based pricing of infrastructure services. V. WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE The HITECH Act's pricing provisions may improve the situation, but all is not well. There remains a widely shared perception that the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule are blocking socially beneficial uses of data while still under-protecting individual priva-cy.296 These perceptions persist, this Part argues, not because of a mere failure to propose answers; instead, the wrong questions are be-ing asked. This Part seeks to reframe the discussion to focus on two crucial questions that fell by the wayside during the long debate297 \u2014 from 1974 to 2002 \u2014 that produced these regulations in their current form. 290.

Restoring the Proper Scope of the State's Police Power to Use Data to Promote Public Health The first neglected question is, \"What is the scope of the state's police power to use private health data to promote public health?\" Regulatory practice under the Common Rule conceives the scope of the state's police power more narrowly than it is conceived in other legal contexts.298 This anomaly can be traced to an original sin during design of the Common Rule: its framers failed to define public health actions or delineate when they should be exempt from the Common Rule's consent requirements. The National Commission formed under the National Research Act of 1974299 was instructed to delineate the boundary between research and medical treatment.300 There was no similar directive to clarify the boundary between research and public health actions. This left a gray area in which the state's power to use data to protect the public's health is sometimes made subject to indi-vidual consent. The Belmont Report301 \u2014 which set the ethical principles embod-ied in the Common Rule \u2014 defined research as an activity that pro-duces generalizable knowledge.302 Using generalizability to mark the line between research and treatment worked well; it kept common \"experimental\" therapeutic practices, such as the off-label use of drugs in routine clinical care, from falling under the jurisdiction of the Common Rule.303 This definition carried through to the Common Rule's definition of \"human-subject research\"304 and HIPAA's defini-tion of \"research.\"305 has jurisdictional significance under the Common Rule: it delineates whether an activity is, or is not, \"human-subjects research\" that is regulated by the Common Rule (and thus subject to its informed consent requirements).

For example, vaccinating people to control a smallpox epidemic is permissible even without their consent;307 vaccinating people to see which of two vaccines works better is research that obviously should require consent. Nonconsensual vaccination is justified in the first case not because it fails to produce generalizable results, but because the unvaccinated person poses a potential threat of contagion to others in the circumstances of an epidemic. Focusing on generalizability misses the point. Ever since the Common Rule came into effect, there have been tortured efforts to draw a sensible line between \"public health prac-tice\" (which does not require consent) and \"public health research\" (which does). Various analytical frameworks have been proposed that consider multiple factors in addition to whether generalizable knowledge is being produced.308 The fact remains, however, that gen-eralizability of results gives rise to a presumption that an activity is \"research\" that will require informed consent, and there is no clear, reproducible standard for overcoming that presumption. Public health actions that produce generalizable knowledge, with minor excep-tions,309 require informed consent. 306.

Exercises of the state's police power can be enjoined only when they are illegitimate, as when the government acts beyond its constitutional powers or infringes a constitutional right.310 There are real constitutional limits on the government's power to touch people's bodies.311 Governmental touching of a person's data raises fewer con-stitutional problems.312 Unconsented public health research on peo-ple's bodies would implicate constitutional protections against bodily invasion.313 Unconsented informational research by a public health agency does not trigger these same concerns. The distinction between public health practice and research, when applied to uses of people's data, has the effect of drastically narrow-ing the scope of the state's police power in the area of public health. The state, when legitimately exercising its police power, can require its citizens to enter nonconsensual transactions that benefit the pub-lic.314 Any legitimate exercise of the police power \u2014 including those that produce generalizable knowledge \u2014 can support the imposition of nonconsensual requirements on citizens. Nowhere, other than under the Common Rule, does law parse legitimate exercises of the police power into those that produce generalizable knowledge \u2014 and thus require consent \u2014 and those that do not. Indeed, actions that produce generalizable knowledge offer greater benefit to the public and, if anything, present a stronger case for nonconsensual access to data. identify the cause of the outbreak, even though the knowledge gained is generalizable in that it likely will benefit future cruise passengers). 310.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 117 Treating generalizability as grounds to require consent for informa-tional research, as the Common Rule does, yields the wrong answer: consent requirements are imposed in inverse proportion to the amount of public benefit the use will generate. The recent ANPRM315 appears poised to perpetuate this problem. In a critical passage, it questions whether the Common Rule should apply to public health and quality improvement activities, but the last sentence of this passage suggests that activities that aim to produce generalizable knowledge should be regulated.316 Successful moderni-zation of the Common Rule requires recognition of the following point: the state's police power to protect public health encompasses a power to use data to create generalizable knowledge. The Common Rule, as currently applied, misses this point. As a result, legitimate exercises of the state's police power are being thwarted. An example was seen recently, when Congress authorized a large health data network317 that will use patients' clinical and insurance claims data to conduct drug safety surveillance and other studies that have the potential to produce generalizable knowledge.318 Congress clearly has power to legislate to protect the public health,319 and it is almost inconceivable that modern courts would question a congres-sional determination that the public health benefits of these activities are sufficient to warrant access to patients' data.320 It thus seems sin-gularly inappropriate for private IRBs to second-guess Congress's decisions. To clarify the role of IRBs in overseeing these activities, the Director of HHS's Office for Human Research Protections (\"OHRP\") made a determination that the congressionally authorized data uses are public health activities that are not subject to the Com-mon Rule.321 Nevertheless, in one recent public health study using this network, IRBs refused access to roughly five percent of the requested 315.

These problems with the Common Rule could be fixed by con-forming it to the HIPAA Privacy Rule's treatment of public health activities. The Privacy Rule was specifically designed to regulate dis-closures and uses of data, as opposed to interventional activities, and it directly addresses public health uses of data.323 It expressly allows data holders to make nonconsensual disclosures of data to a \"public health authority that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information\"324 for various purposes, including public health \"investi-gations\"325 \u2014 a broad term that could encompass . how HIPAA defines research.326 Even if the breadth of that term is debatable, the Privacy Rule makes several things perfectly clear: the data holder does not need to conduct an IRB review327 or make any inquiry into the nature of the intended data use when disclosing data to public health authorities.328 It merely needs to verify that the person requesting the data is a public health official329 with legal authority to request the data330 and that the requested data are the minimum neces- 322.

The IOM's 2009 study of the HIPAA Privacy Rule discussed the dis-tinction between public health practice and public health research at some length333 and seemed to suggest that IRBs need to parse this distinction when administering the HIPAA Privacy Rule.334 The regu-lation does not require this; the HIPAA Privacy Rule envisions no IRB involvement in disclosures of data to public health authorities.335 Misunderstandings about this fact continue to hinder public health access to data. The HIPAA Privacy Rule appropriately defers to legis-latures to decide the appropriate scope of the police power to use data to protect the public's health. It is not for executive agencies, or for the private institutional review bodies they empower, to second-guess these determinations. The Common Rule makes the state's police power subject to nullification by private and potentially conflicted IRBs336 \u2014 a matter that is all the more troubling in light of the lax procedural norms under which these bodies operate.337 B.

For example, health data had been widely used in research without consent in the decades before the Common Rule came into existence.339 The regulations preserved preexisting uses without enunciating a coherent theory explaining why \u2014 and which \u2014 data uses justify nonconsensual access. The waiver provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule lack a \"public use\" requirement \u2014 a criterion, similar to the one used in eminent domain jurisprudence340 \u2014 that requires nonconsensual research uses to serve a publicly beneficial purpose.341 1. How the Public Use Requirement Got Lost There is wide agreement among bioethicists that the \"central ethi-cal issue\" in health informational research is to ensure that the poten-tial public benefits are sufficient to warrant the burden on the individual.342 At every stage of the process that led to development of the Common Rule and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, advisory bodies that pondered nonconsensual research use of data called for a utilitarian balancing of public and private interests. It is worth tracing this histo-ry because it came to an anomalous result: the waiver provisions of both regulations, as finally promulgated, lack criteria that require such a balancing. 338.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 121 The earliest precursor of the Common Rule was a set of 1974 regulations that required informed consent and IRB review of re-search, with no provision for consent to be waived.343 The National Commission's recommendations about human-subject protections, published in 1978, focused primarily on interventional and behavioral research.344 The Commission discussed waiving or altering consent, but not with respect to the use of data.345 The report separately ad-dressed research that relies on existing documents, records, or tissue specimens and stated several principles: \"If the subjects are not identi-fied or identifiable, the research need not be considered to involve human subjects,\" and consent requirements should not apply.346 Even \"where the subjects are identified, informed consent may be deemed unnecessary\" provided certain conditions are met.347 These conditions included a public use requirement: an IRB must determine that \"the importance of the research justifies such invasion of the subjects' pri-vacy.\"348 The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\"), precursor of today's HHS, commenced proceedings in 1979 to incor-porate the National Commission's recommendations into its existing regulations.349 The proposed regulation did not include a waiver pro-vision. HEW explained that it was instead considering whether certain types of behavioral research and research with data should be exempt from the regulations altogether and thus not subject to a consent re-quirement at all.350 HEW sought comments on how to handle research with data. What is striking is that the unconsented use of data was, at that time, a matter of considerable indifference. Fewer than twenty commenters discussed the proposed exemption for studies with exist- 343. Protection of Human Subjects, 39 Fed. Reg. 18,914 (May 30, 1974) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 46). 344.

This type of research later gained importance as post-1980 advances in information technology made it possible to link patients' records from multiple sources to form LHRs356 \u2014 a process that requires at least some access to identifying information.357 The National Commission, in its 1978 report, had called for a mechanism to allow unconsented research access to identified data and records.358 HEW and its succes-sor, HHS, did not address this recommendation in their 1979 to 1981 rulemaking process. The final regulation promulgated in 1981 did, however, insert a waiver provision359 identical to the one that still exists in the Common Rule.360 In explaining why it had inserted this provision so late in the regulatory proceedings, HHS made no reference to nonconsensual data use. Rather, the waiver provision was a response to an altogether different problem: research into the optimal design of federal benefit programs.361 This explains why the Common Rule's waiver provision contains no public use requirement for nonconsensual data access. 351.

HHS was responding to Crane v. Mathews, 417 F. Supp. 532 (N.D. Ga. 1976), which had held that IRB review should have applied to certain randomized studies that varied Medicaid benefits to observe impacts on beneficiaries' con-sumption of healthcare. HEW had responded hastily with a strained interpretation of the Common Rule that attempted to place such studies outside the scope of its regulations. See Secretary's Interpretation of \"Subject at Risk\", 41 Fed. Reg. 26,572 (Jun. 28, 1976). The issue continued to simmer and, as HHS promulgated the final revised regulations in 1981, it tried a different solution: HHS admitted that such research should be subject to IRB review but added a provision to allow waiver of informed consent. Final Regulations Amending Basic HHS Policy for the Protection of Human Research Subjects, 46 Fed. Reg. at 8383. No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 123 The waiver provision, when initially implemented, was not intended for use in approving nonconsensual data uses, so it did not incorporate the balancing test the National Commission had recommended.362 When the waiver provision was later pressed into service for approv-ing nonconsensual data uses, the waiver criteria were not updated for this new purpose. The more recent HIPAA waiver provision presents a different sto-ry. The HIPAA Privacy Rule, though it has been criticized, was the product of a thoughtful and well-researched rulemaking process.363 When developing its proposed regulation, HHS understood that waiv-ing consent for informational research raises issues that would not be adequately addressed by simply copying the waiver criteria of the Common Rule.364 Instead, HHS started from scratch and proposed a new set of waiver criteria. These included a requirement that an IRB make a determination that \"the research is of sufficient importance so as to outweigh the intrusion of the privacy of the individual whose information is subject to the disclosure.\"365 Unfortunately, this criteri-on drew \"a large number\" of adverse comments.366 Some commenters warned that the criterion was subjective and would be inconsistently applied by IRBs; others criticized its reliance on conflicting value judgments as to whether research is important.367 In response to these comments, the December 2000 version of the HIPAA Privacy Rule368 revised the balancing criterion, conforming it to a familiar test that IRBs routinely perform when approving any research, whether consented or unconsented: the risks of research must be reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits of the re-search \u2014 if any \u2014 to the individual and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the re-search.369 This change was wrongheaded. This criterion, which ap-pears at section 46.111(a)(2) of the Common Rule, is a minimum threshold for acceptability of research.370 Research that does not meet this criterion is considered so devoid of scientific merit that an IRB 362.

This was not the sort of public use requirement the National Commission had proposed. HHS had an opportunity to correct this error two years later, when a new administration asked HHS to revisit the HIPAA Privacy Rule.372 Unfortunately, the correction took the form of jettisoning the troublesome balancing requirement altogether.373 The currently effec-tive HIPAA waiver provision, like its counterpart in the Common Rule, has no requirement that the proposed research offer any public benefit.374 These waiver provisions are functionally equivalent to a private delegation of takings power375 without any public use re-quirement whatsoever. 2. Clarifying the Concept of Public Use of Data in Research Those who expressed concern during the first HIPAA rulemaking about IRBs' ability to balance public and private interests376 may have had a point. Utilitarian balancing is fundamentally at odds with the autonomy-based bioethical principles these regulations seek to up-hold. The interests in the balance are incommensurable.377 Miller has pointed out that even if research has high social value, if consent is logistically difficult or impossible to obtain, and if a consent require-ment may undercut the scientific validity of results, these facts \"do not in themselves constitute valid ethical reasons for waiving a re-quirement of informed consent.\"378 The field of bioethics has drawn heavily on an atomistic concept of autonomy that portrays individuals as \"self-reliant, self-governing, 371.

Modern takings jurispru-dence has been equally unable to resolve such trade-offs.384 Nonconsensual research use of data is a \"muddle\"385 strikingly similar to the one that has afflicted regulatory takings jurisprudence386 in the years after Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City.387 In that case, the Supreme Court applied utilitarian balancing of public and private interests to deny compensation to Penn Central when the city's Landmark Commission restricted its ability to develop the airspace above Grand Central Station, even though the restriction inflicted a major financial loss on Penn Central for the public's bene-fit.388 The Court applied a deferential \"rational basis\" review that pre-sumed \"regulation has high social value whenever it is 'reasonably related to the promotion of the general welfare.'\"389 The HIPAA and Common Rule waiver criteria abandon even the attempt to perform utilitarian balancing. This amounts to a presumption that information-al research has high social value. This arguably may be the right deci-sion: research generates positive externalities, and it is hard to assess 379.

It may be that it benefits society to encourage all research; however, this is a deci-sion that a society needs to make through deliberation.390 After re-viewing the development of today's waiver criteria, it is obvious this deliberation never took place. 3. Developing a Workable Public Use Criterion For waivers to merit public trust, a workable public use criterion needs to be enunciated. The takings muddle suggests by analogy that there will be no easy solution. However, it also offers a number of possible approaches that may be worth exploring. A. Focus Not on How Decisions Should Be Made, but by Whom Deciding which lines of research offer substantial social benefits requires a global perspective that local IRBs do not possess. A cen-tralized, national oversight body or a legislature is better positioned to assess which lines of research warrant nonconsensual data access. One possible approach would be to form a publicly accountable body to identify general categories of research that offer public benefit. Pa-tient advocacy groups could petition it to allow data access for re-search into their \"pet\" diseases, much as they lobby Congress for research funding for specific diseases today.391 When Congress has authorized specific lines of health informational research, as it did in FDAAA392 and in the comparative effectiveness provisions of the Pa-tient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010,393 this should be treated as a Blackstonian \"consent of the people\" to the research. Pri-vate IRBs should not be tasked with second-guessing determinations of public benefit that a duly elected legislature has already made. In an exercise of their enforcement discretion, OHRP and OCR could issue guidance creating a safe harbor that deems data holders to have 390. See DANIEL CALLAHAN, WHAT PRICE BETTER HEALTH? (2006) (listing issues a so-ciety should resolve through deliberation and challenging the notion that medical research is inherently good and should be pursued without regard to the burdens it places on competing values). 391.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 127 complied with the regulations when they make data available for leg-islatively authorized research uses. B. Develop Rules of Thumb for Identifying Suspect, \"Non-Public\" Uses of Data Merrill has suggested an analytical approach that focuses on iden-tifying the traits that cause some takings to lack sufficient public pur-pose.394 These presumptively private uses then can be singled out for more skeptical regulatory oversight.395 In the same way, it may be easier to state what a publicly beneficial use of data is not than to specify what it is. The idea is to develop a list of red flags that weaken the presumption that a proposed research use of data offers public benefit. To take one example, there is not presently a health informa-tional research registry that serves the same purpose as ClinicalTri-als.gov, where sponsors of clinical trials disclose information about their planned projects.396 It sometimes is alleged that academic and commercial researchers would be reluctant to disclose their planned informational research activities, since doing so would give away their corporate strategies and research ideas. Unwillingness to disclose research plans might be viewed as a red flag signaling that a data use has primarily a private purpose. Private-purpose data uses still would be allowed, but they would require informed consent. Persons wishing to use the public's health information must be prepared to disclose what they intend to do with it. C. Reject Utilitarian Balancing in Favor of Natural Rights Analysis Nineteenth-century state courts analyzed takings cases under nat-ural rights principles that grounded property rights in hood397 \u2014 an approach that bears considerable resemblance to modern bioethical analysis that grounds privacy rights in autonomy. Claeys has argued rather persuasively that the old natural rights analy-sis did a better job of drawing sensible lines than modern utilitarian balancing can do.398 Of particular interest are cases where state ac- 394. See Merrill, supra note 61, at 90-92 (identifying a need for heightened scrutiny of takings in which there is high subjective valuation of the taken property, there is a potential for secondary rent seeking, and where there has been an intentional or negligent bypass of a thick market). 395.

In the latter problem, monetary compensation is not at stake;401 what is at stake is whether the activity will be subject to the Common Rule's oversight requirements. Natural rights analysis held that owners are not entitled to takings compensation when they receive \"implicit in-kind\" tion402 \u2014 for example, when each homeowner who is forced to make improvements enjoys \"reciprocity of advantage\"403 and will benefit from the improvements others are forced to install.404 This was cast as the state using its police powers to force a mutually advantageous ex-change that would be hard for individuals to organize by themselves; each affected person gives something to, and gets something from, the others. When there was no reciprocity of advantage \u2014 that is, when the burdens of a measure to benefit the public were disproportionately visited on some community members \u2014 the action was a taking, and compensation was owed.405 The notion of reciprocity of advantage survives in modern bioeth-ical criteria for assessing whether a particular data use is \"public health practice\" that can be conducted without informed consent.406 If (\"Takings law gets muddled only when it applies a certain kind of utilitarian property theory to regulatory takings.\"). 399.

No. 1] Much Ado About Data Ownership 129 benefits of a study will flow primarily to the people whose data are used, as opposed to being generalizable to other populations, this weighs in favor of a finding that the study is public health practice.407 The criterion of \"benefits internal to the community\" is simply reci-procity of advantage under a different name. Unfortunately, modern IRBs use this criterion in combination with other criteria \u2014 such as generalizability of results \u2014 that often muddy the waters.408 The nine-teenth-century cases treated reciprocity as central to the analysis. A similar focus could help identify which nonconsensual uses of data are acceptable and warrant public trust even in an environment of strong respect for individual autonomy. Nonconsensual research uses of data held in large regionally or nationally scaled data networks can be conceptualized as mutually advantageous exchanges. In this light, research in very large data networks actually has stronger ethical justi-fication than does research with smaller datasets that force \"some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\"409 These and other possible solutions need to be explored. The aim here is not to advance a particular solution but rather to focus atten-tion on the critical and long-neglected question: what is an appropriate public use of private data, and how should that decision be made? VI. CONCLUSION The primary aim of this Article is to critique recent data propertization proposals. While ultimately flawed, these proposals offer a kernel of conceptual value. The property analogy supplies a helpful lens for viewing a central problem in the debate about the Common Rule and HIPAA Privacy Rule \u2014 specifically, how to ad-dress the conflict between patients' desire to control their data and the public's need to use those data for various worthy purposes. This lens brings into focus two problems that have been neglected in the debate over access and privacy: that existing regulations, as applied, drasti-cally narrow the state's police power to harness data for public bene-fit, and that they fail to subject nonconsensual use of data in informational research to any public use requirement. Reforms to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule are unlikely to resolve the debate if these problems remain unaddressed. It is not a foregone conclusion, however, that regulatory amend-ments will be required to address the problems identified in this Arti-cle. The Secretary of HHS has discretion, under the existing Common 407. Id. at 9, 52. 408. Id. at 15, 47-52. 409. Armstrong v.

Through an exercise of this authority, the Common Rule's treat-ment of public health uses could be brought in line with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Guidance from the OCR could help IRBs understand their role under the latter regulation, which treats public health disclo-sures appropriately but is widely misunderstood. The use of guid-ance \u2014 by OHRP for the Common Rule, and by the OCR for the HIPAA Privacy Rule \u2014 offers a promising way to clarify criteria for granting waivers to allow nonconsensual use of data in informational research. For example, a suitably skilled and representative advisory body could grapple with the task of characterizing classes of informa-tional research that presumptively amount to a legitimate public use. The OCR and OHRP then could exercise their enforcement discretion to issue guidance creating a safe harbor that deems IRBs to have complied with the waiver criteria when approving such uses but ex-poses IRBs to further scrutiny when they do not. The point of this discussion is that the problems identified in this Article are not neces-sarily difficult to address; they simply have been overlooked. This neglect counts as a seminal failure in federal efforts to appropriately regulate health privacy and data access over the past forty years. The long and intractable debate surrounding privacy, public health uses of data, and informational research is the open sore that came of this ne-glect. The neglect needs to end now. 410. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.101(c) (2010). "}
