This allows client to experience the healing, loving and comforting Energy of their own, unique Spiritual support, including their loved ones in Spirit. During Reflexology these amazing and palpable energies of Love, Peace, Comfort and healing are channeled into the client's body through their energy field, Chakras, foot reflexology points and nervous system. The effect is quite transforming. Clients commonly report that they have never experienced anything like it. Feelings of Peace, Love, incredible relaxation, lightness, joy, hope, well-being, release of pain (emotional and physical) and more are enjoyed. Messages of encouragement and love from Spirit Guides and loved-ones in spirit are commonly felt, seen and/or heard by clients during their sessions. "}
