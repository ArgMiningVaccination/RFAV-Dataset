It is a chronic and progressive condition where people continue to masturbate despite personal and social consequences. Though chronic masturbation is treatable, many individuals are reluctant to seek treatment due to social stigma and personal shame.1,2 What Is Masturbation Addiction? Masturbation addiction happens when someone can no longer suppress their urges to masturbate and, consequently, compulsively engage in the behavior. Using the term \"masturbation addiction\" is controversial, as there is not significant enough research to support it being a standalone diagnosable condition.3 Many professionals refer to it as \"compulsive masturbation,\" which may occur as a symptom of other diagnosable disorders.3 Unfortunately, research is limited due to social stigma and personal shame. Although masturbation is a healthy practice in moderation, excessive masturbation may bring with it many negative consequences.4 In either case, healthy or unhealthy, it is considered a relatively taboo topic often due to familial, societal, or religious shame associated with masturbation.2 One large survey revealed that 78% of adults masturbate.5 Regardless, the stigma has led toward those struggling with the condition to experience internalized messages of shame and sin surrounding masturbation.2 What Is Considered Excessive Masturbation? Masturbation is considered to be a problem when it starts to mirror other forms of [behavioral addictions](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/behavioral-addictions/). Signs of a masturbation problem might include:3 - Masturbating takes up a lot of your time and energy - Your home, work, or personal life is suffering because of masturbation - You might be late to meetings, cancel events, or leave social appointments early to masturbate - You masturbate in public or in uncomfortable places because you can't wait to get home - You masturbate even when you don't feel aroused, sexual, or \"horny\" - When you feel negative emotions\u2014such as anger, anxiety, stress, or sadness\u2014your go-to response is to masturbate for comfort - You feel guilty, distressed, or upset after masturbating - You masturbate even if you don't want to - You find it difficult to stop thinking about masturbation - When not masturbating, you experience craving or withdrawal symptoms Note that what is considered \"normal masturbation\" does vary by person, and daily masturbation does not by itself indicate a problem.1 Is Chronic Masturbation Bad for You? Masturbation is a natural behavior, and in moderation can even have positive mental and physical health effects. However, overdoing it can be bad for you. Excessive masturbation side effects might include: [Low self-esteem](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/low-self-esteem/) - Low sexual satisfaction with partners - Inhibits other [healthy coping mechanisms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/coping-mechanisms/) - Interferes with interpersonal connections Chronic Masturbation Symptoms Because masturbation addiction is not a formally recognized diagnosable disorder, it is important to note that the term \"symptoms\" in this case more so refers to a classifying set of criteria for said condition. Symptoms will vary in number and intensity depending on the individual and severity of the addiction. Generally, the more severe the addiction, the more severe the symptoms. Such symptoms do impact the individual among all domains including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social. Common symptoms of masturbation addiction include:1 - Loss of sensitivity - Lack of impulse control - Shame about masturbation - Guilt about masturbation - Overstimulation from excess masturbation [Sexual dysfunction](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/sexual-disorders/) If any of these symptoms are experienced, it is important to take pause and speak to someone. Causes of Masturbation Addiction Like its symptoms, causes and triggers of masturbation addiction will vary by individual. Again, these may be impacted by personal predispositions and social influences.8 The more causes and triggers that are present in someone's life, the greater the potential susceptibility. With an awareness of these risk factors, more proactive measures may be taken to prevent a problem. Here are several causes and risk factors for compulsive sexual behavior:8 - An imbalance of natural brain chemicals - Changes in brain pathways - Conditions that affect the brain - Ease of access to sexual content - Alcohol or drug abuse problems - Another mental health condition - Family conflicts or family members with problems such as addiction - A history of physical or sexual abuse Note that these causes and risk factors need not be initially present for someone to develop masturbation addiction. The addiction may begin out of an intense enjoyment of self-gratification that progressively leads toward changes in brain pathways, an imbalance of brain chemicals, and other problems and conditions. How to Stop a Masturbation Addiction With a proper recovery and maintenance process, it's possible to [stop compulsive masturbating](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/how-to-stop-masturbating/). Though there is no cure\u2014and again, you must remain consistent and intentional\u2014the rewards of recovery may lead toward a fulfilling, successful life without the constant associated urges and behaviors. Here are five tips for stopping compulsive masturbating: 1. Identify & Remove Your Triggers If there are specific times, or situations, which trigger masturbation compulsions, figuring out what those are is a good first step. If you can identify your triggers, you can plan ahead to learn how to cope with the trigger or find ways to avoid it altogether. 2. Join a Support Group Having a support system of other people going through the same situation can be very helpful. Groups like [Sexual Compulsives Anonymous](https://sca-recovery.org/WP/) offer validation and there are many others who could benefit from your validation as well. 3. Consider Reducing Any Stigmas You Feel About Masturbation If you feel shame and guilt from these compulsions, it can help to remember that the behavior is natural and nothing to be ashamed of. It's important to think about where these fears and insecurities come from and learn to heal from them in order for your relationship with sexual activities to be healthier. 4. Be Present in Your Personal Relationships It's important to continue trying to prioritize your friends, family, and partner if you have one. By planning fun activities or having quality time together, it gives you something else to do and provides a good way to lessen the compulsions. 5. Engage in Activities You Enjoy, Like Sports or Gaming Taking time to participate in games or sports, or anything that gets your mind and body engaged, is a good way to get your mind off of masturbation. It's important to find other things that can be fulfilling, keeping you engaged with activities and people you enjoy. Masturbation Addiction Treatment Treatment for masturbation addiction extends beyond just masturbation practices to get to the core of the problem.2 The more comprehensive the treatment, the better. Depending on severity of the condition and personal preference, treatment may entail any one or combination of outpatient therapy, intensive outpatient (IOP), residential treatment, and/or support groups. Chronic Masturbation Therapy It is important to address all underlying factors for treatment to be effective. If other mental health concerns are present, those should be addressed as well. Sometimes, a celibacy contract in which one refrains from masturbation and other sexual activity is a start to help abstain from the unwanted behavior entirely.2 Common topics that may come up during therapy for compulsive masturbation might include:3 - Someone's feelings and behavior around masturbation - Whether they engage in other sexually compulsive behaviors - Problems caused by their masturbation habits - Past traumas - Current stressors or anxiety triggers [Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/) addresses thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors, and can be very effective for treating behavioral compulsions. For example, a common maladaptive belief is, \"I am an undesirable sexual partner.\" The problematic corresponding thought may then be, \"Because others do not find me desirable, I must sexually gratify myself for pleasure. It's all I'll ever get.\" The behavior then ensues. By reframing how one sees oneself and engaging in various behavioral experiments, beliefs, and thoughts, the behaviors may ultimately change. Medication At this time there is not a specific medication prescribed for masturbation addiction.3 It is important to note, however, that other conditions that require medication (e.g. major depressive disorder, alcoholism, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar, etc.) may have led to or have been developed alongside an excessive masturbation habit. In such cases, it is important that patients explore these factors with a prescribing physician and take any medications as prescribed. Talk to your doctor or a psychiatrist if you have mental health concerns that you believe may be helped by medication How to Get Help for Masturbation Addiction Unfortunately, with masturbation addiction not being a formally recognized disorder, it may take some time finding a specialist. Further, it may not be covered by insurance, meaning that cost will come out of pocket. These considerations might require some additional research. You can use an [online therapist directory](https://directory.choosingtherapy.com/directory) to conduct a search for providers assisting with \"compulsive masturbation\" or other addictive disorders. Another option is to visit the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists' referral directory. This organization works with a variety of sexual disorders including masturbation addiction/compulsive masturbation. How to Get Help for a Loved One When helping a loved one it is always important to be as informed about the disorder as possible while remaining as supportive as possible. Part of this means shedding judgment, which may ultimately shame your loved one. As research has indicated, most people masturbate or have at one point in their lives.5 The act itself is normal. It is also important to consider the underlying factors contributing toward this condition becoming an addiction. It is likely that your loved one is struggling in other areas of life. By showing support and being actively engaged in the recovery process, the likelihood of one recovering is increased. Helping a loved one requires much more than telling the other to \"just stop\" and setting boundaries; it requires being there in a supportive role. Signs of Masturbation Addiction in Different Populations For young children and adolescents, it is important to decipher between what is considered \"normal\" versus atypical sexual behavior. Again, sexuality is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, even at a young age. The following warning signs are specific to problematic sexual behavior in general but may be an indicator of potential masturbation addiction as well. Typical and atypical behaviors by age group are as follows: Children 0-4 Typical: Feeling comfortable naked, touching one's own or other children or adult's genitals, watching other adults get undressed Atypical: Masturbating compulsively or to the point of causing self-injury, pretending to have sexual activity, forcing other children to engage in sexual activity, and excessively touching the genitals of others7 Children 5-9 Typical: Wanting privacy in the bathroom, masturbating in private, becoming curious about sexuality Atypical: Engaging in sexual behavior with significantly younger children or animals and entering the rooms of other sleeping children to engage in touch or sexual activity7 Children 10-13 Typical: Using sexual language, desiring romantic relationships, masturbating in private Atypical: Compulsive masturbation, forcing others into sexual activity, exchanging money or goods for said activities, or producing and disseminating sexual images of oneself Children 14-17 Typical: Viewing materials for sexual arousal, discussing sex with friends, engaging in sexual activity with others close in age Atypical: Being preoccupied with sexually aggressive material or illegal pornography, engaging in acts with significantly younger children, and forcing others into sexual activity7 Adults For adults and seniors, problematic masturbation may be a continuation from childhood and/or adolescence or become a new problem. For this age group it may entail expression of a secret sexual fantasy, fulfillment of desired needs that are unfulfilled by one's sexual partner, loneliness, boredom, a coping mechanism, et cetera.2 Regardless of age, the consequences of said addiction are similar but within the context of individual and societal expectations for that age group.
