The rapidly developed [vaccinations]are highly effective in preventing severe [disease] [courses]and have been proven safe. Both natural [infection]and, to a much lower extent, the mRNAbased [vaccinations]can be accompanied by [transient]autoimmune phenomena or onset of diseases]. Objective(s) We [report]here two cases of [multiple sclerosis](MS) with clinical and new radiological signs beginning in close temporal relation to spike (S) [protein] [mRNA]-based [vaccinations]. Aim(s) To establish that the onset of MS in these two cases is very likely caused by CD4+ were sorted after stimulate with positive [autoantigen]pools or SARSCov- 2 Spike [protein], followed [peptide]pools. which have previously been implicated in MS. Conclusion(s) Detailed studies of both peripheral [blood]- and CSFderived CD4+ [T cells]show that the onset of MS in these two cases is very likely caused Dispon\u00edvel Cole\u00e7\u00f5es: "}
