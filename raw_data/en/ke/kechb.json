A prime example is immunotherapy, which harnesses the body's immune system to destroy cancer cells. It was originally approved for patients with later-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the immunotherapy drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for patients with stage 1B, 2 or 3A NSCLC after they have undergone plati - num-based chemotherapy and resection. This \"fairly stagnant\" space, according to one expert, has now become busy with more advances around the corner. In this special issue of CURE , we spoke with three experts in the NSCLC field to discover why this is a major benefit for patients with early-stage NSCLC and what is on the horizon. \"Taking what we know of metastatic disease from patients who get treated with immunotherapy, we know that when immunotherapy works, it works even better than chemotherapy, \" an expert said. \"And that's why we've been very excited to see immunotherapy come in earlier ... to be able to cure more patients. \" Another feature in this special issue focuses on the benefits of sup - portive and palliative care and the unique help they give to patients with lung cancer. The story attempts to squash any misconceptions of these two types of care and shows patients how their quality of life may improve. Other topics addressed in this issue are the potential link between in - flammation caused by depression and outcomes in patients with NSCLC, and a look at removing less lung tissue during surgery in patients with early-stage NSCLC. We also spoke with one of our advocacy group part - ners to learn more about the benefits of seeking a second opinion. One patient wrote about their experience with lung cancer and what they wish they had been told while undergoing treatment. As always, we hope you find our stories inspirational and informative.

Wong, M.D., Ph.D., FRCPCeditor's note LUNG CANCER APRIL 2023 Taking Support to a New Level WHEN PATIENTS ARE UNDERGOING treatment for lung cancer, the expected focus is on treatment options and details. Patients and their families may be surprised when the topic of supportive or palliative care enters the conversation with their cancer team. Patients may assume that supportive or palliative care means end-of-life care, when in fact it is meant to improve a patient's quality of life during treatment. For example, supportive care com - monly addresses physical symptoms associated with lung cancer and side effects associated with cancer therapy. These include cough, shortness of breath, pain, loss of voice and diffi - culty swallowing, nausea and diarrhea, among others. And palliative care often focuses on the social, emotional and financial effects of the disease to boost a patient's well-being. These types of care are meant for patients with lung cancer regardless of their age, the stage at which their can - cer was diagnosed and the treatment they are receiving. Most guidelines from major oncology organizations, which are based on available evidence from studies, recommend the initia - tion of supportive and palliative care at the time a patient received a lung cancer diagnosis so symptoms can be addressed before they potentially become debilitating. In fact, even ag - gressive treatment goes hand-in-hand with these types of care: Studies have shown that when such care is initiated early, patients live longer. Patients who receive it tend to have a better quality of life and outlook. Sometimes patients with lung cancer do not start supportive or palliative care at the so-called right time because either they are not told of the benefits soon enough or there is some hesitancy by the patient to start this type of care because they are mainly focused on their cancer treatment. With the feature in this special issue of CURE , we hope that you learn more about the benefits of both supportive and palliative care and how more efforts are being made to make such care more widely available. DEBU TRIPATHY, M.D. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF Professor of Medicine Chair, Department of Breast Medical Oncology The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center PCH.VECTOR / STOCK.ADOBE.COMWhat I Wish I' d Been Told Before Starting Cancer Treatment By GAYLE SELLERSshare your story CHEMOTHERAPY AFFECTED MY brain in ways I didn't know about ahead of time. It was June 11, 2011, when I received a diagnosis of stage 3B lung cancer. I was 49 years old. Cancer does not run in my family. I had no symptoms and was shocked to hear the diagnosis. I had gone to my personal physician for pain in my right side, thinking that it was from exercising. He ordered an X-ray, and after viewing the results he referred me to a pulmonologist. The pulmonologist then ordered a PET scan. The results showed a shadow in my left lung, so I was sent to a surgeon for a biopsy, which confirmed I had lung cancer. I was immediately sent to medical and radiation oncologists. Because the cancer had spread to the right lung as well, I could not have surgery. So I went through six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation. Fortunately, I had no side effects. I didn't mind that I could eat anything I wanted and not gain weight. I'm a member of Weight Watchers and had lost 100 pounds prior to my diagno - sis, so it was great to enjoy foods I never would have eaten otherwise. A year later, I received a diagnosis of brain cancer after I had a seizure. No one had told me about the risk for brain metastases, and it was then that I learned about the blood-brain barrier. Chemotherapy is a poison that kills both bad and good cells in the body, but the head has a barrier that keeps chemo out of the brain. I underwent whole-brain radiation and that's when I lost my hair and started wearing hats. Wigs were not my thing. I was teaching Junior Achieve - ment in elementary schools, and a second grader asked me why I wore a hat (not knowing that I was bald). I said it keeps my head warm. He replied that his dad wore a hat, too, because he was bald. I continued to have metastasis along my cancer journey and was treated with only radiation, no more chemo. My oncologists told me that my body accepted radiation well, and apparently it did. After a few more bouts of cancer, including another lesion on the brain, I have been cancer free for five years. I continue to get CAT scans and MRI scans two or three times a year to be sure there is nothing new. One of those MRIs showed fluid in my brain \u2014 another thing I wish I was told could happen. The blood-brain barrier didn't let the fluid that was created by the lesions being destroyed by radiation drain. Therefore, I had brain surgery to release the fluid and gather some of the surrounding cells, which were biopsied at the same time. Fortunately, nothing showed any cancer. I had a lot of support from my fam - ily, close friends, my Weight Watchers members (I am a leader of classes and had to get substitutes during my treat - ment) and definitely from the Supreme Being above. I never cried, never doubt - ed that I would get through everything that came my way, never questioned why this was happening and totally trusted my doctors. My attitude was and always is positive. I learned a lot along my journey, un - fortunately, by having different areas of metastasis. That is the main thing that I wish: that I had been more in - formed of what could happen. However, I am overwhelmed with the fact that I'm still here, alive and kicking! The advice I would give to anyone affected by cancer is that a positive attitude means everything. I'm coming up on 12 years since my original diagnosis and looking forward to many more years cancer free.

By DON VAUGHANEARLY SUPPORTIVE CARE Extends Life, Eases SymptomsMILLETSTUDIO / STOCK.ADOBE.COM CURETODAY.COM APRIL 2023 \u00b7 LUNG CANCER 11Anna Bass, 62 , of Victoria, Virginia, had been a longtime smoker, so she was not surprised in October 2016 when she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in her right lung. Her doctor had noticed a small spot on a CT scan two years earlier after she quit smoking. She had opted to hold off treatment, hoping that the lesion would not grow larger. Bass, a secretary at Victoria Baptist Church, underwent a lobectomy to remove the top right lobe of her lung. She was happy to learn that she required no further treatment. \"My brother-in-law is an oncologist, and he said if they didn't tell me to get chemotherapy or radiation therapy, it was because they weren't necessary,\" Bass recalls. Throughout her cancer journey, Bass received an array of supportive care from her medical team, friends and family. Nurses addressed her pain, helped her learn to breathe properly again and demonstrated how to use an oxygen concentrator. She was encouraged to exercise, so she started walking. 12 LUNG CANCER \u00b7APRIL 2023 CURETODAY.COM FEATURE supportive careBut the most significant support Bass says she received from her care team was reassurance that her cancer had a good chance of being eliminated and likely would not reoccur. \"They told me that the cancer had been slow growing, the biopsy had clear margins and they would be following me for the rest of my life,\" Bass says. \"Today I'm cancer free.\" Bass's story illustrates the many benefits of supportive care for patients with lung cancer, a population that tends to skew older and have more comorbid conditions than those with other forms of cancer. Bass, for example, has chronic obstructive pulmo - nary disease and is a recovering alcoholic, which restricts her use of opioids to alleviate pain. When started early in the treat - ment continuum, guidelines show, supportive care can help patients live longer, improve their quality of life and cope better with the side effects of their disease and treatment, as well as comorbid conditions. The terms supportive care and palliative care are sometimes used interchangeably, but there can be differences. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer defines supportive care as \"the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side effects across the continuum of the cancer experience from diagnosis through treatment to posttreatment care.\" Palliative care, according to the Center to Advance Palliative Care, is \"specialized medical care for people JOEL WHITE The biopsy had clear margins and (my team) would be following me for the rest of my life.

It is focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness \u2014 whatever the diagnosis. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.\" Treatment Advances IMPROVE OUTCOMES Lung cancer is a prevalent disease with a high incidence rate, so it has received a lot of attention from researchers over the years. This has led to advances in treat - ment and supportive care. \"This patient population still has a lot of needs, but the good news is that their prognosis and their experi - ence have gotten better,\" says Dr. Jennifer Temel, co-director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Cancer Outcomes Research and Education Program and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \"Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have (become) more effective, so patients are living longer. And for the most part, the physical symptoms associated with these treatments are less. This doesn't obviate the need for supportive and palliative care for lung cancer patients, but I think their needs have changed over time and they are becoming more like other advanced cancer populations.\" Supportive and palliative care for patients with lung cancer commonly involve the entire care team, observes Betty Ferrell, director of nursing research and education and a professor at City of Hope in Duarte, California. A care team includes physicians, nurses, social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nutritionists, chaplains, psycholo - gists and psychiatrists. Other aspects may include such novel approaches as music therapy, art therapy, acupuncture and massage. \"There are four key disciplines in (patient) care: medicine, nursing, social work and chaplaincy,\" Ferrell says. \"Physicians evaluate the patient's medical condition, while nurses do a lot of symptom management and handle other responsibilities. The social worker assists the patient and family with issues such as finances, transporta - tion, and in-home services \u2014 you can't provide good palliative care without a social worker. And chap - laincy addresses the patient's spiri - tual needs. Chaplaincy is critical.\" Dr. Arif Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer ANNA BASS ' supportive care team taught her how to breathe again, motivated her to exercise more and helped her return to her life. JOEL WHITE14 LUNG CANCER \u00b7APRIL 2023 CURETODAY.COM FEATURE supportive careSociety and an associate professor of medicine and population health sciences at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, agrees that spiritual support is vital. \"Chaplaincy can help when patients have existential questions, such as 'Why did the cancer happen to me? I've always been a good person,'\" he says. \"That question usually does not have a scientific answer, but a chaplain can be very helpful in helping the patient work through it.\" On the medical side, supportive and palliative care can address symptoms unique to patients with lung cancer, Kamal adds. These include shortness of breath, cough, difficulty swallowing, loss of voice, coughing up blood, confusion and issues around brain metastases. The Importance of STARTING EARLY Almost all accepted treatment guidelines recommend that supportive and palliative care be started at the time of diagnosis in order to address the symptoms and side effects of treatment before they become debilitating. However, this often is not the case, Ferrell says. \"When people come to us with lung cancer, everyone is focused on treating the cancer \u2014 no one wants to talk about palliative care,\" she explains. \"Everyone's response is, 'It's not time yet, let's just start chemotherapy, then maybe later we'll start palliative care.' As a result, patients may not receive the supportive care they need until months after they should have. By the time they receive it, their quality of life has been severely impacted.\" Temel says, \"We as a research and clinical community still have to find that sweet spot of figuring out how and when to integrate palliative care at the best time. But based on the data, early integration of palliative care for patients with challenging physical or psychological symptoms is still the best strategy.\" According to Temel, Massachusetts General Hospital was among the first institutions to demonstrate the benefits of initiating supportive and palliative care at the time of diagnosis. \"More than a decade ago, we published a paper that showed that when you involve palliative care early in the course of illness for patients with incurable lung cancer, they have a better experience with their cancer and have better outcomes,\" she notes. \"They have better quality of life, fewer symp - toms of depression, spend less time receiving chemotherapy and have better outcomes at the end of life.\" Whereas a patient's care team addresses the physical and emotional impacts of treatment, friends and family also play a critical role in supportive care. But there is always the risk of burnout. \"If you're caring for someone with lung cancer, you're a 24-hour caregiver,\" Ferrell says. \"That can be a huge burden on some family members.\" Lisa, who asked that her last name not be used, is a writer and publisher in Raleigh, North Carolina. She was a caregiver for her older sister during her lung cancer journey starting in 2014. She assisted her sister with everything from housing and meals to transportation to and from treatment. Although she was happy to help, Lisa admits that the two years of caregiving were extremely stressful. \"There were times when my sister could be so critical that it was hurtful,\" Lisa recalls. \"Things were so hard at times that my goddaughter and I would go away so I could regain my composure. We would have a vent session and try to reboot my compassion meter.\" The family caregiving experience was far less dramatic for Christy Dawkins, 51 , of Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina. When she received a diagnosis of stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer in December 2019, her husband enthusiastically jumped into the role of caregiver. He took a monthlong sabbatical from work to care for her, doing all he could to keep her spirits up. \"He was there for me through all of the trips to receive radiation treatment and everything,\" Dawkins says. \"He really helped me through it.\" Meanwhile, family friends created a meal train on Facebook so that the family wouldn't have to worry about (My husband) was there for me through all of the trips to receive radiation treatment. \u2014 Christy Dawkins DAILEY ALEXANDRA PHOTOGRAPHYFEATURE CHRISTY DAWKINS also had the support of her family friends to take care of tasks at home like cooking. CURETODAY.COM LUNG CANCER 1516 LUNG CANCER \u00b7APRIL 2023 CURETODAY.COM cooking during such a stressful time. \"We had people dropping off meals every night,\" Dawkins recalls. \"That was a huge help.\" Addressing EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS Because lung cancer is more commonly diagnosed in older people, many family caregivers are older themselves and may be dealing with their own health issues, such as diabetes, heart failure and arthritis, Ferrell says. But their involvement can be extremely important to the patient. They are an additional pair of eyes and ears, and they often are directly involved in making sure the patient receives the care they need. But the heaviest burden they may bear is managing the patient's emotional symptoms. \"We often don't realize the role that caregivers play in helping patients to keep going despite depression or anxiety,\" Ferrell notes. \"There's a lot of fear, anxiety and emotions associated with living with lung cancer.\" Though supportive care for patients with lung cancer has been an integral part of treatment for many years, misconceptions still persist. \"Most common is the belief that palliative care and hospice are synonymous, so that when we talk about palliative care, sometimes patients and their families have worries that that means they're at the end of life,\" Temel explains. \"It's up to doctors, nurses and social workers to explain the distinction between palliative care and hospice care and the role of both services to allay those fears so patients are more accepting of the involvement of palliative care.\" Kamal agrees. \"There must be educational campaigns that teach people how the emphasis during these conversations is not on end-of-life planning,\" he says. \"In my clinical practice, most patients are not dying. I have a large number of patients who have been seeing me for years because what we're talking about is long-term distress, as opposed to an acute end-of- life type plan.\" Ideally, supportive and palliative care discussions are initiated by the patient's medical team at the time of diagnosis. If that doesn't happen, the patient and family caregivers should inquire about needed services, Ferrell says. \"If my spouse or a parent is diagnosed with lung cancer, what do I want as a spouse or daughter? I want them to receive the best care possible,\" she says. \"So that's the question every patient and caregiver should ask: 'What about palliative care?' \" Concludes Temel: \"I often remind my patients and their families, especially if I think they would benefit from something like pallia - tive care but are resistant, that having cancer is hard for everyone and they should at least be open to accepting any support we can give them. Patients and their families talk about how it takes a village on their side to get through a cancer diagnosis. But it also takes a village on the clinician side. As an oncologist, I'm always going to do whatever I can to support my patients and their families. But the struggle is significant, so I rely on my colleagues who are social workers, nutritionists and psychologists to help out. Patients should take advantage of all of the services we have to help them navigate this very challenging time in their life.\" DAILEY ALEXANDRA PHOTOGRAPHY CHRISTY DAWKINS learned how critical a support system is during cancer treatment and beyond.Be the first to hear the latest news on clinical trial availability and enrollments!

But as cancer therapies advance, treat - ments that were once out of reach for many patients with NSCLC have become available. A therapy that began its history as a last resort has slowly made its way into frontline settings, and researchers continue to discover novel treatments. And each new discovery saves lives. One example of progress in lung cancer is the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA 's) January approval of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for patients with stage 1B, 2 or 3A following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy. Keytruda is an immunotherapy drug that has been approved for a variety of cancers, including advanced (metastatic) lung cancer, but was only recently approved as a post-surgery, or adjuvant, therapy for patients with early-stage NSCLC who have also been treated with chemotherapy. \"This is clearly a very busy space,\" Chaft says of NSCLC research. \"Postoperative and preoperative spaces were stagnant for decades. And then, in the last 3 years, we've now seen some advances, (and) we can bring therapies proven to be benefi - cial for patients with metastatic cancer into the earlier stage.\" FOR TREATING EARLY-STAGE NSCLC TREATMENT FOR THESE PATIENTS HAS EVOLVED TO INCLUDE IMMUNOTHERAPY AFTER SURGERY AND CHEMOTHERAPY. By ANDY POLHAMUS THE WA Y FUTUREof the THE WA Y FUTUREFEATURE20 LUNG CANCER \u00b7APRIL 2023 CURETODAY.COM FEATURE early-stage nsclc MECHANISM OF ACTION & INDICATIONS FOR KEYTRUDA Like all immunotherapies, Keytruda harnesses the power of the body's natural immunity to kill cancer. Keytruda is a PD-1 inhibitor, meaning it blocks the production of a cell protein called PD-L1, which is involved in the proliferation of tumor cells and evasion of natural tumor immunity. By blocking PD-1, Keytruda allows the body's immune system to attack tumors. \"(Keytruda) goes back about eight years at this point in terms of lung cancer,\" explains Dr. Dwight H. Owen, a medical oncologist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center-The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute in Columbus. \" At least for (NSCLC), the first approvals were only for stage 4 or metastatic disease \u2014 and only after previous treatment with chemotherapy.\" Although initial studies earned the drug approvals for use in patients with tumors expressing high levels of PD-L1, further research found that the drug could benefit patients with NSCLC regardless of their PD-L1 status. This makes Keytruda the second immunotherapy to be approved as a post-surgical treatment in patients with earlier-stage NSCLC. The first, Tecentriq (atezolizumab), was approved in 2021, but that indication only applied to patients with PD-1 expression. One striking thing about Keytruda is that although it is a PD-L1 inhibitor, patients can receive \u2014 and benefit \u2014 from Keytruda regardless of their PD-L1 expression levels. \"The way that immunotherapy works is, it tries to reorient our own immune system to attack the cancer cells,\" Owen explains. \"In theory, our immune system should recognize cancer cells as bad actors. They're not behaving the way that they're supposed to; they're growing when they're not supposed to. So they should be recognized by the immune system, which should attack and kill them. Some cancers develop a camouflage to protect cancer cells from the immune system. And what these immune drugs do is essentially remove the camouflage, allowing the immune system to recognize, engage, destroy and then remember what those cancer cells look like to go on and destroy other cancer cells.\" What makes the use of immuno - therapy important in patients with early-stage NSCLC is that early treat - ment offers the best chance of a cure. \"Over the last few decades, we've realized that surgery alone is curative for some patients with early-stage lung cancer but not nearly as many as we hope,\" Owen says. \"The reason for that is almost certainly because there is still 'microscopic' or 'micro - metastatic' disease left behind.\" This is when the use of adjuvant therapies that get rid of any remaining tumor cells becomes crucial. \"Taking what we know from metastatic disease from patients who get treated with immunotherapy, we know that when immunotherapy works, it works even better than chemotherapy,\" Owen says. \" And that's why we've been very excited to see immunotherapy come in earlier into the disease to be able to cure more patients.\" The FDA based its approval of Keytruda for use in early-stage NSCLC on findings from the KEYNOTE-091 trial, which included 1,177 patients with completely resected lung cancer with disease stages ranging from stage 1B to 3A. Investigators in the phase 3 study randomly assigned patients to receive either 200 milligrams of Keytruda or placebo by IV once every 3 weeks for as many as 18 cycles. Most patients (86%) also received platinum-based chemotherapy after their surgeries. Investigators reported that patients assigned to Keytruda had a median disease-free survival that was nearly a year longer than that of patients assigned to placebo: 53.6 months in the Keytruda group compared with 42 months in the placebo group. This means that patients assigned to take Keytruda after surgery and platinum- based chemotherapy were disease free for 11.2 months longer than those who received placebo following surgery and chemotherapy. Dr. Michael Rotkowitz, a medical oncologist with Jefferson Health in Sewell and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, notes that the drug's improvement in disease-free survival is particu - larly important. \"What we know historically is that for stage 2, 3A and even stage 1, the recurrence risks after surgery are over 50%,\" Rotkowitz says. \"The KEYNOTE-091 trial shows a reduc - tion in recurrence risk \u2014 a marked disease-free survival benefit. I think this will be practice changing.\" Although a small minority of patients included in the study did not undergo platinum-based chemotherapy, those who did receive chemotherapy appeared to fare significantly better than those who did not. Using both chemotherapy and immunotherapy appeared espe - cially effective. In KEYNOTE-091, the median length of disease- free survival for patients who underwent platinum-based chemotherapy and were assigned to Keytruda was reported at 58.7 months compared with 34.9 months among patients who THE BATTOYART / STOCK.ADOBE.COMWE'VE BEEN VERY EXCITED TO SEE IMMUNOTHERAPY COME IN EARLIER INTO THE DISEASE TO BE ABLE TO CURE MORE PATIENTS. -Dwight H. OwenCURETODAY.COM APRIL 2023 \u00b7LUNG CANCER 21 FEATURE underwent chemotherapy but were assigned to placebo. There were some limitations in the KEYNOTE-091 study. For one, experts were quick to point out that because it was designed several years ago, it makes use of a cancer staging system that is now out of date. By the current staging system, patients in the KEYNOTE trials would all be considered to have disease in stages 2 to 3. Additionally, one subgroup of patients expected to benefit most from the therapy did not. \"The (Keytruda) data showed improve - ment of disease-free survival irrespective of PD-L1 expression,\" says Chaft. \"Though oddly, it showed that patients with tumors that did not highly express PD-L1 did not benefit as much.\" Chaft added that she suspects this data point was a statistical anomaly rather than an indica - tion of the drug's true therapeutic benefit in this subset of patients. LIMITATIONS & SIDE EFFECTS Patients should be aware that Keytruda does come with side effects, although oncologists consider the drug to generally be well tolerated. Most commonly, patients taking Keytruda by itself have experienced nausea, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, rash, constipation, diarrhea, itching, decreases in appetite, fever, coughing and hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces lower quantities of thyroid hormone than it should. \"The caveat is that anytime you escalate treatment, you are increasing the risk of side effects,\" Owen says. In the KEYNOTE-091 trial, hypo - thyroidism reportedly occurred in 22% of patients, whereas hyperthy - roidism, or an overactive thyroid gland, occurred in 11%. Furthermore, 7% of patients reportedly experi - enced more severe organ inflam - mation including pneumonitis, or inflammation of lung tissue. Two patients in the study died of myocar - ditis (inflammation of the heart). In general, Chaft says immunother - apies are very well tolerated but says that doctors considering Keytruda for patients with early-stage NSCLC should do so on a case-by-case basis. \"We certainly don't want to harm patients by trying to increase their chances of a cure,\" she explains. \"Many of these patients are cured already, either by the surgery or the chemotherapy. Looking at the patient as a whole, what is their likelihood to benefit from the immuno - therapy versus harm?\" Chaft and Owen also point out that people with certain genetic alterations, such as those with EGFR and ALK tumor aberrations, are more likely to benefit from treat - ments targeting those mutations rather than Keytruda. \"If their tumors are driven by one of these genetic alterations, they're not likely to gain benefit (from Keytruda) and would be more appro - priately directed toward a targeted therapy,\" says Chaft. Another important factor for doctors considering Keytruda in this setting is whether the patients have any autoimmune diseases, Chaft notes. In this situation, she says, Keytruda should be avoided. UNMET NEEDS & THE FUTURE OF NSCLC TREATMENT Cancer treatments continue to evolve, particularly in the area of immunotherapy. Rotkowitz pointed out that more and more often, patients receive chemo- immunotherapy before surgical resection, even as adjuvant therapies advance.\"There's been a huge push toward chemo-immunotherapy before surgery, and those patients get chemotherapy with (the immuno - therapy drug) Opdivo (nivolumab),\" he says. \"On the other side, there's been a huge emphasis on moving (therapies) to the front line.\" Chaft agrees. \"Considering preoperative chemo- immunotherapy really may be the way of the future,\" she says. Regulatory approval and the release of new data have already begun to reflect this trend. The FDA in March 2022 approved Opdivo combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a neoadju - vant (presurgical) treatment in early NSCLC. Keytruda also recently made head - lines for another NSCLC study, in which Keytruda plus chemotherapy followed by surgery and post-surgical treatment with Keytruda improved event-free survival (the time after treatment ends that a patient is free from complications or events that treatment aims to prevent or delay) in patients with stage 2, 3A and 3B NSCLC. Chaft notes that in the coming year, data from two additional studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors also will become avail - able, adding to the growing body of evidence and treatment options for immunotherapy in lung cancer. Chaft was also an investigator on a recent study of adjuvant Opdivo. Additional research is also being done in the metastatic setting, with immunotherapy as well novel targeted therapies, says Rotkowitz. Investigators are evaluating options like CAR-T (cell-based) therapy and anti-CLTA-4 (another immune checkpoint like PD-L1) agents. Real progress continues at a rapid pace. \"There's a tremendous amount of research going on,\" he says. \" A tremendous amount of innovation.\" 22 LUNG CANCER \u00b7APRIL 2023 CURETODAY.COM Inflammatory Biomarkers From Lung Cancer, Depression May Predict Survival Outcomes The inflammation associated with lung cancer and depression may impact survival, despite treatments like immunotherapy and targeted therapies. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A. PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO severe depression may have elevated inflam - matory biomarkers shown to predict survival in lung cancer, according to recent study results. Both lung cancer and depression have properties of inflammation, which is the body's response to injury or infection. Chronic inflammation can damage healthy tissues, cells and organs over time. It may also affect how patients respond to treatments like immuno - therapies and targeted therapies, which utilize the patient's immune system. Findings from the study, which were published in PLOS ONE , highlight the importance of screening for and treating depression and anxiety in patients with lung cancer. \"For patients and caregivers, it is important that practices and facilities screen their loved one for depression and anxiety,\" Barbara L. Andersen, professor of psychology at The Ohio State University in Columbus, said in an interview with CURE . \"Screening has been mandated by the Commission on Cancer, so it is important for patients and caregivers to prompt the medical team if screening has not been done. Once screened, it is important for patients (to) take to heart any recommenda - tions for further assessment and provision or referral for treatment for their depression or anxiety.\" The study that Andersen and colleagues conducted included 186 patients with newly diagnosed stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were screened for depression and anxiety at diagnosis and before treatment began. Researchers then used medical record data from blood draws at diagnosis, abstracting cell counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets. The counts were used to calculate three inflammation biomarkers, such as the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes. \"Being aware that both depression and lung cancer have inflammatory properties, we predicted significant effects between the severity of depres - sion at diagnosis and increased systemic inflammation,\" Andersen said. Patients were followed, and analyses confirmed that the three biomarkers predicted two-year overall survival (the time when a patient is still alive) of the patients, which was 61%. As expected by the researchers, predictors of worse overall survival were higher neutrophil-to-lympho - cyte ratio (which indicates an inflam - matory imbalance of the tumor; NLR), higher platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (an indicator of tumor progression; PLR) and lower advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI; a way to assess ongoing inflammation). Researchers tested the link between the three biomarkers and depressive symptoms. Findings demonstrated that patients with moderate or severe depressive symptoms were two to three times more likely to have poor biomarker levels.Andersen noted that although this study focused on patients with NSCLC, it would be anticipated that significant biomarker/depression relationships would be found in patients with small cell lung cancer. \"These biomarkers \u2014 NLR and PLR \u2014 are used across tumor sites and have been predictive of survival,\" she said. \"The markers are not unique to lung cancer, with only ALI being lung cancer-specific. I am confident that this same effect of elevated inflammation and depression severity would be found in patients with small cell (lung cancer).\" Andersen added that she does not want people to discount depression in patients with NSCLC. \"I've heard people say, 'Well, they have cancer; of course they're depressed.' Well, no,\" she said. \"(Most patients with) cancer \u2014 70% (or) 80% of them \u2014 do not have moderate to severe symptoms. But then there' s everyone else \u2014 about 30% \u2014 (who) do have severe symptoms of depres - sion, perhaps major depressive disorder. When severe and untreated, depression is a mental health problem that shows little with time. More likely, it will continue at this level.\" Based on the findings from this study, Andersen recommended patients with NSCLC seek treatment for depression, if it is offered. \"I know that's hard for people with depression to follow through. A symptom of depression is low motivation,\" she said. \"That can feed into reluctance to take a referral for care or begin psychological treatment. Major depression is an insidious illness with toxic effects when left untreated. Fortunately, there are efficacious treatments for both depressive and anxiety symp - toms, with the strongest evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation.\" inflammationCURETODAY.COM APRIL 2023 \u00b7LUNG CANCER 23 For some patients with non-small cell lung cancer, removing part of the lobe rather than the entire lobe still provides benefit, study results show. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A. PATIENTS WITH STAGE 1A non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who undergo surgery to remove a small portion of their lung have outcomes comparable to patients who have surgery removing an entire lobe, according to recent study results. Although the findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that patients with stage 1A NSCLC can benefit from having less lung tissue removed, one of the study's researchers explained that patient selection is critical before making this decision. \"In a group of patients where the cancer is less than 1 inch ... and is near the edge of the lung, you can go in and biopsy the lymph nodes to make sure that the lymph nodes are clean,\" Dr. Nasser Khaled Altorki, chief of thoracic surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said in an interview with CURE . \"If the lymph nodes are clean of cancer, then it's OK to take a section of the lobe, not the whole (lobe). ... So you biopsy the lymph nodes first and make sure that these are small tumors and near the edge of the lung.\" Researchers sought to determine whether outcomes would differ if patients with stage 1A NSCLC under - went a wedge resection (a procedure to remove a tumor with a margin of tissue around it) versus having a lobectomy (removing a whole section of the lung). \"Make believe that you're in an apartment, which is the lobe, and the apartment has rooms,\" Altorki explained. \"Each room is a segment, or you can take a part of the room, which is a wedge. So either one of those is acceptable and results in similar survival or freedom from cancer recur - rence as taking the whole lobe.\" In this phase 3 trial, researchers analyzed data from 697 patients with stage 1A NSCLC, meaning that their tumor was no bigger than 2 centimeters. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo sublobar resection (340 patients) or lobar resection (357 patients) after it was confirmed that their disease had not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Researchers focused on several outcomes, including disease-free survival (time between being randomly assigned and either disease recurrence or all-cause death), overall survival (the length of time a patient with cancer remains alive), lung function and disease recurrence. Patients were followed for a median of seven years. After five years, patients who under - went surgery to remove part of their lung had similar rates of disease-free survival (63.6% versus 64.1%, respec - tively) and overall survival (80.3% versus 78.9%) compared with those who underwent surgery to remove a whole section of the lung. Researchers also did not notice any significant differences between the two groups regarding the incidence of locoregional recurrence (recurrence of cancer in the same area as the original tumor or in nearby lymph nodes) or distant recurrence (cancer that has returned in another part of the body far away from its original site). At six months, patients who under - went surgery to remove part of their lung had improved predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (the volume of air that a patient exhales during a forced breath during a certain period of time) compared with those who had an entire lung removed, although the difference between both groups was just 2 percentage points. Altorki explained that the area of surgical treatment for stage 1A NSCLC has improved drastically over the past 15 to 20 years. Approximately 80% of the procedures to remove a lobe of the lung or less than a lobe now are done minimally invasively, which he called \"an amazing change in how we prac - tice.\" He also said that the mortality risk from surgery or during hospitalization is an estimated 1% when the entire lobe is removed and approximately 0.5% for the removal of less than a lobe. \"It's slightly lower, it's not significantly lower, but it's important,\" Altorki said. \"If you can halve the death rate, that would be great.\" Because the findings from this study confirmed success in removing less than a lobe of the lung in appropriately selected patients with stage 1A NSCLC, Altorki said that the implementation of this surgical tactic may be an easy transition in the operating room. Altorki said, \"I think people were already thinking (that removing less of the lobe would result in similar outcomes) before the trial, and the trial sort of gave them the 'Yes, you're right, you could do that. It's OK.' And it is good for patients. If there's any winner in this, it is the patient who won, because you don't want any more of your body (removed than you) need to.\" DMITRIY KANDINSKIY / STOCK.ADOBE.COM Doing More With CANCER \u00b7APRIL 2023 CURETODAY.COM DRAFTMM / STOCK.ADOBE.COMSOME PATIENTS WITH LUNG cancer may feel timid about seeking a second opinion after receiving a diag - nosis, but this shouldn't be the case. A second opinion may offer a patient more treatment options or give them even more confidence in their primary oncolo - gist's original choice, as well as more education and understanding. Either way, it is important for patients to be open with their medical team about seeking a sec - ond opinion and always to advocate for themselves. As a part of the \"Speaking Out\" video series, on behalf of KRAS Kickers , CURE spoke with their founder, Terri Conneran, about the importance of patients seeking a second opinion and why they shouldn't \"sneak around.\" Q:Q:What does getting a second opinion entail for a patient with lung cancer? A:A:Terri Conneran: It starts with asking for the second opinion. And it shouldn't be something that you're sneaking around about. ... This is a matter of talking to your doctor and saying, \"You know what, let's get a second opinion, let's get another set of eyes on this at a different center.\" Going to see a specialist in lung cancer, that's all they focus on, is so important. ... It's OK to ask. And if your doc - tor is saying, \"I don't know about that,\" be more suspicious because they should want this. Doctors are quite accustomed to peer review, where one doctor talks to another doctor. This is outside of a tumor board, which is an in-house setting that is dif - ferent from going to an outside comprehensive cancer center. Those comprehensive cancer centers have specialists that are up to date on the top-tier, cutting- edge areas of research. And the good news in lung cancer is that research is going so fast that they need to have a specialist. Q:Q:What is the benefit of having a second opinion? How might it hurt a patient if they don't get a second opinion? A:A: Think of your body as being like a fine race car. If I had a Ferrari that needed repairs, I' d want to see a specialist. If I was going to spend a lot of money, I' d want to know that I was doing exactly the right thing. Are you willing to risk your one and only body, your one and only mom or dad or sister or brother, with just one opinion? Or you want to get the second one too? It's that important. And if you choose not to, that's on you. I understand that it's very inconvenient. It's very awkward, it feels a little strange, it feels outside of your comfort zone. But it's important enough to get the full information so you can do what's right. You're not going to get a second chance. And that's a sad thing to say. That's what you're risking. So when you have the second opinion, even if they say, \"Let's do exactly what the first doctor said,\" now you have 100% confidence. You can go into it knowing that's best. If they give you a different choice, that gives you an opportunity. Now you need to drill down a little bit, but you know that there are options. And those options can be lifesaving. Oftentimes it ends SPEAKING OUT LUNG CANCER Don't Sneak Around a Second Opinion An expert discusses the importance of seeking a second opinion during a diagnosis. By COLLEEN MORETTI speaking outCURETODAY.COM APRIL 2023 \u00b7LUNG CANCER 3up being about a biomarker test. Sometimes you're hearing the same information from a second doctor, but you're hearing it in a different way. And that clarity is heartwarm - ing and inspiring to you. Q:Q:How do research hospitals versus actual care play a role here? A:A:Truthfully, I was really afraid of research. I didn't realize that the research that they're doing yester - day is the treatment I'm getting today. And that's exactly what it is that you need to have. The same way that the computers we're walking around with today, 20 years ago they were just kind of a dream. Cancer care has come that far. The chemotherapy that they do today is different than they used to do. Chemo is not always the first-choice option. Some - times you end up on therapy, you may end up on a tar - geted therapy, you may be radiation or something. There are different options, but you're not going to know as a patient. How would you know unless you go and speak to that research doctor? And it should be one at a compre - hensive center, one of the larger centers, because they have the depth the research. Q:Q:How should patients tell their primary oncologist that they are going to seek a second opinion? A:A:Just spit it out. It's OK to say, \"Hey, I' d love to get a second opinion. Where do you suggest?\" Then have the conversation. Your doctor, your oncologist par - ticularly, needs to be on that team. The same way your oncologist may suggest that you get a scan \u2014 they're not doing the scan, they're not actually performing the radia - tion, and they suggest seeing a specialist. You need to go and get that information. But you need to ask for it, and that's really what advocacy boils down to. You're not going to have the knowledge without asking. You can't stop ask - ing. And if you don't understand, ask again. Transcript edited for clarity and conciseness.
