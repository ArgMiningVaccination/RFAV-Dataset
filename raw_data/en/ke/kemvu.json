You're amped up and ready to go \u2014 and you want to make sure nothing gets in the way of you and your weight plates for a solid training session. Or maybe you're completely lacking energy and motivation today, and you want to help get yourself into the right gear. Whatever your situation, you've probably wondered at some point or another about pre-workout. To the uninitiated, [taking pre-workout](https://barbend.com/best-pre-workout-supplements/) to fuel your sessions may seem like the line in the sand between the weekend warriors and the competitive athletes. If you're focused on fitness enough to [want to try pre-workout](https://barbend.com/strongest-pre-workouts/), you're probably thoughtful about what you put in your body. Here, you'll get the scoop on the best natural pre-workout ingredients so you can get all the benefits with none of the [artificial flavors](https://barbend.com/artificial-sweeteners-healthy/). [What Is Avoid Pre-Workout](#4) Editor's note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It's always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. None of these supplements are meant to treat or cure any disease. If you feel you may be deficient in a particular nutrient or nutrients, please seek out a medical professional. What Is Pre-Workout? A pre-workout is a [supplement](https://barbend.com/best-supplements-for-muscle-growth/) meant to enhance performance during your training session. Certain pre-workouts are meant to be all-purpose, while others hone in on a specific aspect of your training that you may want to improve. For example, some pre-workouts are aimed specifically at increasing your [mental focus](https://barbend.com/pre-workout-ingredients-for-focus/), while others are meant to improve [muscle mass and endurance](https://barbend.com/best-pre-workout-supplements/). Generally speaking, most pre-workouts \u2014 except the [non-stim pre-workouts](https://barbend.com/best-non-stim-pre-workouts/) \u2014 contain ingredients like caffeine that are meant to give you a big energy boost. You typically take your [pre-mixed supplement](https://barbend.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-pre-mixed-pre-workout/) \u2014 or mix the pre-workout powder into [your shake](https://barbend.com/best-protein-shakes/) or [water](https://barbend.com/best-water-bottles/) \u2014 about 30 or 45 minutes before your workout. What Goes Into a Good Pre-Workout? There are no set guidelines for [pre-workout ingredients](https://barbend.com/pre-workout-ingredients-for-pump/) so companies are free to choose their own ingredients and dosages, which can vary widely. ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30678328/))( [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30089501/)) You can typically expect some combination of ingredients like caffeine, [branched-chain amino acids](https://barbend.com/best-bcaa-supplements/), [beta-alanine](https://barbend.com/best-beta-alanine/), nitrates, different plant extracts, and [creatine](https://barbend.com/best-creatine-supplements/). Many pre-workouts also assume you're going to be [working up quite a sweat](https://barbend.com/why-dont-i-sweat-when-i-workout/) while you're hoisting all those [barbells](https://barbend.com/best-barbells/) overhead. So they'll come with electrolytes to support your [hydration needs](https://barbend.com/how-much-water-to-drink-a-day/). What Is a Natural Ingredient? [Supplements](https://barbend.com/best-supplements-for-bodybuilding/) do not have to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Still, once they hit the market, the FDA can perform checks on companies regarding labeling requirements. In terms of the ability to call a product \"natural,\" the FDA states [on its website](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/use-term-natural-food-labeling): The FDA has considered the term \"natural\" to mean that nothing artificial or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food that would not normally be expected to be in that food. So if it's got anything patented that was made in a lab, you probably won't be considering it natural. Remember that not everything that's natural is necessarily healthy or desirable. For example, [excess caffeine](https://barbend.com/caffeine-post-workout/) can cause jitters or nausea and may even increase [anxiety](https://barbend.com/post-training-anxiety/) in some lifters. Best Tea Extract Looking for a way to get your caffeine that's not quite coffee-based? [Green tea extract](https://barbend.com/stronggirl-pre-workout-review/) may be a great pick for you. If you're okay with having stimulants in your pre-workout, having some caffeine before your workout has been shown to [increase strength](https://barbend.com/how-to-increase-strength/), endurance, [power](https://barbend.com/how-to-train-power/), and [speed](https://barbend.com/speed-work-powerlifters/). ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30926628/)) Green tea extract doesn't just have caffeine, either. It also boasts the amino acid L-theanine \u2014 which is often touted as [improving focus](https://barbend.com/workout-mindset/) \u2014 and antioxidants, which may help [support all that work. ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21040626/))( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35162826/)) The [L-theanine](https://barbend.com/theanine-benefits-athletes/) in green tea can also have a calming effect \u2014 which can be very helpful amidst all that jitters-inducing caffeine. ( [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475342/)) Watermelon Juice Watermelon contains the amino acid [citrulline](https://barbend.com/best-citrulline-supplements/). Citrulline has been found to elevate the body's level of nitric oxide \u2014 which is helpful because it helps relax your blood vessels, therefore increasing [blood flow](https://barbend.com/what-is-blood-flow-restriction-training/) and lowering blood pressure. ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20499249))( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21067832)) This dilation can have implications for improving blood flow to [your muscles](https://barbend.com/hypertrophy/), which may stimulate nutrient dispersal and growth. Citrulline is a non-essential amino acid, meaning that your body does produce some on its own. Still, due to its potential to give you [a better pump](https://barbend.com/powerlifting-arm-training/), you might want a splash of extra watermelon goodness in your pre-workout. Beetroot Juice Beetroot juice comes from where it sounds like they come from \u2014 [beets](https://barbend.com/beets-pre-workout/). In its pure form, beets contain nitrates, which can help [increase endurance](https://barbend.com/endurance-training-for-strength-athletes/), improve blood pressure, and boost your oxygen uptake while you're [running](https://barbend.com/running-and-strength-training/) or [walking](https://barbend.com/benefits-of-walking/). ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22709704))( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21071588)) The more endurance and [more efficient breathing](https://barbend.com/optimized-breathing-rich-froning-wod-performance-airwaav/) you have, the better your workout is bound to be. Whether you're doing [high-rep sets](https://barbend.com/20-rep-squat-workout/) or getting in much heavier, lower-volume work, efficiency is key. And beets, of all things, can help you get there. Betaine Betaine, also known as trimethylglycine, found in foods like [spinach](https://barbend.com/red-spinach-extract-pre-workout/), beets, [sweet potato](https://barbend.com/give-your-carbs-a-makeover-maple-bacon-sweet-potato-fries/), and [quinoa](https://barbend.com/recipe-stuffed-bell-peppers/). It is a non-essential nutrient \u2014 meaning that your body can produce it in some amounts. [Your pre-workout](https://barbend.com/best-pre-workouts-for-women/) can incorporate any combination of these ingredients or their extracts to provide this nutrient. Adding betaine to your pre-workout can potentially have a positive effect on [muscle size](https://barbend.com/hypertrophy-for-weightlifters/), [work capacity](https://barbend.com/workouts-with-single-dumbbell/), and power. ( to perform an [explosive workout](https://barbend.com/developing-explosive-power-without-barbell/), betaine might come in clutch when you're trying to push [your plyometrics](https://barbend.com/best-plyometric-exercises/) to the max. When you're about to get after it [in the gym](https://barbend.com/best-home-gyms/), it's key to feel confident in your work capacity. Cocoa Extract It's not just yummy. Cocoa extract contains high quantities of the [antioxidant](https://barbend.com/antioxidants/) epicatechin. This is great news for your pre-workout because epicatechin doesn't just increase the amount of [nitric oxide](https://barbend.com/best-nitric-oxide-supplements/) in your bloodstream. It helps increase nitric oxide's bioavailability, which means that the nitric oxide you have in your body can be more effective in the presence of epicatechin. ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16626982)) Epicatechin is also found in tea and [apples](https://barbend.com/apple-cider-vinegars-role-in-supplements/). So if those ingredients show up in your pre-workout, there's likely some epicatechin in there, too. Turmeric You might associate it more with tea or curries, but [turmeric](https://barbend.com/best-turmeric-curcumin-supplements/) may be a helpful pre-workout ingredient, too. This earthy spice contains [curcumin](https://barbend.com/curcumin-benefits/), which can significantly increase your levels of nitric oxide \u2014 which, again, is helpful for increasing blood flow to [your muscles](https://barbend.com/how-to-gain-muscle/) during your workout. ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013352)) Curcumin, a known [anti-inflammatory](https://barbend.com/inflammation-foods/), isn't easy for your body to use on its own. If you'd like to include it in [your pre-workout](https://barbend.com/different-pre-workout-formulations/), look for your pre-workout to also include piperine \u2014 the active component of black pepper \u2014 which increases curcumin's bioavailability. ( [14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29065496/)) Black Pepper Your pre-workout certainly adds some spice to your routine when you're getting ready to lift. Adding some literal spiciness by way of [black pepper](https://barbend.com/reign-bcaa-elite-review/) \u2014 specifically, its active component piperine \u2014 can enhance the effectiveness of curcumin in your pre-workout. ( [14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29065496/)) Having piperine alongside curcumin won't only help turmeric do its job. It can also help bolster your body's [immune system](https://barbend.com/chris-bumstead-stem-cells/) \u2014 this is significant because your immune system can take quite a beating when you hit it [hard at the gym](https://barbend.com/hiit-workouts/) day after day. ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9032800/)) Lion's Mane Mushroom Extract Inflammation is not the universal bully that one might think. Inducing inflammation through exercise is a critical part of setting yourself up for [muscle repair](https://barbend.com/how-to-speed-up-muscle-strain-recovery/) and regeneration \u2014 i.e., [muscle growth](https://barbend.com/how-to-build-muscle/). said, too much inflammation [during your workout](https://barbend.com/should-you-take-protein-during-a-workout/) can reduce the quality of your overall performance. ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9032800/)) Enter lion's mane [mushroom](https://barbend.com/adaptogenic-mushrooms/) extract. Research suggests that this fungal extract can act as a powerful anti-inflammatory. ( [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25529054/)) By incorporating an anti-inflammatory like this into your pre-workout, you can help ensure that you'll be able to [push your training](https://barbend.com/drop-sets/) to the limit without hitting a point of no return when internal inflammation builds up. What to Avoid in a Natural Pre-Workout If you're on the hunt for a natural pre-workout, it's likely that you're looking to avoid any artificial sweeteners, flavors, or dyes. Keep in mind that [a pre-workout](https://barbend.com/bulk-black-pre-workout-review/) may say that it's sugar-free or that it contains [no added sugar](https://barbend.com/added-sugar-meaning/) \u2014 but, to add sweetness, it may still include artificial sweeteners. That might be alright with you, and it might not be. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. Read the label and check out the ingredients for yourself before you hit that purchase button. Keep It Natural Strength athletes are often very concerned about what they put into their bodies. They [meal prep](https://barbend.com/bodybuilding-meal-prep/), [count macros](https://barbend.com/how-to-count-macros/), and [measure out portions](https://barbend.com/how-to-use-portion-control/). There's no reason you can't be just as exacting with what goes into your pre-workout. The best natural pre-workout ingredients are the ones that match your goals. If you're looking to improve blood flow, [increase endurance](https://barbend.com/what-is-emom-training/), and get a bit of a power boost, ingredients like green tea extract and turmeric might be exactly what you've been looking for.
