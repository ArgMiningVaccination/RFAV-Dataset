Our thumbs make it possible for us to do deep, specific work. Our thumbs make our clients happy. And yet our thumbs are one of the most oft-injured parts of the massage therapist's body. In this course, you will review the most common use patterns for our thumbs when we massage - the things we do that lead to pain and strain and injury. Then you will explore an alternative way of using the thumbs. In the process, you will learn to rely on our thumbs less, and rely on the easy use of your whole body more. And as we do that, we will learn how to use the thumbs more effectively when they are the best option for a given stroke, how to support our thumbs and keep them in line with the rest of the body, thus creating a way of using the thumbs (and the body as a whole) that is both safe and effective.

And yet because we are so focused on all the big, beautiful muscles that spread across the back, we often forget what is underneath - the ribs. These small bones, and the even smaller muscles that run in between them, are essential to nearly everything we do each day. They protect and support every breath we take, and they provide the foundation that enables every movement we make with our arms and our head. This is a neglected part of the body. It shouldn't be. In this course students will: Practice clear and effective draping to expose the rib cage while keeping breast tissue covered, when the client is in supine.
