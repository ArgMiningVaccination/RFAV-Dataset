Supporting communication for the COVID-19 vaccination programme 4 Version 1.0 September 2021A DEFINITION SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION Adverse event (reaction)An unexpected, unwanted, or serious reaction to a medication or vaccine. O fa'a tauli ogaoga e tutupu mai i fula'au ma tui puipui.Any unexpected or serious e ect that happens after a vaccine or medicine. Something that was not expected to happen. Se fa'alavelave e le'i fuafuaina moua ka immunisation (AEFIs)Any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunisation. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the vaccine. An unexpected e ect that happens after vaccination. The vaccine may have not been the reason for the problem. Ko e lekua moua fakaofo, moua ka ke nakai huki, ka kua fai lekua foki. Antibody A protein found in the blood that is produced in response to foreign substances (e.g., viruses) invading the body. Antibodies protect the body from disease by binding to these organisms and destroying them. When the body gets sick or gets a vaccine, the body will make antibodies to protect it against that disease. The body can then recognise the germs when that same disease happens again. To gahuahua e tino ke talaga e tau antibodies ka gagao poke oti e huki ke puipui mai he gagao. moko ikiiki nei kaeke kua liu ke moua ke he tau gagao. Antigen A foreign substance which is detected by the immune system The presence of antigens in the body triggers an immune response, usually the production of antibodies.An antigen is needed to make an antibody. Antigens can be bacteria, viruses, or fungi that cause infection and disease. Ko e antigen ke moua mai e tau antibody. Ko e tau antigens ko e tau moko, tau moko ikiiki, tau popo (fungi) moua mai ha ko e pikitiaaga mo e tau moko gagao. Adjuvant A vaccine component distinct from the antigen that enhances the immune response to the antigen.An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines. It helps our bodies make a stronger immune response. The adjuvant works together with other parts of the vaccine. They have been used in some vaccines for over 70 years. Ko e adjuvant ko e taha he tau mena ne fakaaoga ke taute aki falu a tau huki. Lagomatai aki e tau tino ke fakamalolo aki e tau alaga ke tau mo e totoko atu.

Symptoms of anaphylaxis include breathing di culties, loss of consciousness and a drop in blood pressure. This condition can be fatal and requires immediate medical attention.A quick and serious allergic reaction. This could be a reaction to food or medicine. Symptoms can include breathing di culties, loss of consciousness and a drop in blood pressure. It can sometimes be life threatening and needs urgent medical attention. Ko e lekua ma ti mo e kelea ha kua nakai felauaki e tino mo e tau mena kai (food) poke tau vai/tau segavai (medication). lata ke kumi fakama ti e tau lagomatai he tau toketa. AssociationThe degree to which the occurrence of two variables or events is linked. Association describes a situation where the likelihood of one event occurring depends on the presence of another event or variable. However, an association between two variables does not necessarily imply a cause-and-e ect relationship. The term association and relationship are often used interchangeably. A link between one event taking place at the same time as another event. This link does not prove that one event caused the other event. O se feso'ota'iga i le v o le tasi mea na tupu e tutusa ma le taimi a se isi gaioiga.

Ko e tagata ne nakai gagao ti attenuated vaccine (or a live attenuated vaccine) is a vaccine created by reducing the virulence of a pathogen but keeping it viable (or \"live\"). Attenuation takes an infectious agent and alters it so that it becomes harmless or less dangerous. These vaccines contrast to those produced by \"killing\" the virus (inactivated vaccine).Live vaccines use a weakened (or attenuated) form of the germ that causes a disease. These vaccines are like the natural infection that they help prevent. They create a strong and long-lasting immune response. Ko e huki ne fakaaoga e tau moko momoui ka kua fakahalehale, mai e tau moko gagao. Ko e tau huki nei kua tuga e tau natural infection, fakaaoga ke lata mo e tau puipuiaga.

ASupporting communication for the COVID-19 vaccination programme 6 Version 1.0 September 2021B DEFINITION SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION Boost (Booster injection) An additional dose of a vaccine that re-stimulates the immune after the e ects of an earlier dose wear o . It is not yet clear whether booster shots of a COVID-19 vaccine will be necessary. Extra shot of a vaccine given to either build up higher levels of immunity or to make sure the immunity lasts longer. Liu ke huki foki poke huki lagaua, ke faka tonu to moui loa e tau puipuiaga nei. C DEFINITION SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION Cell culture A laboratory technique that can be used to make some vaccines, where cells can be grown in a nutrient-rich liquid to either I) make virus to be inactivated for inactivated vaccines, ii) make antigen for protein subunit vaccines or iii) make viral vectors. Using cells grown in liquid to make vaccine ingredients. Fakaaoga e tau fufua moui ne fakafanau ki loto he tau vai ke taute aki e tau huki. Clinical Trial A research study in which one or more human subjects are progressively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo/sham or other control) to evaluate the e ects of those interventions on healthrelated biomedical or behavioural outcomes. A type of research study. People either receive a new vaccine or are in a group that do not receive the vaccine (called the control group). The control group may receive a di erent vaccine or placebo. Participants usually do not know which group they are in. Scientists test the safety and bene ts of new vaccines.

Fakatai: Tagatutu H DEFINITION SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION Herd immunity This is a type of infection control that occurs naturally, or through immunisation programs, when a large enough portion of a population becomes immune to a disease to stop further spread. Immunity may be either by recovering from the disease or by being vaccinated against it. In the case of COVID-19, the possibility of herd immunity remains unclear due to the uncertainty of long term immunity to this virus. When most people in a community have protection against an infection. High levels of protection make it more and more di cult for the germ to pass from person to person. This can successfully stop the spread of disease in the community. Kaeke kua tokologa e tau tagata he maaga kua fai ke lata mo e gagao.

Its primary function is to identify foreign substances in the body (example: viruses). Then it develops a defence against them. This defence is known as the immune response. It involves production of protein molecules called antibodies to eliminate foreign organisms that invade the body.The body's system for identifying and killing germs to protect us against infection and disease. It involves making antibodies that move in the blood, recognize foreign substances like bacteria and viruses, and attach to them. It signals to the body to get rid of the foreign substances. Ko e tau alaga i loto he tino ne leveki mo e tamate e tau moko ke puipui aki a tautolu mai he tau moko kelea ne mukamuka ke moua e tau gagao.

Immune response The immune response is how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria, viruses, and substances that appear foreign and harmful.The immune response is how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria, viruses, and substances that appear foreign and harmful. Ko e tau alaga he tino ke taui atu, leveki e tino, ka he tau alaga nei e tau moko kua foou ke he tino, fai puipuiaga a lautolu ki ai ha ko e tau moko kelea. Immunity Immunity is the ability to resist illness when exposed to a disease. There are several ways to develop immunity. Active immunity is the result of being exposed to a disease, or vaccine for a disease. The exposure prompts your immune system to produce antibodies that help your body resist infection. If you re-encounter the disease your immune system's 'memory cells' will swiftly reproduce those antibodies which should protect you from that disease. Passive immunity occurs when a person receives antibodies belonging to another person (see plasma), or naturally when an infant absorbs their mother's antibodies from the placenta or via breast milk. This type of immunity does not last for a long time, because the person's own immune system was never activated and so their body did not produce its own protective antibodies.Being able to avoid getting sick or avoid getting infected when exposed to a germ. Your body builds this immunity by either being exposed to the gems or by getting a vaccine. Your immune system has a \"memory\"- it can remember germs that it has seen previously. Ke maeke he tino ke leveki mo e puipui mai he gagao he tau moko gagao. Talaga he haau e immunity tau puhala e-la mo e nofo fakalataha atu mo gagao, poke huki. Iloa mo e manatu he immunity e tau moko ne kua ta ni he kitia ke he tino fakamua.E H ISupporting communication for the COVID-19 vaccination programme 10 Version 1.0 September 2021Immunisation The process of being made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically by the administration of a vaccine. It implies that you have had an immune response.The process of developing immunity to an infection, usually by getting vaccinated. Ko e puhala ke lata mo e tau puipuiaga ke ua pikitia ke he tau gagao, i ke huki. Inactivated vaccine A vaccine made from viruses and bacteria that have been killed through physical or chemical processes. These killed organisms cannot cause disease. A vaccine made from a germ that has been killed. The germ is killed either by high heat or by chemicals. When this killed germ is injected into your body, it helps your immune system learn to nd the germ, without the risk of getting sick. Ko e tau huki nei kua talaga aki e tau moko ne kua ta he mamate. Tamate e tau moko nei ke he tau puhala nei-tuku ke he haau, maeke ke lagomatai ke he immune system, iloa e kumi e tau moko ti tamate a lautolu ke ua gagao a koe. L DEFINITION SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION Lipid Essentially a type of fat. Lipids are being used to make a protective bubble around mRNA in mRNA vaccines to prevent it from being broken down before it enters a cell. Lipid is fat that is used to make a protective bubble around the mRNA in mRNA vaccines. mRNA is very weak and breaks down quickly in the body if it is not protected. Once the mRNA is transported into the cell, it is broken down inside the cell. Ko e taha vala gako he tino kua fakaaoga he tau huki-mRNA.Lahi e lolelole e mRNA ti ma ti ke pa ki loto he tino kaeke kua nakai fai puipuiaga. loto he fufua moui nei. M DEFINITION SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION Messenger RNA (mRNA) An RNA produced by transcription that carries the code for a particular protein from the nuclear DNA to a ribosome in the cytoplasm and acts as a template for the formation of that protein.A type of small molecule that your cells use as instructions to make protein. mRNA tells your cells how to put together a speci c protein using the building blocks (called amino acids). You have many millions of mRNA molecules in your body at any one time- all being used to make proteins.

After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and Blymphocytes that will remember how to ght the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a harmless protein\u2014or even just a piece of a protein. This protein triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting very unwell if the real virus enters our bodies. Fakaako he tau huki mRNA e tau fufua moui ke talaga e tau harmless protein poke taha vala ni he protein. Ti fakaofoofo he protein nei e tau alaga papatau ki loto he tau tino.
