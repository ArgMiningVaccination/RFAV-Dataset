Now, more than ever, we need a [Clean Program](http://www.cleanprogram.com) cleanse. The 21-day Clean Cleanse by Dr. Junger focuses on ridding the body of built up toxins, repairing the digestive system, and sustaining blood sugar to eliminate unnecessary cravings and overeating. The focus is on your health not your weight, although weight loss is most often an added bonus. Eliminated foods (like gluten and dairy) can then be slowly added back in as you listen to your body for any negative reactions. What's also great about the Clean Cleanse is that it's totally customizable to your preference! You buy the foods you like based off of the [Elimination Diet List](http://www.cleanprogram.com/media/files/cleanse-diet.pdf), and you eat/drink the portion sizes that you feel your body needs. Because after all, we are not all built the same. So join us on January 12th for the Clean Program's 21-Day Group Cleanse! We will be posting recipes and lifestyle tips all month long to help kick off a healthy 2016. Make sure you visit the [Clean Program's](http://www.cleanprogram.com) website for more information, and stock up on some of these healthy staples from our Clean Cleanse grocery list!
