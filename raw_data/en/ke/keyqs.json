[Go to Accessing Care](#accessingcare) Assessing genetic risk can identify methods to prevent cancer, lead to earlier diagnosis, or guide cancer treatment for you and your family. As a national referral center, we have experience with a range of inherited risk, including rare genetic changes and mutations in recently identified genes. Our team brings together experts in genetics, oncology, and other fields to interpret complex genetic information, so you receive deeper insight more quickly. Cancers with Genetic Risk Cancer usually develops for reasons unrelated to your family. Hereditary changes in DNA can play a role in some cases, though, through missing, duplicated, or miscoded genes. While these mutations do not always cause problems, they increase your risk for certain cancers: Cancer Syndromes Sometimes an inherited mutation or a set of mutations can cause multiple cancer types in the same family, across generations. These syndromes, their known gene associations, and the conditions they cause include: - Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 (BHD) syndrome: FLCN gene \u2014 skin and kidney tumors and lung problems - DICER1 syndrome: DICER1 gene \u2014 lung, kidney, Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): APC gene \u2014 syndrome, or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS): PTCH1 gene \u2014 basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, jaw tumors, and others - Hereditary breast cancer: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, \u2014 breast cancer; also ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal, prostate, and pancreatic cancers for BRCA genes; and also other cancer types depending on the gene - Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC): CDH1 gene \u2014 stomach cancer, lobular breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer - Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC): FH gene \u2014 skin and uterus tumors and kidney cancer - Hereditary ovarian cancer: BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD501C, RAD51D, the Lynch genes, and others \u2014 ovarian cancer; also other cancer types depending on the gene - Hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma (HPRCC): MET gene \u2014 kidney Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC): SDHD, SDHAF2, SDHC, SDHA, SDHB, and other genes tumors in ganglia nerve cell bunches - Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS): BMPR1A and SMAD4 genes \u2014 gastrointestinal polyps - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS): TP53 gene \u2014 breast, bone, soft tissue, and adrenal gland cancers, leukemia, and brain tumors - Lynch syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ovarian, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, upper urinary tract, brain, and skin cancers - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1): MEN1 gene \u2014 endocrine gland intestinal tumors - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2): RET gene \u2014 medullary thyroid cancer and parathyroid, adrenal and nerve - MUTYH-associated polyposis MUTYH gene \u2014 colorectal polyps and cancer - Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2): NF2 gene \u2014 nerve tumors, including acoustic neuroma - Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS): STK11 gene, also known as the LKB1 gene \u2014 breast, colorectal, pancreatic, stomach, testicular, ovarian, lung, and cervical cancers - PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS): PTEN gene \u2014 various benign tumors, melanoma, and breast, thyroid, kidney, endometrial, and colorectal cancers - Schwannomatosis: SMARCB1 and LZTR1 nerve tumors - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome: VHL gene \u2014 blood vessel and adrenal gland tumors and pancreatic and kidney cancers Your Stanford team follows the latest evidence from the field of cancer genetics, with many of the program's discoveries guiding national care. Our doctors write national guidelines on when to test for mutations and how best to manage risk. They continue to identify genetic changes that can cause cancer. INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS - BRCA decision tool: Women worldwide use our free [decision tool](http://brcatool.stanford.edu/)to learn more about their options for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. These mutations can cause breast, ovarian, and other cancers. - Stomach cancer expertise: We offer leading expertise in the CDH1 gene mutation tied to [stomach cancer](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/cancer/stomach-cancer.html). People from around the world seek our help when testing unexpectedly finds this rare mutation. Comprehensive Risk Assessment Our board-certified, cancer-focused genetic counselors guide you through each step of the process and help you reach highly personal decisions. You can also consult with top doctors whose published work continues to improve care. Learn about our [genetic testing and risk assessment services \u00bb](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/c/cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-testing-counseling.html) Personalized consultations Our consultations help people who survived cancer, need treatment, or suspect their genetic predisposition is higher. We examine personal and family medical histories, consult the latest research, and run computer models. When appropriate, we discuss the benefits of genetic testing, as well as its limits and possible impact. Panel genetic testing Instead of testing single genes, top programs now use next-generation sequencing to analyze dozens at once. We adopted this panel testing early on and proved its effectiveness at helping people with genetic risk. We lead the way in testing for lesser-known genes tied to cancer, especially breast cancer. Coordinated family care If you have children, we coordinate services with the [genetic counselor at Stanford Children's Health](http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/service/genetics). If you want to become pregnant, we can coordinate with our [Fertility Preservation Program](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/fertility-preservation-for-cancer-program.html#shared-top-content-iparsys_marquee) to screen embryos for inherited cancer risk during in vitro fertilization (IVF). The fertility program can also help women with a BRCA gene mutation and higher ovarian cancer risk preserve their eggs. Please contact us or speak with your doctor if you meet any of these criteria: You have a diagnosis of: - Breast, uterine, colon, prostate, pancreatic, or other cancer before age 46 - Triple-negative breast cancer - Breast, prostate, or pancreatic cancer at any age, with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage Your family has: - Known mutation in a cancer risk gene - Member diagnosed with cancer at an early age - Multiple members diagnosed with cancer, including different types Treating Cancer and Managing Risk We provide personalized options, helping you weigh both the benefits and the drawbacks. Our recommendations depend on your risk level and the mutations identified, if any. We offer specialized expertise to devise a plan when the answer is not obvious or national guidelines do not yet exist. We also partner with other Stanford clinics to connect you with the best specialist for managing your specific cancer risk. Surveillance and Medications If you face a higher risk for cancer, we can recommend tests and scans to detect disease at earlier stages, when it is more curable. We offer the latest techniques, working to refine and improve them. Medications can also lower your chances of developing cancer if an assessment places you at higher risk. Prophylactic Surgery While we recommend doing so only in certain cases, removing organs or tissue can protect your long-term health. Our surgeons' expertise ensures safe and effective surgery, as well as fully supported recovery. Family Support We can care for additional family members with higher risk. If needed, we help them find specialists near them and supply the needed background information. Cancer Treatment and Survival Identifying inherited mutations can guide cancer treatment, including disease that has spread, or metastasized. Even if you have successfully completed treatment, knowing that you have a genetic mutation can help prevent a new cancer from developing. Clinical Trials Clinical trials for inherited cancer genetics look to improve the way risk is detected, presented, and managed. When appropriate, these studies may provide you with a chance to try the latest approaches. Open trials refer to studies currently recruiting participants or that may recruit participants in the near future. Closed trials are not currently enrolling, but similar studies may open in the future. Recent or ongoing research areas at Stanford include: - Improved screening for ovarian and pancreatic cancer - Better ways to handle the volume of genetic information now available - Targeted therapy based on certain inherited genetic mutations Open trials refer to studies currently recruiting participants or that may recruit participants in the near future. Closed trials are not currently enrolling, but similar studies may open in the future.
