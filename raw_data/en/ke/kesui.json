At a press conference this morning, a Georgia family will describe how the government has conceded that a vaccine \"contributed\" to their daughter's autism symptoms. The family will receive compensation from a federal vaccine court. That doesn't mean the federal government agrees that vaccines cause autism (click Advocates who see a vaccine-autism link point to Hannah Poling's case as a big victory for their cause - evidence of the potentially disastrous side effects of vaccines. Within 48 hours after receiving her vaccinations, Hannah, then 19 months old and by all accounts a normal little girl, developed a high fever, inconsolable crying and some signs of regression, including difficulty walking and speaking. Over the next several months, she had countless visits with doctors finally culminating in the diagnosis of encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder. At the same time, and this is potentially very important, she had genetic testing and was found to have the gene for an underlying mitochondrial disorder (click So, did the vaccines worsen an already existing condition leading to the symptoms of autism? That is what the government seems to have conceded. And, if so, was it caused by the mercury preservative thimerosal, which was present in Hannah's vaccines several years ago, or was it the profound immune response that vaccinations cause in the body? The Centers for Diseases Control, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine and other prestigious medical organizations maintain there is no link between vaccines and autism. As many experts have told me, this case is likely to raise more questions than it answers. But, these are good questions and important ones for anyone who cares about this issue. What do you think? Editor's Note: Medical news is a popular but sensitive subject rooted in science. We receive many comments on this blog each day; not all are posted. Our hope is that much will be learned from the sharing of useful information and personal experiences based on the medical and health topics of the blog. We encourage you to focus your comments on those medical and health topics and we appreciate your input. Thank you for your participation. It may be true that Vaccinations have side effects including Autism, after some research on whether to completely skip vaccines for my daughter born last year I have come to this conclusion, that the benefits of Vaccinating your child are much more than not vaccinating at all. This is the view of almost all the doctors I talked to [Some doctors can be insensitive to questions on Vaccines but some can offer good information and advice]. So now my daughter gets her vaccines BUT we space them, so that the 6 or so vaccines are not administered on the same day but over 2/3 weeks. I urge all parents to do some research into Vaccines and Thanks Sanjay for your unbiased approach to Vaccines. The question of vaccines and their side affects is daunting. I have read numerous articles stating that vaccines are dangerous and ineffective. I have also read that vaccines are the greatest boon to health in our world. I recently had the decision to make concerning a flu and tetanus vaccination. I decided to do it even though I wonder if it is the right thing to do. Perhaps the most troubling part of some vaccines is the use of the mercury preservative thimerosal. Since mercury is a neural toxin, any exposure to it is very troubling. As a kid, I remember playing with mercury from old batteries. I would roll it around in my hand and smash it into little balls. Vitamin C is supposedly a chelating agent and helps remove heavy metals from your body. Since I take large amounts of Vitamin C every day, I sure hope that it really does remove mercury and other heavy metals from my body. It concerns me that it took 7+ yrs to get this girl story out. After countless other mothers arguring the same battle. But now saying there may be a gene for an underlying mitochondrial disorder which could be the link and the vaccines may have triggerd it. It upsets me that if this could be true then those 5000 or so cases could have been screened to see who is carriers and then vaccines could have been given in a more controlled situation to each specific need. Or was it the profound immune response that vaccinations cause in the body? Either- or more reserch should have been streamlined towards these theroies . I have a 4 month old and I am torn on whether to vaccinate or not or proceed with caution, I also have an 8 yr old with downsyndrome and it scares me that I could have 2 children with special needs. My son has a diagnosis of autism and mercury toxicity. My biggest hope is that Hannah's case brings a quick change in our vaccine program. We need safe ingredients and a safe schedule NOW. Neither of those components are in place now. America's children do not deserve this. And they certainly don't deserve to be lied to: there is still mercury in flu shots given to pregnant women and babies. Thank you so much for the live coverage on the Autism case. I am a mom with an autistic son and one of those 5000 cases waiting to be heard. My story is very similar to the Polings as my son, prior to receiving 6 shots in one day, had chronic ear infections and eventually developed a resistance to antibiotics. On the day of the 6 vaccines, a fever was present but was assured he would be fine to receive the shots. My son, who has a \"typical\" twin sister, met all his developmental milestones and later regressed. Eventually he was diagnosed with having Autism. I look forward to our day in court where we can be the voice to our nonverbal autistic child. Dr. Gupta, my daughter's decline from a healthy, typical child into autism happened immediately upon receiving her 15 month vaccines. She was vaccinated... developed a high fever within hours... held that fever for a week... and was autistic five days later. She got worse over the following months. Subsequent testing shows high levels of mercury and aluminum (after post-chelation challenge) and she also has the vaccine strain of measles, rubella and herpes viruses infecting her intestines. None of the industry-funded epidemiological studies have impressed me, to date... and most (if not all) have fatal design flaws that swing the numbers away from causation. Listen, nobody wants children to get preventable diseases. But we have a problem with the pediatric schedule. Too many vaccines, too close together overwhelm the immune systems of a large subset of children. Why not research that and adjust the schedule? I'll tell you why. It would bring on the lawyers and decimate the pharmaceutical companies. That's why our kids are thrown under a bus for the sake of big pharma. Erik Nanstiel Chicago Parents have children's lab tests showing various types of vaccine injury. - Mercury & heavy metals toxicity. - Antibodies to myelin basic protein. - Vaccine-strain measles in lesions lining the intestinal mucosa. - Mitochondrial disorders, found bymeasuring free flow lactic acid. - Timelines and chronologies listing empirical observations of normal children turned \"autistic,\" immediately or within days. The CDC has epidemiology. Its own massaged statistics. Numbers assembled in Atlanta or Baltimore. No doctors sent to examine sick children or look at their medical workups. If you believe that government numbers are no substitute for these children's medical reality, then call your legislators and the CDC and demand that they start putting effort into the prevention of vaccine injury. No other consumer product has such a lousy system for handling adverse reactions. FOR MORE INFORMATION on the science on autism, mitochondria, and mercury: http://www.safeminds.org/research/science-autism-mitochondria-mercury.html I find it laughable that the Government is trying to separate \"autism like symptoms\" from autism. It is the symptoms themselves that acutally define autism. After hearing the Government state they believe that vaccines caused \"autism like symptoms\" in this case, the average Joe on the street would naturally think that the CDC, IOM and AAP are not being truthful when they say that this case does NOT concede that vaccines cause autism. The average parent of a very sick autistic child already believes that these groups actually have been not truthful - lying in fact, for years now. I believe it is in the Government's best interest to open the sealed documents and share with the public what they know as these parents have requested. If not, the citizens of our great nation will see that it is not the parents privacy the Government is protecting, it is the individuals who have successfuly kept the truth hidden from us for so long now. The sealed documents could only help us better understand the mechanisms behind at least some autism cases, and possibly lead to a cure or prevention method. Why would the Government not want to begin to curb the incredible rise in autism cases? Just curious as to what are the benefits of the vaccines? Are they 100% effective? Does it mean just because thimerosal is no longer a key ingredient in vaccines that the other chemicals that they put in are completely safe? I also listened to my reassuring doctor on the controversy surrounding vaccines and did give my two month old (in 2006) ALL the required shots. And when we took him home the next day he was sick. Which was odd because the doctors and nurses say that when you breast feed a baby they are getting protection from the mother's immune system... I feel that the shots made his immune system weak. If you dig further and look into all the info out there you will see other alternatives to protecting your child for the illnesses that vaccines \"protect\" against. Just because everyone around you may be vaccinating and your doctor's say that there's no link - I like to make my own choice and look beyond the norm. There is a reason why so many parents are coming out and sharing their experiences - it's because they don't want other children to get hurt and they truly believe that something went wrong. My son is now 17 months and hasn't gotten a shot since he was 2 months old. He is very healthy and we feed him mostly organic foods and give him a daily multivitamin (from a Holistic Pharmacy) and with good hand washing - he has remained healthy. He has had a handful of colds like most kids - but does not have a constant runny nose like some kids and he gets over it quickly. My point is that there are healthy children around that have not gotten every shot that's RECOMMENDED and it's always up to the parents to do as much research for themselves... Doctor's are not perfect and just because there's no Defined LINK to Autism does not erase the fact that it's an epidemic and there's got to be something(s) that is causing this. So why not try to go natural and remove as many chemicals as possible (ex:Pestisides from fruits and Veggies, hormones in milk and chicken, house cleaners, Pthalates in baby products and plastic bottles etc.) and see if that works. The idea that thimerisol causes autism has been debunked by studies showing that, although thimerisol has been absent from vaccines since 2000, autism rates remain unchanged. A study in Japan, where MMR vaccination was not universal, failed to show an association between that vaccine and autism. Autism is primarily a genetic disorder, as evidenced by the fact that if your identical twin has it, your chances of having it are 90%! (For fraternal twins, it's 10%.) There may be some evironmental causes, which should be studied, but this emphasis on vaccines is contrary to all scientific evidence and is dangerous to public health! I can understand how, as a distraught parent seeing your child regress soon after receiving a vaccine, it might seem like more that a coincidence, but all the evidence indicates that, in the vast majority of cases, IT IS A COINCIDENCE. I have two kids and both are in the autism spectrum with behavioral and communcations issues, etc. I've been doing research now for 4 years and just a couple of weeks ago bumped into a video by a woman who has been doing the same research. I've been strggling to summarize my research but she does it beautifully in this video. I agree with all her points. My research has lead to the same exact things. It's a lengthy video but please watch it from beginning to end if you really want answers or are wondering if you have the right answers: http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/2/14/why-vaccines-aren-t-safe.aspx This news is so hope-giving and disturbing at the same time. As a concerned parent of a toddler I am glad we are starting to shed some light on a topic that torments all the parents. While my toddler is healthy it took lots of skill and audacity to convince a sleuth of reputed and otherwise well-intended pediatriciansof my concerns regarding the current aggressive schedule of vaccination. Folloing this development I would imagine it is a logical step to address the issue of vaccination schedule from a beneficence perspective and not a business one. It becomes more and more obvious that the \"all inclusive shots\" are assaulting the health of our babies for the sake of \"more efficient\" health-care. I hope all familes affected by this will get the justice they deserve, but I also hope justice will look in the face of truch and evidence and find solutions for so many other infants who deserve a shot at staying healthy. If autism were purely a genetic disease, the rates would be constant and we would have hundreds of thousands of non-verbal autistic adults in our health care system. We don't. What we have now is an epidemic amongst children who came of age as the vaccine schedule was increased by a factor of 3. This case is just the beginning; there are now too many children with well informed parents for the CDC and AAP to be able to keep the genie in the bottle. Shots cause harm. Maybe now we can begin studying how and why so that we can prevent this epidemic from getting worse. Sure, we've heard it a thousand times, \"mercury has been absent from vaccines since 2000,and autism rates remain unchanged\". But isn't also true that in all (or most?) cases of autism in children, it is found that these children have elevated mercury levels? If so, what is the source of the mercury? Did it transfer from the mother to the child? Perhaps mercury is still the culprit, but how the mercury got there is the riddle? Are we really going to let the government get away with their statement that vaccines \"aggrivated\" an underlying genetic disorder and resulted in \"autism like symptoms\"? And repeat this verbal dancing in our news reports? This is silly double speak. Autism is diagnosed based solely on 'autism like symptoms'. If you have autism like symptoms, you meet the diagnostic criteria for autism. Personally, I believe that the all the ice cream I eat only aggravates my pre-exiting genetic factors causing changes in my hind quarters including features of obesity. But in no way is that an admission that I eat to much and it has made me fat. Thank you for an unbiased opinion. Until it is proven that vaccines do not even contribute to autism, it's important that no avenues towards research and/or education are closed. Parents need to make a lot of informed decisions. It's easy to say that the benefits of vaccinating outweigh the possibilities of autism, until you have an autistic child. I'm pro-vaccine, but only safe vaccines, with no thimerasol or any other toxin, and a more widely-spaced schedule. There's so much concern about vaccines, does anyone wonder why they aren't pulling thimerasol from everything when they've already pulled it from mascara and other vaccines? We should wonder about that, as well as the amount of mercury recommended in our diet via fish, and wonder why more really accurate research isn't being done, when the stats are so high. 1 in 166 children are autistic. What number does it need to get to before it's a priority? The idea that vaccines may cause Autism has been refuted repeatedly in over 23 studies involving over 1 million children (both in and outside of the United States). The fact that the public is still considering it is absurd! There are 3 published studies claiming that a connection exists. Of these 3 studies, 1 has been retracted and in another study 10/13 researchers voluntarily withdrew their names from the paper! I empathize with parents who have autistic children; however, we need to look at the facts. Autism is diagnosed at about the same time that the MMR vaccine is given; therefore, it would be expected for autistic children to have received their shot recently. Dr Gupta, Yours is the most reasoned voice in this whole debate. Thank you for not demonizing parents who are concerned about vaccinating children, while at the same time providing scientific context. I do believe vaccines can cause injury, but because I didn't want my children to get mumps or measles or polio, they were still vaccinated. We need a safer vaccine and a better vaccine schedule. Dr Gupta, you are asking the right questions and it will take someone like you to blow the cover off of this. By the way, I was a pediatrician for six years before becoming a radiologist and even while practicing pediatrics, I always had a sinking feeling evertime I prescribed five shots at the same time in a toddler. I just don't think their little bodies can handle it, and I know many pediatricians who feel the same way, but would never declare it openly. For that reason, I too will remain anonymous but supporting you Dr Gupta. Please read Jenny Mccarthy's book regarding her sons autism. It's time that we look into children having weak immune systems who are not tested regarding their weak immune systems and then being given these vaccinations that further cause harm. Not blaming vaccinations entirely but it is time the govenment looks into the likelihood of certain children not able to handle typical vaccinations due to being born with already weaken immune systems thus resulting in autism. From the story I think it's important that: (1) the case becomes unsealed and the information from the trial is made available to scientist who can use it to create additional theories and studies. (2) Doctors--and the medical community in general--need to be more receptive to people's complaints about vaccination issues. I used to be perfectly okay with vaccinations. Until I was in my teens and flu shots started causing extreme immune reactions. Worse than the flu itself. And then I had to get a routine booster and was sent to the emergency room due to an extreme immune response--only one doctor at the hospital believed what was happening to me and thankfully provided the correct course of action. It surprised me though that the majority of doctors there would NOT believe I could have an extreme immune response to a vaccine. I take these things very seriously now. Until it happens to you or your family, it is tempting to dismiss the effects of vaccines, but even if vaccines are not the DIRECT cause of autism, I think it's important to understand and take seriously that vaccines are not just \"dead viruses or bacteria\" or are \"harmless\". Vaccines create a response in the human body that needs to be taken very seriously. It seems that folks might be barking up the wrong tree. This could be a proceedural issue with health care professions ganging too many dosages at one time causing an immune response that is indirectly causing problems. I've send my child recieve 4 inoculation in one sitting. People need to stop trying cover their own butts and use their heads. Stuben \"My son is now 17 months and hasn't gotten a shot since he was 2 months old. He is very healthy\" from anonymous 2:47--Part of the reason your son is healthy is because everyone else around him is vaccinated. and you say, \"So why not try to go natural and remove as many chemicals as possible...and see if that works.\" Out of curiosity, how will you know if it worked? It will be easy to tell if it doesn't work, I'll give you that. This posting proves what I've belived all along. One size fits all healthcare (mandatory immunization of all children everywhere) is NOT a good idea. All children need to be evaluated individually. Additionaly parents must be told the risks that are associated w/the procedures being done. Right now in Virginia I have the choice of giving my sons ALL of the reccomended shots or NONE. If I feel that the polio or MMR vaccine is good, but decline the Heb B or the chicken pox shots I run the risk of having my boys taken from me by family services. Alternatly I can decline all shots due to personal religous beliefs and not be bothered at all. Where is the sanity in this? Dr. Mithra Green D.C. It has been known for a great deal of time that some children have immune reactions to vaccinations, analogous to allergies to certain substances. Autism itself is not a disease in the same sense that Sickle Cell Anemia is a diseases but rather closer to a syndrome collecting a spectrum of symptoms, which increasingly look to be caused by a wide range of issues, some genetic, some environmental, and some a mixture of both (well in truth it is almost always some degree of both). This is an instance where a genetic susceptibility was triggered by the environment (the vaccination). Parents are told that there is a small but possible chance of a reaction to vaccines, doctors are aware of it. The reactions can be really bad, but the medical profession feels that the statistically small chance of a reaction is far outweighed by the risk and severity of the diseases being vaccinated against. As a parent it is scary, there is always that niggling \"What if\", but if you forgo the vaccination there is the much larger worry of measles. In the end, unless you know you have a family history of immune reactions to vaccines, it is safer to vaccinate your child. Incidentally, this situation, as noted, has nothing to do with the presence of thimerosal in vaccines (which has been absent for almost a decade now, yet Autism diagnose rates continue to increase). It is a result of an immune reaction to the vaccine itself, rather than contamination via an additive. Scientifically, ALL peer reviewed published evidence has discounted additives as a cause of autism, and parents should not forgo vaccination out of worry of these additives. I don't see how a link from vaccines to Autism can be \"debunked\" if the cause of Autism is still not known. How can you say what does not cause Autism if you don't know what does cause it? However, Hg is a known neurotoxin and you are injecting cumulatively a large quantity into a child, so why wouldn't you presume there to be a high probability of a causal link? Why is there such an effort to dismiss Hg as a cause for brain damage only in this application? Joel Maybe all those pro vax folks can explain why my daughter started stuttering after her last round of shots at age 4 (DTaP and Varicella). And by last round of shots I mean LAST round. Never again. Like many people we have a similar situation with our 15 year old daughter and Hanna's story is unfortunately very common. Please note that we were not allowed to file a claim with the vaccine adverse reporting system because more than 3 years had passed when we became aware of its existence. People who post things like thimerosal was removed from vaccines on a certain date are either misinformed or for some reason choose to perpetuate misinformation and those who would like people to think that this is all about trying to get rich have no clue as to what it takes to raise someone with this disability. We were actually searching for sources of mercury exposure when it was revealed in July of 1999 that the hepatitis B shot contained a mercury based preservative that was going to be removed. We began searching for appropriate treatments and have had some limited success but people are not told about alternative treatments. We thought it would be a very short period of time for thimerosal to be eliminated from all products and treatments for mercury exposure to be devised, but that was almost 9 years ago and we are still waiting for the mainstream to wake up. The one thing different that I see about this case study is that it is about an individual. All of the studies that are typically cited in the press releases when people say there is no proof that autism can be caused by mercury in vaccinations are statistical. Perhaps the real problem is that the medical industry is not looking at the individuals. I guess that this is where the courts appear to differ at least in this case. This is a touchy subject with no clear answers yet. One angle that I hope American medical establishments include in their research is how other developed nations vaccinate their children, at what ages they get vaccinated, and how their autism and death from disease rates compare to the U.S. We are not the only nation that vaccinates our children, so maybe we can learn from other countries. There are many people out there that do not vaccinate their children. This may be a death sentence to them- so I would urge you to think carefully about denying your children healthy lives. I have had the horrible experience of seeing many of these poor, helpless children in the hospital that either die or are very sick for the rest of their lives. The only reason that more of these unvaccinated kids have not gotten terribly sick is because the rest of the reasonable parents vaccinate their children and thus are preventing many epidemics. This is known as passive immunity. If however an epidemic does occur by chance, all of the unvaccinated children will be at high risk of these infections. Unfortunately, then it will be too late to help these kids. Vaccines take a while to work- it takes months for your body to develop immunity- so you need to vaccinate your children now. It is possible to eliminate thimerisol as a cause of autism, even though we have not found what the actual cause is. For example; you start experiencing allergy symptoms, and wonder if you're developing an allergy to your cat. You send the cat to stay with a friend for a few weeks, but the symptoms continue. From this, any reasonable person would infer that they are not allergic to cats. My son has Autism and hearing this press conference today made me go through just about every emotion imaginable. I thank this family for their dedication and for never giving up the fight. I do hope this court decision launches further research and looks into Mr. Poling's theories, but I also hope that doctors start testing for Mitochondrial Disorders in women while they are pregnant or that women become educated and have the knowledge to ask to be tested. I wish I had half this information before my son was born. I say why wait for research, lets get rid of combination vaccines altogether and start spreading out one does vaccines throughout a child's toddler years. I mean really is convenience really worth your child loosing his/her ability to enjoy all that life has to offer. Thank you, Jennifer from Ronkonkoma,New York Thank you, Dr. Gupta, for providing coverage of this issue. My son, now 15 year old, began his post vaccination regression into autism just shy of two years of age. He was a normally developing baby, reaching developmental milestones on or ahead of schedule, prior to his vaccine induced regression. Like so many other parents, I have been personally devasted by the disregard and denial demonstrated by the medical community and our government with regard to the role of vaccines in the alarming increase in autism. I am elated for the Poling family and I desperately hope this will bring the awakening to truth that is needed to end the injection of neurotoxins into our children. I am surprised that in a free country we have a problem like this. Are we or are we not parents? My children have NOT received there toddler shots and will not. I didn't get most of them (Yes I got the polio and tetnus shots) and was exposed to all the normal childhood stuff. Maybe my mother nursing me for a year passed along her immunities along with a few stem cells in her milk to jump start my immune system. (maybe pasteurized and homogenized milk kills more than just bacteria?) Has anyone ever looked at the people who get those diseases (Measles, chicken pox Etc.) and survived. How did they do? What was the result of having them. Now we find out that the human genome project automatically filters out copies of common bacteria and virii in their published works when it has been shown that our genetics contain many copies of these. What happens then when you put a dead copy of some of these into our blood stream? Can these partial proteins cause the rest to activate from our own DNA possibly causing out immune system to recognize a piece of our own DNA as foreign causing an autoimmune reaction. Could this cause swelling in our brain? Makes you think doesn't it. Why is mercury (or a compound with mercury) used as a preservative? There is no perfectly safe vaccine, nor is any medical procedure 100% safe. Getting out of bed in the morning or staying in bed in the morning each provides its own risk. You may die either way. Epidemiologists do the best job they can of using statistics to estimate relative risks when developing vaccination regimes. Sometimes they change recommendations after receiving additional data. When a certain proportion of a population (such as 80 percent or more) is vaccinated, then even those who haven't been vaccinated benefit. How often do you see measles any more if you live in a country with near 100% vaccination against measles? Even unvaccinated individuals rarely get measles. But live in a poor country, as I have, for a few years, and you'll see brain-damaged kids, go to children's funerals, and see parents carrying comatose children with measles to the medical centers\u2014when they're lucky enough to have access to medical help. That changes one's perspective of risk very quickly without any need of statistical formulas. Even in rich countries, there is risk from infectious diseases, and the risk to unvaccinated individuals increases as the proportion of unvaccinated individuals increases. At a certain point the risk for the vaccine becomes smaller than the risk of contracting disease. I sat with my neighbor after his, until that week healthy, granddaughter died of heart complications during a flu season. The best information indicates that most of us living in wealthier countries will die from auto accidents, over-eating, smoking, and other indulgences of wealthy living. But the relatively low risk of dying from infectious diseases is a result of vaccination, not in spite of it. Sure, when everyone around you is vaccinated it's to your advantage to avoid getting vaccinated. So, for morally suspect advice: avoid vaccinations for you and your loved ones, but for goodness sakes, tell everyone else to all get vaccinated. The worst thing you can do, if you are seriously worried about risk, is avoid vaccines while telling friends, neighbors, and particularly everyone in the bloggasphere to avoid vaccines as well. That's my scientifically correct advice, but for ethical reasons I don't follow it. To help maintain the herd protection for those who aren't vaccinated, I and my loved ones are all up to date on our vaccines. And while I was at it, noting that grocery cart handles are a better place to sample fecal bacteria than bathroom door handles, we all got the HepA vaccine as well, which is effective, and statisticians tell me, a lot safer than the hepititis. The problem is that studies done thus far have not been double blind studies. CDC and others have not done studies comparing children not receiving vaccines to those that do. Small studies of Amish children and other groups show a much lower incidence of autism. Another problem being ignored is that vaccines are a multi-billion dollar business. The cigarette industry was not able to find a connection between cancer and cigarettes either. My wife took our children to a pediatrician and was charged $30 per vaccination. A friend told her that the local health department charged $4 per vaccination. When she informed the pediatrician that our children were going to be receiving their shots from the health department, the pediatrician matched the price of the health department. How many dollars & doctors visits are generated from children requiring vaccines? What effect does it have on profitability for pediatricians when parents do not bring children in for visits? Follow the money. Surely pediatricians are not purposely being dishonest with the public, but they have every reason to support studies that support their incomes. Why question it? AHiggins, Sherman Oaks, CA said... If autism were purely a genetic disease, the rates would be constant and we would have hundreds of thousands of non-verbal autistic adults in our health care system. Um, no. Only pure Mendelian traits (single gene) with complete penetrance (they always cause the full-blown disease) have a constant rate. From all I have read, the autism spectrum is populated by possibly dozens of disorders with similar phenotypes (manifestations). Some or all of them may be polygenic (caused by several genes) or incompletely penetrant (the disorder manifests variably) dominants or recessives. What we have now is an epidemic amongst children who came of age as the vaccine schedule was increased by a factor of 3. Or a larger number of children being diagnosed with \"autism spectrum\" disorders than there were thirty years ago. I note that there are some developmentally-based genetic disorders that manifest on a similar timeline: for instance, children with Tay-Sachs disease hit a bunch of developmental milestones normally, appear to be completely normal, and then suddenly hit a wall, regress dramatically, and die. We know the basic mechanism of Tay-Sachs and other, similar single gene disorders. What if there are polygenic autism disorders that manifest similarly? The autism spectrum is only beginning to be explored, and certainly hasn't been parsed out into individual disorders yet. How many of the parents of these children who are freaking out about vaccinations were born before, say, the polio vaccine was implemented? Or the other vaccines? Does anyone actually remember how horrible it was to watch a child die with polio? Or to BE a child with polio? Or what about the elderly people who had polio as children who are now experiencing a post-polio syndrome that is crippling them in their old age? Too many people are opting not to have their children vaccinated at all, instead of mandating to their physicians that the vaccinations should be spaced out, or lobbying for a revision in clinical practice guidelines. If too many children go unvaccinated, disease will run rampant again. It has happened in countries where distrust of and paranoia about vaccinations has occurred for other reasons. Mitochondrial disease has treatment options. My son has a similar story, but I blame the temp nurse who gave the injection to the bone not the vaccine itself. His regression has improved greatly with ear tubes and careful, FDA-approved mitochondrial disease treatment, given after he had blood tests for the condition. If we did not know the cause of our son's developmental delays, namely mitochondrial disease, we would be looking into it based on this article. But that point has been diluted in all of the news stories I've seen on this issue. Most people do not know anyone who has had polio or other diseases prevented by vaccines. I do. I remember when polio was a scourge that brought terror ever summer. I know people who have had polio and its affects upon their body. My mother almost died of diphtheria which the DPT shots prevents. Go on the internet and read about tetanus and what it is like to have it. If you get tetanus, you die from it. I understand peoples concern about reaction to vaccines but most people alive today do not remember when these diseases were rampant. Perhaps one simple step before having any vaccines is to never take a vaccine if you have a fever. I believe that this one simple step would mitigate reaction to vaccines. I agree that vaccines shots should also be spread over a longer period. Dear Julie, I have worked in epidemiology at a major university, and I am not impressed by the studies that have been published that are being used to claim that there is no link between thimerosal and autism, or between autism and vaccines. For instance, the study in Denmark--where the baseline prevalence is much lower than in the US--was seriously flawed by changing the inclusion criteria right at the time thimerosal was removed from vaccines there--right at that same time the Danish statistics also started to include people with autism who were not institutionalized. And as you should know from the transcript of the Simpsonwood meeting, many vulnerable children such as preemies were omitted from other data sets. In addition, when 8% of autistic children have IgA deficiencies and other have low IgG as well, that subset's ability to respond positively to vaccines is much less than the risk. Yet even when the family history of primary immunodeficiencies is disclosed, pediatricians go right ahead and vaccinate the children. Some children, including my grandson, improve on antivirals after getting shingles three years after the varicella vaccine, and the varicella vaccine immediately preceded his regression into autism. Coincidence? And he has proven mercury toxicity. Our family has two members as well who develop anti-nucleolar (autoimmune) antibodies on exposure to mercury, just like Dr. Hornig's lupus prone mice who responded to thimerosal with neurological consequences. And FULL DOSES of mercury are still in most of the influenza vaccines. I hesitate to attribute such a cynical motive to anyone, but why would a group add mercury laden vaccines to an already burdened population if they perhaps....didn't want the rate of autism to go down? There is no perfectly safe vaccine, nor is any medical procedure 100% safe. Getting out of bed in the morning or staying in bed in the morning each provides its own risk. You may die either way. Epidemiologists do the best job they can of using statistics to estimate relative risks when developing vaccination regimes. Sometimes they change recommendations after receiving additional data. When a certain proportion of a population (such as 80 percent or more) is vaccinated, then even those who haven't been vaccinated benefit. How often do you see measles any more if you live in a country with near 100% vaccination against measles? Even unvaccinated individuals rarely get measles. But live in a poor country, as I have, for a few years, and you'll see brain-damaged kids, go to children's funerals, and see parents carrying comatose children with measles to the medical centers\u2014when they're lucky enough to have access to medical help. That changes one's perspective of risk very quickly without any need of statistical formulas. Even in rich countries, there is risk from infectious diseases, and the risk to unvaccinated individuals increases as the proportion of unvaccinated individuals increases. At a certain point the risk for the vaccine becomes smaller than the risk of contracting disease. I sat with my neighbor after his, until that week healthy, granddaughter died of heart complications during a flu season. The best information indicates that most of us living in wealthier countries will die from auto accidents, over-eating, smoking, and other indulgences of wealthy living. But the relatively low risk of dying from infectious diseases is a result of vaccination, not in spite of it. Sure, when everyone around you is vaccinated it's to your advantage to avoid getting vaccinated. So, for morally suspect advice: avoid vaccinations for you and your loved ones, but for goodness sakes, tell everyone else to all get vaccinated. The worst thing you can do, if you are seriously worried about risk, is avoid vaccines while telling friends, neighbors, and particularly everyone in the bloggasphere to avoid vaccines as well. That's my scientifically correct advice, but for ethical reasons I don't follow it. To help maintain the herd protection for those who aren't vaccinated, I and my loved ones are all up to date on our vaccines. And while I was at it, noting that grocery cart handles are a better place to sample fecal bacteria than bathroom door handles, we all got the HepA vaccine as well, which is effective, and statisticians tell me, a lot safer than the hepatitis. This case is an emotional case and I feel for parents with autistic children. Certainly people want to have someone to blame and least of all want to believe it might have come from their own genes. This case has no substance and certainly no relevance to current vaccinations. I am a physician and the father of a 20 month old who gets all his shots. Thankfully he has shown no signs of autism but if he is diagnosed with autism it will not be because of his vaccinations. The reported government admissions are legal maneuverings but unfortunately feed the well intentioned but misinformed fringe who feel so \"well informed\" because of their non-scientific analysis of the data that they will knowingly but ignorantly expose their children to significant health risks and in turn create a public health risk. (This is the same non-scientific nuttiness that seeks to remove fluoride from our drinking water. Fluoridation is probably the second greatest public health triumph next to vaccination.) Parents, if you have questions regarding vaccination you need to talk to your pediatrician and listen to what he or she has to say. This myth has been debunked repeatedly by the solid application of scientific method. Children's lives are on the line not from the vaccinations but from misinformation. -Rob MD Thimerisol is a preservative developed by Eli Lily in the 1940's to give \"shelf-life\" to batches of many different vaccines. Mercury, the second-most toxic compund on earth, easily crosses the blood brain barrier in young, developing children. Why one child develops autism and another doesn't has to do with a \"trigger\" that hasn't been identified as of yet, but since the Federal government doubled the number of mandatory vaccines in 1992 the rate of autism exploded more than 2000%! And just because they quit using thimerisol in new vaccines doesn't mean they destroyed their existing inventory. I caught my pediatrician using flu vaccines last year that showed thimerisol on the label. As the father of a seventeen year old autistic who has been doing research and fighting the fight with a handful of other die-hards trying to save our own I say this: To those of you who are determined to believe no link exists between vaccines and autism: YOU will bear the societal and financial burden of our children as grown adults through your tax dollars and social programs of support for roughly seventy five (75) to seventy seven (77) years as most of our children are physically healthy but developmentally disabled. If YOU don't want this burden, get behind us and help resolve the issue. Otherwise, the burden WILL be YOURS as much as it will be OURS. Get your head out of the sand. This isn't going to go away. JIm Esquivel I genuinely believe that vaccines push certain children over the edge into autism. I think child autism has many more sources of mercury than Thimerosal that very rarely get debated. For instance, how many mothers have a mouth full of mercury fillings? To me it is absoulutely disgraceful that dentists still stick these awful things in our mouths! I would love some research correlating women who have multiple mercury amalgam fillings who also have autistic children. As for vaccines, the guilt trip on parents forced to give them to their kids is totally unfair. Regarding the comment above about fluoride in water being a triumph. The writer fails to acknowledge the numerous lawsuits settled out of court by toothpaste manufacturers where children have had horrendous reactions to this ghastly poisonous substance. Fluoride hardens the outside of the tooth yes, but also causes a brittle effect on the enamel, and makes it harder to detect dental caries. I dread to think what the accumulative, multi-generational toxic burden is from this! It's unbelievable that somebody supports poison in our water - a by product of aluminium production that they didn't know what to do with. This story is just the tip of the autism epidemic iceberg. What do vaccines, processed wheat, and processed milk all have in common? They are all high in the free amino acid Glutamate, which is added as a preservative to vaccines. The very same amino acid used by the body as a neurotransmitter in its free state. The very same amino acid that the genes found for autism carry the instructions to make the synapses for. The very same amino acid found in high amounts in processed foods. The very same amino acid that competes for uptake with the amino acid cysteine, (used to make taurine and glutathione - which gets rid of mercury from ANY source). The very same amino acid that the latest drugs If Big Pharma doesn't know what triggers autism in children with the genes for it, then why are they making so many new glutamate BLOCKING drugs? Are they focusing our attention so hard on thimerasol because a different vaccine additive still in vaccines is really the culprit - and it is an additive that may lead to mercury toxicity later? And more $$$ for treatment? If we allow for the existence of PKU (tested for at birth) which is an error of metabolism for the amino acid phenylalanine, then why don't we believe that children with genetic problems with glutamate synapses might have trouble with glutamate- laden food and vaccines? They give PKU children a special diet till they are 7 - why not do the same for children with autism genes? Would you vaccinate a child with PKU with a vaccine containing a lot of free phenylalanine before their brain was hardwired? Don't think so. Every child is so unique. Our bodies are so different and how one child handles vaccines can differ greatly from how another child does. I beleive that most health issues are the result of numerous factors; I know that vaccines, pesticices, and the other many toxins of this world are creating autism, cancers, autoimmune disease and many other illnesses and they will continue to until we decided to learn how to enhance our immune systems and decrease the amount of toxins we expose ourselves and our children to! I would love to see the CDC and pharmaceutical companies compare fully vaccinated children to fully and partial vaccinated children in their studies. If the government made a fund for vaccination caused illnesses, doesn't it stand to reason that they knew the vaccines could be harmful. Why would you make a fund to pay for cases such as this poor girl, if you didn't believe there was a link? Exactly, you wouldn't. They know it and that's why they stopped using the \"mercury\" in 2001. Vaccines were originally invented because we were living in filth. However, in the US this is no longer the case. Our daughter is 10 years old and has never been vaccinated. She's healthier than most of the kids in her class at school. what amazes me is that the medical establishment in one or two years has been able to write off the existence of a link between autism and the vaccine because of its so-called investigations. Is it a remote possibility that the number of vaccinations that a child receives affect the the child's immune system negatively by creating a type of overload? As a dog, when I bring the animal to the vet he spaces out the vaccinations because it is the safe thing to do. Another thing I find interesting that groups of Amish children who have not been vaccinated have a near zero incidence of autism. Have any researchers addressed that important detail? The jury is still out, and in my humble opinion the medical bureaucrats no better than the political bureaucrats who hide in back of a variety of things rather than do the right thing and try to find the truth with no stone left unturned. A whole generation of kids needs a few good people to do the right thing and dig until the scourg of autism has been defeated. My sister has a 9 year old austic girl. Like most she was normal up til she was almost 2. She had battled ear infection and viral infections. One day she got sick and started screaming and having a fit. She had an upset stomach, feverish but the doctor said she had to ride it out. To this day I believe that the medicaine she took is what caused her autsim. I hope and pray every parent out their gets help for their child and they study hard and effortlessly on this matter. As we speak the the percentage rises and more and more children are being dianogesed. We need to make a stand and fight this together. God Bless and take care. Each time a concern has been raised about a vaccine or vaccine ingredient causing autism, the scientific community has conducted exhaustive studies on the issue, comparing children who did and did not receive the MMR vaccine, or vaccines containing thimerosol, in a variety of countries including the US, Sweden, the UK, and Japan. As a result, a simple pubmed search for scientific articles on autism and vaccines will give you 404 articles which find no link between either the MMR vaccine or thimerosol and autism. The more recent vaccine formulations have not been so extensively tested, and they should be. But, given the consistent failure to find any association between vaccines and autism, it seems unlikely that a link will emerge. I am a pediatrician and mother of a 2 year-old in Boston, MA. I think that a major piece of this story is missing and that is, why did Hannah receive 9 vaccines in one day? Her mother began to say that she did not let Hannah get her 12-month vaccines and that Hannah was \"behind\" on her shots, but she was interrupted. I think that this is an important question because children develop high fevers in response to only one vaccine, so one can imagine the immune response with 9. High fevers and prolonged illness can result in neurological consequences by themselves, so I think that it is very important that we (the medical community and all the Moms and Dads out there) really need to hear more about this case. Thanks for your input! Who is the doctor Harvey Cop? He sits there shaking his head at Dr Gupta when he suggested maybe not giving multiple vaccines at one visit. I did that with both of my boys and the doctor and the nurses criticized me for it. It is a parent's choice not the doctors or the nurses. Just from the stand point of the children having an adverse reaction to the different vaccines. How would the doctors know which one they where having a reaction to, if they administer 9 at a time? I wouldn't mix 9 different alcoholic beverages or 9 different anythings for that matter. Why would I chance my children's health to save a trip to the doctor's office? Dr. Gupta nailed it on the head with his response to the guest in the middle. Mike Orlando, FL Well, as a mother I am VERY concerned and overwhelmed. First of all, I have always been apprehensive to vaccines and modern medicine. I do believe vaccines trigger many dormant problems our bodies may have. Since my daughter's birth I have made sure she gets all her vaccinations all together and now I feel extremely concerned. She is 9months old and well, I'm asking for advice from all of you because I am a new and young mother. What are your suggestions? We must do what is healthy for the majority.We cannot bring devasating diseases once again into the public domain for fear of side effects. I too am concerned about the assault on the immune system from all the vaccinations now recommended. I feel the best odds for precaution are to space the vaccines over a period of months instead of the clumping them together. Everything is a risk, you can only choose what you're convinced is the most prudent and beneficial for your child and society as a whole. This is beginning of the discovery of one of the biggest cover-ups in the CDCs and Pharmaceutical companies history. First, the reason the pedetrians are not educated is because the latest information is not in the published pediatric journals. Next,all of the so-called top notch studies were funded by the Pharmaceutical companies and performed by scientists that work for the Pharmaceutical companies. The CDC has individuals that are not qualified to recommend shot schedules. Who do they get their recommedations on shot schedules from...the Pharmaceutical companies. How much money does the Pharmaceutical companies make on vaccines each year? Is that why we've gone from 15 vaccines in the 80s to over 60 vaccines today?In addition, Themerosal is still in the Flu vaccine that is now recommended to children and pregnant women. The comment about thermerosal being removed is not all true. The companies do NOT have to report Themerosal traces. Furthermore, they have replaced thermerosal with aluminum to preserve several vaccines. All toxic metals. Here's the bottom line: The Pharmaceutical companies need to seperate the shots. No Combos like the MMR and DTap. NO TOXIC Preservatives like Thermerosal or Aluminum. I would rather they cost more than have an epidemic. Next, our kid immune systems CANNOT handle the amount of LIVE virus we are injecting in them. Why does a NEW born need Hep B? Plenty of other examples in the CDC schedule. Finally, there is no such thing as a genetic epidemic! Dr. Gupta and medical professionals please think CRITICALLY and Challenge. To the media, please help our kids. The information is out there. Thank you I have followed the vaccine/autism debate for nine years. The sad fact is that we know very little about the relationship between vaccines and auto-immune illness because there has never been a properly designed study comparing fully vaccinated children with never vaccinated children. Those of us who suspect a connection between vaccines and autism have been lobbying for such a study for a long time. Congresswoman Sheila Maloney has introduced legislation to force the CDC to peform such a study. Until it is done we won't know. The answer to the question of whether or not vaccines cause autism is very simple. Compare vaccinated children to the unvaccinated. Isn't this the gold standard of \"science\"? I have two unvaccinated boys that I will gladly offer to help. I am a practicing pediatrician. Everyone that has a child with autism wants to blame something or someone. Researchers have now found a gene that can explain 1% of autism cases. Another study shows that since eliminating mercury from vaccines that autism has actually increased. NO study links shots with autism, NONE! People in the US need to take a look at their grandparents who may have polio or a baby in the hospital that was exposed and acquired pertussis or watch a 7 year old with measles encephalopathy painfully die. Vaccines have been an enormous advance in health of the entire world. Yes there are some kids who have bad reaction/allergies and that risk is very low, but real. The alternative is a day where dozens of kids lay dead each year in each of YOUR neighborhoods from infectious diseases that are never seen today. We empathize with your autistic child, but don't put the rest of your neighborhood, city, state or nation at risk of infectious plagues to diseases that we have essentially conquered by spreading your fear and baseless agenda. Spend your time helping your own child and not hurting others. As a mother of three children and a chiropractor, I have devoted a great deal of time to the study of vaccinations and their safety. I have a few points I would like to make: 1.) Vaccinations are never 100% effective. That should be something that has become fairly apparent with the recent news of what total failure this year's influenza vaccine is. It is always possible to catch a disease despite being vaccinated against it. We also saw that happen a few years ago with the outbreaks of whooping cough and mumps. The argument that those of us are healthy simply because those around us are vaccinated really makes not sense. In each of these outbreaks, the majority of those sicken with the diseases were those that had been vaccinated. Theoretically, those vaccinated should never come down with the disease because they are \"protected\" but as we have seen, they are still vulnerable. I have three children, ages 7, 5 and 5 months. Not once in their lives have any of my children ever been vaccinated. Not once have they ever taken an antibiotic. Yes, they have gotten sick but they get over it. I am more afraid of these vaccines than I am of the actual disease. I believe that through feeding my children wholesome foods and supporting their bodies naturally that although they may get sick, their immune systems are strong enough. Most children that have serious complications are already immuno-compromised anyway. They lack proper nutrition and in some cases even good hygiene which can leave a child very vulnerable to complications. Most of our parents and grandparents had these diseases as youngsters and are still here today to tell about it. Some disease we vaccinate the children against are not even diseases they are in danger of contracting!! Take Hepatitis B for example. The only ways of contracting it is through contaminated body fluids, such as through needles or unprotected sex yet we are giving this vaccine to babies in the first 12 hours after birth. Of course a child can catch it from mom but can't we screen mom for the disease?? If she doesn't have it then what is the point?? Immunity from this vaccine only lasts about 10 years and will wear off prior to the time that a child can engage in risky behviors and would need a booster anyway!! 2.) When looking at research done studying a possible connection to vaccines and Autism, always check to see who is either funding the study and/or who is doing the research. Unfortunately, many people with financial ties to vaccine manufacturers are the ones carrying out the research and that spells conflict of interest. Would it really be in their best interest if a person admitted a detrimental link between vaccines and autism if they work for the company that provides them with a paycheck?? And don't forget, the FDA, CDC, NIH, etc, are all lined with people who work on these agencies behalf yet are also paid researchers/members of the drug companies. 3.) This is the point I would really like to make because I really think the rest is irrelevant until we answer this question. On every TV show and in every magazine article, we hear every mother's story about how her child developed Autism AFTER getting the child vaccinated. What about the children that have never been vaccinated?? What is the statistic for children never vaccinated and their incidence for developing Autism?? The prevalence of Autism these days is as high as 1 in 150. What about for those not vaccinated? What if we look at this population of people and find that there is a substantial difference in the incidence of Autism than for those that are vaccinated?? This could not be merely dismissed as a coincidence. After looking at some information available on the web, an investigative reporter for the United Press International, Dan Olmsted, found that the incidence of Autism around an AMish community in Ohio was 1 in 15000!! This is definitely something that needs to be looked at. This is a perfect \"control\" group for these experiments. I would love to see the doctors on Larry King answer this questions or explain this away. Why isn't this being looked into more thoroughly, unless someone is afraid of what might be found?? I also find it quite interesting that members of the medical community are now pointing to a link between the shots and autism, it is no longer just the crazies out in left field saying it. I personally would not take a change of watching my perfectly healthy children, developing above normal, to be given an injection that may or may not preclude them from contracting a disease, and then watch them slowly roll backward and stop progressing. 4.) My last point is this: if indeed there is no link between mercury toxicity or toxins within vaccines (formaldehyde, ethylene glycol or antifreeze, aluminum and mercury are all used as preservatives) then why is it that children, much like the son of Jenny McCarthy able to show such dramatic improvement of his symptoms by cleansing out his body and ridding his body of toxins?? The \"experts\" claim that there is no link to Autism and for all the money being spent, no one has ever said what the cause is and since the cause is still unknown, then how can we be sure? Look, if vaccines were harmless, the government would not have given them immunity from lawsuits and there certainly wouldn't be a vaccine injury compensation fund set up by the government to compensate families for children injured by vaccines. Do the research for yourself and see what you can come up with. y daughter developed seizures and autism like tendencies after her second DPT immunization. She has now live 30 years with many challenges and I have much information about waht can be done to prevent and treat which I am glad to share. So if vaccination is so safe then why is there a bell curve pattern set up for the distribution of vaccination? Many children die every from \"adverse reactions\" to their vaccinations. I know this because it happened to the child of a friend of mine. His doctor told him that the child simply must have \"fallen out side the bell curve of the 'normal' population.\" That is not exceptable. Childrens' nervous systems are still developing, where an adults is fully formed. Heavy metal poisoning (such as mercury) is much more detrimental to a child than an adult. Though thimerosal is not used as often in the vaccines themselves. Mercury is still used as a preservative in the bottles that they are stored in. The benefits of vaccination are debatable and studies have had varying results. You do not have to take them or vaccination your child if so choose. Or you can wait until your child is more mature to get give the vaccinations. Research the issue for yourself, then decide whether to vaccination or not. You have a choice! We as parents really need to start taking control of our children's health care. If parents would just educate themselves on other options for the health of their family instead of just running to the doctor for a cold. Isn't it strange how children who are not vaccinated and amish children have no cases of autism? Wake up people you had a child for a reason, now protect them!! Hoemopathy works wonders. Once again the CDC has sprung to the defense of vaccines. It doesn't take a genius to see that they should have immediatly issued a mandate to test for the condition Hannah has BEFORE a vaccine is given from now on. As a mom of 22 years with a child no one wanted to admit that she had problems (alot like austism after seeing other parents explain autism now and the results from shots). As a baby after she got her shots starting in 1985, both she and I have lived through a living hell childhood! Kept telling her doctor about the miserable time after those shots! At 3 1/2 she said she wanted to die and live not longer. Banging head on walls, violent out breaks. Saw Dr. by happenstance for parenting class after she was 8 yrs old and he diagnoised her as ADD back then. School said they didn't think she had problem. I wish I had help back then for this child!!!! With help of a homopathic doctor from the state of Washington at age 17, we were able to get her help to get those poisions somewhat out of her system. She was constantly constipated, soiled pants, appendix flare ups in hospital,ear infections, family blamed me as bad mother, her as freak! Dr. also prescribed so many antibotics from all her ear infections that did not help either. Tubes in ears zillons of times. These drug companies should be held responsible for ruining so many affected families from experimenting with children! Tired Old Mom originally from CT Karen Ginn from Boone, NC said: It was nice to finally hear from Dr. Gupta, whom I like to listen to on several issues, finally comment/give advice that I've been hearing for the past ten years. My son developed autism at around 18 mths, after several vaccines. He's now 10, and we've known for at least 8 years that 1). the vaccines, acc. to our observation and medical records, appeared CAUSAL in Justin's autism 2). thimerasol causes many allergic reactions and shouldn't be in vaccines, and 3). vaccines should be spaced out. Thanks Dr. Gupta for pointing this out to the public. As for those who want to con't to \"extol\" vaccines, remember that QUALITY of life, for some, is also as important as life, and that the \"probabality\" of catching certain illnesses like whooping cough and measles just don't justify incorrect vaccine dosing that lead to autism diabilities. Karen Ginn My son is one of thousands upon thousands of children that were perfectly normal. He received his shots and for the following two days he appeared tired and lathargic. I was told some children get this \"reaction\" the next day my son was gone. The night before we were singing and dancing to \"Elmo\" and the next day he was gone. We have had excellent results woth the \"Gluten and crecian free diet\" and the early intervention. So if it is genetic how is it after two years we got our son back? I thank God every day that he is back. To those who insist that vaccines have not, are not and will no be linked in any way to ASD. That hundreds upon hundreds of stories about children regressing into autism, or developing other autoinmune disorders shortly after a round of vaccination are just the product of fertile imaginations. That thimerosal was taken out of the vaccines in 2001. That the CDC, AAP and FDA have no other interest than the health of our kids. That they are and always will be transparent. That they are not financially supported by vaccine makers. That they have no ties whatsoever with the pharmaceutical industry. That every study ever published discrediting the link between thimerosal or the MMR jab with autism has been unbiased, not manipulated, flawless, definitive, and that the researchers and authors of these studies never had or have any special interests, never received any funding or had any link with the CDC or pharmaceutical companies, and that they were never related in any way shape or form with the pharmaceutical industry. To those who think that the media is fair and balanced in reporting both sides of the story. That they do their homework before they report anything, and that they do not respond to any special interests. That every parent who tries to do \"unproven\" alternative therapies is an irresponsible whacko even if the kids get better, and If they do so is because that is just the natural progression of their autism, or the alternative. that they were never in the spectrum in the first place. That every parent should only try ST, OT or ABA with their kids as if these therapies were free, affordable, or even accesible to everyone. I cannot force everyone to be objective and really do their homework, as I'm sure I don't have the time to do it for them. As Kim Staglano puts it \"you cannot expect 100% of the vaccines to be 100% safe, 100% of the time to 100% of the children\" Yet the CDC thinks so. My son was diagnosed with PDD-NOS last a year ago, and he is the only peer reviewed double blind placebo controlled study that I need. No developmental pediatrician, neurologist, psychologist or therapists have been able to explain to me why his metabolism is so messed up, or why he suffers frequent episodes of unexplained diarrhea, or why he has yeast and atypical bacteria overgrowth in his GI tract, or why he suffers from colitis, or why he is proven mercury and lead toxic. Furthermore, they have not been able to explain why so many kids in the spectrum have similar clinical problems as my son does, or why my son's behaviors and symptoms have markedly improved with \"voodoo\" therapies, and treating his clinical issues. If thimerosal was removed in 2001, then why in feb. 2007 we found thimerosal in 3 out of 4 vaccines that my then 4 months old daughter was going to receive just to have her ears pierced (I still have the vaccine inserts, and by the way this happened in Houston, TX and not in Uganda or wherever). I read somewhere that you \"don't need a study to know that sh.. stinks\", I guess if enough people can agree on that, then thousands of anecdotal stories cannot or should not be ignored and considered worthless. Also, I don't want to say that the CDC or the AAP are corrupted and are profoundly interested in protecting their contributors and sources of funding (If I'm just making this up, just go their web pages and find out for yourselves), yet no one who has in all honesty reviewed the famous Denmark studies (form the statistical flaws to the researchers involved, as well as to the funding sources and vested interests), or the manipulation given to the original Verstraten data presented at Simpsonwood could in their right mind say that institutions like the above mentioned are transparent, and that they only have our children best interests in mind. The IOM, and the FDA are also just eating from the same plate. The ignorance, or better said, lack of information that the mainstream medical community has is due in large part to their trust of the official federal institutions mentioned. Your son/daughter's pediatrician cannot be directly blamed for not knowing, but for not researching. A study is published today (reputable or not)that allegedly destroys the thimerosal or MMR theories as causes of autism, and for the next three weeks you will find it on the web, in newspapers, television news, radio, magazines, and every form of media ever created. If such study (reputable or not) supported the idea that thimerosal or the MMR is related to autism causation you will be lucky if you get to read about it in the classifieds section of a God forsaken newspaper. The scientific evidence that supports a connection is vast. For starters it is universally known that if I was mass murderer I would inject my victims with mercury. It wouldn't take much to kill them, and only very minimal dosis would cause serious neurological damage. It is toxic and that is just a fact. Apparently everybody has an agenda, and the parents are left to find answers on their own. Unfortunatelly the answers that thousands of parents have found on their own are against everything that is oficially being fed to the masses. Therefore, we can only swim against the current, and work relentlessly with our kids and to see them improve day in and day out with forbidden therapies and traditional therapies as well. In some cases these kids even recover. And parents do it all on their own. The flu vaccines still contain mercury. Why are parents giving their children flu shots still? I haven't given my children flu shots in about three years due to his fear of mercury. What is a parent to do when the school system won't admit your child unless they have all their shots. So we don't really have a choice with these mandaory shots unless we want to home school which is abnormal in my opinion. It's a no win situation and scary. my heart goes out to all the parents with autistic children from these dreadful vaccines. The thimerosal apologist that Larry King interviewed said that parents shouldn't worry, because thimerosal has been removed from vaccines. This is not true. This CNN website says that only eight million of the 132 million flu vaccine doses manufacturers promised to produce for this flu season are thimerosal free. http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/10/31/flu.hm.flu.shot/index.html Doctors in recent years have been routinely advising pregnant women, babies and children to receive these flu shots. Vaccine makers and government health officials will tell you now, as they've told me, that flu vaccines that aren't thimerosal free actually only contain a trace amount of thimerosal, so you still shouldn't worry, even if the one your child might have received wasn't totally thimerosal free. Try to find out what percentage of individual doses of flu vaccines administered in the US have had less than 1 microgram of thimerosal, compared with the percentage that have had the same toxic level of 12 to 25 micrograms per dose that parents like the Polings have been screaming about for years now. Go ahead, I dare you. Robin Nemeth North Royalton, Ohio What all those struggling to make a link between vaccines and autism refuse to accept is that science doesn't respect wishes or fears or anger or frustration. It doesn't recognize fairness or remote possibility. It works via the scientific method. In the case of vaccines and autism, thousands of independent scientists all over the work -- including Scandinavia, where the government pays for ALL healthcare -- have studied hundreds of thousands of vaccine recipient children of all ages, receiving vaccines delivered in all combinations, and found not a scintilla of evidence of a link. In fact, in the case of the Danish study, they found autism rising at a faster rate AFTER thimerasol was removed from vaccines. Here's a tough observation: The vast majority of people really struggling to link vaccines and autism are parents of autistic children. As a friend of someone whose autistic child is now in her late 20s, I am very familiar with the heartache and struggle this syndrome can cause. Not a little of the quest to link vaccine and autism is a search for absolution, as if genetic diseases in children should be \"blamed\" on parents. The pseudoscience behind which they seek solace is stunning. I saw one blogger claim that there is no autism among the Amish, who do not vaccinate. First of all, the Amish have so many genetic issues, as do religious Pakistanis who also marry cousins, that to pick out autism among those closed societies would be a fruitless task. Tracing autism in a family tree can be very hard, once you have to go back more than a few generations. Before the 1940s, you could not know that relatives died of CANCER because of the way both families and the profession hid that fact, because of the associated shame. Mental disorders of all kinds were well hidden as recently as the 1950s. Example: Alzheimers disease. It's always been here, just well hidden in attics until society advanced to the point where nursing homes could handle them. Once a socially acceptable diagnosis, awareness exploded. I think that when my first grandchild is born he/she WILL NOT be getting immunized according to the current government schedule. My brother's son is very autistic, and as a doctor this has been his advice for many years. Dr. Mehmet Oz did not start his children on immunizations until they were six months old. I wonder how Dr. Gupta handled this with his children? And by the way doc if you are reading this, you were my little neighbor boy in Novi. You were such an inquisitive and talkative child, you have definitely found your way to the perfect career! First, for those that take the word of doctors as gold, I am sorry to hear that. Despite what some think, they are only human. My wife and I have done tons of research and decided to skip vaccines. There are two things here...1. if you did choose to vaccinne, good -- it is a personal choice; however, do not judge the parents that chose not to; 2. if you want to see the tide shift on vaccinnes, please report any side effects. There are so many that go unreported that those researching may never get full support. Referring to the Dr. from last night who was shaking his head throughout the \"spread the shots out\" suggestions, does it make sense that no parent would go to the drugstore and pick up 9 different kinds of OTC medicine for a child and administer it all at once...so why administer vaccines that way? As a parent of a son with autism who was laughed at and derided for trying the gluten/dairy free diet when no doctor would approve it, despite overwhelming anacdotal evidence from other families, I am not surprised to find the medical/government response to the claims that vaccines may be linked to autism. I cannot claim the link is a direct cause (for that we need more real research) but dismissing the idea that vaccines may act as a trigger or that we are over vaccinating. Dangerous because as long as the government spend time and money to deny a link instead of warning families with a genetic predisposition not to over vaccinate (3 in 1 vaccine shots..are we really that obsessed with saving money over health!), the spread of autism continues and children, families, school systems and trust in our doctors and goverment are slowly eroding while watch hopelessly. I know there's nothing to save my son from this terrible disorder, but everytime I talk to a desperate mom who's just got the diagnosis for her child, it breaks my heart. It is not true that all thimerisol has been removed from all vaccines. I live in Texas. Just a few months ago I had to request a Thimerisol free Flu vaccine. My pediatrician's nurse said that they only had one left. So we skipped the vaccine for my second child. Please check the facts for yourself. Do not write things that are not true. Thank you My son has now largely recovered from autism. He was diagnosed at age 2 years, 9 months & undiagnosed (by the same developmental pediatrician) a year and a half later. He now has some residual symptoms (ADD/ADHD like that we are working to overcome). Nikolai had terrible gut problems, immune weakness (he was always sick), and loss of eye contact, not answering questions, lost language - we're all familiar with the symptoms. My husband is a very traditional radiologist. He KNOWS what happened; the thimerosol (it's still in the flu vaccines!), the multiple viral components, the antibiotics (for frequent ear infections - in short, a little body overwhealmed by toxins at birth (the hepB vaccine, which he had no risk factors whatsoever for). We have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to recover Nikolai; thank God we had it. So many families do not, or their children are too sick. This is the tragedy of a generation; for the children, their families & for our society. It is driven by greed & stupidity. When my daughter was 15 months old (5 years ago) I was concerned about possible links between the MMR vaccine and autism. I wanted to wait to give her the vaccine. Her pediatrician at that time become enraged that I would not follow his advice to vaccinate her and told me he would not be her doctor anymore. Since I am a full time mother, and she was not exposed to a daycare environment, I waited until my daughter was 31/2years old to give her the MMR. I took the risk, and have never regretted it. Parents, listen to your gut to decide what's best for your child. I am the dad of an autistic 3 y/o girl 5 days after her last vaccinne she regressed into a whole different little girl. I rushed her to the Dr. She has not been the same. Prior to that she was exceeding dev milestones. However, I have been clasified as a parent wanting to assign blame to a genetic problem. If my daughter had bumped her head hard & lost motor & cognitive ability 5 days later I would conclude that it was the head injury. I am sorry in my family it was too much of a coincidence. I realize Dr. Gupta that you have a responsibility as a doctor to be Objective in your analysis of certain health concerns. But when it comes to the Federal Governments underlying involvement in reckless Pharmecutical companies practices you seem to side with the Federal side of the story. It appears that the story regarding Hannah Poling has caused a watershed so get ready, there will be many class actions suits to come, who will you side with then? Would it be safe to inject a vaccine into a child if it contained ANY amount of lead, another heavy metal? No, of course not. So why do we with mercury which is ONE HUNDRED times MORE TOXIC than lead, and it's found in ALL flu shots as well as many childhood immunizations. An uneducated answer by someone simply saying that an unsafe vaccine \"triggered\" a condition leading to autism is missing the point. The court case in Georgia successfully concluded that any human being in order to process the level of mercury found in each individual vaccine, let alone multiple vaccinations, need to weigh 250 pounds for the blood-levels to not show mercury toxicity. I urge anyone with questions about a connection between vaccines and autism to check out the Autism Speaks website. They are an organization that has been incredibly effective in raising public awareness of autism and have raised a huge amount of money for research into causes and treatments for autism. I don't think you can accuse them of being in the pocket of big pharma. Their FAQ section addresses the vaccine question in a clear and balanced way. I have a 13 year OLD son, who, got his shots at the age appropriate time. He was a healthy, happy, little boy. But, of course, when i mentioned to his doctor the weird behaviors that started right after, i was told, \"Oh thats normal, it will be ok\" I remember a year went by, and i had him into the the doctor for a check up, and she said she had watched him in the waiting room, and he showed signs of Autism. What?? What is Autism??? My little boy was diagnoised with PPD- Autism - 3 months later. Devastating news. How are you able to swallow that news, and just move on??? How are you able to digest being handed a happy, healthy baby boy at birth, and be told less then 3 years later he has Autism? The goverment will NEVER admit to being wrong. Of Course there is NO LINK with Childhood Shots to Autism. To this day, it still upsets me, makes me cry when i read about other parents that have to deal with this. Autism is devstating to your family. It rips your heart out because I feel like my child will not have the same chance at a normal life like everyone else. He'll never drive a car, he'll never date, he'll never get married, he'll never have children. That was RIPPED away from him, and from me. MAybe the members of the goverment should spend a day in the life of some of us parents who deal with the day to day struggles of raising a child with Autism. I have always suspected a genetic link (or links)--but we just didn't have the knowledge to recognize what genes might predispose some kids to such reactions. I'm thankful that data is beginning to emerge. I'm also sorry the U.S. has set up a system where we are forced in many instances to use lawsuits to get the healthcare we need. Even when doctors suspect something as a possibility these days, they may not be free to comment on it because of insurance and lawsuit concerns, and desperate parents join any lawsuit they think may be able to bring some financial relief. There is nothing wrong with asking more questions. Vaccine safety should be a priority for all people, not just those who have loved ones suffering from autism. Vaccination is a medical procedure, which the government mandates parents must support. Therefore, the government must ensure without a doubt that vaccines are safe or develop better protocols to identify those individuals that might be at risk of side effects from vaccines. Nothing should be more important to Americans than the health of our nations children. They are the future. The question is NOT \"do vaccines cause autism?\" - that answer is \"no\". This is the question: \"Do vaccines, the components in the vaccines, how they are given, and in what frequency and combination - have a profound effect on the development of a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism in certain susceptible people?\" The answer is likely \"YES.\" Going forward, the medical community must start formally identifying those at risk. There are tests that can be accomplished to assess immunity, metabolism, methylation defects, cytochrome functions, and mitochondrial function. It is not necessarily accurate that the CDC denies any connection between vaccines and autism when in fact on April 19, 2007, Dr. Larry L. Needham Chief, Organic Analytical Toxicology Branch, CDC, announced to the US National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine that Thimerosal (mercury containing preservative in vaccines) was among the \"Chemicals Linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder.\" The CDC reviewed all the studies thoroughly and came up with this opinion. The issue is not vaccinate or not vaccinate. The issue is to vaccinate safely. When the comment is made that the child had a \"rare, underlying disorder\" - the point remains that she was developing well and showed no symptoms of the disorder until the simultaneous challenge of 9 vaccines including the ingredient thimerosal. And how do we know it is rare - if the only children tested are those with symptoms? How many other children are asymptomatic and would show up with the same disorder if tested or screened? There can be mitochondrial inefficiencies that are not full mitochondrial disorders and they may stay quiescent until exogneously challenged. In finite testing of children with autism, it is not unusual to find metabolic problems including those that involve mitochondrial function. Dana Laake, MS, LDN Licensed Nutritionist Sometimes people just have genetic tendencies toward things that cannot be predicted or tested for. In my case, apparently I am sensitive to iodine and an amount of iodine that would not have affected a normal person triggered hyperthyroidism in me. It's no one's fault; I just happened to end up with the right genetics for it. These things just happen sometimes and there's nothing that can be done to prevent it. Regressive autism is the type that has increased exponentially each decade. It is unlikely a genetic disorder. There may be predisposition for methylation defects, sulfation defects, abnormal porphyrin metabolism, and defects in the metabolism of toxic metals. The trigger is what makes the difference. Autism is a mini-epidemic and genetic epidemics do not exist. What we are seeing is environmental modification of gene expression. Of concern is that each generation comes into the world with unique inherited gene polymorphisms and then they are exposed to an increasingly toxic environment. The autistic children are our canaries in the coal mine. Dana Laake, Licensed Nutritionist, Co-auther: The Kid-Friendly ADHD & Autism Cookbook (and guide). My wife directed the special education department in our city. They saw a huge increase in cases of unexplained autism in the 80's and 90's. Parents and doctors won't see this huge increase, they don't see large populations. The vaccine to autism link is one possible cause. When it came time to immunize our first born, we wanted assurances he would be unharmed. We insisted no mercury, and would have preferred he be exposed to no more than 2 diseases at a time. We are not Luddites. Whats wrong with insisting on the removal of a poison and not exposing an infant to 5 or 6 diseases at once. All kids get immunized eventually. It's a requirement to enter school. Does doing 6 immunizations at once save the insurance companies money? Some have created a 'straw man' argument around vaccines and autigsm. My wife and I know the necessity of vaccination. We just want the pharmaceuticals to remove the themerisol and stagger the vacinations I am the father of 2 daughters with Autism. I am absolutely convinced that there is some direct correlation between vaccines and Autism. My first daughter began exhibiting symptoms within hours of receiving an MMR vaccine. These symptoms included a fever, rash and swollen lumps under her armpits and, on the insides of her upper thighs (near the groin). We are currently enrolled in New Jersey's first Autism Research project out of UMDNJ in Newak. I do believe the government and the CDC is trying to obscure the facts due to a fear of parents avoiding vaccines and it's resulting consequences. I believe, in the Poling's court case, the government waived the plaintiff's expert testimony to avoid exposing solid medical proof from \"medical experts\" going on record to prove that there is a clear connection between vaccines and Autism. Without this \"Expert Testimony\" on record and, with a secret, court-settlement, agreement that includes concessions by the Polings (concessions most likely directing them to speak evasively about the \"general\" vaccine/autism connection, outside of their daughter's case), the Federal Government and the CDC can continue to publicly deny any direct connection between the two. I have had ample experience testifying in courts of law and know all too well that such deals are often made. It's really a shame that the Government's fear of non-vaccination and, it's possible \"outbreak\" consequences is keeping the truth under lock and key. I know that in, investigations in general, you're not going to find evidence of a crime if you're deliberately looking in the wrong place. Oh, I believe there is plenty of research going on under the premise that they are looking for a Vaccine/Autism link but, think of the litigious consequences to the government, the big pharmaceutical companies and their Washington lobbyists and, the general public's refusal to vaccinate and, you have plenty of motive to hide the evidence. I believe there is a direct link but, unfortunately, many more families will be forced to suffer before the government and CDC take a more proactive initiative. John Scanlan Elmwood Park, New Jersey I am the father of 2 daughters with Autism. I am absolutely convinced that there is some direct correlation between vaccines and Autism.

John Scanlan Elmwood Park, New Jersey my husband and myself did surveys for the cdc as we were there, we hearde several people comment as to their \"child's special health care needs\", was a following survey we did at the same time, as shot records. Many people said that their child's autism was a result of getting vaccines, and their syptoms ranged from serious to mild, but all had similiar stories that drew us to a conclusion that there is a conection with vaccines and autism and or brain disorder related problems. As we are now scared to have our grandson to be vacinated now having this knowledge, prior to this and we vacinated ours children no problem. So what i am trying to say is that in a year doing this survey, and unable to bias the surveyby commenting or asking questions only as written. Listening to their asnswers alone as the parents of these children, during the survey from the cdc...it was clear there were too many families all over the U>S, from varied walks of life, different incomes and different areas of the U.S, were stating the same things. It was hard not to see a connection. i only hope it all comes to an end for too many families suffering. Vaccines have multiple components. The body reacts to each component. If 9 vaccines are given in one sitting, you would multiply reactions by 9. therefore 9 vaccines with 5 components would cause 45 reactions simutaiously. To me that sounds a little overwhelming for a baby's system. It's obvious that vaccines are not well understood, as this and many other cases are simple proofs for that. Reading about this particular case makes me very angry at those that advocate vaccination without having a better understanding about it, and at the same time all those advocates have made sure they would be protected by law for any accountability. First of all, I would like to thank CNN and Larry King for the program about autism broadcasted yesterday. Here in the Philippines, there are so many cases of children with autism and the number is growing. Since most of the vaccines and medicine we use are imported from the U.S. and Europe, I certainly hope that not just the government of United States, but also the government from the European Community make more research to prevent this to become an epidemic. We are also among the families who have autistic children. Everyday, my two nephews are into various therapies which cost us much. Since there are doubts about mutiple vaccines, for the meantime, I strongly urge all parents to provide space for each vaccines. Dr. Gupta: There is something that seems to be overlooked in the search for the cause or causes of autism. In the time that the rate of autism has drastically increased, women have been subjected to routine ultrasound exams. Ultrasound has never been proven safe yet unborn babies are exposed to it at least twice routinely. My sons are 30 and 22 and even though ultrasound was available I chose not to have the exams with both pregnancies. Most ultrasound exams are done just to confirm pregnancy and satisfy the parents curiousity of the baby growing inside and what gender it is. As a parent of twin autistic boys (both who regressed after vaccines), nobody is saying the idea of vaccines is 100% wrong and should be stopped. But with all the changes in vaccines over the years, the question is do we really know it's safe for every single child. The sad part is all the medical associations, like the CDC, stating there cannot be connection between vaccines and autism. But if nobody knows the causes of autism, I don't see how anybody can wash their hands of it and say 'it's not me.' This case is unprecedented for many reasons, but what scares me is that now the government and/or medical associations are resorting to essentially 'hush money' to try and hide this and avoid facts comimg out in court. If medical associations or the government think there is really no connection, they should release the information presented by the family in this case to the public for parent awareness. That is the day I will believe that groups like the CDC truly think vaccines don't at least contribute to autism. Helping the future of all children should be our goal, not worrying about what litigation there may be. My son is 4 1/2 years old. We have been dealing with autism-like behaviors since he was about 12-18 months old. He was developing normally until that time. We also had a move in that time which could have contributed, but his regression started prior to the move. His eating habits were changing, and he was talking less and less. After our move, he pretty much stopped talking altogether, pointing and grunting becoming his communication, and his eating habits were rapidly declining. When he was diagnosed with PDD at the age of 2 1/2, I began doing some research, and I remember a specific incident related to his vaccinations. My husband and I didn't have insurance at the time, and the pediatrician's office administered my son's vaccine at a lower price and said it was the \"health department\" vaccine, which led me to believe that it was different from the ones the office normally used for their patients. Once my son's behaviors started changing, the pediatrician wanted to be kept as informed as possible about how he was doing, and, thinking back on it now, it would appear that request was probably to chart his progress and how he has developed since those vaccines were administered. Now my son has to see a speech therapist, and I have to fight with the school systems to keep him in a \"normal\" classroom setting because he is very bright. He knew his ABCs, could count to 20, and knew all his colors before preschool. He is now reading and writing, something most of his peers can't do. He is doing normal little boy things, like sports, playing with cars and trucks, trains, swimming. There are just some issues with his behavior and social skills. My husband and I haven't had him tested for autism or asperger's syndrome yet because we want to believe the diagnosis of PDD, which he could grow out of between the ages of 5 and 7. But, I am somewhat resentful that those vaccines could have potentially taken away how much further my son could be at this point because of a negative reaction to a preservative contained in those vaccines. We, as parents, are put between a rock and a hard place when it comes to choosing what is best for our children. The vaccines are a requirement by the government, yet they are potentially poisoning our children with those very vaccines. At the very least, we are being used as human guinea pigs. I think the connection to autism and vaccinations is just the tip of the iceburg. I do not know anyone that does not have some kind of auto immune disease. I believe they are all caused by vaccinations. We were born with good immune systems and this is what happens when you man starts fooling around with perfection. I have no problem with vaccinating kids against serious preventable illnesses, but when my son was in grade 3, the school sent home a permission slip to vaccinate for Heapatitis B. They also sent him home with a glossy brochure (obviously from a drug company) explaining why our children needed such a vaccine. I went to the Health Canada website (I live in Canada) and it stated that only 'high risk' individuals need to be vaccinated for Hepatitis B. High risk was defined as IV drug users, sex trade workers and people that participate in high risk sexual behaviour. Furthermore, it stated that the vaccine had been proven effective for only 10 years, at best. I questioned the school about why on earth we should vaccinate 8 year olds for this disease and they treated me like I had two heads. I think we've forgotten how to think critically about our own health - we assume that every product out there is good for us. I hope that this case will help trigger more intense investigations about the link between immunizations and autism. Or maybe a revision of the immunization schedule. If parents are hesitant about having there child immunized, Stephanie Cave has a book out with a alternative immunization schedule. JB All medicines have side affects; the bad go with the good. I am conflicted about vaccines because I believe that they have been a boon to humanity; however they do have side affects. Dr. Archie Kalokerinos of Australia discovered that vaccines could induce severe acute vitamin C deficiency. He wrote a book called \"Every Second Child\" about the affect of vaccinations to Aboriginal children. He pinpointed the increase in vaccination campaigns as the reason why, at a certain point, up to half of the vaccinated Aboriginal infants died, obviously from an acute vitamin C deficiency provoked by the vaccination. I always take an extra dose of Vitamin C prior and after any vaccines are given. Since taking the extra Vitamin C, I have noticed that my injections sites no longer become swollen. Whenever a body is subjected to stress, the need for Vitamin C increases drastically. Since the purpose of the vaccine is to stress the body, extra Vitamin C is need. There is a case of autism in the 70's in France(shown on TV and they-Mother and son- wrote 2 books),the mother realised that she was the ONLY one who could take her son out of his autism.HE was 7y.old,it has not been easy but with perseverence she made it.Now that young man is COMPLETELY\"normal\". My experience:my nefew is autistic,\"light\"now because I helped him A LOT.I was his \"nanny\" from his age of 1 to 6y.old.His autism started at the age of 2and an half.So, I SAW him becoming autistic and as I LIVED his autism with him,we've been VERY close,I can tell you that autism is a RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM. MY \"definition\" of autism(and the term should be \"reserved\" to those children):A child INTELLIGENT and HYPERSENSITIVE who stops or refuses to communicate because for that child somethink is not right. Each child has is own story and I know why my nefew STOPPED to communicate. My daughter had been diagnosed with autism just after receiving her vaccinations at 14 months. I refused to believe this diagnosis and sought treatment. Tests revealed 23 toxins in her system. I was told there was nothing I could do. Here's the catch. She is an identical twin. Her sister was fine and never diagnosed with a problem. This is impossible!! Well, after 3 1/2 years of therapy and chelation therapy my daughter is now a perfectly normal child--just as she was before she was poisoned by these vaccinations. This was the scariest and saddest thing I have ever gone through, but with determination, and hard work, I cured my daughters autism. Everyone needs to know that there is this new \"autism\" as they put it that is affecting our children, however if we just stand by the wayside and do nothing, we are just as responsible as the pharmaceutical companies that developed these drugs. There is help and this ailment can be cured. Don't give up and fight for your children!!! If vaccines are safe,why are vaccine makers immune from lawsuits?Any other company that makes a product that harms people can be sued. This topic brings to mind part of a Kenny Rogers song that I hear from time to time and it goes something like this: \"You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away and know when to run...etc.\". I have discovered that it's all in the \"knowing\". Do you know your child well enough that you are able to predict with, at least, 95% confidence whether a vaccine or anything else, for that matter, will harm them? The medical community can only do so much at any given point in time and, above and beyond that, you sometimes have to become \"an outlaw parent\" and get the information before it gets you! -Encarta. Why havn't they done a study or let it be known if other countries children that have NOT been vaccinated have autism also. I read something about the how there are no signs of autism in Amish children, who do Not get shots. If that is true, then it is OBVIOUS, some children are affected from the vaccines!!! Meanwhile we are destoying the next generation in all countries that give these vaccines!! Wake up World People may say that a child has \"developed\" autism around the age of two. This is not true. The truth is that a parent or caregiver NOTICES the autism around age two. As a teacher of children with autism I find that many parents actually knew their child was 'different' by age one because they did not respond to their name on a regualr basis. (Don't worry if it only happens sometimes- most children have times when they are not paying attention and will not respond). Other parents suspected autism even sooner because of a lack of eye contact and social smiling at other people as a baby. Some parents refuse or do not recognize these signs out of fear or ignorance. However, at the age of two it's easier to see the disorder- and this happens to be age at which many vaccines are given. Thermisol has not been in the vaccines for years- yet autism rates keep rising. There is faulty reasoning here if you are still blaming the vaccines! (The girl in this story had an underlying genetic condition which could have reacted to any sort of strong immune response. Her case is not representative of the norm.) RE: Anonymous said... People may say that a child has \"developed\" autism around the age of two. This is not true. The truth is that a parent or caregiver NOTICES the autism around age two. I wont say what country but my mother came to the USA in 1959, during her youth and life throughout her time growing up she never consumed the coal tar food additives. I am the first generation to suffer from any affects of those additives. My behavior totally changed July 2006 when I totally stopped consuming anything artificial. In fact, My life changed! Therefor I have concluded because of the drastic changes in my life that those artificial food additives were in fact the cause of my aspergers, my bipolar/manic and everything else I have had with regard to my mental health. My children(none had any problems with the vaccines they were given. The only thing ever to bother them was the additives, one daughter was treated for asthma when she never had it! Yellow #5 and 6 are known to cause the esophogeal muscles to constrict mimmicking asthma! No other problems! My grand daughter was born this past september and her early development has not been a problem and she appears totally normal! NOW.... What I said before about Americans having suffered DNA damage that the additives cause for over 100 years puts some body, or validity/substance to my story! IE: In the 1830s William Perkin Invented the food dyes, and in 1906 the FDA started to regulate the 80 some textiles that \"were\" being used as food additives and in 1976 red dye #2 was banned because it was known to cause cancer. It's carcinogenic! Look up wikipedia the search words coal tar and start reading, about half way down, (or something) click on the words group one carcinogen and see what else is on that list! If you use margarine you ARE consuming that toxic stuff! READ! http://www.myspace.com/lordnlady Answer to KIDDOC: Hello, I'm the anonymous who started my previous comment:there is a case in the 70's in France...... I totally agree whith your comments.Autistic people that get out of their autism:no genet.therapy!,vaccines effects disapeared?! Joelle from Brussels Yes, autism appears at the age of 2/3.Now, as I have LIVED autism thru the story of my nefew,I SAW him becoming autistic(I was his \"nanny\"between his age of 1 to 6),there are signs before:one of them is \"depression\",because the child doesn't feel comfortable(usually the mother is kind of \"depressed\" and often the husband is not to present-but each autistic child has its own story-). Depression makes the immune system going down:so 9 vaccins in one shot!(a parent DOCTOR!!),and the yeast infection. About Jenny Mccarthy, what helped her boy is that SHE was feeling better after her divorce and when she met her new boyfriend JIM CAREY.When a mother feels good, her child too! I could talk hours about autism thru my experience(I helped my nefew A LOT)and thru what I have perceived(and still do)whith others stories,testimony... At the age of 2/3 the child can more easily make its world or be in its \"bubble\" About the \"story\"above:My son has now largely recorved from autism....what has been the treatement!!!! Question:is the vaccine(virus)or the others components that is the cause!! Vaccines and autism:Non sense I used to work with someone who claimed that his son's autism was linked to his baby shots. It's amazing to me how anyone can argue that there is no link between the shots containing the mercury preservative and autism. Otherwise healthy children get sick after getting the shots with the mercury... The link seems pretty clear. Mercury is toxic and should never have been used in vaccines to begin with. My friend lost his son when he was six years old due to complications. His marriage soon ended too. It just seems so preventable. I've asked my son's pediatrician before every shot was given if it contained the preservative. I've been told that it has been removed from all of the vaccines with the exception of some, not all, flu shots. If you are worried about this issue please ensure that your own little ones are not given a flu vaccine with the preservative. It's not worth the risk. FACT: my son was not born with Autistic behavior. He met all milestones until 18 m, when he regressed FACT: The pediatrician never did bloodwork or monitored my son's immune health even though Dad had Guillain Barre Syndrome. FACT: Most innoculations are administered without regard to family health history. How can you ask if there is a family history of Autoimmune disorders when you're giving flu shots at the local Krispy Kreme or at a walkup in your local pharmacy? FACT: we are giving too many shots at one time vice 'spreading them out'. This is in order to get 'as many kids as possible innoculated during their well-child visits'. FACT: why are we innoculating again st herpes viruses (ie Chicken pox) when appropriate research has not been done into exactly what the herpes viruses are capable of? ie cell mimicry and stealth viruses FACT: a generation of children are being lost. What will the effects on Medicare be in 40 yrs? FACT: genetic research will not help my son. We are not that advanced. Why is precious funding being spent in this area? In the last 9 yrs since my son was dx'd, cases of Autism have gone from 1:1000 1:250 -> 1:166. More kids being dx'd or a system now looking for it. We're losing time, people. Precious time our kids don't have. It's time to review the research and look at the Facts we have. Not assumptions that can't be backed with hard-proof. While the evidence indicates that there is no vaccine-autism connection, through both my experience as an autistic person as well as those of others on the spectrum, and accounts of those who have become sick and died of preventable illnesses, even if hypothetically it was 100% certain that vaccines contributed to kids being autistic, I would still choose to vaccinate, because the effects of re-introducing these preventable illnesses would result in deaths, a devastating outcome. Autistic people can and do lead fulfilling lives. Dead people can't. I would hate to see the fears people have about having autistic children result in parents suffering the true loss of their child. I have a 9 year old moderately autistic son. I think only other parents of autistic children can understand what my son and I have to work through on a daily basis. I am baffled at how many people hold on to the autism-thimerosal link without any real evidence to support it. I am baffled at the amount of parents that claim their children have vaccine induced autism with no proof whatsoever. Globally study after study after study show no autism-vaccine link but yet still no one will let it die. Now I agree that after reading about this child that children should be tested for mitchondrial disorders and treated appropriately but I am going to guess that 99% of autistic children are not going to be found to have an underlying mitochondrial disorder. I will be waiting to see how all of this plays out. One case does not prove that autism is caused by thimerosal. If you believe the contrary, prove it, show me some evidence. How many people are going to continue to hold on to this with no evidence and cause valuable research funding to be wasted? Tim Kasemodel, Wayzata, MN said... I find it laughable that the Government is trying to separate \"autism like symptoms\" from autism. It is the symptoms themselves that acutally define autism. Tim, I don't believe you comment is entirely accurate. Autism is diagnosed by observed symptoms however the term \"autism like symptoms\" is used when an identified underlying disorder is determined to be the cause of the symptoms. Currently a child with autism will have test results that do not differ from that of a normal child. Of course this would not be the case with a child with phenylketonuria or a mitochondrial disorder. drs said... FACT: my son was not born with Autistic behavior. He met all milestones until 18 m, when he regressed FACT: The pediatrician never did bloodwork or monitored my son's immune health even though Dad had Guillain Barre Syndrome.

Sorry to say, drs but most of what you are saying here is not fact but opinion. My OPINION is that genetic and possible environmental factors that may contribute to autism should be researched. And my response to geosaru: Amen! I agree. Can anyone provide any real evidence (not studies performed by a chiropractor or PTA mom) that a child can develop autism over a few days or from a vaccination (besides this one case of a child that does not actually have autism)? If you have no scientific or medical background (and maybe not even then) do you truly believe that you can accurately determine when your child developed autism? If you started feeling sick right after a vaccination and found out that you had cancer a few days later would you think that you developed cancer in 3 days from your shot? Do some of you truly believe that there is a vaccine conspiracy? That all of the 100s of studies performed with results contrary to your belief are flawed or hiding the truth? Does everyone here realize that there is a major difference in the action and effects of the ethyl mercury in thiomersal and methyl mercury? The blind devotion to this autism vaccine link just amazes me. My 9.5yr old autistic son is not even fully potty trained. God knows if I read studies that provided evidence of an autism-vaccine link, I would be the 1st in line among all of the antivaccinationists. I think that the researchers for autism are missing some very important facts, i live in a country where autism is not present, i just had a baby and when i questionned my pedriatrician about it she told me that in her whole carrier perticularly in this country she has never been faced with one case of autism altough the vaccins that we give here are the same... keep in mind that the reason why i asked her is because one part of my familly that do live in the states has one son and he is Autistic ( very much so ), so obviously i had to come to the conclusion that autism is not genetic but ENVIRONMENTAL, something in the environement in some countries or continents facilitates or bringsit about, now of course i am just speculating from what i've seen and experienced, but i do think that this is something worth looking into because some places in this world just do not have autism, and my family is interesting because befor that specific case of my cousin, it was unheared of. i am still investigating it cause i feel the answer is in the environment not the vaccines. To anon that posts\"Can anyone provide any real evidence (not studies performed by a chiropractor or PTA mom)\" Would you actually look at the science if it were right in front of you? How many scientists and doctors opinions will it take to sway your opinion? visit this link and read what a professor of chemistry and mercury expert has to say.http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/03/boyd-haley-lets.html I could list a hundred doctors and scientists that openly state that vaccines are not what they are portrayed to be and cause all kinds of health problems. I don't want to sound rude but anyone can find these doctors and scientists and yet your post acts as if they don't exist. I ask you to examine WHY you don't know this. | | ABOUT THE BLOGGet a behind-the-scenes look at the latest stories from CNN's chief medical correspondent, PREVIOUS POSTS ARCHIVE RELATED "}
