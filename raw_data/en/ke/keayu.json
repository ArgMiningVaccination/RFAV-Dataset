Calcium channel blocker overdoses can result in: - hypoinsulinaemia, as insulin release is dependent on calcium influx into islet beta cells through L-type calcium channels - calcium channel blocker-induced insulin resistance - calcium channel blockers also impair the cardiac myocyte adaptive response of shifting from using free fatty acids, their favoured \"resting state\" energy substrate, to carbohydrates, due to: - impaired uptake of glucose and free fatty acids by cardiac myocytes - inhibition of calcium-dependent mitochondrial activity required for glucose catabolism The effects of insulin are numerous: - increased glucose and lactate uptake by myocardial cells - improved myocardial function without increased oxygen demand - increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, thus hastening myocardial lactate oxidation and clear the cytosol of glycolytic byproducts that can impair calcium handling and cause diastolic dysfunction. - promotes excitation-contraction coupling and contractility because increased glucose availability results in: - increased sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated calcium ATPase activity - increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations - enhanced calcium entrance into mitochondria and sarcolemma HIET may be best used adjunctively with other measures such as catecholamines, for two reasons: - insulin-mediated inotropy is not catecholamine-mediated, and is not affected by blockers, so additive effects are likely - although insulin appears to improve myocardial contractility, it has no chronotropic effect and may cause vasodilation DOSING AND PROTOCOL Recommended high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy protocol based on the clinical experience of the Western Australian Toxicology Service, published case reports, reviews and animal studies (from Nickson and Little, 2009): ADVERSE EFFECTS Adverse events are predictable, uncommon and easily managed. For instance, there were NO adverse effects in these extreme examples: - the inadvertent administration of a 1000 IU insulin loading dose for verapamil toxicity - treatment of toxic cardiogenic shock for 2 days with a 6 IU/kg/h insulin infusion Adverse effects of HIET include: - hypoglycaemia (<3.3 mmol/L in - hypokalaemia - hypomagnesaemia - hypophosphataemia Hypoglycemia - Some cases of severe calcium channel blocker toxicity in patients presenting with hyperglycaemia do not require any additional glucose administration despite high-dose insulin therapy. - hypoglycaemia may be more likely in milder cases without marked hypotension. Hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) - noted in only two of seven in Greene et al's small series, with a minimum potassium level of 2.8 mmol/L. - Excessive correction of hypokalaemia should be avoided, because it reflects the intracellular shift of potassium from the extracellular compartment due to the action of insulin, rather than a potassium-depleted state. - Hypokalaemia in HIET may actually be beneficial: - it may augment myocardial contractility by enhancing calcium entry during systole - increased intracellular potassium may have a membrane-stabilising effect in excitable cells EVIDENCE - HIET (high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy) was first used to treat verapamil toxicity in humans in 1993, with a favourable outcome. - Since then, in addition to animal studies, there have been >70 cases reporting the beneficial use of HIET in humans, with an overall survival rate of 85%. - HIET has gained widespread acceptance as a core therapy for calcium channel blocker toxicity among clinical toxicologists, even though no randomised controlled trials have been performed to test its efficacy.
