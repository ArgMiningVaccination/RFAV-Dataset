In addition to providing library services to residents, the Library also serves as a resource for the 1.7 million metropolitan residents of greater Kansas City. In 2004, the Kansas City Public Library - Central moved into the former First National Bank building at 10th and Baltimore in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. The century-old building, a true masterpiece of craftsmanship with its marble columns, bronze doors and ornate mouldings, required remodeling and a fifth floor addition, but provided the framework for a modern and impressive urban library . The location features state-of-the-art technology, improved and increased services, meeting rooms, a screening room, a coffee shop and much more, all within the walls of a building originally constructed to convey a sense of strength and continuity. It is upon that foundation the Library places its vision for the next century to come. Facts About the Library The Kansas City Public Library has ten locations.The Central Library is the largest facility, housing resources, special collections and administrative offices.More than 2,348,408 materials were checked out during the last fiscal year . The Inter Library Loan department loaned out 115,846 items last year to other libraries. 2,492,118 customers used the Library system last year.The Library system counts 1,147,278 items in its holdings. Helzberg Auditorium The Library's most versatile meeting space, the Helzberg Auditorium is located on the 5th floor of the library. Helzberg is also aggressively styled with contemporary and clean lines for an energetic atmosphere, and features performance quality acoustics using cork flooring and specially designed ceiling elements, built-in AV system, and floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides that provide natural lighting. Gladys Feld Helzberg Gladys Feld Helzberg was the wife of the late Barnett C. Helzberg, Sr, of Helzberg Diamonds. Helzberg jewelry store was founded in 1915 by the late Morris Helzberg, in Kansas City, Kan., and expanded to a regional market by Barnett C. Helzberg, Sr. Gladys was an active member of the Kansas City Chapter of the Association for Women in Communications and one of the founders of Veterans' Voices. The Gladys Feld Helzberg Scholarship Fund was established in 1960 for talented journalism students and is administered by the University of Kansas endowment fund. She was also the founder of the Greater Kansas City chapter of the Brandeis Women's Committee. 10Trainee Elevator Pitch Session The Trainee Elevator Pitch Session provides trainees the opportunity to deliver an elevator pitch in a 1 -slide, 2 -minute presentation on Thursday, October 18, from 4: 15- 4:50 pm in the Wahl Hall West Auditorium (KUMC Campus). The purpose of this exercise is to develop a concise and clear explanation of your research that even your grandmother may understand. Efficiently conveying your science to the public as well as to the scientific community is an important skill that will have life-long benefits if you can do it well. The purpose of an elevator pitch is to promote yourself, your skills, or the importance of your research, with the end goal of getting oneself introduced to a targeted person, creating a possibility for future communications, building a professional collaboration, or leading to a job interview.

Scott, and Michael J. Soares. Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas. Hemochorial placentation is characterized by the development of trophoblast cells specialized to interact with uterine and fetal vascular beds. These specialized trophoblast cells arise from a trophoblast stem (TS) cell population that possesses the capacity to differentiate into multiple trophoblast cell lineages. Among the differentiated trophoblast lineages are cells that acquire an endothelial cell-like phenotype, termed \"endovascular trophoblast cells\". To investigate regulatory mechanisms that control the development of the endovascular trophoblast cell lineage, we utilized rat TS cells for RNA sequence analysis. The differentiation phenotype was characterized by transcript signatures consistent with acquisition of known differentiated trophoblast cell lineages and a striking endothelial cell-like phenotype. Among the upregulated transcripts were anti-coagulation factors, tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( Tfpi). Disruption of TFPI expression in rat TS cells interfered with development of the endovascular trophoblast cell phenotype. Furthermore, TFPI was shown to be expressed in endovascular trophoblast cells of the rat placentation site. To examine an in vivo role for trophoblast cell Tfpi, we initially utilized ex rat shRNA) followed by transfer to pseudopregnant recipient female rats. Fetal and placental weights of LV-Tfpi shRNA transduced embryos were significantly decreased at gestation days 15.5 and 18.5 compared to treatment with LV-control shRNAs. In vivo TFPI knockdown profoundly restricted the depth of intrauterine trophoblast invasion and was associated with a prominent increase in uterine spiral arteriole fibrin/fibrinogen deposition. A complementary rat model generated by Crispr/Cas9 genome editing of the Tfpi locus was used to generate a knockout rat model. The Tfpi mutation resulted in prenatal lethality. Its impact of the mutation on placentation is still under investigation. To examine conserved molecular mechanisms of TFPI action on trophoblast development, shRNA-mediated TFPI knockdowns were performed a cell culture model. LV-TFPI shRNA transduced human TS cells failed to differentiate into the extravillous trophoblast cell differentiation. Overall, these results implicate Tfpi as a potential regulator of invasive endovascular trophoblast cell development, uterine spiral artery remodeling, and hemostasis at the maternal-fetal interface.

Emilia Przygrodzka1, Pan Zhang1, Hou Xiaoying1, John S. Davis1,2, 1Olson Center for Women's Health, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Nebraska Medical Center; and 2Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Omaha, NE. The corpus luteum (CL) is an endocrine gland that produces progesterone (P4), a steroid hormone responsible for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is crucial for the formation, function and maintenance of the CL. However, the cellular responses to LH that mediate luteal steroidogenesis remain to be fully determined. In the present study, the metabolic responses to LH treatment were examined in bovine small luteal cells (SLC). The SLC were isolated from bovine CL and treated with LH (10 ng/ml) for 10, 30, 60 and 240 minutes. Cells and post-incubation media were harvested to determine metabolomics changes using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms. 20Metabolomics changes were verified by using Seahorse analysis. Metabolomics data and Seahorse results were analyzed using Welch's two-sample t-test and one-way ANOVA test, respectively. Analysis revealed 276 and 117 metabolites in cell extracts and media, respectively. The most up- and down-regulated metabolites were lipids (55.81%) and carbohydrates (38.88%) and lipids (33.33%) and amino acids (31.25%) in culture media. Concentrations of P 4 and cAMP rapidly increased (p<0.05) in cells and media post-LH treatment. The content of isocaproate, a product of CYP11A1, and lanosterol, a cholesterol precursor, were increased (p<0.05) in cells and media. Glucose and fructose were significantly decreased (p<0.05) in cells and media after LH treatment. Simultaneously , lactate was increased (p<0.05) cells and media, while pyruvate was depleted (p<0.05) in media. Since, metabolomics results suggest a stimulatory effect of LH on glycolysis pathway, Seahorse method allowing live analysis of mitochondria function was performed. LH stimulated (p<0.05) ATP production and basal oxygen consumption rate, an indicator of oxidative phosphorylation. LH also increased (p<0.05) the extracellular acidification indicate that LH stimulates glycolysis in SLC providing both appropriate ATP production and substrates for P4 synthesis.

Marsh, Kristin Holoch, Michael Lydic, Amanda Graham, Warren B. Nothnick. University of Kansas Medical Center. Objective: Although there are multiple modalities to test etiology of infertility, there are few biologic markers to predict success with assisted reproductive technology (ART). Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) is emerging as a multi-functional protein capable of regulation of tissue regeneration as well as functioning as an RNA-binding protein. Absence of CCNA2 in the germ line is associated with embryonic lethality. Although considerable tissue regeneration occurs during the early stages of the menstrual cycle, the role of CCNA2 in the endometrium is poorly understood. In this study, we examine the function of CCNA2 in the endometrium and its association with pregnancy. Design: A prospective design was utilized which involved a cohort on women, aged 18-45, seen in a university setting reproductive endocrine clinic undergoing ART to conceive. Materials and Methods: Women undergoing in vitro fertilization were subjected to a scratch biopsy, which was performed in normal sterile fashion with an endometrial pipelle on menstrual cycle day 3. Endometrium was prepared and subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) localization for cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and qRT-PCR assessment of mRNA. Primary outcome of interest was clinical pregnancy, which was defined as fetal cardiac activity seen on ultrasound from pregnancy resulting in same cycle as endometrial biopsy. Fisher's exact test was performed with p<0.05 used for determining statistical significance between the groups. CCNA2 IHC outcome values were expressed as H-SCOREs (intensity of staining X percent of cells staining at that intensity X 100%) for each cell type and data were separately analyzed using unpaired t-tests. Results: CCNA2 protein localized to stromal and glandular epithelium with stromal expression being more predominant. CCNA2 localization in both cell types was exclusively nuclear. Stromal and glandular epithelia positive nuclei were significantly greater in those women which achieved pregnancy compared to those that did not (P<0.0001; H-SCORE STROMA = 57 + 10 vs. 3 + 0.6; H-SCORE EPITHELIUM = 6 + 3 vs. 3 + 0.6). Despite significant differences in protein expression, CCNA2 mRNA expression levels were similar between groups. Based upon these data, we defined a positive Stromal H-SCORE of 25 or higher as positive outcome for CCNA2 staining. We constructed a 2 x 2 contingency table in which pregnancy outcome was defined as either positive or negative, and CCNA2 H-SCORE was defined as either positive (>25 stroma) or negative (<25 stroma). Fisher ' s exact test revealed statistical significance between groups (P = 0.0045; sensitivity 95% CI = 0.664 - 1.00; specificity 95% CI = 0.292 - 1.00). There was no association between pregnancy outcome or CCNA H-SCOREs when controlling for patient age, cause of infertility, endometrial thickness or type of hormonal stimulation. Conclusions: We interpret these data to suggest that endometrial CCNA2 expression is altered during the menstrual stage of the menstrual cycle. These alterations may impair proper development and/or responsiveness to hormonal signaling essential for preparation of a suitable endometrial environment for successful pregnancy. As such, CCNA2 expression in the menstrual endometrium may be associated with ART success. A larger study population is needed to assess the validity of these findings and increase specificity and sensitivity. 214) Effects of Developmental Exposure to Bisphenol A or Bisphenol S on Metabolism and Voluntary Physical Activity. Jiude Mao1,2, Michelle J. Farrington1,2, Rebecca J. Welly3, Victoria J. Vieira-Potter3, Cheryl S. Rosenfeld1,2,4 1Bond Life Sciences Center, 2Biomedical Sciences, 3Nutrition & Exercise Physiology, 4Thompson Center for Autism and Neurobehavioral Disorders, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211. Environmental chemicals may be contributing to the dramatic rise in obesity. As a widely prevalent endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), phenolic compounds, such as bisphenol A (BPA) have received considerable attention as a potential \"obesogen\". Extensive studies have linked developmental exposure to BPA with later obesity and metabolic disorders. More recently, the BPA substitute, BPS, has also been implicated with metabolic disease. Both bisphenols have been shown to operate primarily through estrogen (E 2) receptor (ESR1), which is highly expressed in brain, especially during fetal development. These EDCs might act as an agonists or antagonists of ESR1. In previous studies, we showed that adult female California mice ( Peromyscus californicus ) developmentally exposed to BPA exhibit suppressed voluntary physical activity (PA) and impaired fat metabolism. Only a few other studies to date have examined whether BPA and other EDCs affect PA, even though physical inactivity is a major contributor to the chronic positive energy balance that causes obesity. We hypothesize that during development, maternal BPA or BPS exposure suppresses fetal brain ESR1 signaling resulting in reduced dopamine signaling in key brain regions (especially the nucleus accumbens- NAc) needed to initiate PA. Based on recent evidence that maternal exercise has fetal programming capacity, such that offspring of exercising dams display more PA and are protected against later metabolic dysfunction, we further sought to determine if maternal exercise has the capacity to combat the harmful behavioral and metabolic effects of BPA and BPS. Using C57BL6 mice, we validated our previous finding that exposure of dams to 200 mg BPA or BPS/kg body weight two weeks prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation reduced energy expenditure and voluntary PA in offspring. Importantly, provision of running wheels to dams reversed some of the adverse EDC-induced effects on F 1 offspring. Current work suggests that developmental exposure to bisphenols suppresses later PA, potentially by altering ESR1-dopamine signaling in the NAc, but maternal exercise helps mitigate some of these detrimental offspring effects. These studies for the first time explore the possibility that encouraging mothers to exercise might help combat adverse chemical exposure risks to their unborn offspring. 5) Atypical protein kinase C iota is essential to establish maternal-fetal exchange surface during mammalian embryonic development. Bhaswati Bhattacharya and Soumen Paul. Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Reproductive Health and Perinatal Research, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Defective placentation leads to early pregnancy loss, which is a serious health concern. A major cause of defective placentation is defect in establishment of the maternal-fetalexchange surface due to impaired development of the syncytiotrophoblast (SynT) lineage. In humans and rodents, which are characterized with hemochorial placentation, SynTs are in direct contact with the maternal blood and constitute the main exchange surface. During placentation, SynTs are developed via differentiation of trophoblast stem and progenitor cells (TSPCs) of a placenta primordium and specific transcription factors are implicated in SynT development. However, signaling mechanisms that are involved in TSPC to SynT transition are incompletely understood. Here, we show that Atypical Protein Kinase C iota (PKCi), a conserved protein in mammals, is essential for differentiation of TSPCs to SynTs. Loss of PKCi in a developing mouse embryo leads to abrogation of labyrinth formation leading to embryonic death at ~E9.0. PKCi mediated priming of trophoblast progenitors to SynT development is also a conserved event during human placentation. PKCi is selectively expressed in the first-trimester cytotrophoblast progenitors in human placenta. Depletion of PKCi impairs differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells towards SynTs in vitro as well as after transplantation in immunocompromised mice. Our mechanistic analyses revealed that PKCi signaling is important to induce key transcription factors including GCM1, GATA2 and DLX3 in TSPCs within mouse human TSCs. Our study uncovers a conserved molecular mechanism, in which PKCi signaling regulates establishment of the maternal-fetal exchange surface by promoting TSPC to SynT transition. 226) Signaling of the Pro-Inflammatory Increases of Primary Follicles. Kelsey R. Timme, Heidi B. Miller, and Jennifer R. Wood. Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE. Female obesity is associated with ovarian inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduced oocyte quality . Our previous studies demonstrated that C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) had increased ovarian expression of Tnfa mRNAs, and increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NFkB p65. Several transcription factors and maternal effect genes mRNAs were increased in ovulated oocytes and/or whole ovaries depleted of antral follicles. We hypothesized that acute treatment of primary follicles with TNFa would activate NFkB signaling and alter Dppa3, Pou5f1, Nobox, Figla, and Gdf9 transcript abundance within the growing oocytes. To test this hypothesis, ovaries were collected from 12 day old pre-pubertal CD1 mice and primary follicles were isolated. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed expression of total NFkB p65 (p65) in the oocyte of primary follicles. Ten primary follicles were cultured in media containing 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml TNF for twenty minutes. Western blot analysis demonstrated a dose response effect of TNF on phosphorylation of p65 with the greatest effect seen in follicles exposed to 10 ng/ml TNF. Next, 20 primary follicles were cultured in 10 ng/ml TNFa for 0, 2, and 8 hours, and RNA isolated, reverse transcribed, and droplet digital PCR two-fold in follicles treated for 8 hours (3.97 +/- 0.35) compared to 0 hour (2.01 +/- 0.48) controls (p-value = 0.027). Conversely, there was a numerical decrease in Figla/Canx mRNA abundance between 0 (0.39 +/- and 8 (0.16 +/- 0.09) hours post-TNF treatment. These preliminary data indicate that acute treatment with TNF differentially regulates oocyte mRNAs. In future studies, follicles will be encapsulated in alginate and treated for 1-7 with 0 or 1ng/ml of TNF in order to mimic chronic inflammation.

Soares1,2,4,5,11 1Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, 2Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 3Molecular and Integrative Physiology, 4Pediatrics, and 5Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, 6Department of Informative Genetics, Environment and Genome Research Center, Tohoku University, Japan, 7Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Division of Medical Biotechnology, Langen, Germany, 7Department of Pathology, 8McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, 9Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, 10High Throughput Biology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 11Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. Trophoblast cells (TC) of the early embryo directly interact with the uterus and differentiate into specialized cell types that make up the placenta. Deficiencies in the dif ferentiation of TC are a major contributing factor to early pregnancy loss, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. One possible cause is the reduced ability of TC to respond to environmental signals such as oxygen tension or nutrient status. Our previous studies demonstrate that TC respond to hypoxia through epigenetic and transcriptional programs that are necessary for adaptation and survival of TC. Here, we utilized the rat as a model of hemochorial placenta development. We performed RNA-seq on rat placenta and observed high expression of transposable elements (TE). Furthermore, rat trophoblast stem cells (rTSC) and human (hTSC), showed differential expression patterns of TE. Consistent with TE expression, ChIP-seq of rTSC revealed a genome-wide decrease of H3K9me marks across TE during differentiation conditions. Our observations indicate that TE expression is a common feature of rat placenta development. Therefore, we predicted that hypoxia exposure might alter the TE expression profile. We exposed pregnant rats to hypoxia and performed RNA-seq on placental tissue. Analysis revealed upregulation 23of several TE. A similar phenomenon was observed in vitro in rTSC exposed to hypoxia. ChIP-seq analysis of rTSC exposed to hypoxia revealed reduction in H3K9me on TE in the rat genome. We also observed that in hTSC exposed to hypoxia, LINE-1 ORF1p binds more RNA, without a concomitant increase in protein expression. Our observations reveal that under stress conditions, a transcriptional program is activated in the placenta that has the capacity to alter the genomic and transcriptome landscape. We propose that rTSC and hTSC undergo genome-wide epigenetic alterations in low oxygen that activate transcriptional networks necessary for adaptations.

Harriet C. Fitzgerald1, Pramod Dhakal1, Linda M. Rowland1, Danny J. Schust2, Thomas E. Spencer1,2 1Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 2Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO The endometrium of both humans and mice is incredibly important in providing the site of implantation as well as facilitating the growth and development of the blastocyst. Indeed, uterine glands and their secretions are essential for pregnancy establishment, blastocyst implantation, stromal cell decidualization and conceptus survival. As such, any perturbations in uterine gland function may also contribute to infertility in women. Conventional 2D cell culture systems lack the 3D microenvironment essential for mechanical and biochemical cues for cells, and cell-cell communication. Epithelial organoids cultured in 3D provide a promising avenue to further elucidate the role of uterine glands in pregnancy establishment in humans and mice. Endometrial epithelial organoids (EEO) were grown in culture using modified protocols (Turco MY et al., Nature Cell Biology 2017; Boretto M et al., Development 2017). Epithelial cells were isolated from adult mouse uteri or biopsies of human endometrium using enzymatic dissociation, resuspended in Matrigel, placed in a 48-well dish, and continuously cultured under a defined WNT-activating stem cell media. Round epithelial organoids were established within 3 to 4 days and after 10 days were differentiated with steroid hormones. Mouse EEO were differentiated with estradiol-17 (E2; 1nM) for 2 days and progesterone (P4; 50 ng/mL) for 2 days. Human EEO were treated with estradiol-17 (E2; 10nM) for 2 days, followed with either E2 and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 1M) or E2, MPA and cAMP (1 M) for a further 6 days. Mouse EEO immunostained positive for FOXA2, ESR1, and CDH1, but not PGR, which are signatures of differentiated glands. Mouse EEO responded to E2 with upregulation of Ihh E2+MPA treatment significantly (P<0.05) upregulated in human EEO with E2+MPA+cAMP treatment. These results indicate that both the human and mouse EEO are hormone-responsive and will differentiate under specific culture conditions. These in vitro models will enable critical investigations into the impact of uterine glands on stromal cell decidualization and pregnancy establishment in humans and mice.

Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Hypothalamic expression of Kiss1 plays an essential role in the onset of puberty, gonadal development, and ovulation. Estrogens regulate the expression of Kiss1 in the hypothalamus through ESR1. Kiss1 is also expressed in the ovary, where its expression correlates with the onset of puberty and progression of the estrous cycle. We recently observed that gonadotropin-induced Kiss1 expression was absent in Esr2-null rat ovaries even though Esr1 was present. Wildtype granulosa cells abundantly expressed Kiss1 and oocytes expressed the Kiss1 receptor. We characterized ESR2-regulation of Kiss1 expression in granulosa cells by identifying granulosa cell-specific transcript variants and potential regulatory regions. The Kiss1 promoter, an upstream enhancer and a downstream enhancer, all possessed conserved EREs and showed active histone marks in gonadotropin-stimulated 24granulosa cells. The transcriptionally active Kiss1 promoter, as well as the enhancers, also revealed enrichment for ESR2 binding. Furthermore, activity of a Kiss1 promoter construct was induced following overexpression of ESR2 and was blocked upon mutation of an ERE within the promoter. Finally, PMSG and hCG administration induced phosphorylation of ESR2 FOSL2 in cells. These gonadotropin-induced changes paralleled Kiss1 expression in granulosa cells. Taken together, we conclude that gonadotropin-stimulated Kiss1 expression in granulosa cells is dependent upon both the activation of ESR2 and the upregulation of AP-1.

Recent advances suggest that ZIKV can be vertically transmitted to the fetal organs including the fetal brain via the placenta. Placental infection during the first and second trimester plays a crucial role in ZIKV transmission from maternal circulation to the fetus resulting in Congenital Zika Syndrome. Further, ZIKV infection induces placental trophoblast cell apoptosis. However, the mechanism of trophoblast apoptosis caused due to the ZIKV infection is unclear. Here we hypothesize that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress Methods: human malignant-derived trophoblast (JEG-3 and JAR) cell lines were infected with 0.1-1.0 MOI ZIKV. X-box binding protein 1 (XPB1) splicing assay and relative C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA expression was quantified using qRT-PCR as markers of ER stress after 3- 24 h of ZIKV infection. Apoptosis was assessed by characteristic nuclear DAPI and caspase 3/7 activity assay. Results: We observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of CHOP after 12-16 h of ZIKV infection in placental trophoblast cells. We also observed a dramatic increase in the spliced form of XBP1 in placental trophoblast cells infected with ZIKV after 16 h indicating ER stress. As prolonged ER stress can cause apoptosis, we observed a dramatic increase in placental trophoblast apoptosis after 48 h of ZIKV infection as evidenced by biochemical characteristic nuclear morphology and caspase 3/7 activation. In conclusion , ER stress could be the potential molecular mechanism underlying ZIKV- induced placental trophoblast apoptosis. The critical role of ER stress activation in placental trophoblast cells with ZIKV infection is now under investigation. 11) Low Total Motile Sperm in Transgender Women Seeking Hormone Therapy: A Case-Control Study. Courtney Marsh, Megan McCracken , Meredith Gray, Ajay Nangia, Judy Gay, Katherine F. Roby. University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Objective: This pilot study was undertaken to compare semen quality, hormonal status, and social factors in transgender women seeking fertility preservation with those of cis-men. Long range goals are to establish standard practice measures to ensure optimum semen quality for cryopreservation and fertility preservation in transgender women. Design: This is an IRB-approved fully consented case-control study carried out at an academic medical center. Materials and Methods: Semen parameters in transgender women (cases; n=11) at the time of fertility preservation were measured and compared to those of cis-men recently fathering a child (controls; n=16). Exclusion criteria included prior use of hormones. All participants completed a questionnaire which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 Survey (DASS-21) via a secure online portal. Follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol and testosterone and risk factors that may alter semen parameters were measured and compared. Complete semen analysis was carried out in a clinical andrology laboratory according to WHO guidelines. Hormones were analyzed by LCMSMS at Quest Diagniostics. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney or Student t-test. Results: Sperm concentration was significanctly lower in transgender women compared to controls (28.9\u00b17.8 vs 71.4\u00b120.2 million; p=0.023). In addition, total motile sperm in transgender women was significantly lower than controls (43.2\u00b114.7 vs 1 10.1\u00b122.6 25million; p<0.05). Other semen parameters were not different between groups. FSH, estradiol and testosterone concentrations were not different between groups. The DASS-21 survey indicated transgender women were more likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress (p<0.01) compared to controls. Additonal survey results indicated greater use of tucking and tight undergarments by transgender women (p<0.05), however both groups reported a similar number of ejaculations per week. Conclusions: Sperm concentration and total motile sperm in transgender women prior to hormone treatment were lower compared to cis-men that recently fathered a child. \\ Although sperm counts were low, cryopreservation of sperm prior to the initiation of hormone therapy is a viable option for fertility preservation. The etiology of the differences in semen parameters is not known, but use of tight undergarments may play a role in reducing sperm production and enhanced education related to behaviors prior to cryopreservation may improve future fertility potential. On going studies seek to further substantiate the present pilot findings and to investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to oligospermia in order to design interventions ensuring transgender women the opportunity for optimum fertility preservation.

Reproduction and Perinatal Research, Departments of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 2Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. Oxygen and nutrient demands of a developing fetus increase as gestation progresses. Thus, the vessels, or spiral arteries, that facilitate transfer of maternal blood to the conceptus must undergo extensive remodeling to ensure sufficient nutrient delivery and successful pregnancy . Although numerous cells comprise the maternal interface, the invasive trophoblast cell lineage is required for remodeling of uterine spiral arteries and placentation. Thus, our aim is to identify critical and conserved gene regulatory networks of trophoblast lineage development. Achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (ASCL2) is essential to extraembryonic development in the mouse, as ASCL2-deficient placentation sites exhibit differences in placental organization, including compromised development of the junctional zone, the site of invasive trophoblast cell progenitors. Thus, we hypothesized that ASCL2 is essential for invasive trophoblast lineage development. To test our hypothesis, extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell differentiation was examined using a human trophoblast stem cell culture model. Human trophoblast stem cells can be effectively differentiated into EVT and syncytiotrophoblast cell lineages. Differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells into EVT was characterized by morphologic transformation from round to elongated cells, upregulation of transcripts characteristic of EVT (i.e. ASCL2), and increased expression of major histocompatibility complex, class I, G (HLAG) protein. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knock down of ASCL2 impaired EVT cell differentiation, as indicated by altered cell morphology and decreased expression of EVT-specific transcripts, including HLAG and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2). In addition to the in vitro analysis, an in vivo role for ASCL2 in the regulation of trophoblast invasion is being investigated in the rat. Similar to humans, the rat possesses hemochorial placentation with deep trophoblast cell invasion and trophoblast-mediated spiral artery remodeling. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, an Ascl2 mutant rat has been generated for investigation of the role of ASCL2 in hemochorial placentation. With these in vitro and in vivo experimental tools we can begin to evaluate regulatory roles for ASCL2 in development of the invasive trophoblast lineage and trophoblast-guided uterine spiral artery remodeling. Overall, elucidating regulatory mechanisms uteroplacental vascular remodeling during pregnancy will aid preventative efforts to detect pregnancy disorders at earlier onset and, ultimately, develop effective interventions.

RNA editing of adenosines into inosines (A-to-I) by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) is a common post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism, yet it has not been systematically studied in oocytes. We performed a genome-wide RNA editing analysis in pools of transcriptionally active growing oocytes from postnatal day We identified an abundance of editing of mRNA transcripts in GV oocytes (3,207 and MII eggs (3,003 \u00b1 290), with significantly fewer levels in (733 \u00b1 49 edited transcripts/sample) (p<0.05, one-way ANOVA). This was consistent with increased ADAR1 transcripts and protein in GV oocytes and MII eggs, compared with PND12 oocytes. Compared to somatic tissues, oocytes exhibited a distinct pattern of RNA editing, with a high proportion of RNA edits occurring in coding regions. These edits resulted in nucleotide substitutions that were enriched at the third nucleotide of the codon (wobble position) and altered codon usage. Codon usage can affect mRNA stability and translation efficiency, and RNA editing of the six most frequently edited codons was associated with unstable transcripts in GV oocytes and MII eggs. ADAR1 RNA editing may affect overall mRNA stability through editing of codons. To examine the functional role of ADAR1 in mouse oocytes, we crossed ADARFL/FL mice with ZP3-Cre mice to generate oocytes deficient in ADAR1-mediated RNA editing. After priming mice with PMSG and hCG, ADARFL/FLZP3-Cre female mice were able to ovulate at normal levels, however embryos generated after timed breeding to WT C57B/6 males had delayed entry into 2-cell and 8-cell stages. In summary, we provided evidence in support of a previously unreported phenomenon of selective ADAR1 editing of the codon wobble position, and mice with deficient ADAR1-RNA editing in oocytes produce a high percentage of degenerate embryos. Editing of the wobble position has the potential to fine tune post-transcriptional gene regulation through altering codon usage, and this may be essential for early embryo development. 14) 3-hydroxy fatty acids Induce Placental Trophoblast Health Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, NE Mitochondrial beta-oxidation is one of the major energy-producing mechanisms in the human placenta, which supports growth and development of both the placenta and the fetus; therefore, dysfunctions in this pathway has severe consequences on both maternal and fetal health.

AFLP is a maternal liver injury marked by microvesicular steatosis and acute liver failure that develops in the last trimester of pregnancy. The mutation in the enzyme LCHAD results in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy fatty acids and subsequently infiltrates to the liver from the placenta through maternal circulation. In this study , we aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying 3-hydroxy (JEG-3 and JAR) were treated with various concentrations (100-200 M) of 3-hydroxy myristic acid (3-HMA) for 16hr. Cell death was assessed by characteristic nuclear morphology changes and Caspase 3/7 activity. Mitochondrial Analyzer. Results: We observed that placental trophoblast cells treated with increasing concentration of 3-HMA showed enhanced biochemical characteristic nuclear morphological changes of cell death; however , there was no caspase 3/7 activation. These results suggest that 3-HMA induces caspase-independent cell death. Further, 3-HMA-induced cell death was prevented with the inhibition of receptor interacting protein 27kinase 1 (RIPK1), using necrostatin suggesting necroptosis as a mechanism of cell death. We also observed that treatment of 3-HMA to placental trophoblast cells showed mitochondrial dysfunction altering its bioenergetics as evidenced by a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity compared to controls . In conclusion , 3-hydroxy fatty acids induce mitochondrial dysfunction and placental trophoblast necroptosis. Further studies are underway to characterize the signaling mechanism of 3-HMA-induced placental trophoblast necroptosis. 15) Weight Loss, Physical Activity, and Conception Rates in Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome vs. Other Infertility Diagnoses. Anna M. Gorczyca, Courtney A. Marsh, Joseph E. Donnelly. Center for Physical Activity and Weight Management, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center 2 Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center. The objective of this study was to compare weight loss, physical activity, and rates of conception in obese infertile women diagnosed with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) vs. women with other infertility diagnoses following completion of a weight management program. Obese infertile women, referred by a reproductive endocrinologist, completed the University of Kansas Weight Management Program (KWMP). This program included reduced energy intake, (portion controlled entrees, low calorie shakes, fruits & vegetables, & non-caloric beverages), increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) targeting 300 minwk. and healthy lifestyle strategies. Participants were asked to monitor weekly MVPA (self-report) and pedometer step counts. Height and weight were assessed weekly by trained staff in the clinic. The cumulative average of MVPA and steps over the last 3-wks. of participation were used in the analysis. Pregnancy outcomes were obtained from a review of medical records. PCOS was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used to compare differences in percent weight loss, physical activity (MVPA minwk.-1, stepswk.-1 ), and time in the KWMP between women diagnosed with PCOS vs. other infertility diagnoses. Chi-squared test was used to compare conception rates between women with PCOS vs. other infertility diagnoses. There were no differences in age or baseline BMI between women with PCOS compared to women with other infertility diagnoses. Women with a PCOS diagnosis as their cause of infertility were younger (28.3 yrs. vs. 35.2 yrs.; P = 0.01), in the KWMP program longer (26 \u00b1 5 wks. vs. 12 \u00b1 7; P = 0.01), and had higher step counts week (73,209 \u00b1 8,927 steps/wk. vs. 53,261 \u00b1 8,919; than women with other infertility diagnoses. One-hundred percent of women with PCOS conceived after participating in the KWMP compared to 50% of women with other infertility diagnoses (P= 0.28). It is important to focus future research on anovulatory women with PCOS vs. women with other infertility diagnoses as there may be a larger benefit in this population such as restoration of ovulation and spontaneous conception. 16) Differential regulation of ZsGreen1 abundance by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in a wide array of porcine tissues. Amy T. Desaulniers 1, Rebecca A. Cederberg2, Elizabeth P. Carreiro2 and Brett R. White2 1University of Central Missouri, School of Natural Sciences, 319 W.C. Morris, Warrensburg, MO 64093 2University of Nebraska- Lincoln, Department of Animal Science, 3940 Fair Street, Lincoln, NE 68583 The advent of genetically engineered pig production has revealed a wide array of opportunities to enhance both biomedical and agricultural industries. One powerful method to develop these models is transgenesis; however, selection of a suitable promoter to drive transgene expression is critical. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is the most commonly used viral promoter as it robustly drives transgene expression in a ubiquitous nature. However, recent reports suggest that the level of CMV promoter activity is tissue-dependent in the pig. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the activity of the CMV promoter in a wide range of porcine tissues. Swine harboring a CMV-ZsGreen1 transgene with a single integration site were utilized for this study . Thirty five tissue samples were collected from neonatal hemizygous (n = 3) and homozygous (n = 3) transgenic piglets and analyzed for ZsGreen1 abundance via immunoblot. ZsGreen1 was detected in all tissues examined; however , quantification revealed that ZsGreen1 protein levels were tissue-specific. Within organs of the digestive system, for example, ZsGreen1 was most abundant in the salivary gland, moderately produced in the 28esophagus and levels were lowest in the stomach ( P < 0.05). Interestingly, abundance of ZsGreen1 also differed within organ. For instance, levels were highest in the right ventricle compared with other chambers of the heart (P < 0.05). There was no effect of transgene dose as ZsGreen1 expression patterns were similar between homozygous and hemizygous piglets (P > 0.05). Ultimately, these results elucidate the tissue-specific activity of the CMV promoter in the neonatal pig. Moreover , this model can serve as a useful tool for research applications requiring reporter gene activity in mammalian organs. 17) Loss of REST in Uterine Leiomyoma leads to an Altered Progesterone Response. Ashley Cloud McWilliams1, Faezeh Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Uterine Leiomyoma (UL) are benign tumors that arise in the smooth muscle tissue of the uterus, known as the myometrium. UL is present in over 75% of women, often causing heavy bleeding, severe pain, and reproductive dysfunction. Despite their prevalence, there is no long-term pharmaceutical treatment for UL, due to the lack of understanding about the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Extensive evidence has also indicated an aberrant response to steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of UL. Importantly, REST (repressor element silencing transcription factor) is a tumor suppressor whose loss in UL leads to aberrant expression of its target genes. We found a large number of REST target genes are also targets of progesterone receptor (PGR). Our CHIPseq data shows conserved REST binding sites (RE1 sites) within 100bp of PGR binding sites (PREs). To investigate the role of REST in UL, we generated a uterus specific conditional knockout mouse model of REST. When REST is lost in our cKO mouse we see a UL phenotype and an altered response to progesterone in the uterus. This altered response to progesterone was confirmed with our RNAseq data. The phenotype consists of hyperproliferation in the uterus throughout the estrus cycle despite normal E2 and P4 levels. This is unusual as the role of progesterone is to suppress the proliferative effects of estrogen during the menstrual cycle. Taken together, our data indicates a novel link between an altered progesterone response and loss of REST in UL. 18) Microarray Analysis Predicts Differential Expression of Steroidogenesis and Steroid Metabolism Genes in Theca Cells from Cows with High Intrafollicular Androstenedione. Kerri A. Bochantin, Adam F. Summers, William E. Pohlmeier, Kevin M. Sargent, Scott G. Kurz, Sarah M. Romereim, Oluremi Daudu, Renee M. McFee, John S. Davis, Andrea S. Cupp, and Jennifer R. Wood. University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Populations of cows in the UNL physiology are classified based on androstendione concentration in follicular fluid of the dominant follicle; (>40 ng/ml) control (<20 ng/ml). cows have irregular estrous cycles and reduced calving rates. Furthermore, in theca cells from High A4 cows CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and LHCGR mRNAs are increased. The hypothesis of the current study is that theca cells from High A4 cows have a unique gene expression profile, which contributes to increased androgen synthesis. To test this hypothesis, the estrous cycles of High A4 and Control cows were synchronized with an injection of GnRH and a controlled internal drug release device (CIDR). After 7 days, the CIDR was removed, an injection of prostaglandin F2 alpha was given, and ovariectomies performed 36 hours later. Theca cells were microdissected from the dominant estrogen-active follicle and RNA extracted. High quality RNA from High A4 (n = 3) and control (n = 4) cows were labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Bovine GeneChip Gene 1.0 ST Arrays at the University of Nebraska Microarray Core facility. Following hybridization, normalized data was analyzed using the NIA Array Analysis tool. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed clustering of cows based on A4 classification. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, P < 0.05) with False Discovery Rate (FDR < 0.05) correction identified 1184 differentially expressed transcripts; 1104 transcripts were overexpressed and 80 transcripts were underexpressed in theca cells from High A4 compared to Control cows. These transcripts represented xx-annotated genes (xx upregulated and xx downregulated). Importantly, CYP17A1 was increased 6-fold in theca cells from High A4 compared to control cows. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified 2 networks of genes associated with steroid synthesis. The first network included CYP17A1, SULT1E1 (estrogen - PKC signaling). The second network suggested that beta-estradiol synthesis is associated with increased HSD17B6 (converts DHT to the estrogen 3 beta-Adiol Receptor-beta) and CYP2C9 (drug metabolizing enzyme). Functional studies will determine how signaling pathways contribute to the increase A4 phenotype in theca cells from High A4 cows. 19) Pluripotent stem cell models in the KUMC Transgenic Facility. Julia Draper , Katelin Gibson, Illya Bronshteyn, Jay L. Vivian, and Melissa Larson. Transgenic and Gene Targeting Institutional Facility, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Pluripotent stem cells are important tools for biomedical researchers to study gene function and develop models of human disease. Gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells is a critical tool for advanced manipulation of the mouse genome. Patient specific human induced pluripotent stem cells provide unique tools for capturing the genetic information of a patient into a cell line with the capacity to differentiate into virtually any cell type. The techniques employed for the generation of pluripotent stem cell models require technical expertise. The KUMC Transgenic and Gene-Targeting Institutional Facility is a core facility that supports researchers interested in both mouse and human pluripotent stem cell models. The Facility uses cutting edge methods, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and novel reagents for this work. The Facility's stem cell core performs gene targeting in stem cells, cell culture and preparation for injection for generating chimeric mice, and karyotyping. The Facility also has expertise in differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, and in reprogramming primary cells to generate new induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Our recent efforts include successful site-directed transgene integration and mutagenesis into human and mouse pluripotent stem cells using genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9. In this poster we will present recent projects supported by the TGIF using pluripotent stem cell models. 20) Disruption of ESR1 alters the expression of genes regulating hepatic carbohydrate Praveen Chakravarthi, Michael W. Wolfe, and M.A. Karim Rumi. Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. The liver helps maintain energy homeostasis by synthesizing and storing glucose and lipids. Gonadal steroids, particularly estrogens, play an important role in regulating metabolism. The liver expresses high levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) in both males and females, which mediates the hepatic response to estrogens. Loss of ESR1 causes increased weight gain and obesity in female rats, while causing males to become smaller in size. Obesity in Esr1-null females was associated with metabolic dysfunction. Although Esr1-null male rats have a reduced body weight, they also exhibited an impaired glucose tolerance and increased adiposity. We investigated whether this metabolic disorder in Esr1-null male rats was linked with the loss of transcriptional regulation by ESR1 in the liver. RNA-sequencing was performed on liver RNAs purified from wildtype and Esr1-null male rats to identify the genes regulated by ESR1. Based on an absolute fold change of 2 with a p-value 0.05, a total of 618 differentially expressed genes were identified in the Esr1-null male liver. Pathway analyses demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes included transcriptional regulators, transporters, and regulators of lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, and hormone metabolism. Many of these genes showing an altered expression are related to pathways of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the liver. Our findings indicate that ESR1 is a critical regulator of hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in both sexes despite the sexual dimorphism in weight gain. This research was supported in part by an NIH grant (HD072100) and a pilot grant from KUMC-KIDDRC. 21) Loss of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR1) in Granulosa Cells Causes Infertility. Rikki N. Nelson, Xiaoman Hong, Pavla Brachova, Lane K. Christenson. Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Acuity in post-transcriptional gene regulation contributes to the cell's ability to maintain or respond to its physiological environment by altering gene expression without transcriptional reprogramming. RNA sequencing has highlighted the abundance of non-encoded polymorphisms in RNA and the potential for RNA editing to contribute to post-transcriptional regulation. Both coding and noncoding regions of 30mRNA can be edited resulting in altered codons, altered splice sites, changes in transcript stability, and changes in translation efficiency. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) catalyze adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing, and comprise one family of RNA editing enzymes. There are two catalytically active adenosine catalytic activity. The periovulatory period provides a landscape for evaluating the role of post-transcriptional regulation as the somatic cells are undergoing differentiation and integrating signals from the maturing oocyte. Analysis of published granulosa cell RNA-seq datasets indicates that Adar is the highest expressed adenosine deaminase (10.66\u00b10.02 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) compared to Adarb1 (2.11\u00b10.17) and Adarb2 (0.05\u00b10.02). An organism-wide Adar deletion is lethal in mice, so a granulosa cell specific Adar depleted model was created to examine the role of ADAR1 in ovarian function. ADARFL/FL/Aromatase-Cre (n=5) and wild-type control littermate (n=6) female mice were bred to wild-type males for fertility evaluation over a 7-month period. To assess follicular development and ovulation, ADAR FL/FL/Arom-Cre (n=8) and control were administered PMSG, 5IU of hCG 46 hours after PMSG, and eggs were collected from oviducts 16 hours following hCG. In the mating trial, control females had 8.0\u00b10.4 pups/litter while ADAR FL/FL/Arom-Cre females were infertile. Hormonal stimulation resulted in the recovery of 3.0\u00b12.0 eggs in the ADARFL/FL/Arom-Cre females, while control mice had 38.5\u00b14.2 ovulated eggs. Ovarian histology following PMSG+hCG stimulation revealed that antral follicles developed, but lacked evidence of luteinization. Ongoing studies are evaluating the temporal expression of Adar in granulosa cells and assessing the effect of Adar deletion on expression of genes regarding follicular development, ovulation, and luteinization. This provides the foundation for identifying the mechanism by which Adar impacts ovarian function. 22) Testosterone supplementation in women with diminished ovarian reserve. Erin Ahart, Courtney Marsh, Matthew Goering. The University of Kansas Medical Center. Introduction: Women with DOR have extremely low pregnancy rates after IVF cycles, and there are currently few treatment options available. Testosterone supplementation may improve ovarian response to stimulation via enhanced folliculogenesis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 83 IVF cycles based on inclusion criteria of age < 42 and diagnosis of DOR (basal FSH > 10, AMH < 1, antral follicle count < 6, or history of poor response [< 4 follicles]). Cycles in the control group were carried out using the standard IVF protocol while cycles in the treatment group involved the addition of transdermal testosterone prior to ovarian stimulation. Four primary outcomes were evaluated: total number of oocytes retrieved, number of mature oocytes retrieved, number of embryos generated, and pregnancy potential of the embryos. Results: Pretreatment with transdermal testosterone had no impact on the total number of eggs retrieved after ovarian stimulation. Testosterone had a negative impact of the number of mature oocytes retrieved, but had no impact on the number of embryos generated from those oocytes. Pregnancy rates between the treatment and control groups were no different per embryo transfer, but were lower per cycle initiation with testosterone therapy. Conclusions : Within this study population, retrospective analysis of testosterone therapy revealed no improvement in IVF outcomes. A randomized controlled trial is recommended to further investigate this association. 23) Prefoldin-5 is a novel regulator of c-Myc expression in endometriotic epithelial cells whose expression correlates with that of RPLP1 and cell proliferation. Zahraa Alali, Fatimah Aljubran, Amanda Graham, Warren B. Nothnick. Molecular and Integrative Physiology, Center for Reproductive Sciences, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA Endometriosis is a common disease in women of reproductive age in which endometrial tissue establishes and survives in ectopic locations, yet its pathogenesis is poorly understood. MYC regulates numerous targets associated with endometriotic cell survival including RPLP1. Recently, we discovered an increase in endometriotic tissue and epithelial cell expression of pre-foldin-5 (PFDN5) which correlates with cellular proliferation. PFDN5 is a tumor suppressor, which inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC, thus blocking its action. If PFDN5 functions in a similar manner in endometriotic tissue and cells is unknown. The objective of this study was to examine if endometriotic 31epithelial cell expression of PFDN5 regulates MYC expression and in turn cell proliferation. To test our hypothesis, endometriotic epithelial (12Z) cells were transfected with harvested at 24 and 48h post-transfection and mRNA and protein expression were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. PFDN5 knockdown was associated with increased RPLP1 (2.1-fold increase) and MYC expression (1.7-fold increase) at 24h, which returned to near baseline levels by 48h. Alterations to cellular proliferation were further confirmed by assessing cyclin E (CCNE) expression in 12Z cells. PFDN5 knockdown was associated with increased CCNE1 transcript (2.7-fold increase compared to control-transfected cells). In conclusion, PFDN5 is expressed in endometriotic epithelial cells and its expression is correlated with cell proliferation. We conclude that this regulatory pathway involves PFDN5 regulation of MYC which modulates expression of known MYC targets such as RPLP1 and CCNE1 and in turn cell proliferation. Enhancing our understanding on the role of PFDN5 in the pathophysiology of endometriosis may lead to novel approaches to curtail endometriotic lesion survival and development of novel therapeutic approaches for treating this debilitating disease. 24) Antenatal exposure to maternal hypertensive disorders may affect postnatal growth extremely-low-birth-weight Vishal Pandey. Department of Pediatrics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Postnatal growth failure (PGF) is common in extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants, particularly those who are born small-for-gestational-age (birth weight z-score < -1.28). It is not known whether the adverse intrauterine environment alters postnatal growth trajectory in appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) ELBW infants. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate whether antenatal exposure to maternal hypertensive disorders (mHTN) affects postnatal weight z-score trajectory. We identified AGA ELBW infants without necrotizing enterocolitis or intestinal perforation. Body weight data at six timepoints (T 1: birth, T2: lowest weight on the growth chart, T3: full enteral nutrition establishment, T4: 36 weeks' corrected gestational age, T5: around the original due date, and T6: 1-2 month corrected age) were collected from medical charts and were converted into z-scores using 2013 gender-specific Fenton growth charts. We then analyzed age- and gender-corrected weight z-scores using mixed-effects ANOVA models. We found that weight z-scores varied across time, and were significantly associated with mHTN status, but not with gender. Using Akaike Information Criteria, an mHTN-status-by-time interaction model was selected, suggesting an influence of mHTN on weight z-score trajectory. Specifically, weight z-scores at T 1 were significantly higher and decreased more rapidly from T1 to T3 in the non-mHTN group than in the mHTN group, reaching non-significance between the two groups at T3. Interestingly, weight z-scores remained stable from T3 onwards in the non-mHTN group but continued to decrease further until T4 in the mHTN group, resulting in significantly lower z-scores at subsequent timepoints in the latter group. Comparing the two groups, there were no significant differences in average intake of protein and calories during the first week of life, in the rate of culture-positive sepsis, and in post-menstrual days at hospital discharge. Notably, infants in the non-mHTN group were born at significantly lower gestational age and took longer to establish full enteral nutrition, had more days of antibiotics administration during NICU hospitalization, and were more likely to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia than infants in the mHTN group. Taken together, our data suggest a role of mHTN exposure in determining postnatal weight trajectory and an overall impact of fetal (re)programming on postnatal growth. 25) Effects of Uterine Luminal Secretions on Conceptus Growth in Sheep. Eleanore V. O'Neil , Gregory W. Burns, Kelsey E. Brooks and Thomas E. Spencer. Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri-Columbia In sheep, the blastocyst develops into an ovoid conceptus and elongates into a filamentous conceptus During elongation, the trophectoderm produces interferon-tau (IFNT) to signal pregnancy recognition and modulate uterine receptivity. In vitro studies with embryos and in vivo studies with the uterine gland knockout (UGKO) ewe model support the idea that uterine secretions are essential for 32blastocyst/conceptus survival and elongation. Study One determined ef fects of uterine luminal fluid (ULF) on blastocyst growth. The uterine lumen of wildtype (WT) day 14 cyclic (C) and pregnant (P) ewes was flushed with PBS and the ULF was clarified by centrifugation. Osmotic pumps were secured to the uterine horn of day 8 bred WT ewes, and the catheter inserted into the uterine lumen. Osmotic pumps contained: (1) C ULF; (2) IFNT collected on day 12. Conceptuses from uteri infused with P ULF were longer (3.5 mm+0.5 mm) (P<0.05) than those infused with C ULF (1.5+0.5 mm) or IFNT (1.9+0.5 mm). Study Two determined if C ULF repletion could rescue conceptus growth in UGKO ewes. ULF was obtained from day 14 C WT ewes as in Study One. UGKO ewes were bred and implanted with an osmotic pump on day 10 with PBS (n=3) or C ULF (n=5). All ewes were collected on day 14, including bred WT ewes (n=5). A conceptus was recovered from two PBS-infused UGKO ewes (1 and 21 cm in length) and three C ULF-infused UGKO ewes (1.3, 3.1, and 4.1 cm) (WT ewe conceptuses range from 6.2-25.0 cm). Western blot analysis determined that IFNT was greater (P<0.01) in the ULF of WT than UGKO ewes. Collectively, these results support the ideas that: (1) adoptive transfer of ULF is not detrimental to conceptus survival; (2) factors other than IFNT in the ULF of day 14 P ewes stimulate blastocyst growth; and (3) infusion of ULF from WT ewes into UGKO ewes does not affect conceptus growth. This project was supported by grant 2016-67015-24741 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. 26) Embryonic Hematopoiesis and Angiogenesis: Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS USA. 2 Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. The mid-gestation mouse placenta acts as one of the major organs for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) generation where placental labyrinth vasculature acts as a site for HSC expansion and provides a temporary niche for definitive HSC pool. However, the signaling mechanisms that regulate the hematopoietic and angiogenic development in the placenta are poorly understood. Different studies have implicated the role of GATA family of transcription factors in the development of HSCs in other organs. Recently we demonstrated that simultaneous knockout of both Gata2 and Gata3 in trophoblast lineage severely affected placental development and leads to very early embryonic lethality. Interestingly, the double knockout also resulted in severe loss of hematopoietic population in both the embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Moreover, our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses in mouse trophoblast cells showed that several pathways associated with the hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis were targets for both GATA transcription factors. In this study, we aim to define how GATA-dependent paracrine signaling from the parietal trophoblast giant cell (TGC) layer dictate hematopoiesis as well as angiogenesis in the mouse placenta. Our study revealed that the TGC-specific dual knockout of Gata2 and Gata3 resulted in the loss of placental and embryonic hematopoiesis accompanied by angiogenic defects in the placenta. The conditional double knock-out also led to intrauterine growth retardation of the embryos. Based on these findings we propose that the combinatorial role of GATA2 and GATA3 plays a critical part in the placental hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. 27) Altered Blood Plasma and Follicular Fluid Lipid Profiles Predict Alterations in Cell Signaling, Metabolism, and Immune Function in Cows with Androgen Excess. Alexandria P. Snider 1, Renata Spuri Gomes1, Sarah M. Romereim1, Adam F. Mohamed Abedal-Majed3, Sarah C. Tenley1, Scott G. Kurz1, Jeff Bergman1, Robert A. Cushman4, John S. Davis5, Jennifer R. Wood1, Andrea S. Cupp1 1University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Mexico State New Mexico; 3University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan; 4USDA-ARS U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska; 5University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska. 33UNL physiology herd has cows with excess androstenedione (A4; High A4 > 40 ng/ml; control < 20 ng/ml) in follicular fluid of dominant follicles, reduced Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, and arrested follicular development leading to anovulation and reduced fertility. Our hypothesis was that altered lipid profiles in High A4 cows would identify metabolic and signal transduction processes contributing to altered follicular development resulting in anovulation. Blood plasma samples were collected at day 7 and 15 of a non-stimulated cycle and at ovariectomy after FSH stimulation (20ng/ml/12 hours). Lipid compounds (863) were identified in the follicular fluid and plasma samples via HPLC mass spectrometry with 115 lipid compounds actually annotated. The top 4 lipid compounds per sample were chosen in High A4 compared to control cows using the Random Forest Algorithm for each sample. At day 7 of the non-stimulated cycle lysophosphatidylethanolamine 22:4 (LysoPE(22:4)), which induces the MAPK signal transduction pathway, and C760 was significantly reduced in blood plasma in High A4 cows (P<0.05). On day 15 of the non-stimulated cycle, blood plasma had greater concentrations The LPCs, interact with G protein-coupled receptors, and are involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism suggestive of increased metabolic rate in High A4 cows. The follicular fluid collected at ovariectomy in the FSH-stimulated cycle was dif ferent lipids, being in High A4 cows (P<0.05). Plg-SOPC, is produced in response to oxidative stress. Sphingomyelin helps form lipid rafts regulating signal transduction. Taken together, these data indicate that altered lipids in the blood plasma of High A4 cows may increase MAPK and G-protein receptor signaling to increase metabolic rate. Lipids in follicular fluid of High A4 cows increase oxidative stress and inhibit G-protein receptor signaling compared to controls. Thus, variations in lipid profiles of High A4 and control cows suggest potential differences in metabolic, immune and cell signaling in the High A4 cows which may contribute to their follicular arrest, anovulation and infertility.

Katelin Gibson , Illya Bronshteyn, Julia Draper, Melissa A. Larson, and Jay L. Vivian. Transgenic and Gene Targeting Institutional Facility. University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Genetic manipulation of the mouse has become a standard and indispensable tool for investigating gene function in vivo and for the development of animal models of human disease. Although the use of genetically modified mice is widespread in the biomedical research community , including KUMC, the techniques employed for the generation of these models require specialized equipment and technical expertise. The KUMC Transgenic and Gene Targeting Institutional Facility is an institutional support facility providing a centralized service for the production of transgenic and gene-targeted mice, and the related services of sperm and embryo cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, and rederivation. By centralizing operations into the Transgenic and Gene-Targeting Facility, the gene-modified mouse is available as a research tool to all investigators of research universities in Kansas and the surrounding Kansas City research community. The Facility uses cutting edge methods, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and novel reagents for this work. Our services include microinjection services via pronuclear injection and blastocyst injection of embryonic stem cells. The Facility is also closely involved in the development of new transgenic technologies to enhance the rapid development of novel models. We have have place significant effort in developing and optimizing methods for using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in vivo. Our efforts have developed a pipeline for the design, synthesis, and validation of CRISPR genome editing reagents, and their successful use in generating novel genetically modified mouse models. W e will present elements of this experimental design platform in this poster, and include examples of the various genetically altered strains that have recently been developed. The TGIF is supported by institutional and NIH programmatic support, including the KUMC School of Medicine, the COBRE Program Project in Molecular Regulation of Cell Development and Differentiation (NIH P30 GM122731), the University of Kansas Cancer Center (NIH P30 CA168524), and the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (NIH U54 HD090216). 3429) A growth factor that influences placental health in mice. Ikram Mohamed. The University of Missouri - Columbia. The placenta is the organ responsible for the exchange of nutrients from the mother to the fetus to support growth. The placenta consists of the junctional zone that transports maternal blood to the labyrinth zone in which exchange of nutrients and oxygen occur between blood spaces. Previously, we have shown that a maternal factor called myostatin changes fetal growth without actually contacting the fetus, suggesting that removing this factor alters the development of the placenta to make it more efficient at supporting fetal growth. My goal is to determine whether this inhibition af fects the development of the placenta to make it more efficient. Placentas were collected from two mice treated with an inhibiting antibody to block myostatin in the maternal blood, and two mice treated with a control antibody, from days 2.5-17.5 of pregnancy. I photographed and measured the cross-sectional areas of the junctional and labyrinth zones by using a tiling microscope and ImageJ software. In pregnant mice treated with the inhibiting antibody, there was a larger variance in the areas of the junctional and labyrinth zones than in the controls. There was no significant difference in junctional and labyrinth zone areas based on the antibody treatment. There was some evidence of increased labyrinth zone area in the inhibiting antibody-treated mice compared to controls, but it was not statistically significant. The ratio of the junctional to the labyrinth zone was not affected by the antibody treatment. In the future, we plan to measure maternal and fetal blood spaces in the labyrinth zone. We hope to use this approach to insure the placenta is efficient, to allow both mother and child to have the healthiest pregnancy possible. 30) The role of interferon gamma signaling on hemochorial 1Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, Departments of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 2Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. During early pregnancy, natural killer (NK) cells accumulate within the decidua where they comprise approximately 70% of all leukocytes in the uterus. We have previously reported that NK cell deficiency resulted in profound effects on hemochorial placentation, including morphogenesis of the placenta, accelerated trophoblast invasion, and enhanced trophoblast cell-guided uterine spiral artery remodeling. However, the underlying mechanism of the effects of NK cells is poorly understood. Among the extracellular signals produced by NK cells, interferon gamma (IFNG) is reported to affect invasive trophoblast cell behavior and uterine spiral artery remodeling. To explore the role of IFNG signaling on hemochorial placentation, we generated and characterized Ifng and IFNG receptor 1 (Ifngr1) mutant rat models using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Founders with each of the mutations were backcrossed to wild type rats and the genotypes of offspring were analyzed. Ifng and Ifngr1 mutations were successfully transmitted through the germline. To validate the Ifng mutant rat model, we used an IFNG- specific ELISA to measure IFNG protein in medium conditioned by splenocytes cultured with vehicle or concanavalin A (ConA, 5 \u00b5g/ml for 72 h). Supernatants from the splenocytes from wild type rats showed robust accumulation of IFNG \u00b1 7,717.51 pg/ml), whereas ConA treated produce detectable IFNG (<15.6 pg/ml). Hemochorial placentation was assessed in null conceptuses. Both Prl7b1 ) indices of invasive trophoblast demonstrated evidence for accelerated intrauterine trophoblast invasion in the Ifng and Ifngr1 mutants. In summary, these findings suggest that IFNG signaling may contribute to at least some of the restraining ef fects of NK cells on intrauterine trophoblast invasion. Additional experimentation is underway to further characterize a role for IFNG in hemochorial placentation.

Genetically un-related heifers at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center also secreted greater A4 into media from ovarian cortex cultures; suggesting, the High A4 phenotype is present in other herds. We hypothesized that ovarian folliculogenesis is disrupted in High A4 cows due to excess A4 synthesis by the ovarian microenvironment; and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) isoform treatment would rescue folliculogenesis by decreasing A4 production. Ovarian cortical pieces were collected at ovariectomy from High A4 (n = 5) and Control (n = 5) cows and treated with PBS or VEGFA165 (50 ng/ml) for 7 days. Media was collected daily for steroid analysis. Ovarian cortex from High A4 cows treated with PBS secreted greater ( P = 0.004) concentrations of A4 and other steroid hormones compared to controls. Treatment with VEGFA165 dramatically ( P = 0.004) reduced A4 and other steroid hormones secreted by the ovarian cortex of High A4 cows. Numbers of primordial follicles were greater ( P 0.01) with fewer primary, secondary and antral follicles in uncultured High A4 ovarian cortex compared to Control. Treatment with VEGFA165 stimulated greater ( P 0.02) follicular progression to secondary and antral stages in ovarian cortex from Control cows than High A4 cows. Ovarian cortex treated with PBS from High A4 cows had increased staining for markers of oxidative stress and fibrosis. T reatment with VEGFA165 reduced staining for oxidative stress and tended ( P = 0.056) to reduce staining for fibrosis in High A4 ovarian cortex compared to controls. Taken together, ovarian cortex from High A4 cows secrete greater concentrations of steroid hormones, which may contribute to increased oxidative stress and fibrosis, leading to follicular arrest. VEGFA165 isoform treatment can rescue folliculogenesis and reduce ovarian cortex steroid secretion. Thus, VEGFA165 may be a potential therapeutic to restore the ovarian microenvironment and enhance follicular maturation. This research was funded through USDA grant 2013-67015-20965.

Emily Pfeifer, Elizabeth Kresie, MD and Courtney Marsh. University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO Background: Due to advances in childhood cancer therapy, there is an expanding population of survivors with fertility issues secondary to cancer therapy. Literature has shown an adult cancer population feels fertility is a major quality of life issue and several patient barriers may be responsible for the underutilization of fertility preservation (FP). Purpose: There are identifiable barriers to the utilization of fertility preservation in adolescents exposed to fertility threatening therapy. If these barriers are addressed, providers can effectively communicate to patients that they have fertility preservation options post-therapy and more patients may feel comfortable using fertility preservation. Methods: This study involves a questionnaire survey distributed to patients (or their caregivers) between 0-29 years of age who have received a formal diagnosis and/or treatment which threatens fertility, including patients currently undergoing treatment and survivors. A total of 50 study subjects will be enrolled without power calculation since this is a survey. Part 1 of the questionnaire survey is a demographic form, which seeks to identify formal cancer diagnosis, time-to-treatment, and insurance status at the time of diagnosis. Part 2 of the questionnaire survey aims to identify patient/caregiver awareness, attitudes, and perceptions of fertility preservation. Results: Preliminary results obtained from a small sample size (N=9) revealed participants were a mean age of 8 years-old at diagnosis. All were insured and began treatment for their malignancy a month following diagnosis. Only 2 patients (22%) were very 36or extremely aware of medications and procedures to preserve fertility, while only 1 (11%) disagreed that preserving a child's/teenager's fertility is important. Three patients (33%) were significantly concerned that FP may delay cancer treatment. Conclusions: Identifying the barriers to fertility preservation will allow providers to directly address these issues during patient counseling. If these barriers are addressed, more patients may feel comfortable using fertility preservation. 33) Normalizing the immune system of the rat for analysis of immune cell function at the maternal-fetal interface. Regan L. Scott 1 and Michael J. Soares1,2 1Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, Departments of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 2Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. Rodent model systems are frequently used to study a wide variety of human diseases. Their genomes are extensively mapped, and the ability to quickly generate genetically manipulated models allows an in-depth examination of disease physiology otherwise inaccessible in the human. Specifically , rats are a suitable model to study pregnancy disorders because they possess a hemochorial placenta with deep trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling. We know that immune cells play an essential role in placental development, and disruption of immune cell interactions within the uterus can compromise the establishment of pregnancy. However, recent studies have shed light on the limitations of experiments performed in specific pathogen free (SPF) laboratory rodents because these animals exhibit limited immune system development that does not resemble the complexity of the adult human immune system. Accurate recapitulation of a complex immune system in an animal model is critical for drawing biologically relevant conclusions of the role of immune cells in pregnancy. To address this limitation, we have developed a co-housing strategy to generate laboratory rats with mature immune systems. Laboratory rats are co-housed with rats previously maintained in an environment of robust pathogen exposure (\"dirty rats\"). The rats are maintained in Biological Level 3 Safety facility. One month of co-housing SPF laboratory rats with \"dirty rats\" resulted in the introduction of several new pathogens to our laboratory colony. Pathogen transmission from \"dirty rats\" to SPF rats was validated through PCR of rodent infectious agent panels. Spleen weights and transcript profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from our co-housed laboratory rats showed significant adaptations in their immune systems. Specifically, spleen weights increased and PBMCs exhibited up-regulation of transcripts associated with several pathways including the innate immune response, interferon signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, allograft rejection, cytokine signaling, antigen presentation, prolactin signaling, and toll like receptor signaling. Overall, these data suggest that the co-housed SPF rodent immune systems have adapted as a result of pathogen exposure. We hypothesize that this immune adapted rat model will provide a more accurate representation of the complex interplay of immune cells at the maternal fetal interface.

Pei-Shan Wang, Chu-Yen Chen, Fu-Sheng Chou. Department of Pediatrics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS.Placental insufficiency is a common cause of chronic fetal hypoxia and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Individuals with growth restriction prenatally are at significantly increased risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Clinical imaging showed decreased total brain and cortical grey matter volume in FGR infants, suggesting altered cerebral cortex development. Fetal cortical neurogenesis is a time-sensitive process in which fetal neural stem cells (NSCs) follow a distinct pattern of layer-specific neuron generation to populate the cerebral cortex as the gestation progresses. It has been shown in an in vitro system that profound hypoxia induces cell cycle arrest in NSCs. However, the in vivo effect of hypoxia in fetal NSCs remains unclear. We hypothesize that chronic fetal hypoxia disrupts temporal development of cerebral cortices by affecting NSC cell cycle progression and neurogenic cell division. We aimed to test the hypothesis by using a murine maternal hypoxia-induced placental insufficiency model. In this model, timed-pregnant mice were exposed to hypoxia during the active stage of fetal neurogenesis, followed by fetal brain harvest for cryosectioning and immunostaining. In the hypoxia-exposed fetal brains, we found a significant reduction in cerebral cortical thickness accompanied by 37decreases in intermediate progenitors and in layer-specific neurons. These findings suggest delayed neurogenesis. Interestingly, we also observed a defect in self-renewal in a subset of NSCs, leading to premature neuronal differentiation. Following relief from maternal hypoxia exposure, the remaining fetal NSCs re-established their neurogenic ability and resumed production of layer-specific neurons. Surprisingly, the newly generated neurons matched their control counterparts in layer-specific marker expression, suggesting preservation of the fetal NSC temporal identity despite hypoxia exposure. As expected, the number of neurons generated in the FGR group remained lower compared to that in the control group. Finally, the FGR offspring mice exhibited poorer cognitive functions by Y-maze and pre-pulse inhibition tests than the control offspring mice. Taken together, fetal hypoxia exposure is associated with a defect in neurogenesis, and has a long-term impact on offspring cognitive development. Our findings also pointed to a possible scenario where the temporal identity of the fetal NSCs is uncoupled from the process of neurogenesis. 35) Attainment and Maintenance of Pubertal Cyclicity May Predict High A4 cows with Reduced Fertility. Sarah Nafziger1, Mohamed A. Abedal-Majed1, Tenley1, Robert Cushman3, Andrea S. Cupp1 1 Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska 2 Department of Animal Science, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico 3 USDA, ARS, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska 68933 The UNL physiology herd has a population of cows that secrete excess androstenedione (A4; High A4) in follicular fluid and ovarian cortex, have irregular cycles, and often are anovulatory with reduced calving rates. High A4 cows reached puberty 45 days earlier than control cows ( P=0.17). To determine if manner of pubertal attainment predicted the High A4 phenotype, blood plasma samples were collected from weaning to breeding (October-May) each year from 2012-2017 (n=61 1). Progesterone (P4) greater than 1ng/ml was used to define puberty date with continued cyclicity . A custom SAS analysis was developed, and four distinct puberty groups were detected using puberty date as time of first P41ng/ml and continued cyclicity prior to breeding: 1) Early- 317.0\u00b13.6 days of age (DOA) with continued (n=143); 378.4\u00b12.1 DOA with 4) Non-Cycling- no P41ng/ml (n=98). There were no differences in birth weight, but Early and Typical heifers had greater average weaning weights and yearling weights compared to Start-Stop and Non-Cycling heifers ( P<0.0001). There were no differences prebreeding antral follicle counts between groups. Early puberty heifers had the highest average prebreeding reproductive tract scores, followed by Typical, Start-Stop, and Non-Cycling heifers (P<0.0001). At breeding, heifers were give 2 injections of prostaglandin F2 14-days apart, and all heifers that showed estrus were artificially inseminated. Typical (78.9%) and Early (79.5%) puberty heifers displayed the greatest percentage estrus in response to prostaglandin ( P<0.001), and a greater percentage of Start-Stop heifers (50.3%) (12.6%) ( P<0.001). All heifers were exposed to bulls, and overall pregnancy rate did not differ between groups. However, a greater percentage of Typical (57.9%), Early (51.0%), and Start-Stop (45.2%) heifers calved in the first 21 compared to Non-Cycling (20.9%) from a subset of heifers in each puberty group was cultured, and both Start-Stop and Non-Cycling heifers secreted 47-fold greater A4 in than Typical or Early heifers ( P=0.001). The greater concentrations of A4 produced by ovarian cortex of Start-Stop and Non-Cycling heifers along with irregular or no cyclicity prior to breeding indicates that these females may become High A4 cows.

Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas; Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. 38Interleukin 17F (IL17F) is the newest member of the IL17 family of cytokines. It shares significant homology with IL17A. IL17F is expressed as a homodimer, or as a heterodimer along IL17A. IL17 receptors A and C possess affinity for IL17F and transduce cellular signals upon engagement with IL17F. Preliminary data and genome-wide transcriptome analyses indicate that the placenta and more specifically trophoblast cells are a source of IL17F. Il17f transcripts are readily detected in the developing rat placenta. Most interestingly, IL17 signaling has been directly implicated in maternal immune activation. However, a role for IL17F in the biology of pregnancy is unknown. This study describes the generation of an Il17f mutant rat strain using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing with the goals of investigating potential roles for IL17F in the modulation of pregnancy, placentation, and/or fetal development. Guide RNAs were designed to target two exons within the Il17f locus of functional significance (Exons 3 and 4). Cas9 proteins along with Il17f targeted guide RNAs were electroporated into rat zygotes and transplanted into the oviducts of appropriately-timed pseudopregnant female rats. Out-of-frame mutations in the offspring of the recipient mothers were confirmed via PCR screening and DNA sequencing. These founder Il17f mutant rats were mated with wild-type rats in order to confirm germline transmission and to generate heterozygous pups. Il17f heterozygous males were mated with female heterozygous litter mates in order to generate Il17f null pups. Il17f null offspring are viable and present with normal physical features. This Il17f mutant rat model will be used to investigate putative roles for IL17F in the regulation of normal pregnancies and pregnancies challenged by maternal immune activation.

K Iqbal1, Stephen Pierce1, Pramod Dhakal1 and M J Soares1,2 1Institute for Reproductive Health and Perinatal Research, Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Anatomy and Cell Biology, and Pediatrics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas; 2Fetal Health Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of catecholamines and other molecules possessing a catechol structure, such as estrogens. COMT modifies 2-hydroxyestradiol to 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), a compound with biological functions implicated in regulatory processes associated with angiogenesis, HIF activity, trophoblast, and preeclampsia. Comt knockout mice show pregnancy complications and pregnant mice exhibit a preeclampsia-like phenotype resulting from an absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME). Additionally, COMT pregnant knockout mice show failures in adaptations to hypoxia however no effects on placental and fetal growth was observed. The purpose of this study was to utilize a rat genetic model of COMT deficiency to investigate the involvement of COMT in placentation and pregnancy outcome. To accomplish this task, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of the COMT gene. We designed gRNAs targeting the exons coding for S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAM-MTase) forming the active site of COMT enzyme. Following genotypic characterization of offspring, we identified a founder containing a 374 bp exonic deletion where most part of the SAM-MTase protein coding exon was deleted. The deletion resulted in a frameshift and premature stop codon as well. The mutation was transmitted to progeny, and caused a loss of the COMT protein as determined by Western blot. Similar to COMT null mice, COMT null male and female rats were viable and fertile. COMT deficiency did not significantly impact pregnancy outcomes, including litter size, sex ratio and mendelian ratio. There were no significant difference in fetal and placental weights at gestation day 18.5. There was no effect of exposure to prenatal hypoxia (10.5% \u00b1 0.3% O2) from gestation day 6.5 to 18.5 on placental and fetal weight. All together, our data indicate that COMT gene activity is not essential for early development or pregnancy outcome.

Pig conceptuses produce and secrete estrogens (E2), interleukin 1 beta 2 (IL1B2), and prostaglandins (PG) during the period of rapid trophoblast elongation and establishment of pregnancy. Previous studies established that IL1B2 is essential for rapid conceptus elongation (Whyte et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci whereas E2 is not essential for conceptus elongation or early maintenance the corpora lutea (CL). Prostaglandin synthase 2 ( PTGS2) expression increases during early pig conceptus development along with production of prostaglandins (PGs). Blastocysts express PTGS2 but not PTGS1 during early development. To evaluate the role of conceptus PTGS2-derived PGs in early pregnancy, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to create a deletion in exon 1 of the PTGS2 gene. Both PTGS2+/+ and PTGS2-/- embryos were generated using edited fibroblast cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Culture media from PTGS2+/+ and PTGS2-/- blastocysts was collected at day 7. Total PG was substantially lower ( P = 0.0062) in the culture media of PTGS2-/- compared to PTGS2+/+ blastocysts. Next, PTGS2+/+ and PTGS2-/- blastocysts were transferred into the uterus of surrogate gilts, and the reproductive tract was collected on either day 14 or 17 of pregnancy. Elongating and filamentous type conceptuses were recovered from the uterine lumen by flushing. The conceptuses were cultured for 3 hours to determine overall PG production. Total PG was lower (P = 0.0166) in media of PTGS2-/- conceptuses compared to PTGS2+/+ conceptuses. However, total content of PGE2 and PGF2 in the flushings of the uterine lumen containing either PTGS2-/- or PTGS2+/+ conceptuses were not different (P>0.10). Next, PTGS2-/- blastocysts were transferred into surrogate gilts to assess pregnancy establishment beyond 17 days. The uterus from surrogate gilts was harvested on day 34. Pregnancy was maintained and numerous viable PTGS2-/- embryos were present in the uterine horns of the surrogate gilts. These findings indicate that PTGS2-derived PGs from the elongating conceptus are not essential in pregnancy establishment in the pig.

Plewes1,Heather Talbott1, Xiaoying Hou1, Pan Zhang1, and John S. Davis1,2 1Olson Center for Women's Health/Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 989450 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-9450, USA 2Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 4101 Woolworth Ave, Omaha, NE 68105, USA The corpus luteum (CL) is an endocrine protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in luteal cells, stimulating progesterone biosynthesis. In the ruminates, prostaglandin (PG) F2 acts on the CL, initiating downstream signaling events leading to regression of the gland. Mitochondria maintain a highly regulated equilibrium between fusion/fission, to sustain biological function. Dynamin-like-1(DNM1L), is a key mediator of mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation events at two different sites activity , promoting mitochondrial stability and elongation. The mechanism by which DNM1L is regulated in the ovary is largely unknown. We hypothesize that LH and PGF2 differentially regulate the phosphorylation of DNM1L(Ser616 or Ser637) in bovine luteal cells. Bovine ovaries were obtained from a local abattoir, CL were dispersed, and small (SLC) and large (LLC) luteal cells were enriched via centrifugal elutriation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the CL expresses transcripts for dynamin-family members, including DNM1L. In SLC, LH stimulated phosphorylation of 616) in SLC. Overexpression of a effects of LH on DNM1L phosphorylation. Additionally, LH decreased the association of DNM1L with the mitochondria. Studies using small molecule inhibitors and siRNA knockdown of DNM1L showed that DNM1L is required progesterone biosynthesis. In contrast, PGF2 increased phosphorylation of DNM1L(Ser616), but had no effect on phospho-DNM1L(Ser637) in LLC. Moreover, PGF2 increased the association of 40DNM1L with the mitochondria. These results indicate that DNM1L is differentially regulated by LH and PGF2 signaling pathways and that DNM1L is required for optimal luteal progesterone synthesis. Taken together, the findings suggest LH may stabilize luteal mitochondria and promote steroidogenesis in bovine luteal cells via modulating the phosphorylation and activity of the GTPase DNM1L; and luteolytic hormones like PGF2 may stimulate mitochondrial fission by increasing the activity of DNM1L. 40) TRAINEE ORAL PRESENTATION ONLY: Lean maternal gestational diabetes mellitus impacts the ovarian proteome basally and in response to a stressor in later life. Kendra L. Clark 1, Omonseigho Talton 2, Shanthi Ganesan 1, Laura C. Schulz 2, Aileen F. Keating 1 1Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University 2Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Missouri Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an obstetric disorder affecting approximately 10% of pregnancies. GDM is normally resolved at delivery, but may associate with lasting health effects for mother and progeny, with both having a higher risk of acquiring diabetes later in life. The 4HFHS (High Fat High Sucrose) mouse model emulates GDM in lean women, who comprise ~50% of GDM cases, which is characterized by insulin resistance in the first trimester , and glucose intolerance in the second-third trimester. Dams are fed a HFHS diet one week prior to mating and throughout gestation, which inhibits beta cell expansion, leading to inadequate insulin response to glucose in mid-late pregnancy. We have discovered that the ovarian response to DNA damage and environmental chemical insult is altered by metabolic changes that occur during obesity. Since the offspring of HFHS dams have increased adiposity, we hypothesized that maternal metabolic alterations during lean GDM would compromise ovarian function in offspring both basally and in response to a dietary stress later in life. Pups received either a control or HFHS diet from 23-31 weeks of age. Briefly, DLPC were lean dams and control diet pups; D LPH were lean dams and HFHS pups; D HPC were HFHS dams and control diet pups and D HPH were HFHS dams and HFHS pups. Ovarian protein was isolated, LC-MS performed and bioinformatic analysis completed. Proteins were considered to differ between treatments if the fold-change was above 1 and the P-value was < 0.1. A HFHS challenge in the absence of maternal GDM (D LPC vs. D LPH) increased 3 and decreased 30 ovarian proteins. Maternal GDM in the absence of a dietary stress (D LPC vs. D HPC) increased abundance of 4 proteins and decreased abundance of 85 proteins in the offspring ovary. Finally, 4 proteins increased and 87 proteins decreased in offspring ovaries due to dietary challenge and exposure to maternal GDM in utero (D LPC vs. D HPH). Interestingly, canopy FGF signaling regulator 2 (CNPY2), DAZ associated protein 1 (DAZAP1), and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) were altered across multiple groups. Relative to offspring who did not experience GDM in utero or a dietary stress in later life (D LPC), CNPY2 decreased ( P 0.05) by 2.18-fold in offspring exposed to both GDM and HFHS diet (D HPH) and in offspring either from GDM pregnancies (D HPC; 1.72-fold) or fed a HFHS diet (DLPH; 1.65-fold). DAZAP1 also decreased ( P < 0.05) by 5.13-fold in the D LPC vs. D HPH offspring and by 2.43-fold in the D LPC vs. D HPC . In contrast, SRSF2 displayed a 1.42-fold increase ( P < 0.05) in the D LPC vs. D HPH and increases of 1.91-fold and 1.70-fold in D LPC vs. D HPC and D LPC vs. DLPH, respectively. Altered abundance of ovarian proteins in offspring who experienced maternal GDM underscore the potential long-term effects of metabolic changes on ovarian function.
