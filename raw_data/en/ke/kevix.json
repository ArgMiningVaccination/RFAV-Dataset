But did you know that there is also a medicinal benefit to adding watermelon to your picnic? In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Watermelon (Xi Gua) is used in herbal remedies for its ability to clear Summer-Heat, promote urination and decrease thirst. It is a tasty replacement for the Chinese Herbal Formula Bai Hu Tang which is commonly used for a specific pattern of symptoms that manifests as a high fever, excessive thirst, excessive sweating, irritability and dark, scanty urination. To increase the diuretic effect, eat the white rind of the fruit (found just against the green, hard exterior rind). Xi Gua is often used in Chinese Herbal Medicine to alleviate symptoms for some cases of edema and jaundice due to its diuretic effect. The most common way to take Xi Gua is to eat the fruit or drink the juice. For a new spin, browse around for watermelon and arugula or mint salad recipes. "}
