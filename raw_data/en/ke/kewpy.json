Drawing on the traditions of the ancient Alchemists Guild and the modern science of crystals, we have prepared a series of courses that will teach you virtually everything about using crystals and their energy to improve your life and spirit. Over 100,000 people have taken one or more of these courses, and we seem to be congratulating new Crystal Masters weekly. If you complete these seven courses satisfactorily, you will earn the certification as a Crystal Master. You will then have mastered using crystals to improve your life and spirit and those of others. It is a magical journey (and it can continue from there, too!). Crystal Master Courses The Journey to Crystal Master is taken in a series of seven courses: - The Basic Crystal Users Course - The Certified Crystal Healers Course - The Magic of Crystal Alchemy Course - The Certified Crystal Aromatherapist Course - The Basic Crystal Grid Course - The Crystal Grid Master Course - The Crystal Moon Astrologer Course The courses can be self-paced, and all the modules are posted and available within the Crystal Inner Circle Hall of Annual and Life Members. The courses are also taught each year week by week, starting 1 Feb each year, making them much easier to accomplish with the guidance and weekly assistance of the instructors (the schedule is near the end of this page for your reference). Crystal Vaults & The Founder The Crystal Vaults sponsors and supports the work of the Crystal Guild. Our founder, Hank Mason, is the founding Crystal Mage of the Crystal Guild. As a member of the ancient and honorable International Alchemy Guild and as an author for Lewellyn writing books on crystal and their uses, he founded our \"education arm\" for you to bring you both historical uses of crystals blended with the modern science that helps us truly understand them. Testimonial I just want to send a note to let you know how thoroughly I have enjoyed the Certified Crystal Master course. I can't believe it's coming to an end. Fortunately I am a lifetime member so I have access to these courses for review, and an abundance of articles, blog posts, information PDFs, libraries, the community forums. It's kind of sad that it's coming to an end, but the best part is two new courses are coming up this spring and fall for Crystal Masters.Through the lab portions of the course, I was able to experiment with different crystal energies, color energies, essential oils and elixirs and essences, crystal grids and incorporating crystal healing into my offerings. All the lab lessons were very informative.I probably would not have been able to take the courses individually. I certainly recommend anyone considering these courses to take advantage of the generous offers that come with annual and lifetime membership.I'd like to extend a special thank you to Mr. Henry Mason for his fabulous program and Ms. Erynn Hatzl for always being there to answer my questions quickly.-Robin Now, these courses are available anytime at the Crystal Guild hall.

Certified Crystal Healers Course You may have always wanted to understand crystals and crystal healing. You may have dreamed of being a Certified Crystal Healer. Now you can make that dream a reality. You can do it easily on your schedule, on your own time, and you will succeed! And yes, you can do this in 5 minutes per day if you desire. You can spend several thousand dollars on a Crystal Healer course in several places on the Web. But you don't have to spend that kind of money on becoming a good crystal healer. This course teaches you all you need to know to become a confident and successful crystal healer. You will learn the 10 Secrets of Crystal Healing. \"The elaborate context of healing ritual that constitute a healing session are paramount to its success. This is neuroscience. These factors have real biological effects on the immune and other bodily systems. They have a great effect on our \"experience of being ill\" and our feelings about it. Do not underestimate the power of ritual in healing. We are all programmed to believe it it. Most of us fell (more than once) and skinned our knees. \"Come here and let mommy kiss it and it will feel better,\" we were told. And we did and it did.....\" ~ Module 14 of the Certified Crystal Healers Course Crystal healing is not as mysterious as it is often portrayed. Rather it is, like all healing regimens, based on true understanding, deep care and kindness, insightful knowledge, and consistent practice. The 70 video and written modules of this course provide you with just that - the ability to use kindness, insightful knowledge, and consistent practice of proven healing regimes. You will amaze yourself. When you finish these 70 modules and pass the exam (yes, it too is an open-book exam), you will be a Certified Crystal Healer and have a certificate to prove it. You will be entitled to add the letters CCH after your name. Testimonial Hello Erynn, I am grateful for the opportunity to have studied with Crystal Inner Circle the past year and earned my Crystal Master Certification. I have been working with crystals for a few years and to have had the opportunity to be able to study different aspects surrounding crystals and learn valuable certifications and have literature to refer to is something I never imagined I would be able to do. The CIC team is very knowledgeable and approachable. I would recommend to anyone interested in crystals - whether you are just starting your journey or are familiar with them - to sign up, you will not regret it! - M\u00e9lanie How do you get this course? You can head to the [Crystal Guild](http://www.crystalguild.org), pay the $499 tuition, and start the course. or... You can take advantage of our special offer to take it for FREE as an annual or life member of the [Crystal Inner Circle](http://www.crystalinnercircle.com/cic1).

You will certainly learn that you can achieve the life you want and realize there is still magic in the world, and it can make all the difference in your life. Magic is Real We, like you, know magic is real. We know it is essential to give our lives meaning and color. What is magic? Magic is our human attempt to understand what we do not yet have the science to understand. Magic is the personal effort to deal with a Universe of pure mystery. You are going to find that magic in Crystal Alchemy. Opening the doors to the mysterious study of alchemy and expanding it to bring the energy and magic of crystals to light is unprecedented. Crystal Alchemy is a new offshoot of traditional alchemy drawing on the traditions and methods of the alchemist of old and combining them with the knowledge of the energies of crystals and stones. Today we can combine the wisdom of the ancient alchemist, seers, and magicians with the current findings of science. The result is a robust, easily mastered skill - creating magic from crystal energy. The study of this skill is called Crystal Alchemy. Never before have some of these secrets been revealed. You will be amazed to learn that wonders you just thought might exist really do exist. And you can easily control and use them to make life better for yourself and others. This course will show you how. The Emerald Tablet Alchemy dates back to when our two cultures of science and religion were part of one true philosophy. The roots of alchemical theory can be traced back to a single document known throughout history as the Emerald Tablet. According to legend, the tablet was brought by mysterious visitors to Egypt over 12,000 years ago, a time the ancient texts refer to as Zep Tepi when godlike beings roamed the earth. The author of the Emerald Tablet was a member of what the ancient Egyptians called the Group of Nine. His name was Thoth, and he taught humans how to interpret nature and write down their thoughts. He is credited with inventing writing, mathematics, music, astronomy, architecture, and medicine. He recorded the visitors' teachings in hundreds of books and succinctly summarized them in the Emerald Tablet. How can you take this course?

Testimonial What a ride this has been over the last year! I took a chance on myself and decided to go through the courses and I am incredibly happy and grateful I did. Crystal Inner Circle has put together so much amazing information together in all these classes. It really spoke on a soul level all that I have learned. The lessons within each class are short and to the point, just loaded with information. For a mom of three that homeschools and works full time but still wanting to do something for myself, this has been such a blessing. Thank you to all who have put everything into these classes, sharing knowledge and experience, always there to answer questions and help throughout all the classes. I appreciate all of you and thank you again and again! Much love and respect, Melissa Basic Crystal Grid Course Welcome to a wonderful journey into crystal grids' mysteries, wonder, and power. The Basic Crystal Guild Course is 19 introductory lessons that are the prerequisite for the Crystal Grid Master Course.

Combining the energies of different crystals allows for the creation of crystal grids to be made and used for virtually any purpose. Using crystal grids effectively will allow you to combine the power of the healing and spiritual energies of crystals. Crystal grids will greatly expand the effectiveness of crystals by combining their energies. This course is written and delivered by Henry Mason, the leading expert on crystal grids.

Testimonial Hi Erynn and Hank,When I first heard of the certification process leading up to Certified Crystal Master, I was intrigued about what I could learn but very apprehensive about whether or not I would be able to keep up with the pace of the coursework as I work full time. I normally would have not thought about pursuing such certification due to the time commitment and cost required, but the email that I received about what was NOT going to happen (the one that said we were not going to pay thousands of dollars and put crystals on our heads and sing Kumbaya--it made me laugh), I knew that I was making the right decision to join the Crystal Inner Circle and start learning. The short lessons made it extremely easy to catch up on the many weeks that I was \"behind\"--a half-hour on the weekend or listening to two or three modules during my lunch hour made it doable. I also felt my confidence grow as I progressed through the courses. By the time we got to the Crystal Alchemy course, I felt comfortable deviating from the curriculum to create my own elixir recipes to meet my needs instead of just reproducing each of the elixirs in the course.I loved listening to Hank narrate each of the modules and the videos themselves were visually appealing and appeared professionally done--not just someone with a webcam recording themselves (which was what I expected). Although I only posted questions or comments a couple of times in the forum, I got a quick response. Everything was explained so clearly that I didn't have many questions. I also appreciated how things were presented--very informational without any of the ego \"look at how much I know\" style of others I have seen.This is probably more information that you asked for, but I really enjoyed the process and gained so much confidence in applying what I learned. I can't wait to move forward to become a Senior Crystal Master and eventually a Crystal Mage--I know I will have the support to achieve these goals.Warm regards,Deb R. Crystal Moon Astrologer Course Astrology can be very intimidating. The vocabulary is difficult to master, the concepts are esoteric, and the myriad of schools of astrology make even basic understanding a problem for almost all of us. And astrologers are expensive. Maybe you have had a birth chart made. They are free on several Web sites. If you were like me, looking at it was sort of confusing but interesting and unfathomable. Most of us got about that far, put it in a drawer, then occasionally turn to a daily horoscope for our Sun Sign and call it a day. But wait! There is a very popular part of astrology called Moon Astrology. It recognizes the simple fact that when the Moon is above the horizon it has about a million times more astrological effect on us than all the other planets combined. It is like a giant searchlight in your backyard shining in your window compared to the other planets being like flashlights in some small village in China. it really doesn't matter where those flashlights are or in which village, the searchlight simply overpowers them. So when the Moon is below the horizon, traditional sun-based astrology is effective and it matters where the planets are in their houses compared to your birth chart. When the moon is above the horizon, it simply dominates the sky and the astrological effects. What we need to know is what effect it is having. Crystal Moon Astrology teaches us that, and it turns out to be remarkably easy to use. The Course Consists of Several Modules - Lore and Legend, Fact and Fiction: This section introduces the magic and wonder of the Moon, From ancient beliefs, to the most current research we will explore the Moon from both its metaphysical and scientific views. You will find that life as we know it on Earth is actually totally dependent on the Moon. - The Phases of the Moon. Building on the first module, we will explore the 29.5-day cycle of the Moon's luminosity. From the New Moon to the Full Moon and back, the cycle for most of history defined the calendar of mankind. Our name for a Moonth is just a \"Month\" with one \"o\" missing. - The Fundamental Elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Understanding the basic elements is key to Moon Astrology. The reason is that we as humans and the Moon and the Earth are composed of the four elements, and as the Universe resonates, so do we. Staying in sync means good health and prosperity. - The Moon in the Zodiac. The Moon's travel in the Zodiac is a rapid one. It circles the entire Zodiac from our perspective each 28 days as it orbits the Earth in that time. When we divide the Zodiac into 12 parts we have the well-known Sun Signs such as Virgo and Cancer. When we divide it into 28 parts we get the Mansions of the Moon. The Mansions of the Moon have been a part of Astrology for over 5,000 years. Each Mansion reflects the unique elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth based on its location in the Zodiac. - The Spirits and Crystals of the Mansions. From all cultures and times, people have associated the Moon and the elemental energy it brings by the personification of the energy. Called by whatever name, Gods, Goddesses, Spirits, Elementals, Saints, or Deities, these spirits bring us an understanding of how the Moon and its energy have affected us as humans across time and culture. The minerals and crystals of each Mansion are explored. - Advanced Topics. In this section, we explore some advanced topics to extend your understanding of Crystal Moon Astrology. We explore concepts such as \"Birth of Moon Phases and Zodiac Mansions\", and more. How can you take this course?

Crystal Master This certification means you are one of the few true experts in the uses of crystal energy. It also means you have completed the prerequisites to take the two Certified Crystal Master courses that once completed lead to the certification of Senior Crystal Master. The next steps: Senior Crystal Master and Crystal Mage All Certified Crystal Masters are eligible to continue their studies with three more courses: Crystal Herb Master, Crystal Candle Magician, and Crystal Mage Study. Crystal Herb Master Each spring, we teach the Crystal Herb Master Course. This course is offered FREE to all Crystal Masters who are members of the Crystal Inner Circle. It is the first of two courses that lead to the certification as a Senior Crystal Master. The Crystal Herb Master Course is divided into 12 weeks. Each week after this first one, you will study and use two herbs (one week, we cover three). There are 21 total herbs in the course. Each week there are three lessons. Two of them will cover one herb each. Then the third lesson of the week is a video of the use of those herbs. Completion of the course will require the completion of a Crystal Herbalist Notebook and the completion of four student herb projects. These projects will demonstrate your ability to use your knowledge of herbs and crystals in a meaningful and useful way. Course completion will be awarded the submittal of images from the notebook and projects. Here is an example project: Crystal Candle Magician Course The Crystal Candle Magician Course is taught each Fall to Crystal Masters seeking to earn certification as Senior Crystal Masters. This is a very hands-on course that involves creating ceremonies for a myriad of needs using candles, crystals, herbs, essential oils, and elementals effectively and artfully. Completing the Crystal Herb Master Course and the Crystal Candle Magician Course leads to certification as a Senior Crystal Master of the Crystal Guild. This level demonstrates a wide range of expertise in using crystals, herbs, essential oil, candles, and rituals to develop methods and processes and create tangible benefits for one's life, spirit, and others. Crystal Mage Each year we supervise the Independent Study of Senior Crystal Masters seeking to attain the highest level of Crystal Guild certification - Crystal Mage. These studies usually take about 5 months and consist of a series of projects that demonstrate the knowledge required to teach Crystal Master courses and to mentor others in their studies.
