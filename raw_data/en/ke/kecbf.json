In this introductory class you will learn about a myriad of essential organic herbs sourced from our store. These herbs are beneficial, natural, supplements for weight loss, reproductive aid, muscle pain, digestive issues and many more. The herbs are also chakra related and should be used in meditation to help with correcting imbalanced or overactive chakras. Each class will consist of herbs based on its related chakra. We will focus on the body parts connected to the chakra, and the physical symptoms that can be of consequence for that chakra being imbalanced. Each participant will get a short course on the herbs chosen for the class, what they are and what they do. Based on the information received you will be able to pick your herb(s) of choosing and make your own essential herb kit! To find out more details, join a class!
