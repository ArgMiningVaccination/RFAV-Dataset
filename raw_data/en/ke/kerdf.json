As the path begins to wind, so do the emotions and expectations. Yet this is a time when the body and spirit need the most harmony to create. That is where we can offer guidance and empower you with a more fine-tuned relationship with your body. ESTABLISHED Source Healing has been optimizing fertility holistically since 1999, well before it was used in the mainstream. We want you to feel supported during a time that can bring strong emotions that run the spectrum... from joy to disappointment... from fear to hope. We also help you find mindful balance to enable you to be present in your life and relationships, as well as empower you to strengthen your relationship with your physical and emotional body, positioning you to serve as your best advocate on the winding fertility journey. For over two decades, we have supported women and men in this journey. We have also have the training and accreditations it takes to do it well and with presence. CUSTOMIZED SUPPORT Whether you hope to conceive naturally, increase your chances with IVF or IUI, or optimize egg quality for egg freezing, we partner with you on your unique path to optimized fertility. While our patients are often told their fertility is unexplained, we strive to provide you with an understanding of your unique road map from a Chinese medicine perspective, based on your symptoms and constitutional patterns. As we get to know you, the emphasis will be on optimizing your wellness and giving yourself permission for receiving nourishment and self-care, as well as guiding you on how to receive for a healthy pregnancy and postpartum resilience. OUR METHOD Our acupuncturists approach treatments with our own method: The Source Method. It is rooted in an evidence-based Chinese medicine approach that includes a blend of acupuncture, Chinese herbal therapy, nutritional guidelines, lifestyle recommendations, breath-work, and guided meditation; along with intuitive energetic guidance and mindset training to bring your body into better balance. As part of the Source Healing difference, our practice works as a collective, conducting \"think-tanks\" on each individual case so that you are benefitting from multiple perspectives. \"As someone with stage four endometriosis, I started acupuncture while trying to get pregnant with my first child. After five egg retrievals and three failed rounds of IVF, I came to Source Healing for treatment before undergoing my final embryo transfer. I started acupuncture in advance of my transfer to support blood flow and overall wellness. My life was forever changed when a couple weeks later after years of trying I confirmed that I was pregnant with my daughter. Then at about five months post-partum after having my daughter, I decided that I would like to start to focus my acupuncture on helping to prepare for what I thought would be another round of IVF for a second child. I never made it to that next round of IVF, because after a couple weeks of going to Source Healing I was pregnant AGAIN for the second time totally naturally. I credit acupuncture with helping my mind and body be in a healthy place to support the embryo transfer and ultimately two healthy pregnancies.\" - Jackie P. What to Expect For your initial consultation/treatment, we will map out a plan that is both attainable and understandable. From dietary shifts, emotional strengthening, herbal therapy, energetic openings, breath-work, meditation training, and lifestyle counseling, we will help guide you every step of the way. To get you ready on a physical level, we will focus on your menstrual cycle, digestion, sleep, and anxiety levels as well as other systems in your body to start the balancing process. We often recommend 12 sessions for three months (or three menstrual cycles) or one session a week for three months, as research shows that this is the time it takes to heighten egg quality and regulate menstrual cycles. We treat a wide range of conditions to support female and male fertility optimization as well as prenatal and postpartum care, including: UNEXPLAINED INFERTILITY RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE EGG QUALITY LOW AMH / HIGH FSH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES AMENORRHEA DYSMENORRHEA HORMONAL IMBALANCE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROM (PCOS) ENDOMETRIOSIS MALE FACTOR INFERTILITY PRE + POST-NATAL SUPPORT LUTEAL PHASE DEFECT (LPD) IVF/IUI SUPPORT DECREASED OVARIAN RESERVE EGG FREEZING SUPPORT MISCARRIAGE/STILL BIRTH TRAUMA BIRTH TRAUMA LIBIDO SUPPORT LABOR PREP / INDUCTION BREECH BABY POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION/ANXIETY Natural Conception If you are trying to conceive naturally, we recommend that you receive acupuncture to balance out your body weekly for 3 months or 3 cycles before you start trying. We recommend all women think about their body's physical/emotional balance if they plan on having kids in the future. If you have PMS, irregular cycles, painful periods, endometriosis, PCOS, or other symptoms, it's important to get those imbalances managed ahead of time. It is important to get in touch with your rhythms and cycles now and learn what your body is telling you. That way, you have a present and active communication system with your physical body for when you are ready to start trying to conceive, as your body can be your ally to make the process easier and less fraught with anxiety. Assisted Reproductive Therapy (ART) / Frozen Transfers Should you choose to enter into IVF or IUI, our team can prep you and help you maintain overall balance as you are going through the entire process to increase your chances. Many scientific studies show the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine in conjunction with ART. Prior to IVF/IUI or egg freezing, we will target treatments based on where you are in your cycle; following that based on where you are in your individual process. Male Factor Infertility Nearly half of all infertility cases are attributed to male infertility. The three factors that lead to male fertility are sperm count, motility (movement), and morphology (shape and size). Varicocele can also be addressed with Chinese Medicine. From a Chinese Medicine perspective, improving male reproductive health is achieved by tonifying the Kidney meridian, clearing heat from the Liver meridian, opening circulation and flow; as well as increasing the immune system and virility. Because it takes 70 days to generate new sperm, treatment time is approximately 3 months with acupuncture, Chinese herbs, nutritional counseling and lifestyle shifts. Fertility Massage Fertility massage is a complimentary therapy to enhance your own body's natural ability to conceive. Whether it be in conjunction with acupuncture, if you are having difficulties conceiving, or to help induce conception. It allows movement of congested lymph fluid and increases blood flow to the uterus, nourishing the entire reproductive system. It also provides physical balance to your body as a whole, as it balances Qi and relieves stress, which can hinder conception. The best time to receive fertility massage is at the end of menses to ovulation. It is not recommended during menses. The massage is administered specifically to the abdominal area and incorporated with a full body massage, so an 80 min session is recommended but not necessary to receive the maximum benefit. Fertility massage is offered exclusively by our therapist, [Gina](https://sourcehealing.janeapp.com). Prenatal Massage Prenatal Massage can be booked for general discomfort during any stage of pregnancy. It can help reduce stress, decrease symptoms of depression, relieve muscle aches and joint pain. Prenatal massage can also help regulate hormone levels, help blood circulation, and reduce swelling.

Soon after, to our total shock, I was pregnant! My husband didn't believe it, we were prepared for failure, and my doctor couldn't explain it. I was monitored very closely by our endocrinologist and to his and our surprise, the pregnancy was perfectly normal and grew beautifully inside my body. We have a beautiful son who is now 3 years "}
