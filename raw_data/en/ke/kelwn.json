{"title": "The CAG/CAA expansion encoding polyQ huntingtin (mutant huntingtin [mHTT]) causes Huntington's disease (HD), which is characterized by atrophy and loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are preceded by neuropathological alterations in the cortex. Previous studies have shown that mHTT can spread in the brain, but the mechanisms involved in the stereotyped degeneration and dysfunction of the neurons from the striatum to the cortex remain unclear. In this study, we found that the mHTT expression initially restricted in the striatum later spread to the cortical regions in mouse brains. Such transmission was diminished in mice that lacked the striatal-enriched protein called 'Ras-homolog enriched in the striatum' (Rhes). Rhes restricted to MSNs was also found in the cortical layers of the brain, indicating a new transmission route for the Rhes protein to the brain. Mechanistically, Rhes promotes such transmission via a direct cell-to-cell contact mediated by tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), the membranous protrusions that enable the transfer of mHTT, Rhes, and other vesicular cargoes. These transmission patterns suggest that Rhes and mHTT are likely co-transported in the brain using TNT-like cell-to-cell contacts. On the basis of these new results, a perspective is presented in this presentation: Rhes may ignite the mHTT transmission from the striatum that may coincide with HD onset and disease progression through an anatomically connected striato-cortical retrograde route.", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2022-08-16", "cleaned_text": "| | Mammalian genomes harbor a large number of transposable elements (TEs) and their remnants. Most TEs are incapable of retrotransposition as most TEs are epigenetically repressed. However transcriptional silencing is partially released to permit developmental or tissue-specific expression of TEs. Some TEs have also evolved as cis-regulatory elements (CREs), enabling them to recruit host-encoded transcription factors. Dysregulation of TEs is implicated in neurological disorders and cancer. Previously, the noncoding long terminal repeat (LTR) part of the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) families has been shown to function as transcriptional enhancers (cis-regulatory elements). We have previously shown H4K16ac and H3K122ac marks transcriptional enhancers. I will present our recent work which demonstrates that MOF/MSL mediated H4K16ac regulates TE transcription by maintaining a permissive chromatin structure. Since TEs constitute nearly 50% of the genome, our data shows that H4K16ac and H3K122ac regulate a significant portion of the mammalian genome by opening local chromatin structure and transcriptional activity at TEs.

These communities also play vital roles in algal blooms and in photobioreactors. Despite their importance, how these communities assemble and function is not clear. In this talk, I will talk about two projects that deal with these questions. In the first half, I will describe a novel method to measure the emergent carbon cycling ability of the communities, and show that diverse communities cycle similar amounts of carbon due to a similarity in their emergent metabolic capabilities. The second half of my talk will explore how phototrophs affect microbial community assembly around them. I will show that the phototrophs have a significant impact on the community assembly when external nutrient supply is infrequent. Further, the effect of phototrophs is to drive convergence in the taxonomic composition of initially diverse communities, surprisingly by suppressing certain taxa. The results of the two projects provide overarching rules of the dynamics and functions of phototroph-heterotorph communities. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The spatial distribution of molecular species in a sample can provide a wealth of information about biological, chemical, and physiological processes.

(Haapus), NCBS Details: https://bit.ly/apls-virus Abstract: Other than politics, viruses have been the dominant topic in the news for nearly three years now. Yet it is debatable whether the concept of \"virus\" itself is well understood by a large fraction of the people who bandy the term about. Indeed, although viruses may have even been the first life forms to appear on earth, and have been affecting human populations for as long as humans have existed, they were not defined until about the 1950s. This presentation looks at the history of development of the virus concept in biology and medicine, from the first usage in the English language\u2014when it had multiple meanings\u2014to its modern definition. In particular I will be focusing on the rather paradoxical role played by the research on two particular viruses (or rather groups of viruses)\u2014viruses that cause tumors in chickens and those capable of infecting bacteria\u2014in arriving at the definition. Their role was paradoxical because at the time of their respective discoveries in the first decades of the 20th century, few people believed that they were in fact \"viruses\" as the term was understood then. Ultimately, however, it was an understanding of how these particular creatures functioned that led to the formulation of the modern concept of virus, as an entity different from other categories of being.

This wouldn't have been possible without enzyme-driven metabolic processes. While the catalytic function of enzymes is key for various cellular processes, equally important is the regulation of enzyme function. An enzyme's activity can be regulated in many different ways: binding of an allosteric regulator, post-translational modifications, and change in oligomeric state to name some. In my talk, I will present a paradoxical mode of enzyme activity regulation that we discovered in B. subtilis. The enzyme of interest GudB, that breaks glutamate, is regulated by binding to another enzyme, GltAB that catalyzes the opposite reaction. I will present kinetic and structural evidence that in the GudB-GltAB anti-metabolon, GudB is inhibited by GltAB binding. Why to inhibit an enzyme in such a complex way? It turns out that this complex mode of regulation is an elegant solution for the metabolic requirements of the interior and the peripheral cells of the Bacillus biofilm. Moreover, the complex formation is crucial for the survival of the cells in the stationary phase and prevent sporulation. I will also briefly present other examples of such designs in biology (made of opposing activities) and discuss their utility in synthetic biology. Finally, I will conclude with an evolutionary perspective of the emergence of this complex in the Bacillus species tree and describe our efforts to evolve such an anti-metabolon using directed evolution.

However, modern machine learning frameworks such as neural networks are often designed for structured datatypes such as images or sequences. To address this, we show that high dimensional point cloud datasets, particularly those that are sampled from an underlying manifold structure, can be represented as affinity graphs from which we can extract data-geometric quantities such as curvature and geodesic distances which have uses in visualization and embedding. Then we show that features on these point clouds are signals on such a graph, and spatial and frequency domain representations of these graph signals allows us to denoise signals, compute density and even optimal transport on the point cloud. Finally, we show that even placing arbitrary signals on the nodes of these graphs allows us to develop underlying descriptions of the data manifold via scattering transforms which can then be fed into deep learning frameworks for regression and generation. We demonstrate applications of these concepts to single cell developmental and disease data and molecule representation and generation.

Studies in several plants have identified a few microRNAs and other small RNAs that target regulators of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway called the MYB transcription factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenously expressed non-coding small RNAs, involved in negative regulation of gene expression. Since most of the MYB members are not well characterized in crop plants, it is not possible to predict the MYB subgroups that are targeted by miRNAs. Poor understanding of how miRNAs/siRNAs regulate MYB expression, led us to study the functional relevance of miRNAs in accumulation of specific secondary metabolites in crop plants such as grapes. Using sRNA-sequencing, degradome analysis, we established that grape lines with high anthocyanin content expressed abundantly two MYB-targeting miRNAs. Our analysis revealed two miRNAs, miR828 and miR858, that targeted R2R3-type MYBs in grapes. We identified previously unknown R2R3-type member MYB114 as a potential target of miRNAs. Targeting by miR828 caused MYB RNA decay and initiated a cascade of secondary siRNAs whose production was RDR6 dependent. MYB suppression and cascade silencing was more robust in grape lines with high anthocyanin content than in a flavonol-rich grape line. Functional analysis revealed that MYB114 as a repressor of anthocyanin accumulation. Our study identified a novel MYB repressor with an active EAR motif. We also provided functional understanding of EAR motifs in MYB repressors. Collectively we showed that reduced silencing of MYB114 in flavonol-rich grapes, due to lower accumulation of miRNAs, resulted in shifting the pathway towards flavonol accumulation. | | | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are the major vector of malaria, a disease that affects more than a half of the world's population and results in more than 400,000 deaths every year (WHO report, 2018). Larval and adult mosquitoes rely on their sense of smell to find food sources and avoid repellent substances in their environment. However, the genetic tools to study and alter the function of olfactory neurons are currently very limited. In this talk I will highlight how the development of genetic tools that allows the interrogation of olfactory circuits has provided insight into the olfactory perception of mosquito larvae and sexual dimorphisms in adult mosquitoes | | |VC Link||Coordinator| All insects carry a complex blend of hydrocarbons (CHC) on their cuticle. These CHCs play a crucial role as desiccation barrier and in intra- and interspecific communication and recognition processes. Although CHC composition and function in ants and eusocial bees has been studied intensively, our knowledge on the evolution of this ubiquitous trait is rather scarce. In my talk I will introduce you to comparative studies on CHC profiles of Asian and European honeybees. These studies shed light on the specificity of CHC profiles in honeybees and their function as cues and signals in the social life of bees. | | How the nervous system extracts and represents the external world is a central question in neuroscience. In addition to sensory physiology, the mechanics of sensory structures condition the sensory feedback and shape the information available to the nervous system. I study how biomechanics, sensory feedback and motor dynamics help achieve movement control. Movement control in insects is especially challenging because they perform extremely fast aerial maneuvers. Mechanosensors provide extremely rapid feedback on a wing stroke-to-wing stroke basis. Insect wings are covered with dome-shaped strain sensors, called campaniform sensilla which provide feedback about wing deformations that occur due to body rotations and hence inform about external perturbations as well as insect's self-motion. We used extracellular electrophysiology to record from campaniform sensilla on hawkmoth wings to understand how they capture information about wing motion. Using computational methods, we built neuronal models that capture the firing response of these sensors and predicted their response to more naturalistic wing movements. I will briefly discuss current projects that use biomechanical models and comparative methods to understand the interaction of wing mechanics and sensing. In addition to these strain sensors, insect cuticle is embedded with a variety of mechanosensors. Another mechanosensory organ called the pilifer, occurs as a bundle of hair bristles at the base of hawkmoth's specialized mouthparts. Hawkmoths are expert flower foragers and hover over flowers to feed from them, even as the flowers sway in the wind, typically in low light conditions of dusk and dawn. Our behavioral studies show that they systematically probe the floral surfaces with their extremely long and flexible mouthpart called the proboscis for tactile cues that guide the insect to a tiny nectary at the center of the flower. Moreover, other behavioral studies suggest that rapid mechanosensory feedback from pilifers must inform the moths about the relative position of the flower and hence help track a swaying flower successfully. Preliminary recordings from the pilifers show that these are extremely sensitive and respond within a few milliseconds of a stimulus. Future experiments will seek to understand how pilifers encode motion of the mouthparts, and hence extract tactile features of the flower, encode floral movements, and control flight movements. These results help us understand how insect sensory systems shape their flight and feeding behaviors. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| RNA has never been more in the limelight than today. RNA viruses, RNA vaccines, RNA therapies and much more have brought RNA to the forefront of science, technology and human health. Inspired by our studies on natural RNAs, my group is interested in developing translatable technologies for RNA-based diagnostics, therapeutics and novel solutions towards anti-microbial resistance. RNA localization, protein production, interactions with partners and even the lifetime of RNA in the cell are influenced by its structure. Hence, new advances in RNA-based technologies require an understanding of RNA structure along with function. Over the years, my group has developed various capabilities that let us identify, analyze, probe, compare and visualize RNA structure. In this talk, I will highlight our work on i) RNA-based technologies for diagnostics and surveillance, where we couple whole-genome local RNA structure analysis with engineered RNA biosensors and use this for specific nucleic-acid detection, ii) Riboswitches and non-coding RNAs as candidates for novel anti-microbial solutions, and iii) naturally occurring RNA switches in bacteria and viruses where we elucidate their mechanisms of translational control, their partnership with signaling proteins and ultimately their function in cells. Understanding the principles of structural switching and how structure enables function in these natural RNAs enables us to develop novel RNA switches for customized applications. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| VCA is a life enhancing procedure which comprises transplantation of organs with heterogenous tissue types such as face, hand and abdomen. Conventionally, systemic drug delivery has been practiced in VCA. The biggest hurdle preventing the widespread use of this surgery is daily lifelong immunosuppression which is systemically administered to patients to prevent rejection. The systemic immunotherapy leads to various adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, metabolic complications and malignancies. In current work, I will discuss two different approaches that we have developed for local drug delivery during VCA. One is the use of small amphiphilic hydrogelator, triglycerol monostearate (TGMS) for inflammation responsive drug delivery of an immunosuppressant, tacrolimus. In our first proof-of-concept studies, we show that a single dose of tacrolimus loaded hydrogel prevents graft rejection of >100 days compared to the same dose injection of tacrolimus alone, which gave a median graft survival of ~33.5 days. We have further modified this system for dual drug delivery and non-invasive monitoring of the drug depot using a near infrared dye. In another approach, we discuss the synthesis and characterization of a prodrug-based polymer. The polymer can be used to form microparticles and hydrogels, which can be used for localized drug delivery in VCA. | | Defects in chromosome-microtubule attachment can cause chromosomal instability (CIN), frequently associated with infertility and aggressive cancers. Chromosome-microtubule attachment is mediated by a large macromolecular structure, the kinetochore. Sister kinetochores of each chromosome are pulled by microtubules from opposing spindle-poles, a state called biorientation which prevents chromosome missegregation. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack the opposing-pull are detached by Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase. It has been a long-standing puzzle as to how mono-oriented attachments that precede biorientation are spared despite the lack of opposing-pull. Using an RNAi-screen, we uncover a unique role for the Astrin-SKAP complex in protecting mono-oriented attachments. We provide evidence of domains in the microtubule-end associated protein that sense changes specific to end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments and assemble an outer-kinetochore crescent to stabilise attachments. We find that Astrin-PP1 and Cyclin-B-CDK1 pathways counteract each other to preserve mono-oriented attachments. Thus, CIN prevention pathways are not only surveying attachment defects but also actively recognising and stabilising mature attachments independent of biorientation. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Coumarin is a structurally simple scaffold widespread in nature, found in many plants and edible foods. Coumarins have attracted great attention in biological applications due to their three unique characteristics: 1) fluorescent, emit light in ultraviolet and blue; 2) photocleavable, routinely utilized to prepare caged compounds; 3) biologically active, many drugs and pharmacological contain coumarin scaffold. These properties can be modulated as desired by introducing substitutions on the coumarin core. I have used coumarins for preparing useful caged compounds for neuroscience, and better fluorescent stains for mitochondria, and thoroughly investigated the underlying mechanisms. My findings from mechanism details offered new applications in biology and medicinal chemistry. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Morphology is one of the fundamental dimensions for macroevolutionary studies. To understand intricate evolutionary patterns in structures and functional correlates of various adaptive morphological traits, several approaches have been developed in recent years. An integrated approach implementing understanding of natural history, phylogeny, biogeography, morphology and adaptive landscapes is instrumental to assess the evolution of organismal structures and functions. Recent advances in imaging and computational techniques have enabled biologists to estimate linear and non-linear measurements of structures and subsequent manifestation of these estimates to complex functions revealing biomechanical and kinetic aspects of functional morphology. Among various advanced methods, MicroCT and geometric morphometry have become instrumental in assessing functional morphology both qualitatively and quantitatively. These techniques along with advanced comparative phylogenetic methods further strengthen aspects of functional morphology revealing complex evolutionary patterns. To examine the effects of adaptive forces on the functional morphology of various traits, insects including butterflies with their greatly diverse internal and external morphological features is one of the best model systems. Additionally, butterfly assemblages in the unique heterogeneous habitat of India with their interesting evolutionary history provide with great opportunity to investigate complex evolutionary patterns. Therefore, I focused on understanding how advanced techniques enable the analyses of adaptive morphology to reveal evolutionary patterns in various Indian butterflies. I performed multiple case studies on the adaptive functional morphology of butterflies, using geometric morphometrics and MicroCT. Firstly, I investigated how mimicry drives the mode and tempo of the trait evolution such as flight morphology and wing colour patterns in the mimetic butterfly community of Western Ghats. Secondly, I explored the structures and functions of specialized organs that mediate the multimodal interaction between a myrmecophilic butterfly caterpillar and tending ant species, using MicroCT. Next, I examined the presence of mechanical lock and key between conspecific male and female external genitalia interactions among butterflies across different families using MicroCT. I further examined wing shape divergence in Calinaga butterflies and revised the taxonomic status of Indian Tarucus butterflies based on extensive natural history and morphological data. Collectively these works put together an integrative approach to answering questions in comparative and functional morphology. | | Lysosomes are key organelle for cellular protein degradation. Amino acids are being generated upon delivery and subsequent degradation of proteins within lysosomal lumen. However, the fate, function and patho-physiological significance of these lysosomally-generated amino acids are not clearly known. Moreover, the alteration of lysosomal amino acid pool in response to the changes in the nutritional status in extracellular microenvironment remained completely unknown. The newly emerging concept establishing this organelle as the signaling hub for amino acid homeostasis and its importance in age-related diseases are at its infancy. My work focuses particularly on non-traditional role of this conventional 'garbage-recycling' organelle. My work is a first ever attempt to understand the molecular logic of establishing lysosome as vital decision maker for amino acid storage and usage in cell upon communicating with extracellular environment. I will present my discovery showing the mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin)-independent, RagGTPase-Ragulator (essential components of the mTOR-complex)-dependent novel amino acid homeostasis pathway that generates essential amino acid storage in lysosome under starvation in extracellular environment. This lysosomal amino acid storage pool is further utilized for protein translation to potentially sustain cell growth in starvation. I have demonstrated role of this novel pathway in cancer, potentially in neurodegeneration, Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) and aging, which awaits further discovery. I will also present my previous work in one of the neurodegenerative disorders, ALS, where I have identified aberrant mTOR-activity-mediated lysosomal-autophagy hyperactivation which potentially alter lysosomal nutrient storage in ALS-motor neurons in mouse model, which could have potential clinical significance. | | TANGO1, a transmembrane protein assembles into a ring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site. The cytoplasmic part of TANGO1 stitches the membrane enclosed within the ring (donor of secretory cargoes) to ERGIC (the next compartment in the secretory pathway). Fusion between donor and ERGIC creates a conduit, a tunnel, which is used to export cargoes from the ER. The transmembrane helices of TANGO1 in the ring form a barrier to prevent miscibility of ERGIC into the bulk of ER. This method of tunnelling cargoes from ER to the next secretory compartment, the ERGIC, is fundamentally different from production of known vesicles in exocytosis (Raote and Malhotra. Ann. in the ER lumen and recruits cytoplasmic tethering proteins to connect ERES to the next secretory compartment (ERGIC/cis-Golgi). The fusion of ERES to ERGIC is used to transfer cargo while maintaining the identity of the two compartments. In this assembly, COP coats remain as collars at the neck of this tunnel. | | Electrons and electron microscopy have the power to resolve atomic details. However, electron beam-induced movement and radiation damage are some of the factors that limit the resolution that can be achieved for biological specimens. In particular, the radiation damage of biological molecules by electrons requires averaging of multiple molecular images to obtain higher signal to noise ratio and thus higher resolution. During the last few years, there has been enormous technical progress in the structure determination of biological macromolecules by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) both as single molecules as well as ultrastructural features within the cells and has become a popular technique. In the lab, we use cryoEM as the major technique to tackle interesting and challenging biological problems in particular at the membrane interface. In this seminar, I will describe the structural and functional characterisation of two model systems: 1) a robust microbial enzyme with interesting biochemical properties and active site, which we have also been using as test sample for cryoEM specimen preparation and data collection 2) a highly dynamic membrane protein belonging to the class C GPCR namely the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu5) and how it is activated by its ligand to result in a signalling event. | | Calcium-induced mucin secretion from goblet cells by exogenous agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manner composes the mucus layer that protects our epithelial lining from pathogens and allergens. Hyper and hypo secretion of mucins is linked to several diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease and colorectal cancer progression. We would like to target mucins to control diseases of the airway and colon, but we first need to understand how cells secrete the right quantity and quality of mucins under normal physiological conditions. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify Proteins Involved in Mucin Secretion (PIMS) in colon cancer cell lines. Our data reveal that cooperation between the sodium channels TRPM4-TRPM5 and sodium-calcium exchangers (NCXs) promotes entry of extracellular Ca++ to release mucin by the stimulated pathway from goblet cells. Baseline mucin secretion, on the other hand, is triggered by intracellular calcium oscillations mostly by the function of ER-located ryanodine receptors (RYRs). These calcium oscillations act via a small Ca++ binding protein KChIP3 to control the fusion propensity of mucin granules. KChIP3-bearing mature mucin granules do not fuse to the plasma membrane. Upon binding to calcium, KChIP3 dissociates from mature granules, which then fuse to plasma membranes. In other words, KChIP3 attached to the granules acts as a brake- a negative regulator- for the fusion of mucin granules to the plasma membrane. Loss of KChIP3 results in mucin hypersecretion both in vitro and in vivo (colon of KChIP3-/- mice). KChIP3 thus emerges as a high-affinity Ca++ sensor to control baseline mucin secretion. We have identified a glycosyltransferase FUT8 that controls the viscoelastic properties of mucins. Defects in FUT8 are observed in patients with ulcerative colitis. Another gene from our collection is helping us address the long-standing question of how cells supervise the biphasic release propensity of secretory granules. | | | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Biotic interactions and abiotic factors (such as climatic and edaphic conditions) jointly drive ecosystem patterns and processes. At the same time, biotic interactions are influenced by and can influence abiotic factors. Therefore, predicting ecosystem responses to ongoing global changes including the decline in biodiversity and climate-change requires understanding how biotic and abiotic factors interactively affect ecosystem patterns and processes. In this talk, I will discuss some findings from my PhD research wherein I examined how herbivores and pathogens affect grassland responses to global environmental changes. In particular, first I will discuss how fungal pathogens that are often overlooked in grassland ecosystems shape the vegetation community and ecosystem functions. Second, I will share findings from a climate-change experiment in Asian highlands and how herbivores affect grassland responses to climatic changes. Next, I will discuss some upcoming work that builds upon these studies as well as other new research directions. The first of these studies, in collaboration with a national grassland research network, will examine the role that insect herbivores and foliar fungal pathogens play in structuring grasslands across a range of environmental conditions. The second study will examine how declining snowfall, which drives primary productivity in high-altitude grasslands, affects vegetation dynamics and nutrient cycling processes. Finally, I will share ideas for a new research direction in which I will examine some of these questions using theoretical models. Specifically, I will explore how incorporating nutrient recycling due to biotic interactions in existing biodiversity theory affects ecosystem scale patterns over ecological and evolutionary time scales. 02:30 PM, Tuesday, Sep 13, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Thesis Seminar by Ms Sreeja K Dhanya on 'Role of STIM1 in regulating gene expression and synaptic components in mouse Purkinje neurons' 11:00 AM, Wednesday, Sep 14, 2022 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterThesis Seminar by Ms Keerti R Yadav on 'How does Sandercyanin fine-tune a ubiquitous chromophore Biliverdin IX ?' 06:00 PM, Wednesday, Sep 14, 2022 Remote VCThesis by Ms G-protein coupled PLC signaling in vivo' 10:15 AM, Thursday, Sep 15, 2022 | Remote VCSeminar by Prof Iswar K.
