When I found out he had been a college professor, I asked him what he taught. After a pensive pause, where he reflected on his teach- ing life, he looked at me sadly and answered, \"In retrospect, not a heck of a lot.\" After some 30 years as a family doctor, I of- ten wonder what my legacy will be. Have I made a difference in my patients' lives? I must admit that I am often rushed and spend less time with patients than I would like. This is complicated by my incessant need to be on time, which is one symptom of my obsessive-compulsive per- sonality. I also get irritable at times and have a hard time hiding this fact. So, do I help people, or do they stay with me because they don't re-ally have another choice? Is there some way of measuring a career as a family physician?There are websites such as Rate Your MD, but most individuals only post there if they have strong feelings one way or the other. As a rule, since there is no court of appeal, I don't visit these sites. However, my patients and family members will tell me what people have posted: one guy gave me terrible scores in all categories except for punctuality. He had to ad- mit that even though I am a terrible physician I am usually on time. So back to my question: how do most of my patients feel about me and the service I provide? I have taken care of many of them and their families for decades, but maybe they don't have another choice due to the shortage of family Contemplating legacies physicians. I think of many of them as my friends and care deeply about their health and happiness, but I wonder if this shows? Do they realize how much their life issues affect me? Is this caring reciprocated? The answers to these questions came to light recently due to my wife's illness and my sudden absence from my prac- tice. Initially my patients were told I was away for personal reasons, but as time went on, I gave the okay for my staff to let them know that my wife is unwell. My col- leagues have been exceptional and have covered most of my office shifts, but I have had to work some days because vacations were scheduled and locums already spoken for.Is there some way of measuring a career as a family physician?318 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021318At this moment in time, it feels like we are over the worst of it. I say that with more than a modicum of cau- tion. It feels that way, at least, as we enjoy the brief but beautiful summer that we are expe-riencing in BC this year. (You will be reading this as the rain and wind howl at your window, with the summer of 2021 in your proverbial rearview mirror.) This summer felt better to me than the one we had last year. It wasn't only the blue skies and warm temperatures, or the absence of rain (a side note: emigrating to Canada from a warmer climate precludes me from ever complaining about the heat here). It wasn't only my recently found insouciance (another side note: I recent- ly discovered that word; you francophones will know that it means free from worry). It isn't only thanks to having some special people in my life. I believe that many of us are starting to feel that we have more freedom. Following our Annus (and a half ) horri- bilis, we are carefully making social contact with one another again and starting to do the things that we used to take for granted. This weekend, my family, friends, and I attended a beautiful wedding, which is something I have not done in a long time. My partner and I have booked tickets to see a Broadway show toward the middle of next year. I am looking forward to seeing my brother and his wife, both of whom are double vaccinated, who are visiting this month from outside of Canada. Therein lies the crux of the issue. Double vaccination. It would be preferable for every- one on the planet to be double vaccinated sooner rather than later. I ask all my patients about their vaccination status and debate the Passport to post-pandemia (2 August 2021) issue patiently with those who have chosen to remain unvaccinated. I accept that vac- cination remains a choice but am neverthe- less frustrated, like the rest of you, that some people are choosing to remain unvaccinated. We have all heard the made-up fearmonger- ing myths that they choose to believe. Eye roll, please. While working at a vaccine clinic recently, I reassured some people, tongue in cheek, that the vaccine they were receiving did not in fact have microchips in it. I firmly believe that all governments need to agree on the concept of vaccine passports. It would be preferable for people who wish to travel across provincial and national borders to be required to show proof of their double vaccination sta- tus. The only exception to that would be chil- dren who are too young to be vaccinated, and the very few people who have a valid medical reason to remain unvaccinated. The vaccine passports need to be secure in order to prevent fraud, and private to prevent tracking. I have heard the argument from the privacy camp, who believe that a vaccine passport is an in- vasion of their privacy. I assume those same people use cellphones, which already track everything about them. The cellphone com- panies, Internet providers, and smartphone app providers already know a lot about us. Although we don't like it, that is the reality of the world in which we live. And privacy is not absolute. Many of us have had calls from Public Health after a patient tested positive for a reportable com- municable disease. The appropriate people are mobilized to gather that patient's private information in order to protect others from Editorials The outpouring of support and genuine caring that I received during these times has brought me to tears on more than one occa- sion. Some of my patients have also had tears in their eyes while relating how sorry they are to hear about my wife's situation. Cards, flow- ers, and casseroles have appeared on a regular basis. The love and caring I have felt has filled and sustained me when I have been close to empty and overcome by sadness. Many of my patients shared that they've never forgotten how much my caring meant to them when they were faced with adversity and life's challenges. They wanted to give a little something back as a sign of appreciation for the job I have done and the relationship we have built. This is a legacy I can live with. n \u2014David R.

Continued on page 320319 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021319 prEsidEnt's commEnt Physician health and wellness is about to get a whole lot more robust I made a private commitment to myself as I took on the Doctors of BC presidency in the middle of the pandemic: I wanted to do everything in my power to make sure that every one of us saw it through safely to the end. My main fear was not casualties from COVID-19; instead, I feared burnout, fatigue, mental health issues, and substance use would take their toll. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, phy- sician wellness was an issue requiring atten- tion and support. With the added stressors on physicians and their families during the past 18 months, the need has increased exponentially. Since 2019, BC's Physician Health Program (PHP) has seen a 58% increase in the number of physicians seeking help and a 37% increase in case complexity. In a recent sample of acute care physicians in BC, colleague Dr Nadia Khan found burnout rates as high as 71% in women and 64% in men. And a recent Ontario Medical Association survey found that 74% of physi- cians and trainees are experiencing at least some degree of burnout. In October 2020, the Canadian Medical As- sociation announced the Physician Wellness+ Initiative, which directs funds to address the health and wellness needs of physicians and medical trainees across the country. Included in this distribution of funds, Doctors of BC's PHP was allocated $1 million over 4 years to identify gaps in existing wellness services, to enhance or develop new services and programs to address those gaps, and to ensure future needs are met. The PHP , in partnership with and with additional funding from the Joint Collaborative Committees, will focus on physician health and wellness and develop a number of programs to assist BC's doctors at local, regional, and provincial levels.Physician wellness network We know that reducing burnout and supporting physician wellness are essential, so the physician wellness network will offer ongoing oppor- tunities for communication, networking, and collaborative gatherings for doctors involved with MSAs, divisions, public health, and UBC's resident doctors, among others, to share ideas, successes, and challenges, and to strategically align activities that support physician wellness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skills training So that physicians can better support their pa- tients with mild to moderate mental health issues and use CBT skills for self-care and to communicate with colleagues and within teams, the Shared Care Committee will be offering a CBT skills training program over a period of 8 weeks plus 2 half-days. When the PHP piloted a physician-specific cohort in the fall of 2020, it was so popular that more than 170 physicians expressed interest, despite there being only 15 spots available. Physician peer support network Given the abundance of literature that shows the effectiveness of physician peer support to foster a caring medical community and cul- ture where physicians feel at ease seeking and offering help, the PHP will be training physi- cians across the province to deliver one-to-one emotional peer support. A consultation with local divisions, MSAs, and other physician or- ganizations is taking place to help determine the best approach. Expansion of PHP family doctor connection service It's not just our patients who deserve their own family doctor; physicians do as well. The PHP will be engaging with divisions of family prac- tice to increase the capacity to attach physicians to their own personal primary care provider. The CBT and peer support programs are in the early stages of planning and development, and prototyping is intended to start this fall. I will not pretend that these initiatives on their own will restore our health and wellness. I have heard from many colleagues about the systemic problems, under-resourcing, under - staffing, increasing complexity, and heavy bur-dens placed upon you. I experience these too. However, by making physician health and wellness a top priority, we shine a light on an important issue, we make systemic changes possible, and we start to tackle intangibles such as toxic workplace cultures that contribute to burnout, fatigue, and distress. By putting a greater emphasis on our own wellness needs, we also set an example for our patients and society. And what of my commitment that we all make it through to the end? We have indeed lost some colleagues along the way, though none Since 2019, BC's Physician Health Program has seen a 58% increase in the number of physicians seeking help320 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021320prEsidEnt's commEnt the spread of that communicable disease. When other people's lives and health are at stake, personal privacy needs to take second place to public safety. A person can choose to live off the grid and lose out on the conveniences afforded to those of us who choose to use cellphones and the Internet. Likewise, a person can choose to remain unvaccinated, but then they should lose out on certain freedoms (such as cross-border travel) that should be afforded only to those of us who have chosen to be vaccinated. n \u2014David B. Chapman, MBChBwere physicians who contracted COVID-19 in the line of duty. The factors contributing to these losses are complex, but I would like to think they also galvanize us to make things better. I am bolstered by the news that we have welcomed many new colleagues into our profession; the number of BC doctors has actually grown during the pandemic. People have joined us from different provinces and different countries; they are from different backgrounds and have many different experi - ences. They bring with them valuable ideas, innovations, and an abundance of energy that can only contribute to the value of our BC physician community. n \u2014Matthew C. Chow, MD Doctors of BC President Dr. Rashaad Bhyat, Clinician Leader at Canada Health Infoway, shares his perspective on how e-prescribing modernizes the prescription process and enhances patient safety, benefiting patients, physicians and pharmacists alike. What is one of the most common issues brought on by handwritten prescriptions that can hinder the prescription process? One of the main challenges with handwritten prescriptions is a notion that many physicians, pharmacists and patients will be familiar with, given it is firmly embedded in popular culture: handwritten prescriptions can lend themselves to misinterpretations due to illegible handwriting. Given their demanding schedules, physicians have to write prescriptions as swiftly as possible, which can sometimes lead to an indecipherable scrawl. This can result in considerable back and forth between physicians and pharmacists to de - termine the intent of the prescription, culminating in delays for patients to receive the medication and care they need. How can e-prescribing factor into improv - ing quality of care for patients? In our daily lives, we benefit from doing so many things digitally, be it our shopping, our banking or our work. Meanwhile, interacting with the health care system in a digital way has not always been so straightforward for patients, physicians and pharmacists alike. e-Prescribing services like PrescribeIT\u00ae modernize the prescription process by enabling physicians to electronically transmit a prescription directly from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to the pharmacy management sys - tem of a patient's pharmacy of choice. This reduc - es the risk of illegible prescriptions, transcription errors, and back and forth between physicians and pharmacists, streamlining the prescription process and making medication available to patients in a safer and more timely manner. What role does e-prescribing play in improving efficiencies for physicians and pharmacists to enhance patient safety? The biggest risk to patient safety as it relates to prescriptions often comes down to communi- cation. Streamlining communications within a patient's circle of care is vital to ensure patient safety and also creates efficiencies for both physicians and pharmacists. PrescribeIT\u00ae offers the ability for physicians and pharmacists to send secure clinical communication to each other through an integrated messaging tool, permitting them to quickly align on an appropriate course of action and provide the best medication options for their patients. For instance, during a recent interaction with one of my patients, I created a prescription that was sent to a pharmacy without PrescribeIT\u00ae. The pharmacy subsequently left me a voicemail flag - ging a drug-drug interaction: a conflict between the medication I had prescribed and another one of the patients' prescriptions, that could cause the medication to be less effective. By the time I had listened to the voicemail, the pharmacy had closed for the evening. While I was able to connect with the pharmacy the following morning and adjust the prescription in time, this back and forth could have been avoided with the simple push of a button using PrescribeIT\u00ae's integrated messaging tool, allowing the patient to receive the medication they needed even sooner. What value does e-prescribing with services like PrescribeIT\u00ae offer during COVID-19?With in-person interactions carrying a much higher risk over the course of the pandemic, e-prescribing has proved itself not only to be convenient, but essential. e-Prescribing can be a significant asset when in-person visits with health care professionals are not possible or not recommended. e-Prescribing enables vulnerable populations to limit their time outside, thereby reducing their risk of infection, and prescribers who have been working remotely throughout the pandemic have also seen the value of e-prescribing, as many don't have fax machines in their homes.Beyond the pandemic, do you think e-pre- scribing is here to stay for the long-term?Absolutely. Over the course of the pandemic, we have seen a rapid and essential shift towards digital health solutions and virtual care, which constitutes any interaction between a patient and a health care provider that doesn't involve direct contact, such as video or phone appointments. According to a Canada Health Infoway survey, 51 per cent of patient-reported visits are now virtual, which is over double pre-pandemic levels. In tandem, we have passed an adoption tipping point for e-prescribing, with a critical mass of Canadian pharmacies and EMRs now on board, laying the foundation for a vast increase in use of the service. In Canada, PrescribeIT\u00ae now serves an estimated nine million patients across the country, with exciting plans to expand into British Columbia. The digital transformation occurring in the realm of health care is focused on improving safety, efficiency, convenience and quality of care for patients and physicians, and e-prescribing is a great example of exactly this. As we look beyond the pandemic, I think that this e-prescribing service will continue to play an essential role in modernizing how Canadians give and receive care. You might even say it is just what the doctor ordered. e-Prescribing is just what the doctor ordered to streamline the prescription process and improve quality of care for Canadians Visit prescribeit.ca to learn more about Canada's only national, not-for-profit e-prescribing service.*ADVERTISEMENT*Continued from page 318Editorials Follow us on Twitter for regular updates The BC Medical Journal provides continuing medical education through scientific research, review articles, and updates on contemporary clinical practice. #MedEd #COVID19Vaccine registry for #pregnant and #breastfeeding individuals in Canada.

It has been used in a variety of Indigenous-partnered research projects, but little information exists about two-Eyed s eeing approaches in medical research. A focused narra- tive review of peer-reviewed Western literature was conducted to identify principles of two-Eyed s ee- ing applications. Medline, Web of s cience, and CAB Direct were searched and papers that described two-Eyed s eeing approaches in Indigenous-part - nered research projects were selected for review. relationship building, community control, col- laborative data analysis, and results that fostered change were recognized as common principles for successful application of two-Eyed s eeing. Medi- cal researchers must be aware of relational and community-involved processes while conducting research with Indigenous communities. Background Indigenous knowledge is shaped by the envi- ronment and land. Emotional, spiritual, and physical relationships with the natural world influence traditions and customs.1 Ties to the Two-Eyed Seeing: Current approaches, and discussion of medical applications A review of which Indigenous health care themes are present in Western medical literature.

There are multiple Indigenous per- spectives on research, often relational, being in- clusive of people's experiences, spirituality, and culture. Western perspectives about research focus on interpretation of concrete facts and understanding the world, with little attention to emotional or spiritual realms.1 Two-Eyed Seeing developed from the teachings of Chief Charles Labrador of Aca- dia First Nation, but Mi'kmaw Elder Albert Marshall of the Eskasoni First Nation was the first to apply the concept of Two-Eyed Seeing in a Western setting.2 Specifically, Two-Eyed Seeing \"refers to learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both of these eyes together for the benefit of all.\"2 Elder Albert Marshall emphasizes that Two-Eyed Seeing requires groups to weave between each respec- tive way of knowing, as Indigenous knowledge may be more applicable than Western in certain situations and vice versa.2 It brings together two ways of knowing to allow a diverse group of people to use all understandings to improve the world. Originally developed as a grassroots pro- gram to encourage Mi'kmaq postsecondary stu- dents to pursue science education,2 Two-Eyed Seeing has since been used in research proj- ects with Indigenous people across a variety of disciplines, but applications vary between groups. Further, there is little information about Two-Eyed Seeing approaches in medical re- search. The aim of this article is to discover and review which Indigenous health care themes are present in Western medical literature.Methods We performed a focused narrative review of peer-reviewed literature using the following key concepts, as decided by consensus among the three authors: Indigenous people, imple- mentation science, and the Two-Eyed Seeing approach. Each key concept was a combination of search and MeSH terms to create search strings. (Refer to the Box on the following page for complete search strategies.) All searches had no restrictions on publication country or language. Sources used for this narrative review included Medline, Web of Science, and CAB Direct. Hand searches of the references of re-trieved literature were also conducted. Eight themes were identified from the literature: The need to declare author positionality. Communication of group interpretations and guiding principles. Relationship building. Inclusion of Indigenous advisory commit - tees and Knowledge Holders. Continued community guidance. Use of traditional knowledge gathering techniques. Collaborative community-involved data analysis and interpretation. Making meaningful and lasting relation - ships. Themes were described if the paper refer- enced Two-Eyed Seeing, Indigenous method- ologies, or community-based research in the abstract or title and the theme was presented in at least two papers identified in our search. We excluded all randomized control trials and studies with youth or children. 322 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021322Bcmd 2B Results and discussion Author positionality Author positionality statements are common practice for researchers working with Indig- enous communities.3-11 Author positionality statements are brief descriptions of a research- er's ancestry, who they are, and where they came from. They outline intent and situatedness. Re - searchers create a space for introductions and provide indications of the influence that the author's epistemology has on the study.10,12 Au- thor positionality can be described as the idea of \"research in relation\":12 researchers need to define their work in terms of personal experi-ences, families, and communities. It is the first step to building relationships and forming trust; the community will be able to understand the researcher's world view, beliefs, and values. Group interpretations and guiding principles When working with an Indigenous community, research groups described their interpretation of Two-Eyed Seeing.3-6,8-11,13-16 One group's interpretations led to the creation of princi- ples that guided their Two-Eyed Seeing ap - proach. The first authors from two studies used knowledge from their Indigenous ancestry to apply Two-Eyed Seeing.8,9 For example, An - ishinaabe Mino-Bimaadiziwin (\"Relationships tie us to everything\") guided the study design and procedures for an Indigenous researcher conducting research with a First Nation com-munity in Ontario. 8 Non-Indigenous authors also described their epistemology and how it influenced their interpretation of Two-Eyed Seeing.3,4 For example, one team defined the research group's collective understanding of the need for research, that colonialism is an under- lying cause of problematic substance abuse in Indigenous people, and that traditional culture is key to healing.4 The concept of the four Rs was discussed as a guiding principle in their application of Two-Eyed Seeing.5,8,10,11 The four Rs are respect, relevance, reciprocity, and responsibility; togeth- er, they are ethical considerations for research groups who work with Indigenous peoples.17 Respect reflects how researchers must create an environment where research is mutually empowering of both Indigenous and Western perspectives. Relevance describes research be- ing in line with the beliefs and priorities of the partnered community. Reciprocity is research that benefits both the Indigenous community and the research group. Responsibility is the necessity to privilege Indigenous voices and be supportive of Indigenous people's rights to self-determination. 17 Relationship building It is essential for research groups to establish relationships with partnering communities dur- ing the inception of a study.3-11,15,16 Participants from Indigenous health organizations in On- tario found that building trusting relationships and promoting respect for local knowledge were crucial steps in any successful partnership.15 Research groups developed relationships with Elders of the partnering communities.

Other groups would meet with community stakeholders and form relationships to under- stand community-identified goals and needs. This created collaborative partnerships and im- plementation of a research project that was im - portant to both the Indigenous community and the research group (reciprocity). Further, it was common to have members of the research group interact with the community outside of the re- search context, building safe and trustworthy relationships between people through ceremony and community activities.4,7,10 Other authors described the use of an ethical space,5,11,14,16 a concept that allows multiple ways of know - ing to co-exist. This theoretical space is where open discussions can occur. Groups may discuss their cultural practices and ways of knowing, bridging the research intentions, values, and assumptions of both groups.18 Ultimately, the goal of early relationship building was to de- velop trust, provide a safe space for both groups to explain their epistemology, and create a col- lective understanding of community needs and research needs. Indigenous advisory committee/ Knowledge Holders Creation of either an Indigenous advisory com - mittee or a group of Indigenous Knowledge Holders occurred at the beginning of some studies to provide cultural context and guid - ance.3-5,7-9,15 Committees consisted of com- munity members, representatives, Indigenous Knowledge Holders, and researchers. The com- mittees provided cultural support and guidance to partnered researchers and ensured traditional protocols were followed. In some cases, advisory committees were responsible for approving eth- ics protocols and procedures. It was common to have an Indigenous ethics board or advisory committee review the studies and provide their approval in addition to institutional ethics ap- provals from universities.3,5-11,14-16 Indigenous ethics boards were Indigenous university re- search ethics committees or ethics boards cre- ated by Indigenous organizations. Other groups did not create Indigenous advisory committees 323 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021323but used Indigenous Knowledge Holders who held the same responsibilities.6,10,11 Indigenous Knowledge Holders were chosen by the part- nered Indigenous community. These individuals were usually Elders, but occasionally they were select groups of respected Indigenous commu- nity members. Indigenous advisory committees or Knowledge Holders ensured the cultural context was reflected from project inception to result dissemination. Community guidance Continual community involvement was a defining feature of a Two-Eyed Seeing ap- proach.3-11,13-16 Indigenous community involve- ment centred on ensuring research groups were accountable and collaborative with the partner- ing community. Accountability was described as everything from involving the partnering In- digenous community in developing the research question to sharing results,8 while collaboration was defined as providing a safe space for dis- cussion and removing any power imbalances or biases.10,13,14 Community involvement included community control over study design and fre- quent discussions with the research group to ensure the study aligned with community val- ues, needs, and protocols. It was evident that research groups must acknowledge and respect inclusion of partnering community members' knowledge and be ready to engage in conver-sations regarding the virtues and values of the research. These discussions highlight the project outcomes each partner expects and, more im-portantly, ensure community preferences lead the research. 16 It was expected to see Elders influence study design. For instance, Elders suggested the use of certain qualitative methods, knowing that local approaches (within doing) not only resonate Bcmd 2B with community members, but also demonstrate sharing of ideas and power within a Two-Eyed Seeing approach.16 Other communities intro- duced their specific and relevant ideas to the research groups, helping promote community beliefs and values.4 For example, the concept of knowledge gardening (seeding, nurturing, and growing information) was important to over- come the limitations of Western research-grant time frames and to create a culturally rooted analysis, which resonated with the partnering communities' cultural views. 2 Traditional techniques Research groups often used particular ways to gather traditional knowledge when work - ing with Indigenous communities. Sharing circles were the most frequently used knowl- edge gathering method.4,6-9 Sharing circles are an Indigenous healing tool that differ from Sharing circles emphasize problem solving and are intended to provide an opportunity for emotional openness and disclosure of feelings. 324 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021324group discussions or focus groups as they have sacred meanings in many Indigenous cultures.6 Guided by a facilitator with Indigenous knowl- edge, all participants in the circle are viewed as equal, with their information, spirituality, and emotionality shared between circle members. Sharing circles emphasize problem solving and are intended to provide an opportunity for emotional openness and disclosure of feel- ings. Sharing circles used in the studies were accompanied by cultural practices: prayers, El- der support, passage of sacred herbs, smudg- ing, and the use of drums and songs.4,6-9 Other studies used Western interviewing techniques, such as individual semi-structured interviews, but used traditional knowledge to influence the interviews.3,11 For instance, two authors used a traditional Anishinaabe symbol-based approach to include reflections in their study, one as part of their semi-structured interview,3 the other as part of their sharing circles.6 This type of Indigenous circle ceremony offered par - ticipants time to reflect on a concept, such as their personal identity or community strengths, and then choose a symbol that represented the concept to them. This process is spiritual, and participants could present their symbol to the group, providing a space for reflection of the chosen concept. Reciprocity, one of the four Rs, is present in multiple aspects of traditional knowledge gathering.4-8,11,15 Reciprocity included providing participants space to share their stories. Re- searchers were able to better understand and be- gin to develop a Two-Eyed Seeing perspective by listening to Indigenous community members' personal experiences. Participants' stories were presented to communities to encourage motiva- tion for health and wellness change. Reciproc - ity is also culturally and ethically necessary, as a protocol, to acknowledge participant con- tributions; the acknowledgments can be gifts or scared medicines like tobacco or monetary honorariums.15 Thus, groups often provided participants with gifts to honor the sharing of their knowledge and their time spent meeting together. The community provided reciprocity to the research group in the form of ceremonies, prayers for their wellness, and sacred foods. Bcmd2 B Learning from a Two-Eyed Seeing approach (community data analysis) Unlike Western data analysis research prac- tices, a Two-Eyed Seeing approach emphasizes community and participant involvement.3,4,6-11 Elders and Indigenous advisory committees frequently guided data analysis. They provided a cultural context to ensure the information generated was helpful to the community and the data were not misinterpreted to benefit the researcher's agenda.3,4,6-11 Ethical research processes ensured the infor- mation gathered through discussions in sharing circles was not misinterpreted by providing opportunities for sharing-circle participants to review the analyzed data and provide feed- back.3,6-10 Research groups were expected to initiate and validate stories told in sharing cir- cles, as stated in community-created protocols. Researchers analyzed recordings of interviews and presented summaries to participants dur- ing meetings, which provided opportunities for participants to change or add to their stories. As well, according to doing research with Indige- nous communities and protection of intellectual property, researchers must verify all generated knowledge with the partnered communities before it is released to the research group.10 It is common for traditional knowledge to be misunderstood or taken out of context and for it to lose its original meaning. Further, researchers are responsible to give ownership of all knowl- edge generated from a study to the partnered community and to ask for permission about how, when, and with whom they may share the knowledge, as well as permission for any future use of the knowledge in papers or presenta- tions.10 As the Indigenous community owns all generated knowledge, it is their decision what happens to the knowledge, from storage to destruction. Since partner communities own the knowledge shared and generated through research, research groups cannot prevent revi-sions or destruction of already generated data if the priorities of the community change. 10 Making meaningful and lasting relationships Two-Eyed Seeing approaches place importance on proper knowledge dissemination and con-tinuation of relationships with the partnering communities.6-8,15,16 Historically, research in- volving Indigenous communities followed a helicopter approach: arrival, data collection, and departure,8 taking information away from the community without honoring a four-Rs approach. Communities had no idea what the collected data was used for, by whom, for what purposes, or the research group's interpretations. Two-Eyed Seeing approaches emphasize shar - ing the final report with the community and presenting findings in a meaningful way so the information is beneficial to making a change within the community.7,8 Further, knowledge gathered from Indigenous research should allow for the collective story of the Indigenous com- munity to be presented with Indigenous people involved, to ensure Indigenous knowledge is not altered or conformed to Western ways of thinking. Groups are accountable throughout the research process to ensuring the initial com- munity needs and cultural values agreed on dur- ing development of the project remain present through the whole process. This can be accom - plished through community-led projects.4,10 All studies described how research teams should expect to continue their relationships with the community after the project is done. Some authors suggested that the relationships with the partnering community should extend beyond the final report and become a lifelong commitment.6 Long-term relationships reflect the respect and responsibility components of the four Rs, as research groups must continue to support partnered Indigenous communities (re- sponsibility) and continue to help empower the community (respect). Further, Two-Eyed Seeing places importance on relationship building\u2014a relationship that is not confined to study time- lines. After completion of the study, research groups should set up systems with the partnered community to remain accountable to and reach- able by community partners. Two-Eyed Seeing within medical research Medical research groups that are partnered with Indigenous communities can incorporate all eight themes to create a collaborative research process that ensures successful relationships. The first step is for the research group to form a re- lationship with the Indigenous community and begin the trust-building process. Each research 325 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021325group member must provide an in-person po- sitionality statement describing who they are, where they came from, and their ancestry. Re- search groups will also need to spend time with the community outside of research activities, developing trusting and respectful relation- ships. To guide the study, the research team and Indigenous community must define their interpretation of Two-Eyed Seeing and the principles that resonate with each partner. This is a collaborative process, one in which power imbalances are removed and there is respect for everyone's opinions, perspectives, values, and beliefs. Continual community involvement and the creation of an Indigenous Advisory Com-mittee are essential. Research groups will not usually have knowledge of traditional practices or beliefs. Advisory committees provide cultural context and ensure community input is heard and local protocols adhered to. Further, research groups are expected to listen to community members outside of the advisory committee. It is imperative for Elders to speak directly with researchers to provide input and guide the study. Researchers should be aware of traditional knowledge gathering and cultural practices. Successful studies will either use traditional knowledge gathering methods or merge them with Western qualitative methods, as it creates a culturally safe study\u2014for instance, the use of sharing circles as a qualitative method when interviewing Indigenous community members instead of Western focus groups. Study par- ticipants should be given the chance to review collected data to ensure validity and that their stories were not altered. Finally, research groups need to ensure study findings are disseminated back to the community in a meaningful way and set up methods for lasting relationships with the community. Conclusion This narrative review provides an overview on perspectives and application of a Two-Eyed Seeing approach when working with Indig - enous communities. Two-Eyed Seeing brings together Indigenous and Western world views. The guiding principles of Two-Eyed Seeing, as it relates to research, revolve around relation- ships and the four Rs. Clear principles have been highlighted, which emphasize relationship building; equal power balances in the partner- ship; and research that is culturally safe, re- spectful, and reflective of Indigenous values and self-determination. While there is still a relative lack of published literature on Two-Eyed See- ing in research studies, the common principles found in this review can provide a starting point for future researchers to begin to understand Two-Eyed Seeing. However, a Two-Eyed See- ing approach cannot be generalized or for- mulated. This approach will be unique to the Indigenous community based on their beliefs, cultural traditions, collective knowledge system, and relationship with research group partners. Ultimately, research groups need to understand that research with Indigenous populations re- quires taking time to create a trusted, respectful, and ethical friendship in which problems can be identified and approached together, rather than based on a Western view of researchers coming into a community to solve their prob-lems for them. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Pre- habilitation before major surgery can lead to a faster recovery, better patient experiences and outcomes, and savings for the health care sys-tem. Best practices for surgical prehabilitation focus on both mental and physical aspects of surgery by decreasing presurgical risk factors and increasing a patient's functional capacity. In BC, the Specialist Services Committee and the Shared Care Committee support an innovative provincial program that is improving patients' readiness for and outcomes after elec- tive surgeries. Launched in 2019, the Surgical Patient Optimization Collaborative (SPOC) improves the experience for surgical patients by: Using a patient-centred and multidisci - plinary approach. Supporting care providers to implement change processes. Using preoperative surgical wait times. Integrating available community resources. Improving patient outcomes. Sites are supported to implement prehabili- tation programs using the Institute for Health- care Improvement's (IHI) Breakthrough Series Collaborative Model.1 With this model, SPOC provides participating teams with: 18 months of interactive learning sessions and action periods. Evidence-based and expert-reviewed tools and strategies in 13 clinical components. Funding and support for physicians and multidisciplinary team members. Quality improvement coaching, including guidance on data collection.Collaboration transforms delivery of care for surgical patients This article was submitted by the Specialist Services Committee and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board. In-person connections to other teams to learn from each other and from recognized experts. Improved patient outcomes and experience Access to appropriate information for patients and families to prepare for surgery significantly impacts their experience and recovery. For ex- ample, patients have a greater awareness of how important being healthy is for recovery and a better understanding of their role in influenc- ing health outcomes. Meanwhile, families have a lesser caregiver burden or need less time to devote to post-op care. To date, over 5200 patients were screened for more than 18 000 clinical components. Over 95% of patients were successfully prehabilitated for at least one clinical component. Data2 show that prior to surgery: 42% of patients improved their nutritional status. 80% of diabetic patients had their glycemic control assessed prior to surgery, and then decreased or maintained Hb A1C levels. 84% of patients increased physical activity. 79% of smoking patients decreased or stopped smoking. 86% of anemic patients increased their he- moglobin levels.And after surgery: 91% of patients reported an improved sur- gical experience. 86% of patients reported an improved sur- gical outcome. Enriched provider experiences Over 100 health care providers have imple- mented prehabilitation work in 14 sites/teams across the province. Surgeons, family doctors, and anesthesiologists collaborate with medical office assistants, preassessment clinic nurses, nurse navigators, site executives, and project managers to develop and sustain prehabilitation processes. This work includes regular collec- tion and review of data, which is used to guide adjustments to plans and workflows. This has contributed to an increase in the number of patients screened. Interdisciplinary collaboration is increas- ing job satisfaction for physicians and team members, with 94% of SPOC physicians re- porting improved provider experiences.

Optimizing your disability and professional expense insurance When did you last review your disability and professional expense insurance needs? It's rec- ommended that you review your coverage with a Doctors of BC insurance advisor 1 year after starting a practice and 2 years thereafter. If you have the Guaranteed Insurability Benefit (GIB) rider on your Doctors of BC Professional Expense Insurance (PEI) or Dis- ability INCOMEprotect for practising physi- cians, you may increase your coverage without medical questions each November. Disability insurance Disability insurance provides monthly tax-free income if you're unable to work due to accident or illness. It's important to maximize your dis- ability coverage, as 1) you could be disabled for a long period and disability benefits may be your only source of income, 2) the medical costs associated with a disability can be unex- pectedly high, and 3) some of your disability benefits should be designated for retirement savings, since benefits end at age 65. Insurers limit the amount of tax-free dis- ability coverage you can purchase based on your net income (gross earnings less business expenses, excluding personal salary, dividends, and income tax). These limits are designed to ensure that claimants are not earning more from benefits than they were earning while employed. Depending on your income, the insurer may offer maximum coverage of 30% to 40% of your net income. The BC government-paid Physicians' Dis - ability Insurance (PDI) can help maximize the benefits available to a physician during a disability. PDI typically pays up to $6100 of monthly tax-free disability benefits for physi-cians earning eligible MSP income. PDI will reduce benefits if the claimant's total disability benefits from all sources are greater than 60% of predisability net income (after expenses but before income or corporation tax). This is an important factor in determining how much additional disability you should have. For ex-ample, if you earn $250 000 net income and are eligible for $6100 of PDI, you should have up to $6400 of additional personally paid dis- ability. In this example, any additional cover- age beyond $6400 will reduce PDI benefits, to information technology and communica- tion platforms and time for clinical follow-up, as well as shortages in workforce, space, and equipment. Reduced system costs Surgical patient prehabilitation increases ef- ficiency of the health care system by better preparing patients for surgery, resulting in fewer adverse events and shorter hospital stays. In its first 2 years, SPOC has: Led to average net savings of approxi - mately $2175 per arthroplasty patient and $7500 per colorectal patient. - 74% of the arthroplasty surgery sav - ings and 55% of the colorectal surgery savings were due to a shorter surgical length of stay (LOS). - 37% of the colorectal surgery savings were due to a reduction in the rate of postsurgery surgical site infection. Shortened LOS for optimized patients by 28% for arthroplasty surgery and by 45% for colorectal surgery. Spread and sustainability SPOC is continuing to expand to more sites across the province, including through teams working with primary care networks and by offering a second cohort of teams.

Each situation is different; you are encouraged to speak with a Doctors of BC insurance advisor about your personal situation. Professional expense insurance As costs of managing your practice increase, ensure your PEI coverage increases as well. PEI provides reimbursement of professional and business clinic expenses, including member- ship dues, accounting fees, liability insurance, office rent, and staff salaries. Note that spousal salaries for income-splitting purposes are not considered a reimbursable expense. If your PEI amount is inadequate, you may have to use your personal savings or disability payments to help fund your professional expense obligations dur- ing a disability.

Innovative coating for blood vessels reduces rejection of transplanted organs Researchers at UBC have found a way to reduce organ rejection following a transplant by using a polymer to coat blood vessels on the organ to be transplanted. The polymer substantially diminished rejection of transplants in mice when tested by collaborators at SFU and Northwestern University. The polymer was developed by UBC pathology and laboratory medicine professor Dr Jayachandran Kizhakkedathu and his team at the Centre for Blood Research and the Life Sciences Institute. The findings were published recently in Nature Biomedical Engineering (www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00777-y). The discovery has the potential to eliminate the need for drugs on which transplant recipients rely to prevent their immune system from attacking a new organ as a foreign object. Dr Kizhakkedathu explained that blood vessels in organs are protected with a coating that suppresses the immune system's reaction, but in the process of procuring organs for transplantation, the coating is damaged and no longer able to transmit the message. Dr Kizhakkedathu's team synthesized a polymer and developed a chemical process for applying it to blood vessels. He worked with UBC chemistry professor Dr Stephen Withers and the study's co-lead authors, PhD candidate Daniel Luo and recent chemistry PhD Dr Erika Siren. The procedure has been applied only to blood vessels and kidneys in mice so far, but researchers are optimistic it could work equally well on lungs, hearts, and other organs. Clinical trials in humans could be several years away. The research was supported by CIHR, NSERC, UBC, SFU, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, GlycoNet, and the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research.330 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021330 CliniC al ABstr ACt: rapid growth in regional population puts an incredible strain on health care resources.

In response, the Ministry of Health designed and built a stand-alone, dedicated outpatient and surgery facility\u2014the Jim Pattison Outpatient Care and Surgery Centre ( JPOCSC). One of the main goals of the facility is to provide ambulatory surgical services to help alleviate demand on hospital operating rooms and expand overall surgical capacity in Fraser Health. The centre received significant public funding, but donor funding from the Surrey Hospitals Founda- tion, private donors, and ultimately Mr Jim Pattison accounted for a portion of the equip- ment costs. Many studies have examined the key attri- butes of successful day-care surgery programs2-4 and have helped define patient health cutoffs for BMI, age, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) level, and other variables. Enhanced recovery after surgery initiatives have greatly improved outpatient success,5-7 and most sur- gical specialties have tried to identify those procedures that can be safely performed in a day-care surgery setting.8-14 Most larger stud- ies2,15 have focused on one surgical specialty. Recent anesthesia focus has been on the effect of obstructive sleep apnea on day-care surgery success rates.16 While studies have been con- ducted outside Canada,17-19 there have been no recent reviews of large day-care surgery centres in this country. In addition, most stand-alone surgical facilities in Canada are privately built and operated, which can lead to patient selec-tion bias. In any ambulatory surgery centre, program- ming to prevent and reduce complications that require patient transfer to a higher level of care or hospital admission is essential. Once those factors have been identified, it is also impor- tant to compare local results with national or international averages. JPOCSC submits data to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database and uses it as a source of quality control.

We also set out to demonstrate the viability of large, stand-alone, publicly run day-care surgery centres within the Canadian health care system. Methods All patients who underwent surgical procedures at JPOCSC from 1 January 2016 to 31 De- cember 2017, including those who had a pro- cedure with general anesthesia in a full-service operating theatre, were included in our study. Procedures performed in minor theatres that did not require general anesthesia were not included. All patients who required transfer to the lo- cal tertiary care centre prior to discharge were identified, and their charts were reviewed to determine the most likely reason for transfer. We then categorized each transfer case by the most likely source of complication, as follows: surgical, medical, anesthesia, patient selection, and process (institutional). In cases where more than one factor was identified, only the most significant was categorized, as determined by a group consisting of a nurse, anesthetist, and surgeon. For example, if a patient had signifi- cant postoperative pain and required cardiac monitoring, the cardiac issue was determined to be the more significant reason for transfer. All transfer cases involved patients who could not be discharged home for any reason; they did not include patients who were discharged and readmitted at a later date. We also reviewed the readmission rate with- in 1 week of discharge to capture any outliers. These data were further subdivided by surgical subspecialty. Finally, NSQIP data for the same time pe- riod20 as our study were used as a benchmark for comparing our results to the national average. Results During the 2-year study period, 11 728 proce- dures were conducted at the JPOCSC. Table 1 lists the most commonly performed procedures according to surgical discipline. In total, 140 cases required transfer to the local tertiary care hospital.332 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021332clinical Canada's largest purpose-built public day-care surgery centre Over the 2-year period, the discharge rate was 98.81%, and the transfer rate was 1.19%. Annual transfer rates were similar: 1.24% in the first year; 1.16% in the second year. The average number of ambulatory surger- ies performed per month at JPOCSC over the 2-year period was 488 (range 398-627) [Fig- ure 1]. The average number of transfers per month was 5.8 (range 2-10) [Figure 2]. The transfer rate per month [Figure 3] refers to the number of transfers as a percentage of total case number. It ranged from 0.35% to 2.22%, with the average rate for all dates of 1.19%. The categories most commonly associated with transfers over the 2-year period were an- esthesia (44.3% [62/140]) and surgical were responsible for 7.9% (11/140) of all transfers, while medical and patient selection factors led to 5.7% (8/140) and 4.3% (6/140) of all trans-fers, respectively. We also examined the total number of trans- fers per surgical discipline [Table 3]. In both years of the study, most transfers were associated with general surgery and plastic surgery. Retinal surgery was the only category not associated with transfers in either year. Most unplanned readmissions occurred in the first 48 hours following discharge after sur- gery. The overall readmission rate was 1.81% for all surgical disciplines over the 2 years [Table 4]. The highest readmission rates were associated with urology, general surgery, orthopaedics, and ear, nose, and throat. Discussion Surgery continues to evolve to try to create less invasive, safer, and more expedient pro- cedures. In addition, increasing numbers of procedures that once required lengthy inpatient stays have been switched to day-care surgery procedures.7,8,11-15 This has resulted in benefits such as reduced nosocomial infections and re-duced costs. There are many private surgical facilities in Canada that have been built predominantly to provide noninsured services, such as cosmetic surgery, or surgery covered outside the stan- dard provincial health care systems.

This limits the number of patients who can receive surgery at an outpatient facility. Our review included all procedures per- formed in a full-service operating room with general anesthesia and cases, such as spinal cases or regional cases, where anesthesia was present; therefore, cases such as routine gastroscopy, colonoscopy, vasectomy, minor skin surgery, and minor hand surgery were not included. These procedures, performed with local anesthetic with or without quick reversal sedation, are widely accepted outpatient procedures. In ad- dition, other procedures commonly performed on an outpatient basis, such as cataract surgery, are not performed at the JPOCSC. All patients were ASA 1 or 2 except vascular-access patients and patients with pacemakers who could be ASA 3 as well. A BMI limit of 45 was used, and patients with a significant history of obstructive sleep apnea or anesthetic complications are not permitted to have surgery at JPOCSC. Because operating room access at both JPOCSC and the tertiary care hospital is tied to the same al- location algorithm, many patients who would qualify for surgery at JPOCSC received their care at the tertiary care hospital to expedite access. Therefore, most day-care surgeries, re- gardless of location, received care from the same surgeon and anesthetic team. When JPOCSC was created, the regional hospital's criteria for day-care surgery were ad- opted because JPOCSC's size and scope made it possible to treat more complex patients, and its close tie to the hospital made transfers easier, without refusal. The overall intent was to not limit the cases that would be conducted on an outpatient basis at one facility versus the other. There can be a significant difference in the same-day discharge rate of a day-care surgi- cal centre versus that of a hospital. Our team identified a significantly higher same-day dis- charge rate for an outpatient centre compared to that of a hospital when all other variables were TABlE 2.

The discharge rate at the local tertiary care hospital matched that reported by a different group in another province22 for the same procedures, which further shows institutional bias when admission is a much simpler process. Therefore, a stand-alone outpatient centre has a greater chance of optimizing same-day discharge on a routine basis. JPOCSC was opened to provide ambulatory day-care surgery to reduce volumes in the main hospital operating rooms and increase overall surgical capacity in Fraser Health. Since the surgeries performed can be relatively complex for day-care surgery, often beyond the scope of most free-standing ambulatory centres, it is important to continuously monitor the trans- fer rate from JPOCSC to a higher level of care and to compare the rate to that of similar institutions. We determined that for the 11 728 surger- ies performed over the 2-year period in this study, the unplanned transfer rate was 1.19%. This is similar to results in a report produced by multiple ambulatory surgery centres in the United States in 2017.20 That study included 1499 ambulatory centres and 1 749 059 surger- ies. The rate of hospital transfer and admission was 1.01%. Our transfer rate was within the middle 50th percentile for all centres. We used the NSQIP data because ambulatory centres are much more common in the United States; therefore, a larger database of comparative result was available. Our transfer rate also declined from 1.24% to 1.16% between the first and sec- ond years of study, even though more surgeries were performed in the second year. The low number of transfers in our study and others suggests that ambulatory centres do not need to be immediately adjacent to a larger hospital. This can allow health authorities and governments to choose locations closer to new centres of population growth to improve resource distribution. Paramount to determining the viability of successful outpatient discharge is the review of unplanned readmission within a specific period following surgery. Our overall rate of readmission within the first week following sur- gery was 1.81% for all surgical disciplines. This rate was within the NSQIP mid-50th percentile for similar centres over the same time period.20 For all cases, readmission was due to surgical complications such as hematoma or surgical site infection. In our review of readmissions, combined general surgery and plastic surgery breast reconstruction cases were placed in the plastic surgery group. This readmission rate is similar to the rate recorded at the regional hos- pital for similar cases, and is within the NSQIP average range. In this study, the cause that was most likely responsible for patient transfer was examined. All reasons for transfer were then grouped into surgical, medical, anesthetic, institutional, and patient selection categories. The categories naturally had some crossover between groups. It is very difficult to isolate pain into either the anesthetic or surgical categories. This is- sue has been brought before both disciplines at JPOCSC for review. For simplification, we included postoperative pain under anesthesia. Each case transferred from JPOCSC is pre- sented to each member of the patient care path- way and is reviewed at divisional morbidity and mortality rounds, as are readmissions. This has proven beneficial to obtaining input from dif-ferent parts of the care pathway. Other studies have shown that this type of review is essential to improving patient care outcomes.19,23-25 Conclusions The JPOCSC and Surgery Centre's unplanned transfer and admission rate to the tertiary care hospital was well within the average for similar centres throughout the United States. The very high success rate for same-day discharge eclipsed that of case-controlled patients who had the same surgery at a regional tertiary care hospital. The lack of overnight stay capability at JPOCSC encourages adherence to the patient care pathway, and our low readmission rate postdischarge further indicates the successful same-day discharge of these patients. In our public health care system, it is crucial to maximize resource use and patient access to services. Unplanned overnight admissions fol- lowing surgery unnecessarily tie up inpatient beds and add further expense to the already taxed public system.

Methods: We examined trends in prescribing prac - tices using a data set of outpatient opioid prescrip - tions in BC from 2013 to efet, prescribing British Columbia from 2013 to 2017: A population-based study A 5-year retrospective analysis of community-dispensed opioids in BC showed that the number of opioid prescriptions issued declined slightly, and the types of opioids prescribed varied by medical specialty and over the study period.

This article has been peer reviewed.Results: In total, 19 785 practitioners prescribed 15 693 867 prescriptions that were dispensed to 1 692 035 patients. In 2017, 11.5% of British Colum - bians were given at least one prescription for opi- oids. Over the 5-year period, opioid prescription rates declined by 1.6%; however, the proportion of patients who received more than 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day increased by 8%. there was heterogeneity of opioid prescriptions across and within specialty groups. Conclusions: We provide population-level data to inform prescribers that there is a need to be aware of opioid prescription variability and its potential effect on long-term opioid use. Opioids are an essential component of multimodal therapy for acute and cancer pain management. Legitimate opioid prescription use in this setting is not considered to be a major contributor to chronic opioid misuse.1,2 However, transition to persis- tent opioid use, distinct from opioid misuse, in an opioid-naive patient is reported to be the most common complication occurring after elective surgery, and the rate of use may be as high as 1 in 15.3,4 For example, persistent opi- oid use following lumbar fusion surgery has been reported in 12.8% of opioid-naive pa- tients.5 An initial prescription of opioids carries a 5.3% risk of persistent opioid use at 1 year and a 2.9% risk at 3 years.6 Certain patterns of initial opioid prescriptions are known risk factors for persistent opioid use in previously opioid-naive patients. These doses, increasing number of days of opioids supplied with the first prescription, and instigation of a repeat prescription on initiation of opioids.6,7 How - ever, increased risk is independent of the initial indication for the opioid prescription.6 There is wide variation in opioid drug and dosage prescribing after common surgical pro- cedures, yet as much as 70% to 80% of the drugs are not used and contribute to an opioid source within the community.8,9 These opioids are often kept for future potential emergency pain use but become a source for recreational misuse or diversion.10 Long-term use of legitimate prescription opioids or unused community opioids is a po- tential gateway to subsequent opioid use disor- der and transition to illicit drug use. Four to six percent of individuals who use prescription opi- oids will make this transition, especially when prescription drugs become less available.11-13 Canadians were the third highest consumer of prescription narcotic drugs per capita in 2018.14 337 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021337Y efet LS, Bone JN, Courtemanche R, Lauder G, Courtemanche DJ clinical The introduction of synthetic drugs such as fentanyl and carfentanyl into the illicit drug market has resulted in a surge of unintend- ed opioid-related deaths since 2015. British Columbia declared this opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2016.15 One response to this crisis was The 2017 Canadian Guideline for Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain, which suggests that prescribers should restrict patients to 90 MME per day.16 Despite this and other recommendations, the 2019 Canadian opioid overdose-related death rates remained the high- est in BC at a rate of 20.0 per 100 000, twice the national average of 10.2.17 It is important to understand the variability in opioid prescriptions among prescribers in an attempt to reduce the quantity of opioids within the community. Previous studies have described physician specialty-specific prescrib- ing trends. However, they studied mainly pa- tient populations in the US, and often did not describe prescriptions in relation to other fac- tors such as patient age and sex.18-20 Analyzing prescriptions by these characteristics is par- ticularly important in understanding opioid use in age-specific populations because their opioid prescriptions can vary significantly by provider specialty.21,22 We describe opioid prescribing patterns in BC from 2013 to 2017 with the primary goal of determining the relationship between prescriptions and patient age and sex, and pre - scriber types. Methods A 5-year retrospective longitudinal analysis of all community-dispensed opioids within BC was conducted. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia Chil- dren's and Women's Research Ethics Board (H18-01006). The study conforms to the rules regarding data reporting as set out by Popula-tion Data BC and the provincial government. Opioid classification A list of all possible prescription opioids for the study period was created based on the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System.23 The categories for \"opioids\" and \"drugs used in opioid dependence\" were included, and each was searched within the Health Canada Drug Product Database. In total, 691 drug identifica- tion numbers were identified. Data sources Dispensed prescriptionsA list of all prescriptions dispensed in BC be-tween 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 was obtained from the PharmaNet database 24 through Population Data BC. PharmaNet, reg- ulated by the BC Ministry of Health, records every prescription dispensed in community pharmacies, regardless of a patient's insurance status. The final list of opioid prescriptions in- cluded all those matching the 691 identified drug identification numbers. For each prescription, the following data were collected: drug identification number, date dispensed, quantity dispensed, days sup- plied, and patient age and sex. Additionally, the following drug-specific details were ob- tained: chemical/generic name, drug strength, drug form units, and dosage form description (e.g., 3 [drug form units] tablets [dosage form description]). The field \"directions for use\" was requested but not obtained due to privacy/con- fidentiality concerns. All patients and prescribers were given a unique study ID by Population Data BC in order to create a de-identified data set. Opioid details The Health Canada Drug Product Database was searched for each specific opioid within a drug to obtain the corresponding opioid strength.25 Additionally, the oral MME was calculated for each drug using conversion fac- tors obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control's 2017 oral MME guide.26 Formula- tions were type into 12 groups [Table]. Tramadol and tapentadol were combined due to their similar mechanism of action.27 Codeine and tramadol/tapentadol were characterized as weak opioids; the remain- der were characterized as strong opioids.Prescriber details Data on each physician's type of practice were obtained by linking their unique de-identified study ID to their listed specialty (or specialties) from the BC College of Physicians and Sur- geons database.28 Physicians with multiple specialties were categorized by the primary specialty as designated by Population Data BC. Prescribers were then aggregated into the following categories: anesthesiology, specialty dentistry, general dentistry, diagnostics, general practice, medicine, nurse practitioner, pediat- rics, pharmacy, physician: unknown specialty, psychiatry, surgery, and other (includes allied health professionals, optometrists, naturopathic physicians, midwives, and podiatrists). BC population details Annual population data for BC, stratified by age and sex, were obtained from published Govern- ment of British Columbia estimates.29 Data cleaning Prescriptions with unidentified sexes or with ages greater than 113 (the oldest identified Brit- ish Columbian during the study period) were set to missing. Prescriptions from prescriber types that were not present in BC during the study period were excluded because they were perceived as data errors. Daily MMEs and days supplied greater than twice the 99th percentile were excluded because they were considered data errors. Physicians' specialities that could not be identified from the BC College of Physi- cians and Surgeons database were categorized as an \"unknown\" speciality. The prescriber for prescriptions with misclassified prescriber des- ignations were also set to \"unknown.\" Statistical analyses Patients, prescribers, and prescriptions were clas- sified descriptively overall and by year using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables and counts for categorical variables. Using age- and sex-specific reference population totals from the BC general popula- tion, prescription rates per 1000 were calculated for each study year. Data were stratified by pre- scriber group type. The total number of prescrip- tions per provider was calculated overall and for each of the three most common opioid groups prescribed within the prescriber speciality group. Trends in the number of prescriptions is- sued over time by opioid group, both overall and within prescriber groups, were assessed 338 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021338clinical Opioid prescribing patterns in British Columbia from 2013 to 2017 visually and via Poisson regression, including a cubic spline for calendar month from the start of the study period. All analyses were conducted using R statistical software.30 Data cleaning, editing, and analysis was con- ducted on a secure server in the Population Data BC Secure Research Environment. Analysis exports conformed to the rules and limitations set by Population Data BC and were restricted to counts greater than or equal to 5. Results Details on opioid prescriptions and patient co- horts are presented in the Table. Between 2013 and 2017, 15 693 867 opioid prescriptions were dispensed in BC. Ten prescriptions were exclud- ed from analysis due to unidentified sex; 35 were excluded for ages greater than 113. Prescriptions from prescriber types that were not present in BC during the study period were excluded (n = 792). Daily MMEs and days supplied greater than twice the 99th percentile were excluded (n = 3923 and 23 375, respectively). Physicians' specialities that could not be identified were categorized as an \"unknown\" speciality (n = 229, accounting for 2 015 101 prescriptions). A fur- ther 111 996 prescriptions had misclassified prescriber designations; in these cases, the prac- titioner was also set to \"unknown.\" The 15 665 732 prescriptions included in the analysis (15 693 867 minus 28 135 exclud- ed) were prescribed by 19 785 practitioners to 1 692 035 patients, yielding an average annual opioid prescription per capita rate of 124 per 1000 (median 50 years, 51% female) [Table]. The median daily MMEs increased from 32 in 2013 to 34 in 2017. Opioid prescription rates per capita declined by 1.6% across all prescriber groups over the 5 years. The top three opioid prescriber groups were general practitioners (42%), pharmacists (13%), and dentists (13%) [Figure S1, Table The 20% of prescribers were responsible for 86% of opioid prescriptions over the study period; the top 10% were responsible for 66% of prescriptions.

For both males and females, the annual rate of opioid prescriptions per capita decreased from 2013 to 2017 [Figure S2]. The per capita rate of prescriptions increased with increasing age for both sexes [Figure S2]. For males and slightly more for females, there was a substantial increase in weak opioid prescriptions between the ages of 10 and 19 years [Figure S2] . General dentists were responsible for 32% of prescrip-tions within this age range, compared to only 3% in the total study population. The opioid most commonly prescribed to patients between the ages of 10 and 19 years was codeine, with median daily MME of 34 and median of 4 days supplied. In patients between the ages of 80 and 89 years, the most commonly prescribed opioid was hydromorphone, with a median daily MME of 24, and median of 7 days supplied. Declines in the overall number of prescrip- tions issued were related primarily to codeine, oxycodone, and morphine of buprenorphine, tra- madol/tapentadol, and methadone prescriptions increased during the study period. On a per prescriber basis, there was large variability in drug choice between practitioner types [Table S1]. Number of days supplied and daily MMEs also varied between prescribers and drugs, and were generally higher for oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl made up 14% of all prescriptions and had the greatest MME and number of days supplied.General practitioners were responsible for most total prescriptions (74%) [Table S1, Figure S1 and S4]. The most prescribed varied by practitioner type [Figure S5]. Codeine was one of the top three most commonly prescribed opioids among almost all practitioner types, with a median 26 (IQR 15-36) daily MME for a median 8 (IQR 5-25) days supplied. Tramadol/tapentadol was favored by surgical specialities, and represented 35% of their opioid prescriptions, with a median 22 (IQR 15-30) daily MME for a median 9 (IQR 5-28) days supplied. On average, psychiatrists prescribed the greatest MME per day, with a median daily MME of 64. Trends in prescribing patterns over the study period differed by prac- titioner type [Figure S1].

Psychiatry had a notable drop in buprenorphine prescriptions (-70%) between 2014 and 2017 [Figure S1]. Most other rates were consistent over time. Supplementary data tables detailing pre- scribing patterns for all subspecialties and drugs prescribed are available online [Table S1 and S2, respectively]. Discussion This review of all opioid prescriptions filled at community pharmacies in BC between 2013 and 2017 showed an overall reduction in opioid prescription rates across all prescriber groups by 1.6%. The overall prevalence rate of opioid prescriptions in BC in 2017 was 12%. General practitioners prescribed 74% of all commu- nity opioids. There was a marked reduction in prescription rates among psychiatrists. Opioid dispensing rates increased with patient age, with a marked upturn for weak opioid prescriptions between ages 10 and 19 years. Within this age range, general dentists were the predominant prescribers. The opioids prescribed varied by specialty and over the study time period. Co- deine and oxycodone prescription rates de- creased from 2013 to 2017 in all groups, with surgical specialties transitioning to tramadol/ tapentadol. Prescriptions for harm reduction opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine increased. These data are extremely important because opioid prescription patterns are known to be a risk factor for subsequent persistent opioid use in previously opioid-naive patients.7 The overall prevalence of prescription opioids seems concerning. However, without comparison to other North American regions, it is undeter- mined whether this is a factor in BC's opioid crisis. The heterogeneity of prescriptions across prescriber groups may be a contributing factor to the unused opioid mass in the community, which is a potential risk factor for opioid misuse and diversion. Reduced opioid prescription rates by psy- chiatrists may be secondary to a shift in practice patterns due to addiction medicine special - ists assuming care of patients with opioid use disorder in 2014. Pharmacists were the third largest group of opioid prescribers. Although they prescribed primarily codeine-containing medications, 10% of were docu- mented to be for hydromorphone. Pharma- cists' responsibility for opioid prescriptions may be due to BC's provincial opioid prescription monitoring strategies in which pharmacists can be the recorded prescribers of opioids when providing emergency supplies and in cer- tain rural communities for over-the-counter opioid-containing prescriptions. The increased use of harm reduction opioids is consistent with the recognized efficacy of these drugs in treating opioid use disorder.31 The reduced preference for codeine may be related to increased awareness of the pharmacogenetic variability of codeine metabolism following the 2012 Food and Drug Administration's black box warning regarding the use of codeine in children less than 12 years of age who were undergoing tonsillectomy.32 The marked increase in opioid prescriptions in patients between ages 10 and 19 years raises questions about the appropriateness of these prescriptions in this vulnerable population. Similar to our study, Volkow and colleagues found dentists to be predominant prescribers of opioids in patients between 10 and 19 years in the United States. 33 A study of BC dentists between 1997 and 2013 identified increas- ing codeine prescription rates, and reported that most dentists prescribed codeine for an inappropriate duration of more than 3 days.34 Furthermore, a survey of BC dentists and en-dodontists showed that they often prescribed opioids when not indicated. 35 The increase in dispensed opioids to teenage patients identified in our study suggests the need for consistent assessment of indication and intensity of opioid prescriptions given that there is an association between higher prevalence of prescription opi- oid misuse with greater medical use of prescrip- tion opioids in this population.36 Smolina and colleagues described determi- nants of opioid consumption trends in BC be- tween 2005 and 2012, and found a 31% increase in opioid prescriptions in terms of MME.37 In the US, Levy and colleagues found a 3.7% in- crease in opioid prescription rates from 2007 to 2012.18 Our study employed different selection criteria and is, therefore, not directly comparable to the aforementioned studies. We found con- sistent decreases in opioid prescription rates per capita, with an overall 1.6% decrease between 2013 and 2017 but an 8% increase in prescrip- tions with daily MME greater than 90. There appears to be a significant change from a 31% increase over 7 years to a 1.6% decrease over the subsequent 5 years, which may be due to a combination of increased practitioner recogni- tion of opioid-associated risks and pervasive prescription regulation. Opioid dispense rates in most Canadian provinces peaked between 2011 and 2016.38 Previous research has described opioid prescriptions by prescriber type.18,39 Studies were limited to an examination of one surgical specialty or specific opioids such as buprenor - phine or tramadol.40-43 Wen and colleagues found an overall 2.2-fold increase in psychiatry buprenorphine prescriptions between 2006 and 2014 in the US, which contrasts with our 0.7-fold decrease.40 This discrepancy may be due to the different study periods. Similar to the results of our study, tramadol dispensing rates increased in all Canadian provinces be- tween 2007 and 2016, with the greatest increase leading up to 2009.43 Unique to our study is the evaluation of variability in opioid prescription patterns of both prescriber groups and opioid types. These results demonstrate heterogeneity in both the drugs prescribed and daily MME of prescriptions. The increase in dispensed opioids to teenage patients suggests the need for consistent assessment of indication and intensity of opioid prescriptions given the higher prevalence of opioid misuse in this population.341 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021341Y efet LS, Bone JN, Courtemanche R, Lauder G, Courtemanche DJ clinical The outcomes of our study are strength- ened by the use of population-level data and the linkage of multiple data sources with com- plete descriptions of practitioner types. Our study is limited by the lack of inpatient opi- oid prescription data, unknown rates of illicit opioid consumption, and lack of prescription indications. Furthermore, our study examined dispensed opioids as a proxy for total prescrip- tions, which is further used as a proxy for opi- oid consumption. The data set also contained data inconsistencies such as obsolete prescriber groups, patient ages, and days supplied deemed improbable, as well as missing data. Physician specialty descriptions were also not available for 13% of prescriptions. This highlights the challenge of collecting, verifying, editing, and maintaining a large database, and implies the need to tighten guidelines for the collection and reporting of such data. This retrospective population-based study describes the variation and temporal changes in opioid prescription patterns among prescribers in BC. Providers currently have limited access to data that describe prescribing patterns within their specialties; therefore, they may struggle to identify where their practice falls on this spectrum. Currently, practitioners in Alberta and Nova Scotia can request a peer comparison report as part of their province's opioid review program.44,45 Since its implementation of a peer assessment program, Alberta has demonstrated reduced MME prescription rates per capita.45 Permitting prescribers to compare their pre- scriptions with their peers in other jurisdictions has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing opi- oid prescription rates.46,47 Conclusion and future directions This analysis of opioid prescriptions in BC be- tween 2013 and 2017 demonstrated an overall 1.6% reduction in opioid prescription rates. Opioids were more frequently prescribed in older patients, but the greatest age-specific gradient was observed between children and young adults. Notably, there was heterogeneity in opioid type and prescription MME among prescriber groups. This data set is currently being analyzed to characterize and report on long-term opioid prescriptions. This review provides evidence to support the development of physician peer comparison reports in BC. However, this should be an aim for all provinces so that national and international comparisons can be made in speciality-specific prescription practices. n Competing interests None declared.

T 604 6 38 BC al Journal vol. 63 no. 8 | october 2021345Doctors of BC published a policy paper on integrating physicians in disaster preparedness and health emergency management back in 2018.1 The current pandemic has again put a spotlight on this important discussion. As we plan for the postpandemic world, we need to increase disas- ter preparedness and health emergency man- agement awareness, not only among physicians, but also among medical students and residents. The call to increase awareness in disaster preparedness among medical learners is not new. The International Federation of Medical Students' Associations published a policy state- ment in 20172 calling to better \"incorporate disaster medicine and health emergency man-agement into the medical curricula, balancing the biomedical and public health dimensions.\" A recent systematic review of disaster training programs also highlighted that when medical schools incorporate these programs for medi-cal students, they improve their preparedness, skills, and knowledge\u2014especially during times of pandemic.3 In Canada, there is an expectation from the public for physicians to be prepared for, respond to, and manage the consequences of a disaster. Although medical schools acknowledged that expectation, forty-six percent of the surveyed medical schools do not teach disaster medicine to learners.4 This article is the opinion of the Emergency and Public Safety Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.To address this gap in medical training, there exist many frameworks and examples. For instance, the National Collaborative for Disaster Health Education and Research in Australia developed a framework to guide di- saster preparedness training and to ensure con- sistency and ease of implementation.5 Ashcroft and colleagues also demonstrated the effective- ness of using multimodal formats and suggested a structure for disaster preparedness training based on their systematic review.3 Even simple, classroom-based interactive discussions resulted in improved knowledge among students. The current pandemic has shown us that a disaster doesn't just affect a few specialties, such as public health, emergency, critical care, and family medicine; it can have impacts on all disciplines of medicine. While we cannot predict when another disaster or health emer- gency will happen, we can do our best to raise awareness and competency among our learn- ers\u2014help them understand the basics of disaster preparedness and become better equipped to respond to health emergencies both as learners and as future physicians. By incorporating disaster preparedness early in the medical curriculum, we help learners build reflexes early on in their training. We also create a culture that is fundamental to in- tegrating physicians in disaster preparedness and health emergency management.Recovery in the postpandemic world can- not mean merely returning to the old ways.

The goal: to provide timely, specialized treatment to help injured workers get back on the job as soon as it is safe to do so. The program is delivered through our contracted network of 46 hand therapy clinics around the province. These clinics, staffed by certified hand therapists, provide services to workers who have sustained injuries to the upper extremity, below shoulder level. Referrals Workers either self-refer to one of the clinics or are referred by a family physician, a hand surgeon, or WorkSafeBC. Physicians may re- fer an injured worker patient directly to one of the contracted hand therapy providers or rec-ommend to the case manager that the injured worker be referred to the program. Hand injury treatment: An example The following example illustrates how a typical hand injury might be treated within our hand therapy framework. A 23-year-old carpenter\u2014we'll call him Rick\u2014suffered a laceration to the right index finger extensor tendon, with a mallet deformity, when he hit his hand against a sharp piece of rebar. Rick saw his family physician the day of his injury and attended an orthopaedic con- sultation 10 days later. At the consultation, the orthopaedic physician recommended splint- ing to address the 15 degree lag at the DIP joint. The worker returned for suture removal 1 week later. With the wound healing, the physi - cian recommended referral to a certified hand therapist, and the WorkSafeBC claim owner WorkSafeBC's Hand Therapy Program This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.initiated the referral process to WorkSafeBC's Hand Therapy Program. One week later, Rick had an assessment at one of WorkSafeBC's certified hand therapy clinics, 1 month after his injury. On assessment, the hand therapist noted that the injury was healing, but there was some skin breakdown from the bandages. The certified hand therapist fabricated a new splint to hold the DIP joint in slight hyperextension and the PIP joint in flexion. Rick attended the Hand Therapy Pro- gram for splinting, progressive range of motion, strengthening, and return-to-work planning. The Hand Therapy Program coordinated and initiated a graduated return-to-work plan, which the worker initiated after 2 months of treatment. Rick participated in a 3-week graduated return-to-work plan monitored by the certified hand therapist. After completing the graduated return-to-work plan, the worker was discharged from the Hand Therapy Program fit to return to work with no limitations and no permanent functional impairment.

She passed away in her sleep on 22 August 2021 after facing demen- tia with grace and dignity for many years. She lived a full and eventful life as a loving, dedicated family member, wife, mother, and grandmother, as well as a trail-blazing female physician. Dr Chung graduated from Xiangya (Yale-China) Medical School in Changsha, Hunan Province, in 1948 at the age of 23. She would joke that she was probably the only doc- tor in Canada who never completed high school as her education was interrupted by World War II. She came to North America to finish her studies due to the ongoing civil war in China, with the goal of returning to China as a medical missionary once finished. The China Immigra - tion Act had just been repealed in 1947, which had allowed her to come. After two internships, the first in Tacoma and the second in Victoria, she went to Montreal for the first year of her residency in obstetrics and gynecology. There she met her future husband, Dr Wallace Chung, who was in his first year of medical school at the time. The couple married on 7 June 1953 and moved to Vancouver. There she started a solo practice at Vancouver General Hospital and the old Grace Hospital. Obituaries We welcome original tributes of less than 500 words; we may edit them for clarity and length. Obituaries may be emailed to journal@doctorsofbc.ca. Include birth and death dates, full name and name deceased was best known by, key hospital and professional affiliations, relevant biographical data, and a high-resolution head-and-shoulders photo. Because of her sex and her ethnicity, she faced significant discrimination from staff and faculty, as well as the community. She was de- nied a loan to start her office because the bank was concerned that she would quit work and stay home once she had children. Despite the opposition, her practice thrived. Newly arrived Chinese-speaking immigrants and women of all ethnicities who wished to have a female obstetrician found her. Despite initially being denied an academic appointment, she was also popular among medical students and residents due to her enthusiasm for teaching. Over a long career starting in 1956, until her retirement in 1992, she delivered 7226 ba- bies. They were all carefully documented in her obstetrical appointment books. She delivered babies whose parents she had also delivered; all were members of the unofficial club of the Chung Babies. She retired as a clinical profes-sor emeritus. Dr Chung's parents were Yoong Yih Wong and Alice Wong. Madeline was the firstborn and eldest of three girls. Her father was very advanced in his thinking for the time and be- lieved that his girls' education should not be any different than that of any boy's. Dr Chung had a relatively privileged life ini- tially, as the daughter of a government official, but her teenage years were extremely fraught. She spent World War II as a refugee in the countryside around Hong Kong after the city fell to the Japanese army. As a young teen, she was the one who had to forage for food and seek shelter for her injured mother and young- er siblings. Her desire to help others in need was heightened by her deep Christian faith as well as the suffering she had encountered. On one occasion, she brought home a patient for Christmas dinner. The young woman, a newly arrived immigrant, had just been diagnosed with cancer and had no family or friends locally. Dr Chung took her under her wing until family could arrange to come over to care for her. On another occasion, a Chinese refugee family was welcomed to live in her family home until they could get on their feet. She also volunteered her time in the com- munity. She was very active in the Chinese United Church and served as a board mem - ber and chair. She was one of the co-founders of the Chinese Language True Light School, which exists to this day. She was not amused at being audited twice in 1 week by the Canada Revenue Agency (fruitlessly both times) as they could not believe that someone could do all that work for free. For her dedication she was given an honorary life membership in the Canadian Medical Association in 1993 and she received a Civic Merit Award from the City of Vancouver in 2013. She was always extremely humble and never sought recognition as long as she could continue doing what she loved. Postretirement, she most enjoyed being Gumma to her five grandchildren, traveling extensively with her husband, growing huge azaleas in her garden, and continuing her vol- unteer work. She traveled to China with the Evangelical Medical Aid Society, where she fulfilled her life's dream to do medical missions, teaching, and delivering babies. A heartfelt thanks to her wonderful fam- ily doctor, Dr Cindy Chang, who was always there when needed, and her devoted caregivers, Reyna and Shirley, without whom we would not have been able to fulfill mom's wish to re-main at home.

In September 2020, I enrolled in the UBC Legacy Project, where medical students partner with a person who has a life-limiting condition to support them in creating a project to leave with their loved ones. I had been reading about how the coronavirus complicated the grieving process for patients and their families; if there was some way I could help, I wanted to try. So there I was, an inexpe- rienced 22-year-old medical student, donned in PPE, entering a hospice for the first time. I felt overwhelmed in the unfamiliar build - ing, introducing myself to many unknown, par- tially covered faces. The prior 6 months of my medical school experience consisted of virtual interactions with mostly healthy volunteers, and I could no longer rely on my nonverbal skills to develop rapport. It was as if my face protection formed a wall between me and everyone else. Before I had time to question my ability to work on this intimate project with Sylvie,* Bridging the 6-foot gap A medical student's experience using stories to connect with palliative care patients during the coronavirus pandemic. Holly Cherniwchan, BHSc Ms Cherniwchan is a medical student at the University of British Columbia (class of 2023). This article has been peer reviewed.I was in her room. Sylvie was a 52-year-old immigrant from England, in Canada with her husband, dying with a rare brain cancer. The room was quiet, except for a ticking clock. As I looked at her from a 6-foot distance, there was a strange sense of isolation, despite being so close. I wondered how to get started, but without delay Sylvie was already sharing her stories. She used to be a journalist and couldn't wait to tell me about her life. I felt my anxiety melt away. I set up the iPad and got things going. Over 2 short weeks, Sylvie and I connected over our shared interests in art, dogs, and travel- ing. We discussed sensitive topics, such as what she loves about her husband. We shared many laughs and many tears. Even though she never remembered my name, her face lit up each time I walked into her room. I hope she knew that, behind my mask, I was smiling too. I didn't know Sylvie for long, yet we were able to create a meaningful video to share with her husband, who is grieving the loss of his soulmate much too prematurely. It was also a project to share with her family in England, who could not be there to share her last breaths because of the coronavirus. Being a part of Sylvie's and her husband's lives is the most valuable experience I've yet to have as a medical student. Reflecting on my time with them, I came to realize what an honor it is to be trusted with someone's memories, to put them together in a video to be a final send-off to their loved ones, and to join them in their last few days in the physical world. When I last saw Syl - vie, she told me that she felt lucky to have had our time together. I couldn't help but feel that I was the lucky one. Sylvie taught me that, at a time when masks, goggles, gowns, and gloves dehumanize our interactions with each other, we can still connect through our stories. n Competing interests None declared.
