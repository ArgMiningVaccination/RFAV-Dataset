The hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the main driving force of immune outbreaks, is involved in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Meanwhile, growing evidence has indicated that the development of NLRP3-targeted therapies offers great potential and promise for the treatment of related diseases. The search for and development of efficacious anti-inflammatory prodrugs from natural sources of plants and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have received extensive attention. Glycyrrhiza, an important minister in the kingdom of TCMs, has high activity and a wide range of therapeutic effects. Studies have shown that a variety of active components found in Glycyrrhiza, such as licochalcone A, echinatin, isoliquiritigenin, and glycyrrhizin, produce a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects by discouraging NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here, we summarize the role and mechanism of the active ingredients in Glycyrrhiza that target the NLRP3 inflammasome and treat related inflammatory diseases. We describe a favorable approach for the development of natural, safe, and efficient drugs that exploit these naturally occurring active ingredients to treat NLRP3-driven diseases. Keywords: NLRP3 inflammasome, Glycyrrhiza, inflammatory diseases, anti-inflammatory Introduction Inflammation is a tissue defense response after the body is stimulated by external microbial infection or by damage signals from itself. The pathological manifestations include tissue exudation, degeneration, and hyperplasia in the inflammatory area, and are characterized by redness, swelling, heat, pain, and dysfunction. The inflammatory response is initiated when cell surface or intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-related molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-related molecular patterns (DAMPs). [1](#cit0001) Many common clinical diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, wound repair, are characterized by inflammation. [2-4](#cit0002 cit0003 cit0004) In clinical treatment, anti-inflammatory drugs are the second largest class of drugs after anti-infective drugs; these drugs mainly consist of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, due to the strong adverse side-effects of many synthetic drugs, [5](#cit0005) the search for and development of dependable and efficacious anti-inflammatory drugs from natural sources such as plants has received extensive attention. In particular, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), the quintessence of disease prevention and control in China for thousands of years, are a very important part of the world medicine treasury and play a vital role in inflammation. Innate immunity plays an important role in the development of a variety of diseases by regulating the immune and inflammatory responses that depend on PRRs. NLRP3 inflammasome is part of the innate immune response and is activated in response to PAMPs or DAMPs, promoting the expression, maturation and release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines that trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses. Recent studies have shown that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is the main driving force behind excessive immune outbreaks. [6-8](#cit0006 cit0007 cit0008) The aberration of NLRP3 inflammasome activation participate in the development of human diseases, such as metabolic pathologies, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory issues, and neurologic cit0011) Glycyrrhiza, also known as \"Guo Lao\" in Chinese, is an important minister in the kingdom of TCMs. It is not only the most commonly used TCM in tonics and food, but also one of the most important TCMs with high levels of activity and a wide range of therapeutic effects. A wide range of pharmacological effects makes Glycyrrhiza useful for treating multi-system inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, and immunocompromised diseases. [12-15](#cit0012 cit0013 cit0014 cit0015) A variety of active components in Glycyrrhiza exert a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, in this review, we mainly focus on the role and mechanism of the active ingredients in Glycyrrhiza and how they target the NLRP3 inflammasome to treat related inflammatory diseases. The Activation of NLRP3 Inflammasome Inflammasomes are protein polymer complexes that coordinate the host's defense mechanism against pathogens and physiological abnormalities. The assembly of inflammasome complexes is initiated by the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) or absent in melanoma 2 ALRs), etc. ALRs mediate recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs during bacterial, viral, fungal and cellular damage. In most cases, activated NLRs and ALRs will recruit the dimeric protein of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) which participates in caspase-1 [18](#cit0018) NLRP3 (also called activation of the canonical NLRP3 the completion of two signals ( [Figure 1](#f0001)). Signal 1 (priming stage) is characterized by toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR2, etc., that induce NF-B-mediated precursor protein production, including NLRP3, pro-IL-1, and pro-IL-18. Signal 2 (activation stage) is the stage when a variety of PAMPs and DAMPs induce the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (NLRP3-ASC-pro-caspase-1). Subsequently, pro-caspase-1 auto-cleaves caspase-1 cleaves and activates the precursor proteins pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into mature forms IL-1 and IL-18, which are secreted into the extracellular to participate in the subsequent inflammatory response. At the same time, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome also leads to the occurrence of a programmed cell death, called pyroptosis. Pharmacological Inhibitors of NLRP3 a chalcone occurring in Glycyrrhiza that has a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-bacterial. [14](#cit0014) Here, we focus on the anti-inflammatory effect of Lico A via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthritis in the elderly and is characterized by subchondral bone hyperplasia and articular cartilage degeneration, leading to the loss of joint function. [22](#cit0022), [23](#cit0023) NLRP3 inflammasome is a potentially novel therapeutic target for the management of OA. [24](#cit0024), [25](#cit0025) In vitro, Lico A suppresses GSDMD expression in primary mouse OA chondrocytes via nuclear factor and IL-18 protein expression in an air pouch mouse model. [26](#cit0026) The above studies indicate that Lico A may have therapeutic potential in OA. | | Figure 2 Chemical structure of compounds from Glycyrrhiza. (A) Licochalcone A; (B) (H) Glycyrrhetinic acid; (I) Carbenoxolone. Cell stress causes excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the separation of thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) from thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1). [27](#cit0027) Then, to NLRP3, triggering the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which has been proven to be a key signaling molecule connecting oxidative stress and inflammasome activation. [27](#cit0027), [28](#cit0028) The LPS/GalN-induced inflammatory to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. [29-31](#cit0029 cit0030 cit0031) Studies have NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 p20, and IL-1 the expression of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) protein in LPS/GalN-induced acute lung injury (ALI) ( [Figure 3](#f0003)), [32](#cit0032) indicating that inflammation inhibited by Lico A may be responsible for suppressing activation of the Txnip-NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is vital for inducing inflammatory response and worsening the development of acne. [33-35](#cit0033 cit0034 cit0035) Lico A has been shown to NLRP3 inflammasome activation via inhibition of ASC speck formation mitochondrial reactive oxygen species SZ95 external use of Lico A on mouse ear skin reduces skin inflammation caused by P. acne, and blocks caspase-1 activity and IL-1 production. [36](#cit0036) These results provide a theoretical basis for the development of natural, safe, and efficient health care products or drugs derived from Lico A raw materials. Licochalcone B (Lico B) Lico B is known to have strong pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer. ( [Figure 2B](#f0002)) in Glycyrrhiza is relatively low, it has a strong anti-NLRP3 inflammasome effect. Our previous studies have shown that Lico B could specifically suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation via binding to NEK7 and inhibiting the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7 in BMDMs, THP-1 cells B ameliorates LPS-induced septic shock characterized by improving survival rate, inhibiting IL-1 production, reducing the number of peritoneal exudative cells and targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. [38](#cit0038) Taking these studies into consideration, we firmly believe that with further investigation of its pharmacological effects will lead to Lico B becoming a promising candidate in the treatment of NLRP3-related diseases. Liquiritigenin Hyperuricemia, a metabolic disease with a high prevalence rate, is typically related to high serum uric acid that could cause monosodium urate crystals to be deposited in the joints and kidneys, seriously endangering the life and health of patients. [39](#cit0039), [40](#cit0040) A large amount of evidence indicates that the inflammatory response mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in the renal injury of rodent models for hyperuricemia extracted from Glycyrrhiza plants, reduces the level of uric acid in the serum and urine, and decreases renal inflammation in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats by inhibiting the activation of the renal AQP4/NF-B/IB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. [44](#cit0044) Hyperglycemia is considered a crucial element in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). high glucose-induced extracellular inflammation in the rat glomerular mesangial cell HBZY-1 by inhibiting NF-B and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, [47](#cit0047) thus potential for DN. Echinatin Echinatin is a bioactive flavonoid in Glycyrrhiza. It has been reported that echinatin exhibits strong scavenging activity and suppresses the production of nitric oxide, interleukin-6 prostaglandin Moreover, echinatin could attenuate CCl4-induced liver injury and may be responsible for the hepatoprotective activity of Glycyrrhiza. [49](#cit0049) Our previous studies echinatin ( 2D](#f0002)) inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), inhibiting its ATPase activity and disrupting the association HSP90-NLRP3 NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice, [50](#cit0050) making it a favorable candidate approach for therapeutic interventions extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Glycyrrhiza. It has been proven that ILG is biologically safe and has high levels of biological activity. Although Glycyrrhiza contains only low concentrations of ILG, ILG has a wide range of pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antioxidant. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effect of ILG has been a rapidly growing research topic in recent years. Therefore, the following sections mainly explains the anti-inflammatory effect of ILG from the perspective of inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. ILG plays a powerful role in repairing neuroinflammation damage. ILG pretreatment prevents cognitive impairment, neuronal injury, attenuates microglia and astrocyte reduces production of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-18 by promoting Nrf2 signaling and suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a kainic acid-induced seizure rat model. [54](#cit0054) A study has shown that chronic nicotine exposure increases the protein levels of caspase-1, ASC, IL-1, and exacerbates ischemic brain damage via activation of the inflammasome in the brains of female rats. [55](#cit0055) As inflammasome deprivation. [55](#cit0055) Furthermore, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal cerebrovascular disease that accounts for a relatively high proportion of all stroke types and is usually accompanied by high morbidity and mortality. [56](#cit0056), [57](#cit0057) ILG administration after collagenase IV-induced ICH decreases early brain impairments and neurological deficits, and the mechanism is related to triggering Nrf2 activity and Nrf2-induced antioxidant system to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome pathway [58](#cit0058) ( [Figure 3](#f0003)). The results of this experiment also indicate that ILG is a potential drug candidate for a new treatment strategy for ICH. Organs and tissues are susceptible to self-injury or infection by foreign pathogens, and these lead to the occurrence of the inflammatory response. ILG can reduce the inflammatory response by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious diseases. NLRP3 inflammasome and its regulatory mechanisms play an important role in the pathological process of ALI. [59-61](#cit0059 cit0060 cit0061) By activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling and inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-B pathways, ILG significantly reduces lung injury in LPS-induced ALI mice, and it decreases the exudation of inflammatory cells and the levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6, and TNF- in highlighting the beneficial effects of ILG and its related mechanisms in LPS-induced ALI and providing new insights for its application. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin could induce small intestinal damage and increase the protein levels of cleaved caspase-1 and mature IL-1 in the small intestine. [63](#cit0063) ILG treatment improves indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. [63](#cit0063) Therefore, there is an urgent need to carry out relevant clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ILG in the treatment of intestinal diseases caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, ILG also plays an important role in other inflammatory diseases. Chronic periodontitis is a common disease, and its incidence and severity increase with age. [64](#cit0064) Periodontal ligament fibroblasts are the primary cell type in periodontal ligament tissues and play a vital role in the occurrence and development of periodontitis, including tissue repair and reconstruction. [65](#cit0065), [66](#cit0066) ILG markedly recovers the migration dysfunction induced lipopolysaccharide by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 activation, release in cultured mouse periodontal ligament fibroblasts. [67](#cit0067) Pleurisy refers to inflammation of the pleura caused by a variety of infectious and noninfectious factors such as tumors, allergies, chemical substances, and trauma. ILG significantly reduces histopathological damage and increases the levels of inflammatory cell exudation, protein leakage and pro-inflammatory mediators in carrageenan-induced pleurisy by inhibiting the NLRP3/NF-B high levels iNOS and COX-2. [68](#cit0068) ILG strongly inhibits NLRP3 macrophages and reduces HFD-induced obesity, lipid homeostasis, insulin resistance, and the accumulation of inflammatory cells and adipose tissue inflammation. [69](#cit0069) Moreover, ILG treatment inhibits HFD-induced IL-1 epididymal white adipose tissue culture. [69](#cit0069) Isoliquiritin Depression is a common and debilitating mental illness. It is characterized by poor mood, loss of pleasure, and avoidance of social interactions, all of which cause a major social and economic burden. [70](#cit0070) Although a variety of antidepressant drugs can be used for the treatment of depression, most have a low cure rate, a wide range of side effects and poor treatment compliance. [71](#cit0071) Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies with high curative effects and few adverse reactions. Current evidence indicates that the development of depression is related to pyroptosis mediated by the inflammasome activation in primary microglia. [75](#cit0075) In vivo data show that isoliquiritin administration effectively ameliorates LPS or chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depressive symptoms by suppressing NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis via miRNA-27a/spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)/NF-B axis, [75](#cit0075) and this provides a new treatment strategy for the treatment of depression. Glycyrrhizin (GL) Glycyrrhizin ( [Figure 2G](#f0002)) (also triterpenoid compound extracted from Glycyrrhiza. GL-related derivatives are mainly used as sweeteners in the food industry. As a medicine, GL preparation is a powerful liver cell membrane protector that has the effects of anti-inflammatory, immune regulation, and hepatocyte protection. [76](#cit0076) It has been used clinically for many years as an effective drug for chronic hepatitis and has achieved good curative results. [77](#cit0077), [78](#cit0078) Metabolic disease is caused by disorders of amino acid, glucose and lipid metabolism in the body, and chronic inflammation is one of its main characteristics. Studies have shown that GL has significant therapeutic effects on metabolic diseases because of its ability to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. [79](#cit0079), [80](#cit0080) NASH seriously threatens the health of patients, and there is currently a lack of effective treatment options. In recent years, studies have shown that NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important biological role in the occurrence and development of NASH. [81-83](#cit0081 cit0082 cit0083) GL preparations are currently one of the first-line drugs used for anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective treatments of liver diseases. GL could acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation in macrophage [84](#cit0084) Importantly, attenuates MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, both intraperitoneal injection of GA and oral administration of GL significantly reduce MCD-induced liver injury, [84](#cit0084) suggesting that GL may attenuate NASH via its active metabolite GA. Atherosclerosis is the pathological basis of many vascular diseases, such as aneurysms, atherosclerotic obliterans and carotid artery disease. [85](#cit0085) Lipid metabolism disorder is the pathological basis of atherosclerosis. Inhibiting the atherosclerotic process is beneficial for controlling the development of the abovementioned vascular diseases. male ApoE/ mice. [86](#cit0086) In addition, GL has been shown to be effective in a variety of acute inflammatory injury models. Streptococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection facilitates pro-inflammatory cytokines production and induces damage to multiple organs, including ALI. [87](#cit0087) GL treatment reduces serum and lung tissue IL-6, TNF-, IL-8, IL-1 and HMGB1 levels, as well as lung tissue neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in S. aureus-induced [88](#cit0088) In a corneal injury mouse model, it has shown that GL treatment attenuates the expression of IL-1 by directly inhibiting extracellular HMGB1 functions, suppressing the NF-B-p65/NLRP3/IL-1 signaling pathway, resulting in the cornea regaining transparency and integrity [89](#cit0089) ( [Figure 3](#f0003)). Acute glaucoma is a cause of irreversible blindness that seriously threatens vision and is characterized by a sudden and significant increase in intraocular pressure followed by the death of retinal ganglion cells. [90](#cit0090), [91](#cit0091) HMGB1 is increased in ischemic retinal tissue during acute glaucoma, and the HMGB1 inhibitor, GL, reduces the severity of the disease via regulating the activation of NLRP3 and caspase-8 inflammasomes. [92](#cit0092) These results provide new insights toward understanding the role of the innate immune response in the pathogenesis of acute glaucoma and provide research strategies for new therapeutic targets for acute glaucoma. Traumatic spinal cord injury can lead to a large amount of nerve cell necrosis and severe functional-behavioral defects in the injured area. [93](#cit0093) In addition to the primary injury, the subsequent inflammatory process also contributes to secondary injury. [94](#cit0094) Functional recovery is promoted by GL treatment in rat model subject to traumatic spinal cord injury. The GL treatment results in recovery accompanied by decreased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, such as ASC, NLRP3, ALI pathological macrophage infiltration edema, and NLRP3 and IL-1 secretion mediated by the ROS-PI3K/AKT pathway. [96](#cit0096) This suggests that it may serve as a potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with great promise toward the attenuation of ALI-related inflammation and pathological status. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. It has clinical manifestations including resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, and is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region and the presence of Lewy bodies containing -synuclein. [97](#cit0097), [98](#cit0098) A large amount of evidence confirms and medicine) exhibit anti-inflammatory effects that ameliorate neurotoxicity induced by -synuclein that related components and preparations of licorice may be used as drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Carbenoxolone ( [Figure 2I](#f0002)), a synthetic derivative of GA, is frequently used in the treatment of gastric ulcers, psoriasis, and wound healing. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a culprit behind the chronic inflammation that accompanies insulin resistance in obese mice. [103-105](#cit0103 cit0104 cit0105) Carbenoxolone ameliorates insulin resistance liver and skeletal muscle of high-fat diet-induced obese mice by inhibiting IB-/NF-B pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, [106](#cit0106) and it deserves further study for the treatment of obesity related diseases. Licorice Extract Glycyrrhiza plants, especially flavonoids, induce strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. chromatography analysis. [107](#cit0107) The mRNA and protein levels of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6, are significantly decreased by all of the flavonoids from Glycyrrhiza uralensis in the colonic tissue of irinotecan-induced colitis mice, and the flavonoids also inhibit the activation formula, ameliorates 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced cholestatic liver injury, and alleviates the increased of pro-inflammatory factors and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. [108](#cit0108) Discussion Since NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the occurrence of a variety of inflammatory diseases, NLRP3 inflammasome may become a potential drug target for these diseases. [27](#cit0027), [109](#cit0109), [110](#cit0110) Therefore, exploring the pathogenesis of these diseases from the perspective of inflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and then developing related drugs may bring new hope for treatment. At present, therapeutic strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasome mainly block the interaction between IL-1 and its receptor using antibodies or antagonists that inhibit the inflammatory response. However, due to the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, there are other pro-inflammatory factors in addition to IL-1, such as the presence of IL-18. Therefore, the treatment strategy of blocking IL-1 requires further investigation, especially in diseases of complex etiology that may not respond as well to therapy. For this reason, the development of drugs targeting NLRP3 inflammasome itself and its related signaling pathways will become a rapidly growing area of research. However, to date, the understanding of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its regulatory mechanisms is still very limited, and there is a lack of clinical drugs targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. In recent years, good progress has been made in research on intervention strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent research in our lab has found that many active ingredients in TCMs could serve as candidate therapeutic drugs for NLRP3-driven diseases by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Cardamonin (from could reduce mortality and attenuate IL-1 production in the septic-shock mouse model by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. [111](#cit0111) In addition, the active components carnosol reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1 secretion in model by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. [112](#cit0112), [113](#cit0113) Therefore, the development of small molecule compounds targeting NLRP3 inflammasome may provide new treatment strategies for complex diseases. Glycyrrhiza contains a variety of active ingredients and is one of the most commonly used Chinese medicines. A common Chinese idiom is nine out of ten prescriptions contain Glycyrrhiza. Ancient documentation on Chinese herbal classics record that Glycyrrhiza could \"harmonize all kinds of drugs and cure all kinds of toxins\", but it is unclear how to regulate these activities. This review details the extensive anti-inflammatory effects of various components in Glycyrrhiza via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our previous studies also show that the drugs carbamazepine, isoniazid and nevirapine, as well as Chinese medicines such as Epimedium folium and Psoraleae frucitus, can promote the activation of inflammasome and lead to liver injury. [114-116](#cit0114 cit0115 cit0116) Therefore, we believe that one of the scientific connotations of the description of Glycyrrhiza's ability to \"harmonize all kinds of drugs and cure all kinds of toxins\" is the broad spectrum of antagonistic effects: abnormal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway is involved in the occurrence and development of various diseases, and active ingredients in Glycyrrhiza slow the process and reduce the development of related diseases by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus are capable of \"mediating various drugs and eliminating all toxins\". The overall concept of TCMs and the characteristics of low adverse reactions have received more attention. The current application of Glycyrrhiza's anti-inflammatory effects has demonstrated the unique advantages of reducing side effects, improving prognosis during disease treatment, and improving the survival rate of patients. This review summarizes current research on active ingredients in Glycyrrhiza, such as Lico A, echinatin, GL, and ILG, that inhibit the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome in the treatment of ALI, DN, NASH, and other NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases ( [Table 1](#t0001)). However, the pharmacological mechanism and clinical application of Glycyrrhiza via suppression NLRP3 inflammasome activation have not been systematically and thoroughly studied, and the specific action links are not yet detailed enough, especially at the cellular and molecular levels. As the chemical composition of Glycyrrhiza is complex and contains a variety of anti-inflammatory components, it is not clear whether these components have a synergistic or an antagonistic effect on inflammatory responses. Therefore, in-depth research in this area still needs to be conducted. Since Glycyrrhiza is one of the most frequently used TCMs, clarifying the molecular biological mechanisms and signal transduction pathways explaining how Glycyrrhiza inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome will better characterize its anti-inflammatory effect, and provide the basis for developing new indications and for guiding clinical use of Glycyrrhiza. This has important theoretical and practical significance. | | Table 1 NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors as Well as Their Effects in Glycyrrhiza for NLRP3-Driven Diseases Acknowledgments This work has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81874368, 81630100, 81721002), Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
