Sheryl Hongsermeier, L.Ac., Dipl.OM, R.N., MA.Ed. I am licensed in Maryland in Acupuncture for over 15 years. I am Board Certified in Oriental Medicine with the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). I am currently serving on the Maryland Board of Acupuncture. I have a Diploma in Acupuncture from the Maryland Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and a Certificate in Chinese Herbology from the Tai Sophia Institute. I received a Masters degree in Educational Psychology (with a Specialty in Child and Family Development) from the University of Missouri. I worked as a Registered Nurse for 33 years and have experience in a variety of hospital clinical settings. My educational background, nursing, and acupuncture/herbal experience enable me to assist people with their health challenges. My focus is to help people recognize their healthcare priorities and support them as they take an active role in their health management and well-being. I hosted a talk radio show with [www.voiceamerica.com](http://www.voiceamerica.com), called \"Sticking to the Point/ Natural Medicine Radio with Sheryl Hongsermeier.\" Please take some time to listen to the many topics and guests I interviewed on the Media page on this website. PUT YOUR BODY IN GOOD HANDS Release, Relax, Unwind ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is one of the oldest known methods of healing and has been used to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease for over two thousand years. Using needles as fine as a human hair, I stimulate acupoints to draw qi, or vital life energy, to specific areas of the body. It works by promoting the circulation of blood and lymph and by regulating normal healthy body functions that are too frequently undermined by poor diet, inadequate rest and excess stress. Acupuncture produces results relatively quickly. Acupuncture is often associated with pain management but it is very helpful in lessening severity of many Internal Medicine problems such as headaches, asthma, GI disorders. CHINESE HERBS I often recommend Chinese herbal formulas to sustain and augment your acupuncture treatments. Chinese herbs have been found to be a safe and effective way to support health and healing for many internal medicine issues. Chinese herbal formulas contain a variety of herbs that work together to promote the body's own healing mechanisms. Herbs are gaining popularity as people seek gentler, more natural remedies for common health challenges. Having worked as a nurse ( R.N.) for many years, I have a great understanding of the action of drugs given by allopathic doctors and know drug/ herb interactions. I seldom recommend the purchase and use of individual herbs and I discourage people from buying herbs recommended from literature/Internet/ well-meaning friends/ allopathic doctors. Herbs are powerful and effective when prescribed by trained herbalists. MEDICAL QI GONG THERAPY Acupuncture and Chinese herbs work with qi energy. I also use my hands to work with qi. Through gentle qi gong the body's own internal energy intelligence is encouraged to awaken and promote the free flow of qi from within. Stress and tension in the body causes qi to stagnate, resulting in chronic stiffness and pain. With hands-on qi therapy, I can release chronic tension patterns and improve your body's movement. I also instruct patients how to do simple qi gong movements for self-care at home. I highly encourage people to take Tai Qi/ Qi Gong classes and will help them find classes that are a good fit for them. ALLERGY REDUCTION A significant number of people I see in the D.C. Metro area suffer from reactions to various environmental and food allergens. Regular acupuncture treatment and herbal supplementation helps keep the immune system more stable and people react less intensely to allergic triggers. I offer food and nutritional counseling as needed for people. MASSAGE THERAPY I am fortunate to have available skilled and gentle massage therapy with a licensed massage therapist (Pam Broomall) available for my clients on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therapeutic massage is an excellent complement to acupuncture treatment. Massage promotes qi and circulation, reduces tension and enhances your well-being.
