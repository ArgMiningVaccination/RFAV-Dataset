How to Keep Pets and Plants Safe Convincing your pets and houseplants to live in harmony can be a challenge. As well-behaved as Fluffy may be, turn your head and you're likely to find her taking a bite or scratching the soil of your beloved houseplant. Even \"safe\" plants can make your pets sick if they eat too much of them. Of course, that's not too great for the plant, either. To help your plants and pets successfully cohabitate, try these tips: Keep unsafe plants in off-limits spaces. If you're keeping toxic plants, put them in areas closed off from your pets or make them unreachable, such as on high shelves on a bookshelf, or in a bathroom or spare bedroom that's kept shut.Ensure pets are safe when they're unsupervised. Crating or blocking your pets from areas with plants can help ensure they can't eat them when you're not around.Cover the soil. If your pets are diggers, keep them from tearing up the soil by covering the soil with shells, pebbles, tin foil, or other materials that won't feel good under their paws.Offer alternatives to dig or chew. Make plants less enticing by offering pets alternative spots where they can scratch or chew, like chew toys, scratching posts, or even a \"digging spot\" in the garden.Use spray deterrents. Applying a no-chew spray\u2014like bitter apple or diluted lemon juice\u2014helps to deter pets from chomping on delicate leaves. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!
