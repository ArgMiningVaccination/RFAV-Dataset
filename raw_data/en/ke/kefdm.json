A mineral-rich resin used in Ayurveda By Alena Clark, PhD Updated on June 25, 2022 Medically reviewed by Allison Herries, RDN Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Uses Side Effects Precautions Dosage Toxicity Interactions How to Store Frequently Asked Questions Sources & What to Look For Shilajit is one of many herb and mineral formulations used in Ayurveda, a healing system that originated thousands of years ago in India. Shilajit has been used in traditional herbal medicine to treat a wide variety of conditions. It contains an important compound known as fulvic acid and is rich in minerals. Shilajit, a blackish-brownish resin, comes from layers of rock found in several mountain ranges worldwide, including the Himalayan, Tibetan, and Altai mountains. Shilajit is available as a dietary supplement. This article describes the potential uses of shilajit. It also covers the risk factors and side effects of taking shilajit. Dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn't mean they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications. Supplement Facts Active FDASuggested Dose: No suggested recommended dose.Safety Considerations: Not suggested during pregnancy, lactation, or for children. Uses of Shilajit Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist, pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. Research on the potential health benefits of shilajit is limited. While shilajit has been studied in lab and animal studies for health conditions (e.g., chronic fatigue, anemia, diabetes, chronic pain), there is NOT enough evidence to support its use for any of these conditions due to lack of human research. More research is needed. Very few welldesigned, placebocontrolled, peer-reviewed human studies have been published. Alzheimer's Disease Shilajit contains an antioxidant known as fulvic acid. A 2012 study found that this fulvic acid in shilajit may help block the buildup of tau. Tau is a type of protein that forms twisted clusters of dead and dying nerve cells known as neurofibrillary tangles. Tau is considered a key marker of Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases. Another research study conducted in 2012 with 16 people with probable Alzheimer's disease showed less cognitive worsening (e.g., confusion, memory loss) over 24 weeks compared with the placebo group. This was measured by mental examination tests. It is important to note that researchers used a combination formula of shilajit and B vitamins, not just shilajit. The researchers of both studies note that more research is needed to determine whether shilajit can play a role in Alzheimer's disease. Sperm Count A 2010 study published in the journal Andrologia investigated the effects of shilajit on sperm in 35 infertile men. The people in the study took 100 milligrams (mg) of processed shilajit in capsule form twice daily for 90 days. At the end of the study period, 28 participants showed significant increases in total sperm count, the amount of healthy sperm, and sperm motility, a measure of how well sperm move. High Cholesterol A small study published in 2003 found improvements in cholesterol levels. The study included 30 individuals, ranging in age from 16 to 30 years. Participants were randomly placed in two groups. One group of 20 participants took 2 grams of shilajit per day for 45 days, and another group of 10 participants took a placebo. Researchers found significant decreases in cholesterol levels and triglycerides in the shilajit group compared to the placebo group. High cholesterol and high triglycerides increase the risk of developing heart disease. The shilajit group also had improved antioxidant status, a measure of how well the body protects cells from damage. However, researchers tested for\u2014but did not see\u2014changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, or body weight. Verywell What Are the Side Effects of Shilajit? Consuming a supplement like shilajit may have potential side effects. These side effects may be common or severe. Due to a lack of research, little is known about the safety of short-term or long-term use of shilajit. However, there are some possible concerns and side effects, including: Shilajit may increase iron levels, as found in animal model studies. Therefore, people with conditions such as hemochromatosis (an excess of iron in the blood) should avoid it until more research in human studies can be completed. Shilajit may alter the body's hormone levels, including a significant increase in levels of total testosterone. Raw or unprocessed shilajit may be contaminated with heavy metals or fungus that can make you sick. Precautions Pregnant or breastfeeding people and children shouldn't take shilajit in any form. As noted above, it is also best to avoid shilajit if you have hemochromatosis or concerns with testosterone. Dosage: How Much Shilajit Should I Take? Always speak with a healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs. There is not enough scientific evidence to determine a standard or appropriate dose of shilajit. Studies investigating shilajit have used varying amounts, although participants are generally under medical supervision. More research is needed on dosages for specific health needs and populations What Happens If I Take Too Much Shilajit? There is not a recommended amount as noted above. As a rule of thumb, never take more than the manufacturer's recommended dosage. If you experience side effects of any sort, stop taking shilajit and call your healthcare provider. Interactions Currently, there are no known interactions with different medications due to a lack of research. It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications. How to Store Shilajit Store shilajit according to manufacturer's directions. Discard as indicated on the packaging. Frequently Asked Questions What are the side effects of shilajit?

Until more research can be done, it is not recommended that pregnant or lactating individuals take shilajit. Sources of Shilajit & What to Look For Shilajit Supplements Shilajit is sold in several forms, including capsules, powder, and liquid. It can come in various colors (e.g., white or black) and have a strong odor. It is usually not found as a food source but may be added to beverages. Some products may be contaminated with dangerous substances, such as heavy metals. Even substances that are labeled \"purified\" may contain contaminants. No scientific evidence suggests which form is best. Additionally, there are safety concerns when taking this or any supplement. Remember that it is illegal for any company to market a dietary supplement product as a treatment or cure for a specific disease. Summary Shilajit is a mineral-rich resin that has long been used in Ayurveda healing. Today, some preliminary studies claim it can aid in treating mild Alzheimer's disease and high cholesterol. However, more clinical trials with humans need to be completed to understand the effects and dosage amounts. While research is limited, possible side effects include increased iron levels in the blood and altered hormone levels. Like most supplements, shilajit is not regulated by the FDA, so it's important to let your healthcare provider know if you're considering using shilajit for any health purpose. 9 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
