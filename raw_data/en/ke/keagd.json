Pain in America delivers an insightful look at the scope of chiropractic care in the U.S., how it is used, and the perceptions and often misconceptions by the public. Chiropractic care is perhaps the most cost-effective treatments for back and neck pain, and headaches. The documentary provides a history of chiropractic's evolution and widespread use, especially for sports and by the Veteran's Administration, and how it has become widely accepted across the nation's healthcare system. It also looks at common misconceptions and how the practice is portrayed and often maligned by the media. The film further examines how the new Affordable Care Act affects the chiropractic profession, and attempts by practitioners and educators to better inform the vast number of Americans that do not presently enjoy the benefits of chiropractic care. Finally Pain in America explores how chiropractic medicine fits into a larger integrated healthcare system and how it can save millions of dollars in the care of the Baby Boom generation and generations to follow. Barrett considers Pain in America one of his most important films. \"I've made a film which will acquaint millions with the opportunities for pain relief afforded by chiropractic care,\" he notes. \"That actually means more to me, at this point in my life, than all the awards on the planet.\" As the leading educational institution for complementary, integrative and natural healthcare practitioners, NYCC was visited by director Barrett and his crew during filming - one of only four such locations. Barrett interviewed NYCC President, Dr. Frank Nicchi, as well as faculty members Drs. Jonathon Egan, Bill Lauretti, and John DeCicco, to gain more insight into the tangible long-term benefits of chiropractic care. \"We're honored to welcome Don Barrett to Seneca Falls to host a special premiere for his new film,\" said NYCC President, Dr. Frank Nicchi. \"Seneca Falls, NY was the inspiration for director Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life and the city has become symbolic of every-town USA in pop culture consciousness. NYCC's location is a perfect setting to present such a powerful film that underscores the core of the college's educational mission and the vital role that chiropractic care can play in mainstream integrated medicine.\" \"I want as many people as possible, many who suffer from chronic pain, to watch this film and give chiropractic a try,\" urges Barrett. \"What do they have to lose except the misery the pain brings to their daily lives? Chiropractors currently treat about 8 percent of the population - roughly 25 million people. If as a result of this documentary, that number moves up just four percentage points, it would mean an additional 12 and a half million patients getting the treatment they need. That's the greatest reward for which I could ever hope.\" Writer, producer and director Don Barrett was born into a motion picture family. His uncle was an Academy Award winning composer and his grandfather ran a major Hollywood studio music department. Barrett began his documentary filmmaking career with \"Powers of Ten,\" \"Closed Mondays\" and \"Scared Straight\" - winning him an Oscar, an Emmy and the coveted George Foster Peabody Award. He has gone on to create numerous award-winning films and documentaries including, \"Patrick Stewart Narrates The Planets\" (NASA Hubble Award), \"Nine Worlds\" (Best in Festival - Berlin), and \"The Voyager Odyssey\" (cited as the 6th Best Documentary Ever Made in \"The Greatest Movies Ever Made\" - Editors of Entertainment Weekly - Time Life). His videos have sold more than four million copies.
