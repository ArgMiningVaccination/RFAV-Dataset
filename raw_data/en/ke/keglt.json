But according to ayurveda, the heat that's generated during the cooking process partially digests the food for you, and liberates nutrients so that they are more available for assimilation. Raw food, in turn, requires more agni, or digestive fire, to process than cooked food. To determine how much raw food is right for your diet, pay attention to the strength of your digestion. If your metabolism is weak and you eat sprouts, they may cause gas, bloating, and constipation. Eating raw food may also throw you off balance when you're feeling worn out or ungrounded.
