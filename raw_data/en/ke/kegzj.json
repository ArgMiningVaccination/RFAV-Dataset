Kingsberg, PhD16 Abstract The objective of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) Expert Consensus Panel was to create a point of care algorithm for treatinggenitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in women with or at high risk for breast cancer. The consensusrecommendations will assist healthcare providers in managing GSM with a goal of improving the care and quality oflife for these women. The Expert Consensus Panel is comprised of a diverse group of 16 multidisciplinary experts well respected in their fields. The panelists individually conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in their respective areas of expertise. They then met to discuss the latest treatment options for genitourinary syndrome ofmenopause (GSM) in survivors of breast cancer and review management strategies for GSM in women with or athigh risk for breast cancer, using a modified Delphi method. This iterative process involved presentationssummarizing the current literature, debate, and discussion of divergent opinions concerning GSM assessmentand management, leading to the development of consensus recommendations for the clinician. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is more prevalent in survivors of breast cancer, is commonly undiagnosed and untreated, and may have early onset because of cancer treatments or risk-reducing strategies. The paucity of evidence regarding the safety of vaginal hormone therapies in women with or at high risk for breast cancer has resulted in avoidance of treatment, potentially adversely affecting quality of life and intimate relationships. Factorsinfluencing decision-making regarding treatment for GSM include breast cancer recurrence risk, severity ofsymptoms, response to prior therapies, and personal preference. We review current evidence for various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic modalities in women with a history of or at high risk for breast cancer and highlight the substantial gaps in the evidence for safe andeffective therapies and the need for future research. Treatment of GSM is individualized, with nonhormonetreatments generally being first line in this population. The use of local hormone therapies may be an option for some women who fail nonpharmacologic and nonhormone treatments after a discussion of risks and benefits and review with a woman's oncologist. We provide consensus recommendations for an approach to the management of GSM inspecific patient populations, including women at high risk for breast cancer, women with estrogen-receptor positivebreast cancers, women with triple-negative breast cancers, and women with metastatic disease.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a con- stellation of physical changes and symptoms including vul-vovaginal dryness, burning, or irritation; dyspareunia; andurinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria, or recurrent urinarytract infection (UTI) associated with estrogen deficiency. 2 Although GSM affects more than 50% of the general popula-tion of postmenopausal women, it is even more pervasive in survivors of breast cancer, 3-7most of whom are undiagnosed and untreated.8,9 Many survivors of breast cancer experience earlier onset of GSM symptoms because of chemotherapy-induced ovarianinsufficiency, surgical removal of the ovaries, or radiationtherapy. 10,11Compounding the situation, the use of adjuvant endocrine therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRh) 82.4% in 2013 inwomen with hormone-receptor positive cancers. 12Addition- ally, the recommended duration of these therapies hasextended from 5 to 10 years. 13For the menopausal population who have been diagnosed with or are at high risk for breastcancer, many have the added burden of not being a candidatefor or being reluctant to use hormone therapies to manage symptoms. Given that GSM is highly prevalent in women with breast cancer, it is important for clinicians to query women aboutsymptoms. 14Data suggest that long-term survivors of breast cancer often report normalization of physical and emotionalfunctioning but experience continued difficulty with sexualfunctioning and satisfaction for 5 or more years after treat-ment. 15Women may be reluctant to bring up the topic of vaginal and sexual health and are often relieved when their clinicians begin a conversation. Even women who are notcomfortable discussing sexual health at the first encountermay be willing to do so in subsequent visits. A retrospectivechart review of 800 women from a breast cancer survivorship clinic at a major national cancer center found that only 39.8%of the 279 women with documented GSM symptoms receivedany form of treatment or referral for treatment. 8 Clinician reluctance to treat may reflect the paucity of evidence regarding safety of currently available therapies for GSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer.16The unintended consequence is that women are driven to untestedand non-FDA-approved therapies. In women with a history ofbreast cancer, the decision of how to treat GSM depends onmany factors, including receptor status, genetic character-istics, extent of disease, time interval since diagnosis, andresponse to prior therapies. Care for women with or at highrisk for breast cancer would be enhanced by an evidence- based compilation of available GSM treatment options, along with a discussion of limitations in the science concerning risksspecific to this population. In these consensus recommendations, prepared by a multi- disciplinary group of experts, we review current evidence andprovide recommendations for assessment and treatment ofGSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer andhighlight the substantial research gaps in clinical evidence for safe and effective treatment strategies. 16-22 IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT Screening The simplest approach for clinicians to detect sexual problems related to GSM is to start a conversation with thewoman when it feels relevant during the encounter. Clinicianscan begin with a ubiquity statement such as, ''Many women after menopause ...undergoing breast cancer treatment ... have concerns about sexual functioning, ''followed by a close-ended question: ''What responses: ''Tell me about it. '' 23This demonstrates that the clinician thinks discussing sexual healthis important and normalizes and universalizes sexual concernsfor women. 24Clinicians can also ask a direct screening question such as, ''Do you have any problems or concerns related to sex or pain with sexual activity? '' Structured approaches to incorporating sexuality into clini- cal practice provide strategies for identification, assessment,management, and/or referral for sexual health concerns.

In history taking, validate her con- cerns and elicit her priorities. There are readily available, simple, and effective tools for identification of symptoms andassessment of effect on QOL, including the Day-to-DayImpact of Vaginal Aging questionnaire 27and the Sexual Symptom Checklist for Women After Cancer.28 In addition to a complete history, which includes review of potential medications that might cause vaginal dryness,women with genitourinary complaints should undergo a physical examination before starting treatment. The exami- nation should include visual external inspection, speculum,and bimanual pelvic examination as clinically relevant and toexclude other conditions that might mimic GSM, such asvaginitis, lichen sclerosus, or other dermatopathology. Duringan examination, the woman and clinician can review areas ofconcern, and women can be educated regarding anatomy andinstructed in the application of local therapies, using a hand mirror as needed. Assessment of breast cancer risk Identification of women at high risk for breast cancer may factor into shared decision-making regarding the use of localhormone therapies for GSM. Breast cancer risk is increased inwomen with a family history of breast cancer or a personalhistory of breast biopsy and in women with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma treated with mantle radiation. Breast cancer risk assessment tools including the Breast Cancer RiskAssessment Tool, 29Claus,30Breast Cancer Surveillance Con- sortium,31Tyrer-Cuzick (International Breast Cancer Inter- vention Study),32and others are useful to more accuratelydefine risk.33-35There is no single cut-off for defining high risk for breast cancer; however, the American Society ofClinical Oncology concludes that women with an estimated5-year risk of 1.67% or greater are candidates for chemopre-vention, 36and high-risk women, defined by a lifetime risk of more than 20%, are candidates for enhanced surveillance with breast magnetic resonance imaging.37 When assessing women with GSM with a history of breast cancer, it is important for the clinician to identify factors thatmay affect decision-making. These factors include balancingthe risk of recurrence, which is influenced by the stage andgrade of the cancer; presence of lymphovascular invasion;hormone-receptor status; use of endocrine therapy; and thetime since diagnosis, with the severity of genitourinary symptoms, QOL, and efficacy of conservative therapies (Table 1). Although data are lacking, based on our consensusopinion, women with an overall lower risk of recurrenceversus higher risk; with receptor-negative versus receptor-positive disease; using tamoxifen versus AIs; and with severesymptoms and greater concerns about quality of life versusfewer symptoms and concerns may be better candidates forlocal hormone therapy. TREATMENT Validating the effect of GSM on survivors of breast cancer and the importance of seeking treatment for relieving symp-toms and improving QOL is critical. The clinician shouldexplain the pathophysiology of GSM and review potentialgenitourinary effects of breast cancer treatment. Counseling patients with or at high risk for breast cancer about treatment options for GSM should include a shared decision-making approach employing principles of informedconsent. 38The discussion about treatment options should include the mechanism of action, if known; potential adverseeffects; current data regarding efficacy and safety; and thebenefits and risks of each treatment option. 39Clinicians should evaluate the woman's perceived need for treatmentversus fears regarding breast cancer risk or recurrence risk. Additionally, consultation with a woman's oncology team is suggested. 18,40,41Finally, when therapy is initiated, follow-up care should be arranged to ensure improvement in or resolu-tion of symptoms and to assess compliance and barriersto treatment.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Nonpharmacologic treatment Although there are limited data to support the efficacy of over-the-counter products,42,43vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are considered the initial and mainstay treatmentoptions for GSM for women with breast cancer. 3However, these products are poorly differentiated and characterized.44 Vaginal moisturizers maintain tissue integrity, elasticity, andpliability and should be used on a regular basis independent ofsexual activity. 45,47Expert opinion, perhaps more than label- ing instructions, advocates frequent use. A 12-week multi-center, randomized clinical trial compared a 10- mcg vaginal estradiol tablet plus placebo gel versus placebo tablet plusvaginal moisturizer versus dual placebo. All three groupsdemonstrated similar reductions in the most bothersome symptom, with no evidence for superiority of vaginal mois- turizer or 10- mcg vaginal estradiol tablet over placebo gel. Limitations of this study include its short duration and use of aplacebo gel that could have augmented the placeboresponse. 46 Lubricants reduce friction and discomfort during penetra- tive sexual activity. The World Health Organization suggeststhe use of lubricants with an osmolality of <380 mOsm/kg. However, most clinically available lubricants do not list osmolality on the product label and have an osmolality thatexceeds this. An osmolality of <1,200 mOsm/kg is generally considered acceptable, with higher osmolality associated withmucosal irritation. 47Although lubricants with pH levels in the normal range for healthy adult women (3.8-4.5) are accept-able, those with pH levels /C203.0 are considered unacceptablefor human use, given the association with vaginal irritation in animal models. 47,48Additives such as parabens, glycerin, warming properties, flavors, and spermicides should beavoided because they may irritate vaginal and vulvar tissues. Lubricants may be water-, silicone-, or oil-based, and patient selection depends on individual preferences and sex- ual activity. Hybrid products may have characteristics of both lubricants and moisturizers. Hyaluronic acid gel has beenassociated with reduced clinical symptoms of vaginal drynessin women without breast cancer. 49There is concern regarding the use of natural oils (eg, olive, coconut) for lubricationbecause these products are associated with vaginal infec-tions. 50 In addition to the use of vaginal moisturizers and lubricants, regular use of vaginal dilators has been recommended for symptomatic vaginal atrophy3and has been found to reduce pain with vaginal penetration by improving vaginal elastic-ity. 51Patients should be counseled regarding the use of vaginal dilators in graduated sizes (either by themselves orwith their partners) to promote stretching of vaginal tissues.Vibratory stimulation, applied either to the vagina or directlyto the clitoris, has also been studied as a modality to reduce pain with vaginal penetration. 52Finally, pelvic floor therapy under the care of a physical therapist trained in the manage-ment of pelvic floor disorders is recommended to reduce painwith vaginal penetration; physical therapists may also behelpful in the direction of vaginal dilator therapy. 53,54 See Table 2 for a summary of nonpharmacologic treatment strategies.55 TABLE 2.

Therefore, both systemic and local estrogen-based treatments are controversial or discouragedfor women with a history of or at high risk for breast cancer. 20 Consensus to date has been to avoid systemic estrogens in women with a history of breast cancer or at a high riskthereof. 58-61Two Swedish randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of systemic hormone therapy (HT) in survivors of early breastcancer have been reported, with conflicting results. 62,63The HABITS trial was prematurely stopped after a median follow- up of 2.1 years because of a statistically significant increasedbreast cancer recurrence in the HT group. 62In the Stockholm trial, at a median follow-up of 4.1 years, the risk of breastcancer recurrence was not associated with systemic HT. 63 However, clinical trials of local estrogen therapies (ET) in survivors of breast cancer all suffer design or sample-sizeflaws. As a result, the applied dose or the amount of active ingredient absorbed into the systemic circulation have become surrogates for breast cancer risk. 64The assumption that less estrogen absorption would be less likely to stimulatethe breast or foster growth of recurrent breast disease has notbeen fully established because several lines of evidencesuggest that some estrogenic treatments may act more likeSERMs in vivo, and estrogens may cause breast cell apoptosisafter a period of estrogen deprivation. 65The FDA-approved prescribing information cites a prior history of breast cancer as a contraindication to estrogen, with rare exception.66For this discussion, and based on our consensus opinion, we willassume that less systemic absorption confers lower risk. Absorption of local ET varies by the active ingredient (potency: conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) >estradiol > estrone >estriol). 67It also varies according to the amount of active ingredient applied (eg, creams applied to a greater surface area in the vagina are more readily absorbed than vaginal tablets or rings); a product's formulation (bioadhe-sives are less absorbed than those with penetrationenhancers); where in the vagina the treatment is actuallyapplied (lower one-third of the vagina preferred over uppertwo-thirds due to the vascular connection with the uterus inthe upper vagina and potential for greater systemic absorp-tion); 68and whether the estrogen is applied topically to the vulvar skin and/or vestibule versus the highly absorptive vaginal epithelium. Absorption also varies greatly by thecondition of the vagina (atrophic vs estrogenized) and how long after application the assessment of absorption is deter-mined. The thin, atrophic vagina is highly absorptive, and thisdiminishes when the epithelium thickens in response to estro-genization. 69 Without evidence to support value in clinical decision- making, clinicians should be discouraged from measuring serum estrogen levels to assess systemic absorption of localestrogens as an indirect measure of risk for breast cancerrecurrence. Although the use of local vaginal estrogens hasinconsistently increased serum estradiol levels, 70-72there is a lack of clarity regarding whether higher levels within a narrowpostmenopause range associate with increased risk for breastcancer recurrence, and similarly, whether lower levels are reassuring. 71Even unmeasurable levels by commercially available estrogen assays can effect changes in distant tissues(ie, bone, 73liver74). Observational studies have suggested the relative safety of local ET, although definitive placebo-controlled, RCT dataare lacking. A large Finnish observational study identified noelevated risk of de novo breast cancer associated with the useof vaginal ET. 75Crandall and colleagues reported no increased breast cancer risk in healthy participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) observational study despitea very large sample size and duration of follow-up. 76In one nested case-control study, local ET was not associated with anincreased risk of recurrence in women with a history of breastcancer. 77 Vaginal DHEA Intravaginal 0.5% (6.5 are FDA-approvedfor postmenopausal with moderate to Two 12-week, 6.5 mg DHEA nightly showed significantimprovement versus placebo in vaginal cell maturation,pH, and dyspareunia because of GSM. 78,79The most common adverse effects are vaginal discharge (5.71%) and abnormal pap tests (2.1%). Intravaginal DHEA tested for 52 weeksshowed improvement in all domains of sexual function on theFemale Sexual Function Index (FSFI). 80One RCT of survi- vors of cancer (most with breast cancer) with moderatevaginal dryness or dyspareunia compared 3.25 mg versus6.5 mg compounded vaginal DHEA versus placebo over 12weeks, and although neither dose of DHEA showed improve- ment in either dryness or dyspareunia, the cohort using the 6.5 mg DHEA showed significant improvement in sexualhealth on the FSFI. 81 Clinical studies with highly sensitive assays show a slight but statistically significant increase in plasma estradiol andtestosterone to the lower half of postmenopause values afterprasterone administration. 82FDA-approved vaginal DHEA has not been studied in survivors of breast cancer, and its label includes a warning against this use. There are no studies directly comparing vaginal DHEA to vaginal estrogen inCONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Menopause, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2018 5 Copyright /C2232018 The North American Menopause Society.

SERMs Ospemifene is a systemically administered SERM approved for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy, with favorable effects on bone density and negligible endometrialsafety concerns. Despite antiestrogenic effects on the breast inpreclinical trials, the effects of ospemifene on breast densityor breast cancer risk have not been systematically establishedin healthy women nor has ospemifene been studied in womenwith breast cancer. Although it is not contraindicated forwomen in Europe with a history of breast cancer who have completed treatment, 83it is not approved by FDA for use in US women with breast cancer.21 Lidocaine Topical lidocaine for insertional dyspareunia was studied in 46 postmenopausal survivors of breast cancer with severeGSM, dyspareunia, increased sexual distress scores, or RCT evaluating 4% aqueous lidocaine saline applied with a cotton ball to the vestibule for 3 minutes before vaginal penetration showeda reduction in dyspareunia of 88% versus 33% with saline. See Table 3 3,55for a summary of pharmacologic treatment options. Off-label hormone options Vaginal testosterone The off-label use of vaginal testosterone therapy for treat- ment of GSM is controversial. Advocates cite evidence thatgenitourinary tissues derived from the embryonic urogenital sinus are rich in testosterone as well as estrogen receptors(ERs). 85,86 Clinical use of vaginal testosterone therapies is limited because no currently available local (or systemic) testosteroneformulations are FDA-approved for administration to women.In one trial, treatment of 80 healthy postmenopausal women for 12 weeks with a compounded vaginal cream containing 300mg of testosterone propionate improved vaginal signs and symptoms. 87 Because testosterone is converted by the aromatase enzyme to estradiol, concerns with increasing serum estradiol levels inresponse to testosterone therapy have confined participants inthe few trials of vaginally administered testosterone in womenwith a history of breast cancer to those also taking AIs, which block this conversion. 88-90In two of these trials, serum testosterone levels were not fully characterized,88,90whereas in the third, serum testosterone reached the supraphysiologicrange (200 ng/dL) after 4 weeks of treatment. Despite the factthat women in the third trial were taking AIs, 12% hadpersistently elevated estradiol levels as well. 91 Vaginal estriol Estriol vaginal preparations (gels, creams, and supposito- ries) are manufactured and government regulated in a numberof countries outside the United States where placebo-con-trolled trials have found benefit for vaginal symptoms inhealthy postmenopausal women. 92,93Limited evidence reported in a small RCT suggests that 0.5 mg vaginal estriolcream may also prevent recurrent UTIs. 94In one 12-week, open-label pilot study of 16 women with a history of breast cancer taking an AI, 0.03 mg estriol tablet in combination with lactobacilli improved vaginal symptoms.95TABLE 3.

In vitro studies demonstratestimulation of breast cancer cells by estriol. 96Estriol is not FDA approved for any indication. Vaginal laser The FDA has approved laser therapy for several medical indications (eg, refractive eye surgery, dental procedures,tumor and cataract removal, cosmetic surgery). Availabledata suggest that inducing morphologic changes in vaginaltissue with laser intervention can alleviate the symptoms ofvaginal dryness and dyspareunia accompanying GSM. 97-103 When treating GSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer, the microablative fractional CO 2laser or the non- ablative vaginal Erbium YAG laser (VEL) are options thatavoid hormone interventions, a potential advantage overpharmacologic therapies. Although the CO 2laser appears to target more superficial tissue, the VEL appears to remodeldeep collagen and promote collagen synthesis. This effectmay promote production of new collagen that ultimatelycould result in improved tissue integrity and elasticity. A recent parallel-group, short-term Brazilian clinical trial of the CO 2laser compared with 1 mg estriol cream in a cohort of 45 women suggests efficacy of laser alone or in combina-tion with estriol after 20 weeks. 104Recently, Pagano and associates published a retrospective case series of 82 survi-vors of breast cancer who failed to have adequate relief oftheir GSM symptoms with nonestrogenic local treatments. 105 These women were treated with three cycles of CO 2laser at 30- to 40-day intervals and demonstrated significant improve- ments in genital sensitivity during intercourse, vaginal dry-ness, decreased itching/stinging, dyspareunia, dysuria,bleeding, and movement-related pain when assessed afterthe three treatments. These benefits were significant regard-less of the woman's age or type of adjuvant breast cancertherapy. The authors noted that the optimal number of treat-ment cycles and the need for and number of retreatments remained to be defined and called for randomized, prospec- tive comparative trials. 106A prospective study of CO 2laser in 20 survivors of breast cancer demonstrated reduction inclinical symptoms of GSM in addition to significant changesin inflammatory and modulatory cytokines, but no change inthe vaginal microbiome 30 days after the second laser treat-ment. 107 A small Argentinian trial compared the Erbium laser (three treatments over 8 weeks; pretreatment with estriol 0.5 mg ovules for 2 weeks) with 0.5 mg estriol ovules administeredfor 8 weeks and noted significant and long-lasting improve-ment in symptoms in the laser-treated group after up to18 months of follow-up. 108 Although large, sham-controlled, RCTs have not been completed to date in women with or without breast cancer,one is planned (IBC Alliance trial). Available data suggest the VEL or CO 2lasers have the potential to ameliorate distressing GSM for survivors of breast cancer without the need for localhormone intervention. Placebo or active-controlled trials, long-term safety follow-up, and additional economic analysesare needed. SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS In this section, we review the data regarding management of GSM in specific patient populations. Treatment should be individualized, taking into account recurrence risk, the sever-ity of symptoms, effect on QOL, and personal preferences. Ingeneral, women with or at high risk for breast cancer shouldbe offered nonhormone therapies as first-line treatments formanagement of symptoms (Table 2). 55 Consideration of the use of local hormone therapies should include a woman's oncologist. Local hormone therapies, including intravaginal estrogens and DHEA, lack data in breast cancer populations but can be considered for use insome women, using a shared decision-making approach.Ospemifene is not FDA approved for use in women withbreast cancer, but as with DHEA and vaginal ET, can beconsidered for use in high-risk women who are not concur-rently taking another SERM for breast cancer risk reduction.The use of compounded local hormone therapies is not recommended because of concerns about the lack of FDA regulation and monitoring and the possibility of overdosing orunderdosing. Laser therapies lack adequate RCTs and long-term safety and efficacy data but may be considered in womenwho prefer nonhormone treatments after a discussion ofpotential risks, benefits, potential need for ongoing treat-ments, and cost (Table 4). Women at high risk for breast cancer Because approximately 75% of breast cancers are hor- mone-receptor positive, it is understandable that some womenat high risk for this disease or with a biopsy that confirmshigh-risk lesions, as well as the clinicians caring for them,may be apprehensive about the use of local hormone thera-pies. In women with a higher risk of breast cancer because of family history, data suggest that the use of systemic ET does not increase the risk of invasive breast cancer. In the WHI, useof CEE in women with an affected first-degree relative wasnot found to significantly increase risk of breast cancercompared with those receiving placebo. 109In the observa- tional Two Sister study, neither systemic ET nor estrogen plusprogesterone therapy (EPT) was found to elevate the rate ofbreast cancer diagnosed before age 50 in sisters of women with invasive or in situ breast cancer. 110 Three observational studies suggest that use of systemic HT does not further increase the risk of breast cancer in carriers ofthe BRCA -mutation over baseline risk after oophorec- tomy. 111-113Although these studies are limited because of observational design, limited size, and short duration offollow-up, they provide some reassurance that systemicHT does not increase breast cancer risk in carriers of the BRCA1 orBRCA2 mutation with intact breasts, a finding con- cordant with a systematic review. 114However, risk-reducingCONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Menopause, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2018 7 Copyright /C2232018 The North American Menopause Society.

Oralospemifene and vaginal DHEA have not been studied in high- risk women and lack a specific indication for use in this population. Women with ER-positive breast cancers Estrogen deprivation is a key therapeutic approach for the treatment of both early stage and metastatic ER-positivebreast cancers and prevention of new primary breast can-cers. 116The principal strategies employed are to block estro- gen at the level of the receptor with tamoxifen or to reduce estrogen production with AIs. Tamoxifen is a SERM, whichhas both partial estrogen agonist and antagonist effects. 117 Vaginal effects of tamoxifen vary, and some women notevaginal dryness with or without an increase in vaginal dis-charge. 118Aromatase inhibitors inactivate or block the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen by inhibitingaromatase, potentially resulting in worsening or development of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, decreased libido, and changes in sexual response.The two estrogen preparations with the lowest systemic absorption are 10 mg estradiol tablets, which result in a typical serum level of 4.6 pg/mL and a maximum annual deliveredsystemic dose of 1.14 mg, and the estradiol vaginal ring, which has a typical serum level of 8.0 pg/mL and a maximum annual delivered systemic dose of 2.74 mg. 64As vaginal tissue is progressively estrogenized and restored to health,estrogen absorption declines, and serum concentration sta-bilizes. 67The initial increase in serum estradiol is usually transient and with the estrogen ring and 10 mg estradiol tablets usually remains within the postmenopause range ( <20 pg/ mL). First-line therapy for the treatment of GSM in women with ER-positive breast cancer, as with all women with a history ofbreast cancer, should start with nonhormone options(Table 2). 55Local hormone treatment of women on either tamoxifen or AIs should be individualized, taking intoaccount the uncertainties of risks along with the risks ofdisease recurrence and severity of vaginal symptoms. 16The use of intravaginal estrogens in women on tamoxifen whose ERs are blocked is less worrisome to most oncologists than the use of intravaginal estrogens in women on AIs in whichestrogen levels are significantly lowered and any systemicabsorption may negate the efficacy of treatment. Women ontamoxifen with persistent, severe symptoms who have failednonhormone therapy and who have a low risk of recurrencemay be candidates for local estrogen or intravaginal DHEA.However, use of intravaginal DHEA should be used with caution in women who have androgen-receptor positive tumors and are using either an AI or tamoxifen.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.no data on safety or efficacy of DHEA in women on AIs. In women with more remote cancers, local hormone therapiesmay be considered in those at lower risk for recurrence, thosewith more severe genitourinary symptoms affecting QOL, andthose who have failed nonhormone, conservative treatments.Recommendations issued from The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Endocrine Society, and The North American Menopause Society(NAMS) cautiously support the use of local HT in consulta-tion with the woman's oncologist. 18,40,41 Women with triple-negative breast cancers No data address the safety or efficacy of local HT in survivors of triple-negative breast cancer. Given that hormone manipulation and lowering of estrogen levels is not a mainstay of adjuvant treatment in this patient population, it is reason-able to consider use of local HT for vaginal symptoms.However, it must be noted that tumors can be heterogeneous,and some ostensibly ER-negative disease may have some ER-positive components. 119-123Further, in women with remain- ing breast tissue and especially those who are at high risk ofnew primary disease (eg, carriers of BRCA1 orBRCA2 mutation), theoretical elevation of systemic estradiol levels may increase the risk of new primary disease, given thatprophylactic oophorectomy decreases the risk of the devel-opment of new breast cancer in women at risk but withoutcancer and in survivors with mutations. 115Nevertheless, despite a lack of data, in women who are long-term survivorsof ER-negative disease for which risk of recurrence is low andsymptomatology is troubling, consideration of local HT is reasonable. Women with metastatic disease Women with metastatic breast cancer are a diverse group with significant heterogeneity in prognosis, and there are nodata to inform decisions regarding the treatment of GSM.Despite the lack of data in this population of women, ifsymptoms are severe enough and QOL is a priority, the decision to use local HT in women with receptor-positive metastatic disease may be reasonable after a discussion ofrisks and benefits, particularly for those not using AIs. Inwomen with ER-negative disease or disease that no longerappears to be responsive to endocrine therapy, any of theavailable treatment options can be discussed as part of shareddecision-making that takes into account the importance ofQOL, comfort, and improved sexual function. CONCLUSION It is estimated that more than 2 million US survivors of breast cancer are affected by GSM, with most receiving notreatment. 8There are numerous, well-documented barriers to the treatment of GSM in postmenopausal women, and thepaucity of data in women with breast cancer is an additionalbarrier for this population. Despite current evidence and the cautious support of mul- tiple medical societies, including ACOG and NAMS, for theuse of local ET for management of GSM when other non- pharmacologic and nonhormone therapies have failed, 18,40,41 the safety of these therapies in women with or at high risk forbreast cancer has not been definitively established, and rec-ommendations for use remain controversial. Adding to theconfusion is the FDA-required class labeling of all products containing estrogen, including local ET, to warn of risk for multiple diseases, including breast cancer, despite the lack ofdata for low-dose local therapies with systemic absorptionwithin normal postmenopause levels. 124,125As a result, clini- cians often the path of nonmaleficence or primum non nocere , and women are left without treatment. Engaging clinicians caring for this population to ask about and treat GSM is important for QOL and requires consensus about treatment because clinical data are lacking. Additional research to further define safety and efficacy of availabletherapies, including vaginal estrogens, intravaginal DHEA,and different types of lasers, and to develop new therapies iscritical. Modifying the product labeling of low dose vaginalestrogen products to appropriately reflect the safety profilewill help inform both women and their providers. Womenwith or at high risk for breast cancer deserve high quality, comprehensive care, including evidence-based management of GSM. Consensus from this multidisciplinary group, whileawaiting more data, provides a framework for therapy.
