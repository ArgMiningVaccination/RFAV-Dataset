To attain global excellence and inspire trust as a world-class scientific organisation and authority, HSA must establish thought leadershipacross its unique blend of regulatory and scientific expertise. We seek new synergies across the professional knowledge and skills embodied in our critical resource - our people. As we move forward, our focuswill also be on forging strong partnerships with key counterpartsabroad, leveraging on technology innovation and driving knowledgetransfer. Even as they explore innovative modes of collaborative integration, HSA's three professional groups do face some unique challenges. TheHealth Products Regulation Group will look to harnessing IT solutionsto innovatively stretch the scope of pharmacovigilance, enhance theefficient processing of regulated products to maximise review proceduresand minimise delay, and develop new regulations in product areassuch as cell therapy and complementary medicine while enhancingthe regulation of generic products. The Health Services Group willendeavour to ensure an ongoing, sustainable adequate and safe bloodsupply to meet Singapore's future needs, embrace technologicaladvancement and innovation, and explore new aspects of cell-processing.The Applied Sciences Group will leverage on technological advancementsand scope out new areas that build on its current forensic and analyticalscience base, such as in the area of chemical metrology.HThe HSA Journ ey | 008Professor Edison Liu Chairman The challenges we face on our journey forward can be successfully overcome if HSA operates as a united entity and adopts a \"can do\" mindset across itsprofessional and corporate groups at all levels. I am more than confident that HSA will not just grow into but will flourish as a regulatory and scientific organisation that embodies intelligence,efficiency, clarity and integrity. It will become an exemplary agency thatwill not only positively impact the health and safety of Singaporeans, butalso world public health.CEO's PrefaceThe HSA Journ ey | 010T he past year has again been an eventful one for HSA as we advanced on our vision journey. We are delighted to work with our new Board, under theChairmanship of Professor Edison Liu. With the completion of our envisioningexercise in mid 2006, and our strategic regrouping into the Corporate HQ andthree professional groups - Health Products Regulation, Health Services andApplied Sciences - HSA looks ahead with optimism to all the possibilities thatawait us on the road ahead. I am continually encouraged by the commitment and quality of our people, who demonstrate tremendous dedication and potential. Across the professionalgroups, exciting possibilities exist to develop new synergies for growth with thediversity of scientific and professional expertise that currently exists in HSA, aswell as new skill sets that will come in over time. HSA is a distinctive organisationencompassing important functions normally found in a number of differentcounterpart agencies overseas. We therefore have unique opportunities todevelop innovative regulatory and scientific frameworks that could serve as newparadigms for the future. This fits in well both with our fundamental role as apublic sector organisation protecting and advancing our nation's public healthand the Singapore Public Service's increasingly global orientation. 011 | The HSA Journ eyIn order for this to come about, reviewing and clarifying our Core Values is a critical enabler to make HSA a Trusted, Teamed and Transforming authority. The organisational and individual congruence we need to enable us to accomplishour Vision and Mission must stem from a clear sense of our identity and purpose. Therefore, the strengthening and development of a strong and sound organisational culture is one clear focus for the year ahead, even as we continue to refine andimplement our strategic plans. We have also identified key organisationalinitiatives in the areas of enhancing our pro-enterprise orientation, reviewingour costing and pricing framework, and re-engineering key processes. Inrecognition of the value we accord to our people, a significant HR review is alsoongoing to ensure that HSA can attract the right people, retain them throughperformance and innovation recognition rewards, and develop them to their fullpotential. The HSA Journey is one of transforming possibilities into realities. The strong support of all HSA staff, our parent Ministry of Health and the HSA Board,combined with our understanding of the critical role we play in safeguardingthe health and safety of Singaporeans and the potential we have to extend ourrole as a global citizen, all combine to energise and motivate us for the journeyahead.

Mr Wong was the Director of the Centre for Medical Device Regulation [CMDR], Health Products Regulation Group since HSA's inception in 2001. In his scientificservice career, he received several awards and was conferred the prestigious Public Service Medal [Silver] in 1995. He has represented HSA at various national scientific committees and played a key role in regional and international meetings on medicaldevices. He continues to serve as a Special Advisor in the Health Products Regulation Group on a part-time basis. Dr Chow was the Director of the Centre for Forensic Science [CFS], Applied Sciences Group, also from HSA's inception. Across his forensic science career, he was instrumental in building up CFS and its predecessor departments to world-classstandards. Under his leadership, CFS gained international recognition for its forensic science capabilities and quality. It is among the few forensic science centres in the region to be accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/ Laboratory Accreditation Board [ASCLD/LAB ] since 1996.

In the past year, the Corporate HQ has seen a number of changes in its reporting structure and grouping of capabilities to strengthen its overall effectiveness. Four taskforces were formed and consultants were brought in to review and recommendenhancements to make the corporate systems relevant and prepared for new frontiers. The taskforces, headed by the Senior Directors and comprising representatives from both the CorporateHQ and professional groups, meet on a regular basis to review the four key areas of pro-enterprise, HR strategies and plans, business processes, and pricing and costing. Though newly established, the initiatives of these taskforces have been significant. The HR Strategy and Planning Taskforce,for example, is the key driving force behind the current and fundamental HR compensation and performance review in HSA. The Pricing and Costing Taskforce has initiated a study to reviewthe key costing assumptions and operational issues, while the Pro-enterprise Taskforce is rolling out initiatives to increase the interfacing with our stakeholders. These new efforts, together with our continuous striving for quality and standards, aim to make the Corporate HQ a strong,trusted and thriving arm of HSA to effectively co-ordinate and partner with the three professional groups as the whole organisation progresses forward on its journey towards excellence.

It administers and enforces the Medicines Act, Poisons Act, Sale of Drugs Act, Medicines [Advertisement and Sale]Act and Misuse of Drug Regulations and Smoking [Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco] Act. A robust framework comprising pre- and post-marketing regulatory activities is applied. This comprises pre-market evaluation, licensing and certificationactivities, on-going post-marketing monitoring through inspections and surveillance, and Adverse Drug Reactions [ADRs] Reporting to track continued standards of products marketed in Singapore. Our Centre for Medical Device Regulation [CMDR] has administered the interim Voluntary Product Registration Scheme [VPRS] for higher-risk medical devices since 2002. We are well on track to a legislated, regulated environment for medical devicesin Singapore. Our Centre for Radiation Protection [CRP] , while with HSA, was the national regulatory authority for the safe use of ionising and non-ionising radiation of irradiating apparatusand radioactive materials in Singapore. It enforced the Radiation Protection Act and its subsidiary regulations through a system of licensing and inspection. Besides personalised monitoring services and radioactivity analyses, it also provided consultancy and trainingon radiation safety. OThe HSA Journ ey | 044Innovative Regulation On 12 February 2007, the Health Products Bill was passed by Parliament. The resulting Health Products Act was designed as an omnibus legislationthat will consolidate, and eventually replace, the existing four separate Acts regulating medicines and other health-related products currently administered by HSA. The Health Products Act is notable in that itincorporates a legislative mechanism that allows the different controlling provisions in the Act to be effected on different categories of health products in a modular manner. This gives HSA more flexibility in tailoringdifferent regulatory regimes for different categories of health products, and avoiding over- or under-regulating any particular category of product. Medical devices is the first category of health products to be regulated under this new Health Products Act. Based on the principles endorsedby the Global Harmonisation Task Force [GHTF], which include licensing of medical device dealers as well as the products, the proposed framework underwent a two-month public consultation exercise between Februaryand April 2007. In March 2007, as part of our continuing efforts to engage stakeholders in the formulation of the medical device regulations, we also conducted an industry briefing to representatives from over ahundred companies. The Phase I implementation of this new framework by 2007 will bring Singapore in line with international best practices on the regulation of medical devices.Responsive Regulatory System To ensure that rules and regulations are kept current and meet the needs of our stakeholders in the changing environment, HSA conducts ongoing reviews of its rules and regulations inconsultation with its stakeholders. New initiatives arising from the regulatory reviews are developed together with our stakeholders and communicated to ensure clarity and transparency. The drug registration system and requirements were reviewed. The major initiatives are: for safety labelling updates to be submitted through notification rather than the approval process, allowing predictability and better planning by the industry the waiver of Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product [CPP] for new product applications where other forms of approval documents can be used as appropriate substitutes for a major revision of the drug registration guidance document for the industry, to enhance clarity and transparency To communicate these new drug registration initiatives, a two-day drug registration workshop for the industry was held in February 2007 and attended by over 200 industry representatives from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, France and the USA. The regulatory controls for Chinese Proprietary Medicines [CPM] were also reviewed and, in July 2006, the CPM product labelling requirements were revised to include an advisory on consumer discretion. The licensing requirements for retail pharmacists were also reviewed and streamlined. Since 1 July 2006, pharmacists are no longer required to amend Form C poisons licences when theypractise at pharmacy outlets under the same management. To improve transparency in the product classification system for health products and food and to assist traders in carrying out preliminary self-classification of products, we have jointly developed a Food-Health Products Classification Tree with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority. As part of our stepped-up efforts against retailers who illegally sell tobacco products to underage persons, the list of suspended tobacco retailers was made available on our websitefrom April 2007. 045 | The HSA Journ eyNetworked Risk Management Networking and strategic alliances allow HSA to tap on knowledge and data beyond the agency andstrengthen our regulatory decision- making and risk management processes. In FY 2006, we evaluatedand approved several major new drugs, which included: New Chemical Drugs New 2006, we introduced electronic reporting of ADRs, in addition to submissions through fax, mail or email. This was through the Critical Medical Information Store [CMIS]*of the Electronic Medical Record Exchange [EMRX]**. We worked with the Ministry of Health [MOH] to implement the drug safety module of the Healthcare Professional Portal [HPP], to enhance our outreach to healthcare professionals, important partners in our risk management system. Since June 2006, healthcare professionals in Singapore receive important and urgent drug safety alerts almost immediately throughSMS, e-mail and fax, and can make ADR report enquiries on-line. * CMIS [Critical Medical Information Store] of the EMRX serves as a shared electronic repository of patients' medical alerts, AD R and drug allergy data. The CMIS online ADR reporting form is also available at the HPP to allow healthcare professionals from the private sector to submit ADR reports. The HPP is a one-stop portal for the healthcare professional community to accessmultiple e-services relating to professional practice and information repository using single-sign-on through a common interfac e. ** EMRX [Electronic Medical Record Exchange] is an electronic platform which enables hospitals and government clinics across the two public healthcare clusters, National Healthcare Group and Singapore Health Services, to share vital patient medical information such as inpatient discharge summaries, medical history and laboratory results. The HSA Journ ey | 046Risk communication is achieved through drug safety alerts to healthcare professionals and the public, and the Adverse Drug Reaction News Bulletin . In 2006, we published three issues of the Bulletin, which was disseminated to over 9,000 doctors, pharmacists and dentists in Singapore. We also worked closely with the pharmaceutical companies to issue six Dear Healthcare Professional letters, which updated healthcare professionals on emerging and potential drug safety problems. In 2006, HSA participated in investigations initiated from alerts by the Singapore National Eye Centre [SNEC] on an increased incidence of Fusarium Keratitis seen in contact lens users at the centre. We worked closely with MOH, SNECand other local institutions, as well as the US Communicable Disease Center and US Food and Drug Administration. This eventually resulted in a voluntary withdrawal of Bausch & Lomb's ReNu products in Singapore on17 February 2006 and a global voluntary withdrawal of ReNu MoistureLoc Contact Lens Solution on 15 April 2006. The HSA Journ ey | 048043 | The HSA Journ eyGaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances Our Local Role HSA works closely with local and overseas agencies to prevent illegaland unsafe drugs from entering ourmarket. In 2006, we conducted severaljoint seizures on illegal codeine coughmixtures with other enforcement agencies, including the Central Narcotics Bureau [CNB], theImmigration & Checkpoints Authority [ICA] and the Singapore Police Force [SPF]. In one such operation, eightbarrels of 200 litres of codeine mixture were seized, the largest seizure of such mixtures by HSA. In August 2006, two individuals were arrested by CNB for illegally dealingin Dormicum. One of them, a foreign doctor, was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. The case involved15,000 tablets and was one of the largest seizures of smuggled Dormicum tablets to date. Working closely with ICA, we foiled several attempts to bring consignments of counterfeit and illegal medicinal products into Singapore. In one case, about 30 different types of illegalmedicinal products, amounting to 100,000 tablets and capsules with an estimated street value of over S$500,000, were intercepted and seized. In January 2007, we provided assistance to the Malaysian Health Ministry in their investigations on a case which involved the importation of an adulterated product, 'Miagra', worth RM14 million. During the year, we made presentations at various local radiological security and safety seminars, including the SIN/US \"Radiological Dispersal Device [RDD] Threat Reduction Workshop\"organised by Defence Science and Technology Agency, and Ministry of Defence's Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives seminar on Safety & Security. 049 | The HSA Journ eyForging Closer Ties within the Region ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality [ACCSQ] Product Working Groups [PWGs] In support of an integrated ASEAN healthcare vision led by the Ministry of Trade and Industry,the regulatory group continued to be actively engaged in numerous activities through PWGs established under the ACCSQ: Pharmaceutical PWG Traditional Medicines & Health Supplements PWG ASEAN Cosmetics Committee Medical Device PWG Together with its ASEAN counterparts, the PWGs worked towards harmonising regulatory measures in product and labelling standards, Good Manufacturing Practices [GMP] standards,registration dossiers, the post-marketing alert system and negotiations on a Mutual Recognition Arrangement [MRA] for GMP Inspections for Medicinal Products. Pharmaceuticals Product Working Group [PPWG] The PPWG held its 12 th Meeting in October 2006. HSA chaired the Implementation Working Group [IWG] and the MRA GMP Inspection Taskforce, which are responsible for coordinatingthe implementation of the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier [ACTD] and development of an MRA for GMP Inspection respectively. At the 12 th Meeting, an agreement was reached to allow the ACTD developed by the International Conference for Harmonisation [ICH] forinnovative products. Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group [TMHS PWG] With the support from the local traditional medicines and health supplements associations, we successfully hosted the 5 th ACCSQ TMHS PWG meeting on 27 and 28 July 2006 and a seminar which preceded the meeting. The meeting attracted 178 regulatory and industryrepresentatives from Asia, Europe and the USA and featured eminent experts from the World Health Organisation [WHO], Europe, USA and China. The 6 th TMHS PWG Meeting was held in December 2006 and continued to focus on working out the definitions of traditionalmedicines and health supplements, the studies and surveys on technical requirements, GMP standards, quality control testing, labelling requirements and the regulatory infrastructure and product placement system. The HSA Journ ey | 050ASEAN Cosmetics Committee [ACC] The 7th ACC meeting was held in December 2006. At the meeting, the ASEAN Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Cosmetic Products were formally adopted and Singapore was appointed to lead in its development. Medical Device Product Working Group [MDPWG] We successfully hosted the 5th ACCSQ MDPWG meeting in January 2007, which was attended by 95 government delegates and representatives from the ASEAN Secretariat and the medicaldevice industry. At the meeting, the member countries formally adopted the \"Dear Doctor Letter\" Guideline, which allows a manufacturer or competent authority to inform healthcare professionals of any product safety issues. In addition, Singapore's proposed framework on\"Post-Marketing Alert System\" [PMAS] that aims to facilitate inter-ASEAN adverse event and product recall reporting was also accepted. Asian Harmonisation Working Party [AHWP]* As the co-chair of the AHWP Technical Committee, we have been working with other member countries to fine-tune the post-market alert system and common submission dossier template.In February 2007, we also represented AHWP to participate in the GHTF Study Group 1 [SG1]** meeting in Japan. * The Asian Harmonisation Working Party [AHWP] studies and recommends ways to harmonise medical device regulations in the region and coordinates with the Global Harmonisation Task Force [GHTF] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]. ** The SG1 compares operational medical device regulatory systems around the world and is responsible for developing a standard ised format for pre-market submissions and harmonised product labelling requirements. 051 | The HSA Journ eyThe International Arena Memoranda of Understanding [MOU] In 2006, HSA signed MOU with Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch and theUnited States Pharmacopoeia. The MOU with the two international organisations aim to enhance mutual communication and scientific collaboration, encourage collaborative efforts in health products regulation, analysis and research, and increase the awareness of theimportance of the quality and safety of medicinal products between agencies. Relationships with the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration continue to be strengthened. International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] During the year, we participated in several IAEA events, which included delivering the Singapore Statement during the IAEA General in Vienna, and two regional co-ordination meetings on Public Exposure Control and Radioactive Waste Management in Myanmar and Indonesiarespectively. In July 2006, we hosted a week-long training course organised under IAEA/Regional Co-operative Agreement on the Organisation and Implementation of a National Regulatory Programme for the Control of Radiation Sources, including the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources. During the month, a study visit was also organised foran IAEA fellow from the Iran Nuclear Regulatory Authority to study Singapore's system of radiation control. WHO International Electromagnetic Field Project Advisory Committee As a member of the WHO International Electromagnetic Field Project Advisory Committee, we participated in the Geneva meeting in June 2007. The focused research knowledge sharedduring the meeting has enhanced the EMF control programmes locally. In addition, to strengthen international preparedness and regional response system for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies, we also participated in a National Competent Authority Workshop in Melbourne, Australia in November. The HSA Journ ey | 052International Medicinal Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce [IMPACT] Initiated by the WHO, the IMPACT is a voluntary grouping of governments, organisations,institutions, agencies and associations from developing and developed countries aimed atsharing expertise, identifying problems, seeking solutions, co-ordinating activities and workingtowards the common goal of fighting counterfeit medical products. To accomplish thismandate, IMPACT will focus on five key areas, namely: Legislative and Regulatory Infrastructure,Enforcement, Technology, and Risk Communication. Singapore, represented by HSA, wasnominated as one of the Vice-Chairs of the IMPACT taskforce and thus became a member ofthe IMPACT Planning Group. Five Working Groups were established to address the five keyareas of concern, and have been working independently to present their proposals at theSecond General Meeting in December 2007. WHO-sponsored GMP Audit During the year, we participated in GMP audits in China and India sponsored by the WHO as part of its pre-qualification programme to ensure medicinal products of acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy are available for United Nation agencies' procurement. We continued our obligations and commitments in several regional and international agreements and forums. Some of the major involvements include: US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement MRA on GMP Inspections with Australia MOU with the US FDA Singapore-Japan Joint Statement on Medicinal Product GMP Inspection under the Japan- Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention/ Pharmaceutical Cooperation Scheme [PIC/S] Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime [PFIPC] WHO-supported Western Pacific Regional Forum for the Harmonisation of Herbal Medicines [FHH] WHO-supported International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines [IRCH] ASEAN Working Group on Technical Cooperation in Pharmaceuticals [AWGTCP] Brunei-Malaysia-Indonesia-Singapore-Thailand [BMIST] Public Health Conference 053 | The HSA Journ eyThe Next Leg of Our Journey With the rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical and life sciences, the emergence of novel technologies and their application in health products development and Singapore's ongoing biomedical sciences initiatives, HSA is facing new challenges in regulating novel healthproducts with our limited resources. At the same time, this opens up new opportunities for the regulatory group to tap on HSA's other professional groups' expertise and external expertise in Singapore and abroad. As HSA moves forward, it is increasingly important for us to beinnovative in our regulatory approaches and capabilities development. We will enhance our capabilities in the following four key areas: 1.Conduct risk assessments of new health products, including medical devices, novel biologics and other innovative health products. HSA is building up our capabilitythrough expansion of our in-house scientific capabilities as well as by leveraging on expertise in our partner agencies and research institutes. By improving our risk assessment capability, we aim to enhance our professional evaluation capabilities and marketingapproval timelines. 2. Manage the evolving risks of products through systematic surveillance, enforcement and a risk communication programme. HSA will review and target implementation of effective risk-based programmes to monitor the safety and regulatory compliance of health products throughout product lifecycles. Our legislative framework will also beenhanced to enable HSA to more effectively enforce post-marketing studies from the pharmaceutical industry that will allow us to further characterise the safety profiles of selected drugs. We will also explore tapping the promising tools of pharmacogeneticsto innovatively detect ADRs in our local population, which in the future may facilitate approvals of certain drugs tracked under this scheme. In the area of risk communication, we will continue to step up efforts to provide early warnings to our healthcare professionals of emerging or potential drug safety problems to enable them to make discerning choices on the safer use of drugs and healthproducts. The HSA Journ ey | 0543. Develop smart regulation and policies for health products that protect public safety while facilitating the growth of the biomedical industry. HSA is refining its regulatory philosophy in line with our mission to wisely regulate health products by applying a risk-based rather than a \"one-size-fits-all\" regulatory approach. The recently passedHealth Products Act will be instrumental in helping us achieve these objectives. HSA intends to actively engage our stakeholders in the implementation of the Health Products Act, so as to better meet their needs and expectations in transparency, clarity,responsiveness and robustness in our regulation of health products. 4.Enhance our strategic alliances, connectedness and influence in the regional and international regulatory arena. This will position Singapore as a thought leader in the field and facilitate our participation in decisions shaping the future of the regulation of health products. Moving ahead, we will focus on efforts to strengthen relationshipsand develop closer co-operation with our key reference agencies and our regional partners in ASEAN. In the coming year, we will also actively participate and lead in regional and global initiatives, especially in ASEAN health products harmonisation,GMP inspections and anti-counterfeiting and enforcement initiatives. HSA will be organising the following major regional and global events in the coming year: PIC/S Meeting in Singapore PFIPC Meeting in Singapore ASEAN-China IMPACT Conference in Indonesia APEC Life Sciences Anti-counterfeiting Seminar in Singapore 055 | The HSA Journ eyThe HSA Journ ey | 056CRP Transfer to NEA After six years as one of HSA's professional centres since its formation in 2001, the Centre for Radiation Protection [CRP] was transferred to the National Environment Agency andbecame the Centre for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science [CRPNS] on 1 July 2007. CRP has built up a reputation over the years for having a sound capability in radiation protection in health and safety during the years under the guidance of HSA and CRP's predecessor departments. Faced with an ever-changing landscape, there are increasing demands for expertise in the areas of nuclear science, security and emergency response. This move has brought together experts from both health and environmental radiation science as they discuss how to bettermeet the challenges ahead at a national, regional and global level.

Thisaccreditation brings us membership of a respected organisation of international blood banks in the scientific community and affirms our high level of professionalism and commitment to quality blood banking. In our journey towards excellence, we partnered with national blood services in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific Region to form the Asian Pacific Blood Network [APBN]. In June 2006, wehosted the official launch of the APBN, which aims to promote blood safety and efficiency of operations through global co-operation and information sharing. This followed the signing of a confidentiality agreement amongst the member countries, which was formally ratifiedon 28 November 2006. We are also members of International Society of Blood Transfusion [ISBT] Working Parties for Haemovigilance, Blood Supply Management and the Hepatitis B Working Group. Along with Japan, Singapore is the only other country in Asia to join the European Haemovigilance Network, which aims to collect and exchange data on the effects of blood transfusion. The HSA Journ ey | 066Mapping Out New Areas of Research We actively seek to take advantage of the latest developments in blood banking science and information technology to improve the quality and efficiency of the services we offer. Our new state-of-the-art Cell Processing Laboratory was opened in 2006. This new facility is a fully GMP-compliant [Good Manufacturing Practice] laboratory dedicated to translational cell therapy work. We are currently involved in collaborative trials with the Singapore GeneralHospital. Ongoing research is also being conducted in the rapidly evolving fields of immunotherapy and new cellular therapies. 067 | The HSA Journ eyGaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances Our Local Role 2007 marks the sixth year of a strategic partnership with the Singapore Red Cross [SRC] to manage our national blood donor programme. The blood donor recruitment effort is complemented by our ongoing public awarenesscampaign on the importance of regular voluntary blood donations and the need to foster blood donation as a healthy lifestyle activity. Forging Closer Ties within the Region In our capacities as a World Health Organisation [WHO]Collaborating Centre for Transfusion Medicine and theWHO Regional Quality Management Training Centre, we continued to help in initiatives to improve the standard and practices of transfusion medicine in the WesternPacific region. Our regional training projects include conducting training for the blood transfusion service in Myanmar, providing external proficiency testing in pre-transfusion testing in blood centres across the Western Pacific region, and working with the SRC to provide donor recruitment training programmes in Thailand andMyanmar. We have also worked with Nanyang Polytechnic to produce, on behalf of the WHO, a training CD entitled \"Quality in Blood Collection\" . The HSA Journ ey | 070The International Arena We make it a priority to share and exchange knowledge within the global arena. In the year, we continued to participate actively in key international conferences as speakers and attendeesin the transfusion medicine arena. These included conferences organised by the WHO, AABB, International Society of Cellular Therapy, Japanese Society of Blood Transfusion, ISBT and South Asian Association of Transfusion Medicine. We are also a member of the WHO-convenedGlobal Collaboration in Blood Safety. To harmonise with international practices, we converted to the ISBT 128 barcode labelling system, an international standardised barcode nomenclature for transfusion medicine.Engaging with the Community In June 2006, we celebrated the 60 th anniversary of the National Blood Programme in Singapore with a unique World Blood Donor Day sandcastle-building activity and beach carnival. This was followed in July 2007 by a two-day scientific symposium themed \"Evolving Trends inTransfusion Medicine\", where regional and international experts in the field of transfusion medicine shared their expertise. 071 | The HSA Journ eyThe Next Leg of Our Journey In the coming year, we will be focusing our efforts on achieving accreditation of our Transplant Support Unit with the American Society of Histo-compatibility and Immuno-Genetics [ASHI]. Successful accreditation with ASHI will give our transplant support laboratory added international standing and recognition. New technologies to be introduced in blood collection include Red Cell Apheresis donation. In Blood Donation Processing, the use of semi-automated blood component extractors willbe introduced to streamline the workflow and further enhance the quality of blood components processed. Pathogen-inactivated frozen plasma and platelets using state-of-art pathogen inactivated technology will also be closely studied to determine their suitability for use intransfusions. Prevalence studies of the West Nile and Dengue viruses in our blood donor population will help to determine if new screening tests will need to be added for the blood supply. We will apply the latest information technology to create more patient-centric diagnostic laboratory services including Automated Pre-Transfusion Testing system, molecular analysisfor red cell antigens, flow cytometry for Human Lymphocyte Antigen cross-matching and antibody screening. Information technology will also be used to enhance our web portal for blood donors - Donorcare@HSA. Through innovative new additions, we hope to provide added convenience and ease in the blood donation process. Collaboration with Republic Polytechnic in utilisingprocess analysis tools in areas such as blood collection, processing and patient testing will further aid us in streamlining our processes and improving efficiency. Blood conservation is a new area in which we will work with hospitals to enable effective management of our blood supply. Through use of procedures such as autologous blood cell salvage, we can work with clinical colleagues to maximise every drop of blood that we collect.

Our academic collaborations include contributing actively to medical undergraduate and postgraduate education from NUS' Department ofPathology and Experimental Surgery of the Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre in the areas of forensic medicine, forensic pathology and pharmacy through various research projects. We alsocollaborate with Nanyang Polytechnic and the Genome Institute of Singapore on the local front, and World Health Organisation [WHO] and the United Nations internationally. Our Local Role In partnership with the CNB, we completed two projects, including an evaluation study on three on-site drug-testing kits; a survey to determine the consumption pattern of heroin and cannabis. The completion of the survey project on heroin and cannabis marked the conclusion to a series of surveys first undertaken in 2005 to determinethe consumption pattern of drugs abused in Singapore. The drugs coveredby the surveys ey | 084Forging Closer Ties within the Region In September 2006, we jointly organised the first regional DNA Symposium on Forensic DNA and Population Statistics Workshop with Applied Biosystems, which featured leading forensicexperts from the United States, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We also co-hosteda symposium with Dade Behring on 'Trends and Tribulations in Drugs of Abuse Testing' inMarch 2007, with board members from the International Association of Forensic Toxicologists[TIAFT] invited as speakers. For use by regional laboratories, we developed a gas chromatographic method for the quantification of safrole and isosafrole in sassafras oil. Both substances are precursor chemicalsused in the illicit manufacturing of N, -dimethyl-3,4-[methylenedioxy] phenethylamine [\"Ecstasy\"]. 085 | The HSA Journ eyThe International Arena On the international front, we continued our collaborations with WHO in the development of draft monographs onLamivudine Oral Solution, Lamivudine Tablets and Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets for the International Pharmacopeia. We also worked on the proposed additionalidentity tests for Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets and re-examined three international chemical reference substances: Diazoxide, Ethosuximide and Tolbutamidefor the WHO Collaborating Centre for Chemical Reference Substances in Sweden. We served as a WHO Temporary Advisor at a meeting on \"Specifications for Medicines and Quality Control Laboratory Issues\" and hosted the training of two WHOFellows in pharmaceutical analysis. We also filled the role of technical expert in the 41 st Meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for PharmaceuticalPreparation in Geneva, Switzerland. The 4 th Edition of The International Pharmacopeia was published in late 2006 with our collaboration. We collaborated closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC] on Project H44 - Scientificsupport to strengthen regulatory and law enforcementcontrol of amphetamine-type stimulants and theirprecursors in East, South and Southeast Asia. Since theproject's inception in May 2006, our newsletterDrugNetAsia has been published twice yearly to serve as a platform for the sharing of information among theregional forensic laboratories. In addition, we participated as a technical member at the International Laboratory Forum on CounterfeitMedicines [ILFCM] to share information on scientifictechniques that are used to detect counterfeit drugs andharmful substances in dietary supplements. The HSA Journ ey | 086015 | The HSA Journey Engaging with the Community Projects were carried out to improve the working environment for staff members, including promoting awareness of laboratory safety with a newly revised safety handbook and annual recognition awards. We also addressed the problem of proper disposal of chemicals and other wastes. Our community activity highlights during the year included visiting and hosting several lunches and dinners for the disabled elderly and senior citizens, a beach clean up and a recyclingproject. We are also committed to nurturing young scientists through our student internshipprogrammes and visits. The Next Leg of Our Journey We see a number of challenges on the horizon in our continuing effort to serve variousregulatory agencies.

Two key application projects, namely LISA [Laboratory Information Scientific Administration ] and FIONA [Forensic Integrated Operations Network Application ] are being developed for the Applied Sciences Group. When completed, both systems will help towards building a paperlessenvironment and promoting greater automation through enhanced workflow. To align with the Government directives for Web Interface Standard [WIS] and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG], the HSA website underwent a revamp and the new websitewas successfully launched in August 2007. In support of the drive towards a more synergistic public service through shared processes and systems, we also embarked on several shared IT and infrastructural initiatives projects. We collaborated with the National Library Board [NLB] and three other public agencies - Health Promotion Board [HPB], Media Development Authority [MDA] and the Standards,Productivity and Innovation Board [SPRING] to implement a shared Corporate ResourcesSystem [CREST]. With CREST, the areas in the management of Human Resource, Finance,Procurement and Administration will be handled more efficiently. We also leveraged on the MOH's Shared Infrastructural [MediNet] services, a centralised infrastructure for both website and Intranet management. To optimise resources and minimiseoverall maintenance cost, we are working closely with HPB and MOH to establish greatercentralised services for network and facility management. 097 | The HSA Journ eyQuality and Service Excellence Through the efforts of the Quality Service Committee, we have continually upgraded our service level and have created added value for customers through procedures and systemsreviews. In July 2006, the Committee introduced a more user-friendly feedback form for customers to better assess the service received and provide suggestions for improvement. We are guided by the Public Service \"Minimum Service Standards\" . In the quarterly Mystery Customer Survey co-ordinated by the PS21 Office, we have consistently achieved a 100%satisfactory mark. An internal Frontline Customer Service Audit helps to maintain ongoingservice standards. During the year, we received 4,485 and 1,660 returns through feedback forms and email respectively. To recognise staff members for their contribution in quality service and work improvement initiatives, the following awards were presented: Nine Quarterly Outstanding Service to Customer Awards [OSCA] One Annual OSCA Award One Team Outstanding Quality Improvement Award Moving Forward HSA will continually seek to strengthen our fundamentals - to make the organisation's Core Values resonate with all HSAians, and streamline and improve our processes further in supportof HSA's overall organisational developments. To ensure better organisation-wide alignmentof strategic directions and systems, we will be pursuing an integrated Organisational Excellencere-certification under the refined niche standards of I-Class and PDS.

To attain global excellence and inspire trust as a world-class scientific organisation and authority, HSA must establish thought leadershipacross its unique blend of regulatory and scientific expertise. We seek new synergies across the professional knowledge and skills embodied in our critical resource - our people. As we move forward, our focuswill also be on forging strong partnerships with key counterpartsabroad, leveraging on technology innovation and driving knowledgetransfer. Even as they explore innovative modes of collaborative integration, HSA's three professional groups do face some unique challenges. TheHealth Products Regulation Group will look to harnessing IT solutionsto innovatively stretch the scope of pharmacovigilance, enhance theefficient processing of regulated products to maximise review proceduresand minimise delay, and develop new regulations in product areassuch as cell therapy and complementary medicine while enhancingthe regulation of generic products. The Health Services Group willendeavour to ensure an ongoing, sustainable adequate and safe bloodsupply to meet Singapore's future needs, embrace technologicaladvancement and innovation, and explore new aspects of cell-processing.The Applied Sciences Group will leverage on technological advancementsand scope out new areas that build on its current forensic and analyticalscience base, such as in the area of chemical metrology.HThe HSA Journ ey | 008Professor Edison Liu Chairman The challenges we face on our journey forward can be successfully overcome if HSA operates as a united entity and adopts a \"can do\" mindset across itsprofessional and corporate groups at all levels. I am more than confident that HSA will not just grow into but will flourish as a regulatory and scientific organisation that embodies intelligence,efficiency, clarity and integrity. It will become an exemplary agency thatwill not only positively impact the health and safety of Singaporeans, butalso world public health.CEO's PrefaceThe HSA Journ ey | 010T he past year has again been an eventful one for HSA as we advanced on our vision journey. We are delighted to work with our new Board, under theChairmanship of Professor Edison Liu. With the completion of our envisioningexercise in mid 2006, and our strategic regrouping into the Corporate HQ andthree professional groups - Health Products Regulation, Health Services andApplied Sciences - HSA looks ahead with optimism to all the possibilities thatawait us on the road ahead. I am continually encouraged by the commitment and quality of our people, who demonstrate tremendous dedication and potential. Across the professionalgroups, exciting possibilities exist to develop new synergies for growth with thediversity of scientific and professional expertise that currently exists in HSA, aswell as new skill sets that will come in over time. HSA is a distinctive organisationencompassing important functions normally found in a number of differentcounterpart agencies overseas. We therefore have unique opportunities todevelop innovative regulatory and scientific frameworks that could serve as newparadigms for the future. This fits in well both with our fundamental role as apublic sector organisation protecting and advancing our nation's public healthand the Singapore Public Service's increasingly global orientation. 011 | The HSA Journ eyIn order for this to come about, reviewing and clarifying our Core Values is a critical enabler to make HSA a Trusted, Teamed and Transforming authority. The organisational and individual congruence we need to enable us to accomplishour Vision and Mission must stem from a clear sense of our identity and purpose. Therefore, the strengthening and development of a strong and sound organisational culture is one clear focus for the year ahead, even as we continue to refine andimplement our strategic plans. We have also identified key organisationalinitiatives in the areas of enhancing our pro-enterprise orientation, reviewingour costing and pricing framework, and re-engineering key processes. Inrecognition of the value we accord to our people, a significant HR review is alsoongoing to ensure that HSA can attract the right people, retain them throughperformance and innovation recognition rewards, and develop them to their fullpotential. The HSA Journey is one of transforming possibilities into realities. The strong support of all HSA staff, our parent Ministry of Health and the HSA Board,combined with our understanding of the critical role we play in safeguardingthe health and safety of Singaporeans and the potential we have to extend ourrole as a global citizen, all combine to energise and motivate us for the journeyahead.

In the past year, the Corporate HQ has seen a number of changes in its reporting structure and grouping of capabilities to strengthen its overall effectiveness. Four taskforces were formed and consultants were brought in to review and recommendenhancements to make the corporate systems relevant and prepared for new frontiers. The taskforces, headed by the Senior Directors and comprising representatives from both the CorporateHQ and professional groups, meet on a regular basis to review the four key areas of pro-enterprise, HR strategies and plans, business processes, and pricing and costing. Though newly established, the initiatives of these taskforces have been significant. The HR Strategy and Planning Taskforce,for example, is the key driving force behind the current and fundamental HR compensation and performance review in HSA. The Pricing and Costing Taskforce has initiated a study to reviewthe key costing assumptions and operational issues, while the Pro-enterprise Taskforce is rolling out initiatives to increase the interfacing with our stakeholders. These new efforts, together with our continuous striving for quality and standards, aim to make the Corporate HQ a strong,trusted and thriving arm of HSA to effectively co-ordinate and partner with the three professional groups as the whole organisation progresses forward on its journey towards excellence.

It administers and enforces the Medicines Act, Poisons Act, Sale of Drugs Act, Medicines [Advertisement and Sale]Act and Misuse of Drug Regulations and Smoking [Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco] Act. A robust framework comprising pre- and post-marketing regulatory activities is applied. This comprises pre-market evaluation, licensing and certificationactivities, on-going post-marketing monitoring through inspections and surveillance, and Adverse Drug Reactions [ADRs] Reporting to track continued standards of products marketed in Singapore. Our Centre for Medical Device Regulation [CMDR] has administered the interim Voluntary Product Registration Scheme [VPRS] for higher-risk medical devices since 2002. We are well on track to a legislated, regulated environment for medical devicesin Singapore. Our Centre for Radiation Protection [CRP] , while with HSA, was the national regulatory authority for the safe use of ionising and non-ionising radiation of irradiating apparatusand radioactive materials in Singapore. It enforced the Radiation Protection Act and its subsidiary regulations through a system of licensing and inspection. Besides personalised monitoring services and radioactivity analyses, it also provided consultancy and trainingon radiation safety. OThe HSA Journ ey | 044Innovative Regulation On 12 February 2007, the Health Products Bill was passed by Parliament. The resulting Health Products Act was designed as an omnibus legislationthat will consolidate, and eventually replace, the existing four separate Acts regulating medicines and other health-related products currently administered by HSA. The Health Products Act is notable in that itincorporates a legislative mechanism that allows the different controlling provisions in the Act to be effected on different categories of health products in a modular manner. This gives HSA more flexibility in tailoringdifferent regulatory regimes for different categories of health products, and avoiding over- or under-regulating any particular category of product. Medical devices is the first category of health products to be regulated under this new Health Products Act. Based on the principles endorsedby the Global Harmonisation Task Force [GHTF], which include licensing of medical device dealers as well as the products, the proposed framework underwent a two-month public consultation exercise between Februaryand April 2007. In March 2007, as part of our continuing efforts to engage stakeholders in the formulation of the medical device regulations, we also conducted an industry briefing to representatives from over ahundred companies. The Phase I implementation of this new framework by 2007 will bring Singapore in line with international best practices on the regulation of medical devices.Responsive Regulatory System To ensure that rules and regulations are kept current and meet the needs of our stakeholders in the changing environment, HSA conducts ongoing reviews of its rules and regulations inconsultation with its stakeholders. New initiatives arising from the regulatory reviews are developed together with our stakeholders and communicated to ensure clarity and transparency. The drug registration system and requirements were reviewed. The major initiatives are: for safety labelling updates to be submitted through notification rather than the approval process, allowing predictability and better planning by the industry the waiver of Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product [CPP] for new product applications where other forms of approval documents can be used as appropriate substitutes for a major revision of the drug registration guidance document for the industry, to enhance clarity and transparency To communicate these new drug registration initiatives, a two-day drug registration workshop for the industry was held in February 2007 and attended by over 200 industry representatives from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, France and the USA. The regulatory controls for Chinese Proprietary Medicines [CPM] were also reviewed and, in July 2006, the CPM product labelling requirements were revised to include an advisory on consumer discretion. The licensing requirements for retail pharmacists were also reviewed and streamlined. Since 1 July 2006, pharmacists are no longer required to amend Form C poisons licences when theypractise at pharmacy outlets under the same management. To improve transparency in the product classification system for health products and food and to assist traders in carrying out preliminary self-classification of products, we have jointly developed a Food-Health Products Classification Tree with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority. As part of our stepped-up efforts against retailers who illegally sell tobacco products to underage persons, the list of suspended tobacco retailers was made available on our websitefrom April 2007. 045 | The HSA Journ eyNetworked Risk Management Networking and strategic alliances allow HSA to tap on knowledge and data beyond the agency andstrengthen our regulatory decision- making and risk management processes. In FY 2006, we evaluatedand approved several major new drugs, which included: New Chemical Drugs New 2006, we introduced electronic reporting of ADRs, in addition to submissions through fax, mail or email. This was through the Critical Medical Information Store [CMIS]*of the Electronic Medical Record Exchange [EMRX]**. We worked with the Ministry of Health [MOH] to implement the drug safety module of the Healthcare Professional Portal [HPP], to enhance our outreach to healthcare professionals, important partners in our risk management system. Since June 2006, healthcare professionals in Singapore receive important and urgent drug safety alerts almost immediately throughSMS, e-mail and fax, and can make ADR report enquiries on-line. * CMIS [Critical Medical Information Store] of the EMRX serves as a shared electronic repository of patients' medical alerts, AD R and drug allergy data. The CMIS online ADR reporting form is also available at the HPP to allow healthcare professionals from the private sector to submit ADR reports. The HPP is a one-stop portal for the healthcare professional community to accessmultiple e-services relating to professional practice and information repository using single-sign-on through a common interfac e. ** EMRX [Electronic Medical Record Exchange] is an electronic platform which enables hospitals and government clinics across the two public healthcare clusters, National Healthcare Group and Singapore Health Services, to share vital patient medical information such as inpatient discharge summaries, medical history and laboratory results. The HSA Journ ey | 046Risk communication is achieved through drug safety alerts to healthcare professionals and the public, and the Adverse Drug Reaction News Bulletin . In 2006, we published three issues of the Bulletin, which was disseminated to over 9,000 doctors, pharmacists and dentists in Singapore. We also worked closely with the pharmaceutical companies to issue six Dear Healthcare Professional letters, which updated healthcare professionals on emerging and potential drug safety problems. In 2006, HSA participated in investigations initiated from alerts by the Singapore National Eye Centre [SNEC] on an increased incidence of Fusarium Keratitis seen in contact lens users at the centre. We worked closely with MOH, SNECand other local institutions, as well as the US Communicable Disease Center and US Food and Drug Administration. This eventually resulted in a voluntary withdrawal of Bausch & Lomb's ReNu products in Singapore on17 February 2006 and a global voluntary withdrawal of ReNu MoistureLoc Contact Lens Solution on 15 April 2006. The HSA Journ ey | 048043 | The HSA Journ eyGaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances Our Local Role HSA works closely with local and overseas agencies to prevent illegaland unsafe drugs from entering ourmarket. In 2006, we conducted severaljoint seizures on illegal codeine coughmixtures with other enforcement agencies, including the Central Narcotics Bureau [CNB], theImmigration & Checkpoints Authority [ICA] and the Singapore Police Force [SPF]. In one such operation, eightbarrels of 200 litres of codeine mixture were seized, the largest seizure of such mixtures by HSA. In August 2006, two individuals were arrested by CNB for illegally dealingin Dormicum. One of them, a foreign doctor, was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. The case involved15,000 tablets and was one of the largest seizures of smuggled Dormicum tablets to date. Working closely with ICA, we foiled several attempts to bring consignments of counterfeit and illegal medicinal products into Singapore. In one case, about 30 different types of illegalmedicinal products, amounting to 100,000 tablets and capsules with an estimated street value of over S$500,000, were intercepted and seized. In January 2007, we provided assistance to the Malaysian Health Ministry in their investigations on a case which involved the importation of an adulterated product, 'Miagra', worth RM14 million. During the year, we made presentations at various local radiological security and safety seminars, including the SIN/US \"Radiological Dispersal Device [RDD] Threat Reduction Workshop\"organised by Defence Science and Technology Agency, and Ministry of Defence's Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives seminar on Safety & Security. 049 | The HSA Journ eyForging Closer Ties within the Region ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality [ACCSQ] Product Working Groups [PWGs] In support of an integrated ASEAN healthcare vision led by the Ministry of Trade and Industry,the regulatory group continued to be actively engaged in numerous activities through PWGs established under the ACCSQ: Pharmaceutical PWG Traditional Medicines & Health Supplements PWG ASEAN Cosmetics Committee Medical Device PWG Together with its ASEAN counterparts, the PWGs worked towards harmonising regulatory measures in product and labelling standards, Good Manufacturing Practices [GMP] standards,registration dossiers, the post-marketing alert system and negotiations on a Mutual Recognition Arrangement [MRA] for GMP Inspections for Medicinal Products. Pharmaceuticals Product Working Group [PPWG] The PPWG held its 12 th Meeting in October 2006. HSA chaired the Implementation Working Group [IWG] and the MRA GMP Inspection Taskforce, which are responsible for coordinatingthe implementation of the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier [ACTD] and development of an MRA for GMP Inspection respectively. At the 12 th Meeting, an agreement was reached to allow the ACTD developed by the International Conference for Harmonisation [ICH] forinnovative products. Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group [TMHS PWG] With the support from the local traditional medicines and health supplements associations, we successfully hosted the 5 th ACCSQ TMHS PWG meeting on 27 and 28 July 2006 and a seminar which preceded the meeting. The meeting attracted 178 regulatory and industryrepresentatives from Asia, Europe and the USA and featured eminent experts from the World Health Organisation [WHO], Europe, USA and China. The 6 th TMHS PWG Meeting was held in December 2006 and continued to focus on working out the definitions of traditionalmedicines and health supplements, the studies and surveys on technical requirements, GMP standards, quality control testing, labelling requirements and the regulatory infrastructure and product placement system. The HSA Journ ey | 050ASEAN Cosmetics Committee [ACC] The 7th ACC meeting was held in December 2006. At the meeting, the ASEAN Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Cosmetic Products were formally adopted and Singapore was appointed to lead in its development. Medical Device Product Working Group [MDPWG] We successfully hosted the 5th ACCSQ MDPWG meeting in January 2007, which was attended by 95 government delegates and representatives from the ASEAN Secretariat and the medicaldevice industry. At the meeting, the member countries formally adopted the \"Dear Doctor Letter\" Guideline, which allows a manufacturer or competent authority to inform healthcare professionals of any product safety issues. In addition, Singapore's proposed framework on\"Post-Marketing Alert System\" [PMAS] that aims to facilitate inter-ASEAN adverse event and product recall reporting was also accepted. Asian Harmonisation Working Party [AHWP]* As the co-chair of the AHWP Technical Committee, we have been working with other member countries to fine-tune the post-market alert system and common submission dossier template.In February 2007, we also represented AHWP to participate in the GHTF Study Group 1 [SG1]** meeting in Japan. * The Asian Harmonisation Working Party [AHWP] studies and recommends ways to harmonise medical device regulations in the region and coordinates with the Global Harmonisation Task Force [GHTF] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]. ** The SG1 compares operational medical device regulatory systems around the world and is responsible for developing a standard ised format for pre-market submissions and harmonised product labelling requirements. 051 | The HSA Journ eyThe International Arena Memoranda of Understanding [MOU] In 2006, HSA signed MOU with Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch and theUnited States Pharmacopoeia. The MOU with the two international organisations aim to enhance mutual communication and scientific collaboration, encourage collaborative efforts in health products regulation, analysis and research, and increase the awareness of theimportance of the quality and safety of medicinal products between agencies. Relationships with the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration continue to be strengthened. International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] During the year, we participated in several IAEA events, which included delivering the Singapore Statement during the IAEA General in Vienna, and two regional co-ordination meetings on Public Exposure Control and Radioactive Waste Management in Myanmar and Indonesiarespectively. In July 2006, we hosted a week-long training course organised under IAEA/Regional Co-operative Agreement on the Organisation and Implementation of a National Regulatory Programme for the Control of Radiation Sources, including the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources. During the month, a study visit was also organised foran IAEA fellow from the Iran Nuclear Regulatory Authority to study Singapore's system of radiation control. WHO International Electromagnetic Field Project Advisory Committee As a member of the WHO International Electromagnetic Field Project Advisory Committee, we participated in the Geneva meeting in June 2007. The focused research knowledge sharedduring the meeting has enhanced the EMF control programmes locally. In addition, to strengthen international preparedness and regional response system for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies, we also participated in a National Competent Authority Workshop in Melbourne, Australia in November. The HSA Journ ey | 052International Medicinal Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce [IMPACT] Initiated by the WHO, the IMPACT is a voluntary grouping of governments, organisations,institutions, agencies and associations from developing and developed countries aimed atsharing expertise, identifying problems, seeking solutions, co-ordinating activities and workingtowards the common goal of fighting counterfeit medical products. To accomplish thismandate, IMPACT will focus on five key areas, namely: Legislative and Regulatory Infrastructure,Enforcement, Technology, and Risk Communication. Singapore, represented by HSA, wasnominated as one of the Vice-Chairs of the IMPACT taskforce and thus became a member ofthe IMPACT Planning Group. Five Working Groups were established to address the five keyareas of concern, and have been working independently to present their proposals at theSecond General Meeting in December 2007. WHO-sponsored GMP Audit During the year, we participated in GMP audits in China and India sponsored by the WHO as part of its pre-qualification programme to ensure medicinal products of acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy are available for United Nation agencies' procurement. We continued our obligations and commitments in several regional and international agreements and forums. Some of the major involvements include: US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement MRA on GMP Inspections with Australia MOU with the US FDA Singapore-Japan Joint Statement on Medicinal Product GMP Inspection under the Japan- Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention/ Pharmaceutical Cooperation Scheme [PIC/S] Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime [PFIPC] WHO-supported Western Pacific Regional Forum for the Harmonisation of Herbal Medicines [FHH] WHO-supported International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines [IRCH] ASEAN Working Group on Technical Cooperation in Pharmaceuticals [AWGTCP] Brunei-Malaysia-Indonesia-Singapore-Thailand [BMIST] Public Health Conference 053 | The HSA Journ eyThe Next Leg of Our Journey With the rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical and life sciences, the emergence of novel technologies and their application in health products development and Singapore's ongoing biomedical sciences initiatives, HSA is facing new challenges in regulating novel healthproducts with our limited resources. At the same time, this opens up new opportunities for the regulatory group to tap on HSA's other professional groups' expertise and external expertise in Singapore and abroad. As HSA moves forward, it is increasingly important for us to beinnovative in our regulatory approaches and capabilities development. We will enhance our capabilities in the following four key areas: 1.Conduct risk assessments of new health products, including medical devices, novel biologics and other innovative health products. HSA is building up our capabilitythrough expansion of our in-house scientific capabilities as well as by leveraging on expertise in our partner agencies and research institutes. By improving our risk assessment capability, we aim to enhance our professional evaluation capabilities and marketingapproval timelines. 2. Manage the evolving risks of products through systematic surveillance, enforcement and a risk communication programme. HSA will review and target implementation of effective risk-based programmes to monitor the safety and regulatory compliance of health products throughout product lifecycles. Our legislative framework will also beenhanced to enable HSA to more effectively enforce post-marketing studies from the pharmaceutical industry that will allow us to further characterise the safety profiles of selected drugs. We will also explore tapping the promising tools of pharmacogeneticsto innovatively detect ADRs in our local population, which in the future may facilitate approvals of certain drugs tracked under this scheme. In the area of risk communication, we will continue to step up efforts to provide early warnings to our healthcare professionals of emerging or potential drug safety problems to enable them to make discerning choices on the safer use of drugs and healthproducts. The HSA Journ ey | 0543. Develop smart regulation and policies for health products that protect public safety while facilitating the growth of the biomedical industry. HSA is refining its regulatory philosophy in line with our mission to wisely regulate health products by applying a risk-based rather than a \"one-size-fits-all\" regulatory approach. The recently passedHealth Products Act will be instrumental in helping us achieve these objectives. HSA intends to actively engage our stakeholders in the implementation of the Health Products Act, so as to better meet their needs and expectations in transparency, clarity,responsiveness and robustness in our regulation of health products. 4.Enhance our strategic alliances, connectedness and influence in the regional and international regulatory arena. This will position Singapore as a thought leader in the field and facilitate our participation in decisions shaping the future of the regulation of health products. Moving ahead, we will focus on efforts to strengthen relationshipsand develop closer co-operation with our key reference agencies and our regional partners in ASEAN. In the coming year, we will also actively participate and lead in regional and global initiatives, especially in ASEAN health products harmonisation,GMP inspections and anti-counterfeiting and enforcement initiatives. HSA will be organising the following major regional and global events in the coming year: PIC/S Meeting in Singapore PFIPC Meeting in Singapore ASEAN-China IMPACT Conference in Indonesia APEC Life Sciences Anti-counterfeiting Seminar in Singapore 055 | The HSA Journ eyThe HSA Journ ey | 056CRP Transfer to NEA After six years as one of HSA's professional centres since its formation in 2001, the Centre for Radiation Protection [CRP] was transferred to the National Environment Agency andbecame the Centre for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science [CRPNS] on 1 July 2007. CRP has built up a reputation over the years for having a sound capability in radiation protection in health and safety during the years under the guidance of HSA and CRP's predecessor departments. Faced with an ever-changing landscape, there are increasing demands for expertise in the areas of nuclear science, security and emergency response. This move has brought together experts from both health and environmental radiation science as they discuss how to bettermeet the challenges ahead at a national, regional and global level.

Thisaccreditation brings us membership of a respected organisation of international blood banks in the scientific community and affirms our high level of professionalism and commitment to quality blood banking. In our journey towards excellence, we partnered with national blood services in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific Region to form the Asian Pacific Blood Network [APBN]. In June 2006, wehosted the official launch of the APBN, which aims to promote blood safety and efficiency of operations through global co-operation and information sharing. This followed the signing of a confidentiality agreement amongst the member countries, which was formally ratifiedon 28 November 2006. We are also members of International Society of Blood Transfusion [ISBT] Working Parties for Haemovigilance, Blood Supply Management and the Hepatitis B Working Group. Along with Japan, Singapore is the only other country in Asia to join the European Haemovigilance Network, which aims to collect and exchange data on the effects of blood transfusion. The HSA Journ ey | 066Mapping Out New Areas of Research We actively seek to take advantage of the latest developments in blood banking science and information technology to improve the quality and efficiency of the services we offer. Our new state-of-the-art Cell Processing Laboratory was opened in 2006. This new facility is a fully GMP-compliant [Good Manufacturing Practice] laboratory dedicated to translational cell therapy work. We are currently involved in collaborative trials with the Singapore GeneralHospital. Ongoing research is also being conducted in the rapidly evolving fields of immunotherapy and new cellular therapies. 067 | The HSA Journ eyGaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances Our Local Role 2007 marks the sixth year of a strategic partnership with the Singapore Red Cross [SRC] to manage our national blood donor programme. The blood donor recruitment effort is complemented by our ongoing public awarenesscampaign on the importance of regular voluntary blood donations and the need to foster blood donation as a healthy lifestyle activity. Forging Closer Ties within the Region In our capacities as a World Health Organisation [WHO]Collaborating Centre for Transfusion Medicine and theWHO Regional Quality Management Training Centre, we continued to help in initiatives to improve the standard and practices of transfusion medicine in the WesternPacific region. Our regional training projects include conducting training for the blood transfusion service in Myanmar, providing external proficiency testing in pre-transfusion testing in blood centres across the Western Pacific region, and working with the SRC to provide donor recruitment training programmes in Thailand andMyanmar. We have also worked with Nanyang Polytechnic to produce, on behalf of the WHO, a training CD entitled \"Quality in Blood Collection\" . The HSA Journ ey | 070The International Arena We make it a priority to share and exchange knowledge within the global arena. In the year, we continued to participate actively in key international conferences as speakers and attendeesin the transfusion medicine arena. These included conferences organised by the WHO, AABB, International Society of Cellular Therapy, Japanese Society of Blood Transfusion, ISBT and South Asian Association of Transfusion Medicine. We are also a member of the WHO-convenedGlobal Collaboration in Blood Safety. To harmonise with international practices, we converted to the ISBT 128 barcode labelling system, an international standardised barcode nomenclature for transfusion medicine.Engaging with the Community In June 2006, we celebrated the 60 th anniversary of the National Blood Programme in Singapore with a unique World Blood Donor Day sandcastle-building activity and beach carnival. This was followed in July 2007 by a two-day scientific symposium themed \"Evolving Trends inTransfusion Medicine\", where regional and international experts in the field of transfusion medicine shared their expertise. 071 | The HSA Journ eyThe Next Leg of Our Journey In the coming year, we will be focusing our efforts on achieving accreditation of our Transplant Support Unit with the American Society of Histo-compatibility and Immuno-Genetics [ASHI]. Successful accreditation with ASHI will give our transplant support laboratory added international standing and recognition. New technologies to be introduced in blood collection include Red Cell Apheresis donation. In Blood Donation Processing, the use of semi-automated blood component extractors willbe introduced to streamline the workflow and further enhance the quality of blood components processed. Pathogen-inactivated frozen plasma and platelets using state-of-art pathogen inactivated technology will also be closely studied to determine their suitability for use intransfusions. Prevalence studies of the West Nile and Dengue viruses in our blood donor population will help to determine if new screening tests will need to be added for the blood supply. We will apply the latest information technology to create more patient-centric diagnostic laboratory services including Automated Pre-Transfusion Testing system, molecular analysisfor red cell antigens, flow cytometry for Human Lymphocyte Antigen cross-matching and antibody screening. Information technology will also be used to enhance our web portal for blood donors - Donorcare@HSA. Through innovative new additions, we hope to provide added convenience and ease in the blood donation process. Collaboration with Republic Polytechnic in utilisingprocess analysis tools in areas such as blood collection, processing and patient testing will further aid us in streamlining our processes and improving efficiency. Blood conservation is a new area in which we will work with hospitals to enable effective management of our blood supply. Through use of procedures such as autologous blood cell salvage, we can work with clinical colleagues to maximise every drop of blood that we collect.

Across the Group, greater focus was placed on ensuring that proper resource deployment and allocation were aligned with ourstrategic intent to meet challenges ahead, in particular the development of professional staff and reinvestment in new information systemsand appropriate, relevant technology. Ourprofessional standards are critical for us toprogress forward and we aim for the consistentattainment of high accreditation standards acrossall three centres. The HSA Journ ey | 078Our Centre for Analytical Science [CAS] continues to provide services to support the Agri-Food Veterinary Authority of Singapore's [AVA] regulation of processed foods, and the regulation of pharmaceuticals, Chinese proprietary medicines, cosmetics, health supplements and cigarettes. Since 1997, CAS has been continuously recognised by the Singapore Accreditation Council-Singapore Laboratory Accreditation Scheme [SAC-SINGLAS] under ISO/IEC Guide 25.This was further upgraded to ISO/IEC 17025 in July 2002, then to ISO/IEC17025: 2005 in June2006. Eight of our Scientific Officers are appointed as qualified ISO/IEC technical assessorsby the Singapore National Accreditation Council. CAS continued to perform well this past year, participating in the APLAC Proficiency Testing Programmes Scheme organised by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines[EDQM] on Dissolution Test for Pentoxifylline Extended-release Tablets. We did very well withour water analysis results on chromium, copper, iron, lead, nickel, thallium and zinc with allthe z-scores within z \u00b1 2. CAS also participated in the 14 th Asia Collaborative Study on ISO Tar and Nicotine involving 42 laboratories from 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. Five different brandsof cigarette samples with tar levels ranging from 1mg to 15mg were tested. Our study reportin March 2007 compared favourably with the other top laboratories. 079 | The HSA Journ ey Our Centre for Forensic Medicine [CFM] provides forensic medical consultancy services in support of the Coroner and the Singapore Police Force [SPF] in medico-legal death investigations within and outside of Singapore. CFM was accredited in 2005 and continues to maintain high professional standards through a regular internal review process. In line with efforts to operate at maximum efficiency, CFMdiscontinued its Forensic Death Investigator [FDI] service in February 2007 due to decreasein demand. Our Centre for Forensic Science [CFS] continues to specialise in forensic science services rendered to the SPF, Central Narcotics Bureau [CNB] and other law enforcement agenciesserving the administration of justice. Since 1996, CFS has been among the few forensic science centres in the region to achieve the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Lab Accreditation Board [ASCLD/LAB]accreditation, an international accreditation scheme for excellence in forensic science service.CFS was re-accredited by the ASCLD/LAB in June 2006. The HSA Journ ey | 080 Mapping Out New Areas of Research While primarily a service entity, we recognise that investment in innovation and R&D is critical to ensuring that we continue to succeed in delivering high quality, high value scientificexpertise to our clients. This year, we successfully applied Bloodstain Pattern Analysis [BPA] and conducted crime scene reconstructions for several high-profile murder cases. The acceptance of the evidenceprovided by our scientists validated the standards of expertise introduced. 081 | The HSA Journ eySeveral new analytical capabilities were developed: Chinese Proprietary Medicines 67 new adulterants and 13 analogues of Phosphodiesterase- 5 [PDE-5] Inhibitors were identified New tests on analysis of Arteminsinin and Acontine were accredited To date, we have more than 350 adulterants that have been accredited under ISO/IEC17025:2005. Cosmetics Two new services to test for Chromium and Neodymium were introduced New test methods were developed incorporating more mass spectrometry techniques for the development of new testmethods in cosmetic testing Tobacco Tests were made for carbon monoxide by Non-Dispersive Infra-Red Analysis [ISO8454:1995] using the semi- automated smoking machine Food & Water Potentially harmful plasticisers and additives from food contact materials were identified Sample extraction techniques were used to determine persistent organic pollutants [POPs] in food, such aspolybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs], and polychlorobiphenyls [PCBs] Accreditation extended to include two new tests to identify Naphthalene and Uranium in water Multi-elemental analysis protocol for water samples were expanded to include seven more elements using InductivelyCoupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry [ICP-MS] ey | 082Gaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances We recognise that the best way to progress is to share our knowledge with others through strategic alliances locally and internationally. Our academic collaborations include contributing actively to medical undergraduate and postgraduate education from NUS' Department ofPathology and Experimental Surgery of the Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre in the areas of forensic medicine, forensic pathology and pharmacy through various research projects. We alsocollaborate with Nanyang Polytechnic and the Genome Institute of Singapore on the local front, and World Health Organisation [WHO] and the United Nations internationally. Our Local Role In partnership with the CNB, we completed two projects, including an evaluation study on three on-site drug-testing kits; a survey to determine the consumption pattern of heroin and cannabis. The completion of the survey project on heroin and cannabis marked the conclusion to a series of surveys first undertaken in 2005 to determinethe consumption pattern of drugs abused in Singapore. The drugs coveredby the surveys ey | 084Forging Closer Ties within the Region In September 2006, we jointly organised the first regional DNA Symposium on Forensic DNA and Population Statistics Workshop with Applied Biosystems, which featured leading forensicexperts from the United States, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We also co-hosteda symposium with Dade Behring on 'Trends and Tribulations in Drugs of Abuse Testing' inMarch 2007, with board members from the International Association of Forensic Toxicologists[TIAFT] invited as speakers. For use by regional laboratories, we developed a gas chromatographic method for the quantification of safrole and isosafrole in sassafras oil. Both substances are precursor chemicalsused in the illicit manufacturing of N, -dimethyl-3,4-[methylenedioxy] phenethylamine [\"Ecstasy\"]. 085 | The HSA Journ eyThe International Arena On the international front, we continued our collaborations with WHO in the development of draft monographs onLamivudine Oral Solution, Lamivudine Tablets and Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets for the International Pharmacopeia. We also worked on the proposed additionalidentity tests for Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets and re-examined three international chemical reference substances: Diazoxide, Ethosuximide and Tolbutamidefor the WHO Collaborating Centre for Chemical Reference Substances in Sweden. We served as a WHO Temporary Advisor at a meeting on \"Specifications for Medicines and Quality Control Laboratory Issues\" and hosted the training of two WHOFellows in pharmaceutical analysis. We also filled the role of technical expert in the 41 st Meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for PharmaceuticalPreparation in Geneva, Switzerland. The 4 th Edition of The International Pharmacopeia was published in late 2006 with our collaboration. We collaborated closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC] on Project H44 - Scientificsupport to strengthen regulatory and law enforcementcontrol of amphetamine-type stimulants and theirprecursors in East, South and Southeast Asia. Since theproject's inception in May 2006, our newsletterDrugNetAsia has been published twice yearly to serve as a platform for the sharing of information among theregional forensic laboratories. In addition, we participated as a technical member at the International Laboratory Forum on CounterfeitMedicines [ILFCM] to share information on scientifictechniques that are used to detect counterfeit drugs andharmful substances in dietary supplements. The HSA Journ ey | 086015 | The HSA Journey Engaging with the Community Projects were carried out to improve the working environment for staff members, including promoting awareness of laboratory safety with a newly revised safety handbook and annual recognition awards. We also addressed the problem of proper disposal of chemicals and other wastes. Our community activity highlights during the year included visiting and hosting several lunches and dinners for the disabled elderly and senior citizens, a beach clean up and a recyclingproject. We are also committed to nurturing young scientists through our student internshipprogrammes and visits. The Next Leg of Our Journey We see a number of challenges on the horizon in our continuing effort to serve variousregulatory agencies. We need to be nimble, responsive and focused in asserting our professionalcapabilities and stature in serving the community in Singapore and beyond. Numerous keyinitiatives will be deployed in the next three years, focussing primarily on strengtheningefficiency and professional effectiveness, and pushing innovative development into new areasof expertise. Our research framework will be revamped and more funds set aside to promoteR&D. The HSA Journ ey ExcellenceThe Journ ey | 092 ur ongoing pursuit of organisational excellence has led us to achieve several organisational accolades over the years. They include the Singapore Innovation Class [I-Class] in 2003, PeopleDeveloper Standard [PDS] renewed in 2005, and Public Service Award for OrganisationalExcellence in 2006. In 2006, focused efforts were channelled into clarifying our strategic directions in the longer term and defining the relevant organisational structures to advance HSA in our new waveof growth. Various strategic conversations and conferences were initiated across differentlevels of staff and departments to encourage a wider exchange of ideas and to allow greaterclarity in collectively defining our next moves forward. This resulted in revised Vision andMission statements and the development of key strategic plans to facilitate our organisationalexcellence journey. A renewed HSA Organisational Excellence Framework was also rolled out to achieve greater synergy across related organisational developmental initiatives and to strengthen peopleintegration. The three pillars of excellence identified are: People Excellence Innovation Excellence Quality and Service Excellence The framework focuses on putting the appropriate structures and systems in place to reinforce organisational culture; provide an optimum environment with the right conditions; and buildcompetencies that will enable HSA to develop into an organisation capable of thriving in afuture environment of greater complexities and challenges.OThe HSA Journ ey | 094People Excellence In recognition of their achievements, 15 HSA officers were conferred the National Day Awards 2006, which included the following three special awards: The Commendation Medal Ms Lim Chin Chin [CFS, ASG] The Efficiency Medal Ms Ngak Lee [CFS, Public [PBM] Ms Daisy Ang [Corporate Communications, Corporate HQ] In August 2006, Ms Goh Choo Neo, Human Resource Officer from Corporate HQ was awarded the Singapore Labour Foundation Educational Tours Award for Model Workers 2006. During the year, 58 officers were promoted in recognition of their excellent performance. Long Service Awards were also presented to 92 officers. Five staff members were posted overseas for training under the Ministry of Health's [MOH] Health Manpower Development Plan in countries that included the USA and Australia. Underthe HSA's Professional Development Programme, 17 staff upgraded their academic qualifications.095 | The HSA Journ eyIntegrating Fun and Fitness at Work As part of our commitment to encourage our staff to lead balanced and healthy lifestyles, activities such as Active Day, Fruit Day, and Games Day were held to strengthen staff bondingand promote healthy living. Our efforts continue to be recognised and we have been commended with the Singapore H.E.A.L.T.H* Gold Award for the last two consecutive years. We were also awarded the Ministry of Home Affairs Award for NS Men's Employers [Commendation] in September 2006 for supporting the National Service activities of ouremployees. * Helping Employees Achieve Life-Time HealthThe HSA Journ ey | 096Innovation Excellence through IT During the year, we intensified Information Technology [IT] developments in the area of system applications as mapped out in HSA's four-year IT Master Plan. Two key application projects, namely LISA [Laboratory Information Scientific Administration ] and FIONA [Forensic Integrated Operations Network Application ] are being developed for the Applied Sciences Group. When completed, both systems will help towards building a paperlessenvironment and promoting greater automation through enhanced workflow. To align with the Government directives for Web Interface Standard [WIS] and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG], the HSA website underwent a revamp and the new websitewas successfully launched in August 2007. In support of the drive towards a more synergistic public service through shared processes and systems, we also embarked on several shared IT and infrastructural initiatives projects. We collaborated with the National Library Board [NLB] and three other public agencies - Health Promotion Board [HPB], Media Development Authority [MDA] and the Standards,Productivity and Innovation Board [SPRING] to implement a shared Corporate ResourcesSystem [CREST]. With CREST, the areas in the management of Human Resource, Finance,Procurement and Administration will be handled more efficiently. We also leveraged on the MOH's Shared Infrastructural [MediNet] services, a centralised infrastructure for both website and Intranet management. To optimise resources and minimiseoverall maintenance cost, we are working closely with HPB and MOH to establish greatercentralised services for network and facility management. 097 | The HSA Journ eyQuality and Service Excellence Through the efforts of the Quality Service Committee, we have continually upgraded our service level and have created added value for customers through procedures and systemsreviews. In July 2006, the Committee introduced a more user-friendly feedback form for customers to better assess the service received and provide suggestions for improvement. We are guided by the Public Service \"Minimum Service Standards\" . In the quarterly Mystery Customer Survey co-ordinated by the PS21 Office, we have consistently achieved a 100%satisfactory mark. An internal Frontline Customer Service Audit helps to maintain ongoingservice standards. During the year, we received 4,485 and 1,660 returns through feedback forms and email respectively. To recognise staff members for their contribution in quality service and work improvement initiatives, the following awards were presented: Nine Quarterly Outstanding Service to Customer Awards [OSCA] One Annual OSCA Award One Team Outstanding Quality Improvement Award Moving Forward HSA will continually seek to strengthen our fundamentals - to make the organisation's Core Values resonate with all HSAians, and streamline and improve our processes further in supportof HSA's overall organisational developments. To ensure better organisation-wide alignmentof strategic directions and systems, we will be pursuing an integrated Organisational Excellencere-certification under the refined niche standards of I-Class and PDS.

The financial statements for the financialyear ended 31 March 2006 were audited by another auditor whose report dated 23 June 2006expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Management's responsibility for the financial statementsThe Authority's management are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the Health Sciences Authority Act (Cap. 122C, 2002Revised Edition) (the Act) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibilityincludes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparationand fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whetherdue to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and makingaccounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditors' responsibilityOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Singapore Standards on Auditing. Thosestandards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the auditto obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from materialmisstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor'sjudgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financialstatements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditorconsiders internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of thefinancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internalcontrol. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies usedand the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluatingthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The HSA Journ ey | 122In our opinion, (i) the financial statements of the Authority are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards so as to give a trueand fair view of the state of affairs of the Authority as at 31 March 2007 and the results,changes in equity and cash flows of the Authority for the year ended on that date; and (ii) proper accounting and other records have been kept, including records of all assets of the Authority whether purchased, donated or otherwise. During the course of our audit, nothing came to our notice that caused us to believe that the receipt, expenditure and investments of monies and the acquisition and disposal of assets bythe Authority during the year have not been in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

FRS 107, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and amendment to FRS 1 (revised), Presentation of financial statements (Capital Disclosures)Effective date (annual periods beginning on No. Title or after) FRS 1 : Amendment to FRS 1 (revised), Presentation 1 January 2008 of Financial Statements (Capital Disclosures) FRS 40 : Investment Property 1 January 2007FRS 107 : Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2008 FRS 108 : Operating Segments 1 January 2009 INT FRS 108 : Scope of FRS 102, Share-based Payment 1 May 2006INT FRS 109 : Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 INT FRS 110 : Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 INT FRS 111 : Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007INT FRS 112 : Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1302.2 FRS and INT FRS not yet effective (cont'd) FRS 107 introduces new disclosures to improve the information about financial instruments. It requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aboutexposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimumdisclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysisto market risk. The amendment to FRS 1 requires the Authority to make new disclosuresto enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the Authority's objectives,policies and processes for managing capital. The Authority will apply the amendmentto FRS 1 and FRS 107 from annual period beginning 1 April 2008 2.3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements Estimates, assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Authority'saccounting policies, reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, anddisclosures made. They are assessed on an on-going basis and are based on experienceand relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances. (a) Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing amaterial adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within thenext financial year are discussed below. The cost of property, plant and equipment and intangibles for the operations of the Authority is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives. Managementestimates the useful lives of these property, plant and equipment and intangiblesto be within 5 to 60 years and within 3 to 5 years respectively. These are commonlife expectancies applied in this industry. The carrying amount of the Authority'sproperty, plant and equipment and intangibles at 31 March 2007 was $90,122,739(2005: $91,853,803) and $11,960,395 (2005: $13,273,797) respectively. Changesin the expected level of usage and technological developments could impact theeconomic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore futuredepreciation charges could be revised.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 131 | The HSA Journ ey2.3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (cont'd) (b) Critical judgements made in applying accounting policies The judgement made by management in the process of applying the Authority's accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amountsrecognised in the financial statements is discussed below. Impairment of financial assetsThe Authority follows the guidance of FRS 39 on determining when a financial asset is other-than-temporary impaired. This determination requires significantjudgement. The Authority evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extentto which the fair value of a financial asset is less than its cost; and the financialhealth of and near-term business outlook for the financial asset, including factorssuch as industry performance, changes in technology and operational and financingcash flow. 2.4 Functional and foreign currency Foreign currency transactionsTransactions in foreign currencies are measured in SGD, the functional currency of the Authority and are recorded on initial recognition in SGD at exchange rates approximatingthose ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies are translated at the closing rate of exchange ruling at the balancesheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in aforeign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initialtransactions. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income and expenditurestatement. 2.5 Property, plant and equipment All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulateddepreciation and accumulated impairment loss.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1322.5 Property, plant and equipment (cont'd) The initial cost of fixed assets comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of bringing theasset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditure incurredafter the fixed assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance,is normally charged to the income and expenditure statement in the period in whichthe costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that theexpenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected tobe obtained from the use of an item of fixed assets beyond its originally assessedstandard of performance, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost of fixedasset. In general, plant and equipment costing less than $2,000 each, are charged to the income and expenditure statement in the year of purchase. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Leasehold land and building 60 years (based on lease period) Building improvements 20 years (based on useful life of asset)Computer hardware 3 to 5 yearsMotor vehicles 10 yearsScientific and medical equipment 5 yearsOther equipment, furniture and fittings 5 to 10 years Assets under construction included in plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not available for use. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistentwith previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economicbenefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arisingon derecognition of the asset is included in the income and expenditure statement inthe year the asset is derecognised. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 133 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 2.6 Intangibles Intangible assets acquired, which comprise of computer software development costs, are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangibleassets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulatedimpairment losses. Amortisation of intangibles is calculated on the straight-line method to write-off the costs over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years. The amortisation expense onintangible assets is recognised in the income and expenditure statement through the'amortisation of intangible assets' line item. The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 2.7 Impairment of non-financial assets The Authority assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testingfor an asset is required, the Authority makes an estimate of the asset's recoverableamount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset,unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of thosefrom other assets or groups of assets. In assessing value in use, the estimated futurecash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate thatreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specificto the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount,the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income and expenditurestatement as 'other operating expenses'. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses recognised for an asset may no longerexist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount isestimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has beena change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since thelast impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of theasset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceedthe carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had noimpairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Reversal of an impairmentloss is recognised in the income and expenditure statement. The HSA Journ ey | 1342.8 Financial assets Financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet when, and only when, the Authority becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Such assets areinitially recognised at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs andsubsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains andlosses are recognised in the income and expenditure statement when the loans andreceivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. The Authority classifies the following financial assets as loans and receivables: Cash and short term deposits Trade, grants and other receivables. 2.9 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to aninsignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and short term deposits carried in the balance sheet are classified and accounted for as loans and receivables under FRS 39. The accounting policy is stated in Note 2.8. 2.10 Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables, including amounts due from related parties, are classified and accounted for as loans and receivables under FRS 39. The accounting policy forthis category of financial assets is stated in Note 2.8. An allowance is made for uncollectible amounts when there is an objective evidence that the Authority will not be able to collect the debt. Bad debts are written off whenidentified. Further details on the accounting policy for impairment of financial assetsare stated in Note 2.12 below. 2.11 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in first-out method) and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurredin bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 135 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 2.12 Impairment of financial assets The Authority assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the differencebetween the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effectiveinterest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset isreduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognisedin the income and expenditure statement. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment wasrecognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequentreversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income and expenditure statement,to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised costat the reversal date. 2.13 Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received is recognised in the income and expenditurestatement. 2.14 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables and accruals, which are normally settled on 30 day terms, and loan payable and payables to related parties.Financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when, and only when, theAuthority becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value of consideration received lessdirectly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised costusing the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income and expenditure statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. The liabilitiesare derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled orexpired. The HSA Journ ey | 1362.15 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Authority has a present obligation (legal or constructive) where, as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow ofresources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation anda reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodyingbenefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. 2.16 Employee benefits (a) Defined contribution plans The Authority makes contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. These contributions arerecognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed. (b) Defined benefit pension plan The Authority operates unfunded defined benefit schemes for certain employees under the provisions of the Pension Act (Chapter 225). Following the Civil Service Pension Fund's (CSPF) decision to decentralise the management of the Government Pension Fund, the Authority assumed theresponsibility of managing the pension entitlements of certain officers from 1 April2001. These officers are those who did not opt for the CPF scheme launched in1955 and continued to be entitled to pension benefits under the CSPF scheme. Upon retirement, the pension entitlements of these officers will be met by both CSPF and the Authority in proportion to their length of service before and afterthe establishment of the Authority on 1 April 2001. Accordingly, pension payableto pensionable officers prior to 1 April 2001 are excluded in arriving at theAuthority's pension liabilities.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 137 | The HSA Journ ey2.16 Employee benefits (cont'd) Retirement benefits for these employees are assessed using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The cost of providing for retirement benefitsis charged to the income and expenditure statement so as to spread the regularcost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the actuarial valuationcarried out during the year. The provision for retirement benefit is measured asthe present value of the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates ofSingapore Government Securities which have terms to maturity approximating theterms of the related liability. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the yearthese gains and losses arise. Such benefits are unfunded. The expenses relatingto pension are included as part of staff costs. (c) Employee leave entitlement Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave andlong-service leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balancesheet date. 2.17 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are generally expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of aqualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities toprepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures andborrowing costs are being incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assetsare ready for their intended use. If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceedsits recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recorded. 2.18 Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Authority substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the leaseat the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimumlease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised.Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of thelease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balanceof the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income and expenditure statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Authoritywill obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1382.18 Leases (cont'd) Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income and expenditure statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit ofincentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expense overthe lease term on a straight-line basis. 2.19 Income recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Authority and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following criteriamust also be met before revenue is recognised: (a) Income from the rendering of services that are of a short duration, such as laboratory analysis fees, patient laboratory testing fees, forensic investigating fees andprofessional services fees are recognised when the services are completed. (b) Income from blood processing fees are recognised when the processed blood products are used by the hospitals. (c) Licence fees income are recognised on an accrual basis over the licence period.(d) Fines and forfeitures are recognised on an accrual basis.(e) Interest income is accrued on a time proportionate basis, by reference to principal outstanding and at the interest rates applicable, on an effective yield basis. 2.20 Statutory contribution to consolidated fund In lieu of income tax, the Authority is required to make contribution to the Consolidated Fund based on the net surplus of the Authority (before donations) for the financialyear adjusted for any accumulated deficits carried forward from the years that theAuthority was under the contribution framework. The contribution rate used to computethe amount is pegged to the prevailing corporate tax rate that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 139 | The HSA Journ ey2.21 Deferred assets Deferred assets are recognised for carry-forward of unused accumulated deficits, to the extent that it is probable that future surpluses will be available against which thecarry-forward of unused accumulated deficits can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future surpluses willbe available to allow all or part of the deferred asset to be utilised. Unrecogniseddeferred assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to theextent that it has become probable that future surpluses will allow the deferred assetto be recovered. Deferred assets and liabilities are measured at the contribution rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based oncontribution rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balancesheet date. 2.22 Sales tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part ofthe cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable;and Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 2.23 Grants Government grants receivable are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be compliedwith. Government grants to meet the current year's operating expenses are recognised as income in the financial year in which the operating expenses are incurred.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1402.23 Grants (cont'd) Government grants and contributions from other organisations utilised for the purchase/construction of depreciable assets are taken to the deferred capital grantsaccount. Deferred capital grants are recognised in the income and expenditure statement over the period necessary to match the depreciation of the assets purchased with the relatedgrants. Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the balance of the relateddeferred capital grants is recognised in the income and expenditure statement to matchthe net book value of the assets written-off. 2.24 Related parties Related parties in these financial statements include other Government ministries, statutory boards and restructured hospitals. Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party inmaking financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related ifthey are subject to common control or common significant influence. Related partiesmay be ministries or statutory boards. The significant transactions between the Authority and other Government ministries, statutory boards and restructured hospitals are disclosed in other parts of the notesto the financial statements.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 141 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 3. Prior year adjustment In the previous financial year, the Authority capitalised the input goods and services tax (GST) for the leasehold land and building. During the year, the Inland RevenueAuthority of Singapore (IRAS) approved the claim of the input GST of $2,056,582 usingan input tax apportionment formula. The Authority accordingly adjusted the carryingvalue of the leasehold land and building by the same amount. In accordance with FRS8 Accounting policies; change in accounting estimates and error, the adjustment ofthe input GST has been accounted for retrospectively and the comparative for 2005/2006has been restated accordingly.

Financial risk management objectives and policies The Authority's principal financial instruments comprise of cash, short term deposits and long term loans. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance theAuthority's operations. The Authority has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. The Authority does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The main risks arising from the Authority's financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Authority reviews and agreespolicies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. (a) Interest rate risk The Authority's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Authority's interest-bearing loans and fixed deposits. Funding requirements areregularly reviewed so that cash in excess of short term operating requirements are placed in fixed deposits to maximise returns. Information on interest rates exposure is disclosed in Notes 7 and 16. (b) Foreign currency risk The Authority does not have any material foreign exchange risk as its operations are substantially transacted in, Singapore dollars. (c) Credit risk The Authority's credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables. The Authority places its cash and cash equivalents with credit-worthy financial institutions. The credit risk with respect to receivables is low as the Authority deals with credit-worthy organisations suchas government bodies and hospitals. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Authority's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Authority has no significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables are spread over a large base of organisations. The maximum credit risk that the Authority is exposed to is represented by carrying amounts of its financial assets as stated in the balance sheet. 159 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 27. Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont'd) (d) Liquidity risk The Authority funds its operations through a mix of internally-generated funds, government and non-government grants. The Authority regularly reviews itsliquidity reserves, comprising cash flows from its operations and government grants, to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained at all times. The Authority relies on the Government to fund a significant part of its operations. The framework for funding of the Authority's operations is reviewed with the Ministry of Health on a regularbasis. For funding of capital projects under the debt-equity financing framework, the Authority has established an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet future funding needs. Under Finance Circular Minute No M53/2003, theMinistry of Finance undertakes to act as the lender of last resort to the Authority for its funding requirements. 28. Financial instruments Fair valuesThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged or settled between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm's lengthtransaction, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Financial instruments whose carrying amount approximates fair valueManagement has determined that the carrying amounts of cash and short term deposits, current trade and other receivables, current trade and other payables, based on theirnotional amounts, reasonably approximate their fair values because these are mostly short term in nature or are repriced frequently. The finance lease payable and loans payable to Ministry of Finance (\"MOF\") are carried at amortised cost in the balance sheet. Their fair values are disclosed in the following table: Carrying amount Fair value 2006/2007 32,261,716 The fair value of the loan payable to Ministry of Finance is estimated using the discounted cash flow analysis based on prime rate of borrowings in the market.

The transfer is to build up Singapore's institutional and humanresource capabilities in the areas of nuclear science, security and emergency response.By consolidating these related responsibilities which are currently separately administeredby the Authority and NEA, the move will avoid duplication of resources as well asenhance coordination in technical issues relating to radiation and nuclear science. 161 | The HSA Journ ey30.

To attain global excellence and inspire trust as a world-class scientific organisation and authority, HSA must establish thought leadershipacross its unique blend of regulatory and scientific expertise. We seek new synergies across the professional knowledge and skills embodied in our critical resource - our people. As we move forward, our focuswill also be on forging strong partnerships with key counterpartsabroad, leveraging on technology innovation and driving knowledgetransfer. Even as they explore innovative modes of collaborative integration, HSA's three professional groups do face some unique challenges. TheHealth Products Regulation Group will look to harnessing IT solutionsto innovatively stretch the scope of pharmacovigilance, enhance theefficient processing of regulated products to maximise review proceduresand minimise delay, and develop new regulations in product areassuch as cell therapy and complementary medicine while enhancingthe regulation of generic products. The Health Services Group willendeavour to ensure an ongoing, sustainable adequate and safe bloodsupply to meet Singapore's future needs, embrace technologicaladvancement and innovation, and explore new aspects of cell-processing.The Applied Sciences Group will leverage on technological advancementsand scope out new areas that build on its current forensic and analyticalscience base, such as in the area of chemical metrology.HThe HSA Journ ey | 008Professor Edison Liu Chairman The challenges we face on our journey forward can be successfully overcome if HSA operates as a united entity and adopts a \"can do\" mindset across itsprofessional and corporate groups at all levels. I am more than confident that HSA will not just grow into but will flourish as a regulatory and scientific organisation that embodies intelligence,efficiency, clarity and integrity. It will become an exemplary agency thatwill not only positively impact the health and safety of Singaporeans, butalso world public health.CEO's PrefaceThe HSA Journ ey | 010T he past year has again been an eventful one for HSA as we advanced on our vision journey. We are delighted to work with our new Board, under theChairmanship of Professor Edison Liu. With the completion of our envisioningexercise in mid 2006, and our strategic regrouping into the Corporate HQ andthree professional groups - Health Products Regulation, Health Services andApplied Sciences - HSA looks ahead with optimism to all the possibilities thatawait us on the road ahead. I am continually encouraged by the commitment and quality of our people, who demonstrate tremendous dedication and potential. Across the professionalgroups, exciting possibilities exist to develop new synergies for growth with thediversity of scientific and professional expertise that currently exists in HSA, aswell as new skill sets that will come in over time. HSA is a distinctive organisationencompassing important functions normally found in a number of differentcounterpart agencies overseas. We therefore have unique opportunities todevelop innovative regulatory and scientific frameworks that could serve as newparadigms for the future. This fits in well both with our fundamental role as apublic sector organisation protecting and advancing our nation's public healthand the Singapore Public Service's increasingly global orientation. 011 | The HSA Journ eyIn order for this to come about, reviewing and clarifying our Core Values is a critical enabler to make HSA a Trusted, Teamed and Transforming authority. The organisational and individual congruence we need to enable us to accomplishour Vision and Mission must stem from a clear sense of our identity and purpose. Therefore, the strengthening and development of a strong and sound organisational culture is one clear focus for the year ahead, even as we continue to refine andimplement our strategic plans. We have also identified key organisationalinitiatives in the areas of enhancing our pro-enterprise orientation, reviewingour costing and pricing framework, and re-engineering key processes. Inrecognition of the value we accord to our people, a significant HR review is alsoongoing to ensure that HSA can attract the right people, retain them throughperformance and innovation recognition rewards, and develop them to their fullpotential. The HSA Journey is one of transforming possibilities into realities. The strong support of all HSA staff, our parent Ministry of Health and the HSA Board,combined with our understanding of the critical role we play in safeguardingthe health and safety of Singaporeans and the potential we have to extend ourrole as a global citizen, all combine to energise and motivate us for the journeyahead.

In the past year, the Corporate HQ has seen a number of changes in its reporting structure and grouping of capabilities to strengthen its overall effectiveness. Four taskforces were formed and consultants were brought in to review and recommendenhancements to make the corporate systems relevant and prepared for new frontiers. The taskforces, headed by the Senior Directors and comprising representatives from both the CorporateHQ and professional groups, meet on a regular basis to review the four key areas of pro-enterprise, HR strategies and plans, business processes, and pricing and costing. Though newly established, the initiatives of these taskforces have been significant.

It administers and enforces the Medicines Act, Poisons Act, Sale of Drugs Act, Medicines [Advertisement and Sale]Act and Misuse of Drug Regulations and Smoking [Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco] Act. A robust framework comprising pre- and post-marketing regulatory activities is applied. This comprises pre-market evaluation, licensing and certificationactivities, on-going post-marketing monitoring through inspections and surveillance, and Adverse Drug Reactions [ADRs] Reporting to track continued standards of products marketed in Singapore. Our Centre for Medical Device Regulation [CMDR] has administered the interim Voluntary Product Registration Scheme [VPRS] for higher-risk medical devices since 2002. We are well on track to a legislated, regulated environment for medical devicesin Singapore. Our Centre for Radiation Protection [CRP] , while with HSA, was the national regulatory authority for the safe use of ionising and non-ionising radiation of irradiating apparatusand radioactive materials in Singapore. It enforced the Radiation Protection Act and its subsidiary regulations through a system of licensing and inspection. Besides personalised monitoring services and radioactivity analyses, it also provided consultancy and trainingon radiation safety. OThe HSA Journ ey | 044Innovative Regulation On 12 February 2007, the Health Products Bill was passed by Parliament. The resulting Health Products Act was designed as an omnibus legislationthat will consolidate, and eventually replace, the existing four separate Acts regulating medicines and other health-related products currently administered by HSA. The Health Products Act is notable in that itincorporates a legislative mechanism that allows the different controlling provisions in the Act to be effected on different categories of health products in a modular manner. This gives HSA more flexibility in tailoringdifferent regulatory regimes for different categories of health products, and avoiding over- or under-regulating any particular category of product. Medical devices is the first category of health products to be regulated under this new Health Products Act. Based on the principles endorsedby the Global Harmonisation Task Force [GHTF], which include licensing of medical device dealers as well as the products, the proposed framework underwent a two-month public consultation exercise between Februaryand April 2007. In March 2007, as part of our continuing efforts to engage stakeholders in the formulation of the medical device regulations, we also conducted an industry briefing to representatives from over ahundred companies. The Phase I implementation of this new framework by 2007 will bring Singapore in line with international best practices on the regulation of medical devices.Responsive Regulatory System To ensure that rules and regulations are kept current and meet the needs of our stakeholders in the changing environment, HSA conducts ongoing reviews of its rules and regulations inconsultation with its stakeholders. New initiatives arising from the regulatory reviews are developed together with our stakeholders and communicated to ensure clarity and transparency. The drug registration system and requirements were reviewed. The major initiatives are: for safety labelling updates to be submitted through notification rather than the approval process, allowing predictability and better planning by the industry the waiver of Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product [CPP] for new product applications where other forms of approval documents can be used as appropriate substitutes for a major revision of the drug registration guidance document for the industry, to enhance clarity and transparency To communicate these new drug registration initiatives, a two-day drug registration workshop for the industry was held in February 2007 and attended by over 200 industry representatives from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, France and the USA. The regulatory controls for Chinese Proprietary Medicines [CPM] were also reviewed and, in July 2006, the CPM product labelling requirements were revised to include an advisory on consumer discretion. The licensing requirements for retail pharmacists were also reviewed and streamlined. Since 1 July 2006, pharmacists are no longer required to amend Form C poisons licences when theypractise at pharmacy outlets under the same management. To improve transparency in the product classification system for health products and food and to assist traders in carrying out preliminary self-classification of products, we have jointly developed a Food-Health Products Classification Tree with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority. As part of our stepped-up efforts against retailers who illegally sell tobacco products to underage persons, the list of suspended tobacco retailers was made available on our websitefrom April 2007. 045 | The HSA Journ eyNetworked Risk Management Networking and strategic alliances allow HSA to tap on knowledge and data beyond the agency andstrengthen our regulatory decision- making and risk management processes. In FY 2006, we evaluatedand approved several major new drugs, which included: New Chemical Drugs New 2006, we introduced electronic reporting of ADRs, in addition to submissions through fax, mail or email. This was through the Critical Medical Information Store [CMIS]*of the Electronic Medical Record Exchange [EMRX]**. We worked with the Ministry of Health [MOH] to implement the drug safety module of the Healthcare Professional Portal [HPP], to enhance our outreach to healthcare professionals, important partners in our risk management system. Since June 2006, healthcare professionals in Singapore receive important and urgent drug safety alerts almost immediately throughSMS, e-mail and fax, and can make ADR report enquiries on-line. * CMIS [Critical Medical Information Store] of the EMRX serves as a shared electronic repository of patients' medical alerts, AD R and drug allergy data. The CMIS online ADR reporting form is also available at the HPP to allow healthcare professionals from the private sector to submit ADR reports. The HPP is a one-stop portal for the healthcare professional community to accessmultiple e-services relating to professional practice and information repository using single-sign-on through a common interfac e. ** EMRX [Electronic Medical Record Exchange] is an electronic platform which enables hospitals and government clinics across the two public healthcare clusters, National Healthcare Group and Singapore Health Services, to share vital patient medical information such as inpatient discharge summaries, medical history and laboratory results. The HSA Journ ey | 046Risk communication is achieved through drug safety alerts to healthcare professionals and the public, and the Adverse Drug Reaction News Bulletin . In 2006, we published three issues of the Bulletin, which was disseminated to over 9,000 doctors, pharmacists and dentists in Singapore. We also worked closely with the pharmaceutical companies to issue six Dear Healthcare Professional letters, which updated healthcare professionals on emerging and potential drug safety problems. In 2006, HSA participated in investigations initiated from alerts by the Singapore National Eye Centre [SNEC] on an increased incidence of Fusarium Keratitis seen in contact lens users at the centre. We worked closely with MOH, SNECand other local institutions, as well as the US Communicable Disease Center and US Food and Drug Administration. This eventually resulted in a voluntary withdrawal of Bausch & Lomb's ReNu products in Singapore on17 February 2006 and a global voluntary withdrawal of ReNu MoistureLoc Contact Lens Solution on 15 April 2006. The HSA Journ ey | 048043 | The HSA Journ eyGaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances Our Local Role HSA works closely with local and overseas agencies to prevent illegaland unsafe drugs from entering ourmarket. In 2006, we conducted severaljoint seizures on illegal codeine coughmixtures with other enforcement agencies, including the Central Narcotics Bureau [CNB], theImmigration & Checkpoints Authority [ICA] and the Singapore Police Force [SPF]. In one such operation, eightbarrels of 200 litres of codeine mixture were seized, the largest seizure of such mixtures by HSA. In August 2006, two individuals were arrested by CNB for illegally dealingin Dormicum. One of them, a foreign doctor, was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. The case involved15,000 tablets and was one of the largest seizures of smuggled Dormicum tablets to date. Working closely with ICA, we foiled several attempts to bring consignments of counterfeit and illegal medicinal products into Singapore. In one case, about 30 different types of illegalmedicinal products, amounting to 100,000 tablets and capsules with an estimated street value of over S$500,000, were intercepted and seized. In January 2007, we provided assistance to the Malaysian Health Ministry in their investigations on a case which involved the importation of an adulterated product, 'Miagra', worth RM14 million. During the year, we made presentations at various local radiological security and safety seminars, including the SIN/US \"Radiological Dispersal Device [RDD] Threat Reduction Workshop\"organised by Defence Science and Technology Agency, and Ministry of Defence's Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives seminar on Safety & Security. 049 | The HSA Journ eyForging Closer Ties within the Region ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality [ACCSQ] Product Working Groups [PWGs] In support of an integrated ASEAN healthcare vision led by the Ministry of Trade and Industry,the regulatory group continued to be actively engaged in numerous activities through PWGs established under the ACCSQ: Pharmaceutical PWG Traditional Medicines & Health Supplements PWG ASEAN Cosmetics Committee Medical Device PWG Together with its ASEAN counterparts, the PWGs worked towards harmonising regulatory measures in product and labelling standards, Good Manufacturing Practices [GMP] standards,registration dossiers, the post-marketing alert system and negotiations on a Mutual Recognition Arrangement [MRA] for GMP Inspections for Medicinal Products. Pharmaceuticals Product Working Group [PPWG] The PPWG held its 12 th Meeting in October 2006. HSA chaired the Implementation Working Group [IWG] and the MRA GMP Inspection Taskforce, which are responsible for coordinatingthe implementation of the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier [ACTD] and development of an MRA for GMP Inspection respectively. At the 12 th Meeting, an agreement was reached to allow the ACTD developed by the International Conference for Harmonisation [ICH] forinnovative products. Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group [TMHS PWG] With the support from the local traditional medicines and health supplements associations, we successfully hosted the 5 th ACCSQ TMHS PWG meeting on 27 and 28 July 2006 and a seminar which preceded the meeting. The meeting attracted 178 regulatory and industryrepresentatives from Asia, Europe and the USA and featured eminent experts from the World Health Organisation [WHO], Europe, USA and China. The 6 th TMHS PWG Meeting was held in December 2006 and continued to focus on working out the definitions of traditionalmedicines and health supplements, the studies and surveys on technical requirements, GMP standards, quality control testing, labelling requirements and the regulatory infrastructure and product placement system. The HSA Journ ey | 050ASEAN Cosmetics Committee [ACC] The 7th ACC meeting was held in December 2006. At the meeting, the ASEAN Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Cosmetic Products were formally adopted and Singapore was appointed to lead in its development. Medical Device Product Working Group [MDPWG] We successfully hosted the 5th ACCSQ MDPWG meeting in January 2007, which was attended by 95 government delegates and representatives from the ASEAN Secretariat and the medicaldevice industry. At the meeting, the member countries formally adopted the \"Dear Doctor Letter\" Guideline, which allows a manufacturer or competent authority to inform healthcare professionals of any product safety issues. In addition, Singapore's proposed framework on\"Post-Marketing Alert System\" [PMAS] that aims to facilitate inter-ASEAN adverse event and product recall reporting was also accepted. Asian Harmonisation Working Party [AHWP]* As the co-chair of the AHWP Technical Committee, we have been working with other member countries to fine-tune the post-market alert system and common submission dossier template.In February 2007, we also represented AHWP to participate in the GHTF Study Group 1 [SG1]** meeting in Japan. * The Asian Harmonisation Working Party [AHWP] studies and recommends ways to harmonise medical device regulations in the region and coordinates with the Global Harmonisation Task Force [GHTF] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]. ** The SG1 compares operational medical device regulatory systems around the world and is responsible for developing a standard ised format for pre-market submissions and harmonised product labelling requirements. 051 | The HSA Journ eyThe International Arena Memoranda of Understanding [MOU] In 2006, HSA signed MOU with Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch and theUnited States Pharmacopoeia. The MOU with the two international organisations aim to enhance mutual communication and scientific collaboration, encourage collaborative efforts in health products regulation, analysis and research, and increase the awareness of theimportance of the quality and safety of medicinal products between agencies. Relationships with the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration continue to be strengthened. International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] During the year, we participated in several IAEA events, which included delivering the Singapore Statement during the IAEA General in Vienna, and two regional co-ordination meetings on Public Exposure Control and Radioactive Waste Management in Myanmar and Indonesiarespectively. In July 2006, we hosted a week-long training course organised under IAEA/Regional Co-operative Agreement on the Organisation and Implementation of a National Regulatory Programme for the Control of Radiation Sources, including the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources. During the month, a study visit was also organised foran IAEA fellow from the Iran Nuclear Regulatory Authority to study Singapore's system of radiation control. WHO International Electromagnetic Field Project Advisory Committee As a member of the WHO International Electromagnetic Field Project Advisory Committee, we participated in the Geneva meeting in June 2007. The focused research knowledge sharedduring the meeting has enhanced the EMF control programmes locally. In addition, to strengthen international preparedness and regional response system for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies, we also participated in a National Competent Authority Workshop in Melbourne, Australia in November. The HSA Journ ey | 052International Medicinal Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce [IMPACT] Initiated by the WHO, the IMPACT is a voluntary grouping of governments, organisations,institutions, agencies and associations from developing and developed countries aimed atsharing expertise, identifying problems, seeking solutions, co-ordinating activities and workingtowards the common goal of fighting counterfeit medical products. To accomplish thismandate, IMPACT will focus on five key areas, namely: Legislative and Regulatory Infrastructure,Enforcement, Technology, and Risk Communication. Singapore, represented by HSA, wasnominated as one of the Vice-Chairs of the IMPACT taskforce and thus became a member ofthe IMPACT Planning Group. Five Working Groups were established to address the five keyareas of concern, and have been working independently to present their proposals at theSecond General Meeting in December 2007. WHO-sponsored GMP Audit During the year, we participated in GMP audits in China and India sponsored by the WHO as part of its pre-qualification programme to ensure medicinal products of acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy are available for United Nation agencies' procurement. We continued our obligations and commitments in several regional and international agreements and forums. Some of the major involvements include: US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement MRA on GMP Inspections with Australia MOU with the US FDA Singapore-Japan Joint Statement on Medicinal Product GMP Inspection under the Japan- Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention/ Pharmaceutical Cooperation Scheme [PIC/S] Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime [PFIPC] WHO-supported Western Pacific Regional Forum for the Harmonisation of Herbal Medicines [FHH] WHO-supported International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines [IRCH] ASEAN Working Group on Technical Cooperation in Pharmaceuticals [AWGTCP] Brunei-Malaysia-Indonesia-Singapore-Thailand [BMIST] Public Health Conference 053 | The HSA Journ eyThe Next Leg of Our Journey With the rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical and life sciences, the emergence of novel technologies and their application in health products development and Singapore's ongoing biomedical sciences initiatives, HSA is facing new challenges in regulating novel healthproducts with our limited resources. At the same time, this opens up new opportunities for the regulatory group to tap on HSA's other professional groups' expertise and external expertise in Singapore and abroad. As HSA moves forward, it is increasingly important for us to beinnovative in our regulatory approaches and capabilities development. We will enhance our capabilities in the following four key areas: 1.Conduct risk assessments of new health products, including medical devices, novel biologics and other innovative health products. HSA is building up our capabilitythrough expansion of our in-house scientific capabilities as well as by leveraging on expertise in our partner agencies and research institutes. By improving our risk assessment capability, we aim to enhance our professional evaluation capabilities and marketingapproval timelines. 2. Manage the evolving risks of products through systematic surveillance, enforcement and a risk communication programme. HSA will review and target implementation of effective risk-based programmes to monitor the safety and regulatory compliance of health products throughout product lifecycles. Our legislative framework will also beenhanced to enable HSA to more effectively enforce post-marketing studies from the pharmaceutical industry that will allow us to further characterise the safety profiles of selected drugs. We will also explore tapping the promising tools of pharmacogeneticsto innovatively detect ADRs in our local population, which in the future may facilitate approvals of certain drugs tracked under this scheme. In the area of risk communication, we will continue to step up efforts to provide early warnings to our healthcare professionals of emerging or potential drug safety problems to enable them to make discerning choices on the safer use of drugs and healthproducts. The HSA Journ ey | 0543. Develop smart regulation and policies for health products that protect public safety while facilitating the growth of the biomedical industry. HSA is refining its regulatory philosophy in line with our mission to wisely regulate health products by applying a risk-based rather than a \"one-size-fits-all\" regulatory approach. The recently passedHealth Products Act will be instrumental in helping us achieve these objectives. HSA intends to actively engage our stakeholders in the implementation of the Health Products Act, so as to better meet their needs and expectations in transparency, clarity,responsiveness and robustness in our regulation of health products. 4.Enhance our strategic alliances, connectedness and influence in the regional and international regulatory arena. This will position Singapore as a thought leader in the field and facilitate our participation in decisions shaping the future of the regulation of health products. Moving ahead, we will focus on efforts to strengthen relationshipsand develop closer co-operation with our key reference agencies and our regional partners in ASEAN. In the coming year, we will also actively participate and lead in regional and global initiatives, especially in ASEAN health products harmonisation,GMP inspections and anti-counterfeiting and enforcement initiatives. HSA will be organising the following major regional and global events in the coming year: PIC/S Meeting in Singapore PFIPC Meeting in Singapore ASEAN-China IMPACT Conference in Indonesia APEC Life Sciences Anti-counterfeiting Seminar in Singapore 055 | The HSA Journ eyThe HSA Journ ey | 056CRP Transfer to NEA After six years as one of HSA's professional centres since its formation in 2001, the Centre for Radiation Protection [CRP] was transferred to the National Environment Agency andbecame the Centre for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science [CRPNS] on 1 July 2007. CRP has built up a reputation over the years for having a sound capability in radiation protection in health and safety during the years under the guidance of HSA and CRP's predecessor departments. Faced with an ever-changing landscape, there are increasing demands for expertise in the areas of nuclear science, security and emergency response. This move has brought together experts from both health and environmental radiation science as they discuss how to bettermeet the challenges ahead at a national, regional and global level.

Thisaccreditation brings us membership of a respected organisation of international blood banks in the scientific community and affirms our high level of professionalism and commitment to quality blood banking. In our journey towards excellence, we partnered with national blood services in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific Region to form the Asian Pacific Blood Network [APBN]. In June 2006, wehosted the official launch of the APBN, which aims to promote blood safety and efficiency of operations through global co-operation and information sharing. This followed the signing of a confidentiality agreement amongst the member countries, which was formally ratifiedon 28 November 2006. We are also members of International Society of Blood Transfusion [ISBT] Working Parties for Haemovigilance, Blood Supply Management and the Hepatitis B Working Group. Along with Japan, Singapore is the only other country in Asia to join the European Haemovigilance Network, which aims to collect and exchange data on the effects of blood transfusion. The HSA Journ ey | 066Mapping Out New Areas of Research We actively seek to take advantage of the latest developments in blood banking science and information technology to improve the quality and efficiency of the services we offer. Our new state-of-the-art Cell Processing Laboratory was opened in 2006. This new facility is a fully GMP-compliant [Good Manufacturing Practice] laboratory dedicated to translational cell therapy work. We are currently involved in collaborative trials with the Singapore GeneralHospital. Ongoing research is also being conducted in the rapidly evolving fields of immunotherapy and new cellular therapies. 067 | The HSA Journ eyGaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances Our Local Role 2007 marks the sixth year of a strategic partnership with the Singapore Red Cross [SRC] to manage our national blood donor programme. The blood donor recruitment effort is complemented by our ongoing public awarenesscampaign on the importance of regular voluntary blood donations and the need to foster blood donation as a healthy lifestyle activity. Forging Closer Ties within the Region In our capacities as a World Health Organisation [WHO]Collaborating Centre for Transfusion Medicine and theWHO Regional Quality Management Training Centre, we continued to help in initiatives to improve the standard and practices of transfusion medicine in the WesternPacific region. Our regional training projects include conducting training for the blood transfusion service in Myanmar, providing external proficiency testing in pre-transfusion testing in blood centres across the Western Pacific region, and working with the SRC to provide donor recruitment training programmes in Thailand andMyanmar. We have also worked with Nanyang Polytechnic to produce, on behalf of the WHO, a training CD entitled \"Quality in Blood Collection\" . The HSA Journ ey | 070The International Arena We make it a priority to share and exchange knowledge within the global arena. In the year, we continued to participate actively in key international conferences as speakers and attendeesin the transfusion medicine arena. These included conferences organised by the WHO, AABB, International Society of Cellular Therapy, Japanese Society of Blood Transfusion, ISBT and South Asian Association of Transfusion Medicine. We are also a member of the WHO-convenedGlobal Collaboration in Blood Safety. To harmonise with international practices, we converted to the ISBT 128 barcode labelling system, an international standardised barcode nomenclature for transfusion medicine.Engaging with the Community In June 2006, we celebrated the 60 th anniversary of the National Blood Programme in Singapore with a unique World Blood Donor Day sandcastle-building activity and beach carnival. This was followed in July 2007 by a two-day scientific symposium themed \"Evolving Trends inTransfusion Medicine\", where regional and international experts in the field of transfusion medicine shared their expertise. 071 | The HSA Journ eyThe Next Leg of Our Journey In the coming year, we will be focusing our efforts on achieving accreditation of our Transplant Support Unit with the American Society of Histo-compatibility and Immuno-Genetics [ASHI]. Successful accreditation with ASHI will give our transplant support laboratory added international standing and recognition. New technologies to be introduced in blood collection include Red Cell Apheresis donation. In Blood Donation Processing, the use of semi-automated blood component extractors willbe introduced to streamline the workflow and further enhance the quality of blood components processed. Pathogen-inactivated frozen plasma and platelets using state-of-art pathogen inactivated technology will also be closely studied to determine their suitability for use intransfusions. Prevalence studies of the West Nile and Dengue viruses in our blood donor population will help to determine if new screening tests will need to be added for the blood supply. We will apply the latest information technology to create more patient-centric diagnostic laboratory services including Automated Pre-Transfusion Testing system, molecular analysisfor red cell antigens, flow cytometry for Human Lymphocyte Antigen cross-matching and antibody screening. Information technology will also be used to enhance our web portal for blood donors - Donorcare@HSA. Through innovative new additions, we hope to provide added convenience and ease in the blood donation process. Collaboration with Republic Polytechnic in utilisingprocess analysis tools in areas such as blood collection, processing and patient testing will further aid us in streamlining our processes and improving efficiency. Blood conservation is a new area in which we will work with hospitals to enable effective management of our blood supply. Through use of procedures such as autologous blood cell salvage, we can work with clinical colleagues to maximise every drop of blood that we collect.

Since 1996, CFS has been among the few forensic science centres in the region to achieve the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Lab Accreditation Board [ASCLD/LAB]accreditation, an international accreditation scheme for excellence in forensic science service.CFS was re-accredited by the ASCLD/LAB in June 2006. The HSA Journ ey | 080 Mapping Out New Areas of Research While primarily a service entity, we recognise that investment in innovation and R&D is critical to ensuring that we continue to succeed in delivering high quality, high value scientificexpertise to our clients. This year, we successfully applied Bloodstain Pattern Analysis [BPA] and conducted crime scene reconstructions for several high-profile murder cases. The acceptance of the evidenceprovided by our scientists validated the standards of expertise introduced. 081 | The HSA Journ eySeveral new analytical capabilities were developed: Chinese Proprietary Medicines 67 new adulterants and 13 analogues of Phosphodiesterase- 5 [PDE-5] Inhibitors were identified New tests on analysis of Arteminsinin and Acontine were accredited To date, we have more than 350 adulterants that have been accredited under ISO/IEC17025:2005. Cosmetics Two new services to test for Chromium and Neodymium were introduced New test methods were developed incorporating more mass spectrometry techniques for the development of new testmethods in cosmetic testing Tobacco Tests were made for carbon monoxide by Non-Dispersive Infra-Red Analysis [ISO8454:1995] using the semi- automated smoking machine Food & Water Potentially harmful plasticisers and additives from food contact materials were identified Sample extraction techniques were used to determine persistent organic pollutants [POPs] in food, such aspolybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs], and polychlorobiphenyls [PCBs] Accreditation extended to include two new tests to identify Naphthalene and Uranium in water Multi-elemental analysis protocol for water samples were expanded to include seven more elements using InductivelyCoupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry [ICP-MS] ey | 082Gaining Momentum through Strategic Alliances We recognise that the best way to progress is to share our knowledge with others through strategic alliances locally and internationally. Our academic collaborations include contributing actively to medical undergraduate and postgraduate education from NUS' Department ofPathology and Experimental Surgery of the Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre in the areas of forensic medicine, forensic pathology and pharmacy through various research projects. We alsocollaborate with Nanyang Polytechnic and the Genome Institute of Singapore on the local front, and World Health Organisation [WHO] and the United Nations internationally. Our Local Role In partnership with the CNB, we completed two projects, including an evaluation study on three on-site drug-testing kits; a survey to determine the consumption pattern of heroin and cannabis. The completion of the survey project on heroin and cannabis marked the conclusion to a series of surveys first undertaken in 2005 to determinethe consumption pattern of drugs abused in Singapore. The drugs coveredby the surveys ey | 084Forging Closer Ties within the Region In September 2006, we jointly organised the first regional DNA Symposium on Forensic DNA and Population Statistics Workshop with Applied Biosystems, which featured leading forensicexperts from the United States, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. We also co-hosteda symposium with Dade Behring on 'Trends and Tribulations in Drugs of Abuse Testing' inMarch 2007, with board members from the International Association of Forensic Toxicologists[TIAFT] invited as speakers. For use by regional laboratories, we developed a gas chromatographic method for the quantification of safrole and isosafrole in sassafras oil. Both substances are precursor chemicalsused in the illicit manufacturing of N, -dimethyl-3,4-[methylenedioxy] phenethylamine [\"Ecstasy\"]. 085 | The HSA Journ eyThe International Arena On the international front, we continued our collaborations with WHO in the development of draft monographs onLamivudine Oral Solution, Lamivudine Tablets and Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets for the International Pharmacopeia. We also worked on the proposed additionalidentity tests for Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets and re-examined three international chemical reference substances: Diazoxide, Ethosuximide and Tolbutamidefor the WHO Collaborating Centre for Chemical Reference Substances in Sweden. We served as a WHO Temporary Advisor at a meeting on \"Specifications for Medicines and Quality Control Laboratory Issues\" and hosted the training of two WHOFellows in pharmaceutical analysis. We also filled the role of technical expert in the 41 st Meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for PharmaceuticalPreparation in Geneva, Switzerland. The 4 th Edition of The International Pharmacopeia was published in late 2006 with our collaboration. We collaborated closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC] on Project H44 - Scientificsupport to strengthen regulatory and law enforcementcontrol of amphetamine-type stimulants and theirprecursors in East, South and Southeast Asia. Since theproject's inception in May 2006, our newsletterDrugNetAsia has been published twice yearly to serve as a platform for the sharing of information among theregional forensic laboratories. In addition, we participated as a technical member at the International Laboratory Forum on CounterfeitMedicines [ILFCM] to share information on scientifictechniques that are used to detect counterfeit drugs andharmful substances in dietary supplements. The HSA Journ ey | 086015 | The HSA Journey Engaging with the Community Projects were carried out to improve the working environment for staff members, including promoting awareness of laboratory safety with a newly revised safety handbook and annual recognition awards. We also addressed the problem of proper disposal of chemicals and other wastes. Our community activity highlights during the year included visiting and hosting several lunches and dinners for the disabled elderly and senior citizens, a beach clean up and a recyclingproject. We are also committed to nurturing young scientists through our student internshipprogrammes and visits. The Next Leg of Our Journey We see a number of challenges on the horizon in our continuing effort to serve variousregulatory agencies. We need to be nimble, responsive and focused in asserting our professionalcapabilities and stature in serving the community in Singapore and beyond. Numerous keyinitiatives will be deployed in the next three years, focussing primarily on strengtheningefficiency and professional effectiveness, and pushing innovative development into new areasof expertise. Our research framework will be revamped and more funds set aside to promoteR&D. The HSA Journ ey ExcellenceThe Journ ey | 092 ur ongoing pursuit of organisational excellence has led us to achieve several organisational accolades over the years. They include the Singapore Innovation Class [I-Class] in 2003, PeopleDeveloper Standard [PDS] renewed in 2005, and Public Service Award for OrganisationalExcellence in 2006. In 2006, focused efforts were channelled into clarifying our strategic directions in the longer term and defining the relevant organisational structures to advance HSA in our new waveof growth. Various strategic conversations and conferences were initiated across differentlevels of staff and departments to encourage a wider exchange of ideas and to allow greaterclarity in collectively defining our next moves forward. This resulted in revised Vision andMission statements and the development of key strategic plans to facilitate our organisationalexcellence journey. A renewed HSA Organisational Excellence Framework was also rolled out to achieve greater synergy across related organisational developmental initiatives and to strengthen peopleintegration. The three pillars of excellence identified are: People Excellence Innovation Excellence Quality and Service Excellence The framework focuses on putting the appropriate structures and systems in place to reinforce organisational culture; provide an optimum environment with the right conditions; and buildcompetencies that will enable HSA to develop into an organisation capable of thriving in afuture environment of greater complexities and challenges.OThe HSA Journ ey | 094People Excellence In recognition of their achievements, 15 HSA officers were conferred the National Day Awards 2006, which included the following three special awards: The Commendation Medal Ms Lim Chin Chin [CFS, ASG] The Efficiency Medal Ms Ngak Lee [CFS, Public [PBM] Ms Daisy Ang [Corporate Communications, Corporate HQ] In August 2006, Ms Goh Choo Neo, Human Resource Officer from Corporate HQ was awarded the Singapore Labour Foundation Educational Tours Award for Model Workers 2006. During the year, 58 officers were promoted in recognition of their excellent performance. Long Service Awards were also presented to 92 officers. Five staff members were posted overseas for training under the Ministry of Health's [MOH] Health Manpower Development Plan in countries that included the USA and Australia. Underthe HSA's Professional Development Programme, 17 staff upgraded their academic qualifications.095 | The HSA Journ eyIntegrating Fun and Fitness at Work As part of our commitment to encourage our staff to lead balanced and healthy lifestyles, activities such as Active Day, Fruit Day, and Games Day were held to strengthen staff bondingand promote healthy living. Our efforts continue to be recognised and we have been commended with the Singapore H.E.A.L.T.H* Gold Award for the last two consecutive years. We were also awarded the Ministry of Home Affairs Award for NS Men's Employers [Commendation] in September 2006 for supporting the National Service activities of ouremployees. * Helping Employees Achieve Life-Time HealthThe HSA Journ ey | 096Innovation Excellence through IT During the year, we intensified Information Technology [IT] developments in the area of system applications as mapped out in HSA's four-year IT Master Plan. Two key application projects, namely LISA [Laboratory Information Scientific Administration ] and FIONA [Forensic Integrated Operations Network Application ] are being developed for the Applied Sciences Group. When completed, both systems will help towards building a paperlessenvironment and promoting greater automation through enhanced workflow. To align with the Government directives for Web Interface Standard [WIS] and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG], the HSA website underwent a revamp and the new websitewas successfully launched in August 2007. In support of the drive towards a more synergistic public service through shared processes and systems, we also embarked on several shared IT and infrastructural initiatives projects. We collaborated with the National Library Board [NLB] and three other public agencies - Health Promotion Board [HPB], Media Development Authority [MDA] and the Standards,Productivity and Innovation Board [SPRING] to implement a shared Corporate ResourcesSystem [CREST]. With CREST, the areas in the management of Human Resource, Finance,Procurement and Administration will be handled more efficiently. We also leveraged on the MOH's Shared Infrastructural [MediNet] services, a centralised infrastructure for both website and Intranet management. To optimise resources and minimiseoverall maintenance cost, we are working closely with HPB and MOH to establish greatercentralised services for network and facility management. 097 | The HSA Journ eyQuality and Service Excellence Through the efforts of the Quality Service Committee, we have continually upgraded our service level and have created added value for customers through procedures and systemsreviews. In July 2006, the Committee introduced a more user-friendly feedback form for customers to better assess the service received and provide suggestions for improvement. We are guided by the Public Service \"Minimum Service Standards\" . In the quarterly Mystery Customer Survey co-ordinated by the PS21 Office, we have consistently achieved a 100%satisfactory mark. An internal Frontline Customer Service Audit helps to maintain ongoingservice standards. During the year, we received 4,485 and 1,660 returns through feedback forms and email respectively. To recognise staff members for their contribution in quality service and work improvement initiatives, the following awards were presented: Nine Quarterly Outstanding Service to Customer Awards [OSCA] One Annual OSCA Award One Team Outstanding Quality Improvement Award Moving Forward HSA will continually seek to strengthen our fundamentals - to make the organisation's Core Values resonate with all HSAians, and streamline and improve our processes further in supportof HSA's overall organisational developments. To ensure better organisation-wide alignmentof strategic directions and systems, we will be pursuing an integrated Organisational Excellencere-certification under the refined niche standards of I-Class and PDS. Together, we willtransform aspirations into reality as we make HSA the leading innovative authority protectingand advancing national health and safety.international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors internationa l visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors int ernational visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors international visitors internationa l visitors internationalVisitors International VisitorsInternational VisitorsCrossing International Borders International VisitorsDate Visits By: 4 April 2006 Dr Margaret Stark, Past President, Association of Forensic Physicians, Principal Forensic Physician, Metropolitan Police; St George's HospitalMedical School, University of London 8 May 2006 Professor Randall Alberte, Director, Department of Biotechnology, Florida Gulf Coast University, USA 30 May 2006 Delegation from Rajamangala University of Technology, Thailand, led by Dr Philip John Barlow 12 - 16 June 2006 Mr Suteep Bussayamanont, Senior Pharmacist/Senior Drug Control Division, ThaiFood and Drug Administration 12 June - 9 July 2006 Mr Chang Hong-Tsang, Document Examiner, Forensic Science Division, Criminal Investigation Bureau, Taiwan, Republic of China 16 June 2006 11-member medical delegation from the Indonesian Red Cross19 - 30 June 2006 Mr Chang Wei-Pin and Ms Liu Hui-Fen, Document Examiners, Laboratory Division, Investigation Bureau, Ministry of Justice, Taiwan,Republic of China 20 June 2006 4-member delegation from the Department of Scientific Services, Brunei Professor Harry Fong, Professor Emeritus of Pharmacognosy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, Collegeof Pharmacy, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA 29 June 2006 Dra.

On Behalf of the Authority Prof Low Teck Seng Acting Chairman Dr John Lim Chief Executive Officer Singapore 26 June 2007 STATEMENT BY THE HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY 121 | The HSA Journ eyHEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY for the year ended 31 March 2007 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Health Sciences Authority (the \"Authority\") set out on pages 3 to 35, which comprise the balance sheet of the Authority asat 31 March 2007, the income and expenditure statement, the statement of changes in equityand cash flow statement of the Authority for the year then ended, and a summary of significantaccounting policies and other explanatory notes. The financial statements for the financialyear ended 31 March 2006 were audited by another auditor whose report dated 23 June 2006expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Management's responsibility for the financial statementsThe Authority's management are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the Health Sciences Authority Act (Cap. 122C, 2002Revised Edition) (the Act) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibilityincludes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparationand fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whetherdue to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and makingaccounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditors' responsibilityOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Singapore Standards on Auditing. Thosestandards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the auditto obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from materialmisstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor'sjudgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financialstatements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditorconsiders internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of thefinancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internalcontrol. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies usedand the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluatingthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The HSA Journ ey | 122In our opinion, (i) the financial statements of the Authority are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards so as to give a trueand fair view of the state of affairs of the Authority as at 31 March 2007 and the results,changes in equity and cash flows of the Authority for the year ended on that date; and (ii) proper accounting and other records have been kept, including records of all assets of the Authority whether purchased, donated or otherwise. During the course of our audit, nothing came to our notice that caused us to believe that the receipt, expenditure and investments of monies and the acquisition and disposal of assets bythe Authority during the year have not been in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

As a statutory board, the Authorityis subject to the directions of MOH and is required to follow policies and instructionsissued from time to time by its supervising ministry and other government ministriesand departments such as the Ministry of Finance (\"MOF\"). The address and principal place of business of the Authority is 11 Outram Road, Singapore 169078. The principal activities of the Authority are: (a) to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, disposal, transport, storage, possession and use of cosmetics, medicines, medical devices and other health-related products,tobacco products, radioactive materials and irradiating apparatuses; (b) to conduct technological assessments of medicines, cosmetics, medical devices and other health-related products for the purpose of determining their efficacy,safety and suitability for consumption and use in Singapore and to advise theGovernment thereon; (c) to collect and co-ordinate the collection of blood from donors and to test, process and distribute such blood and the related products for the purpose of building andmaintaining a safe and adequate national blood supply; (d) to provide professional, investigative and analytical services in health sciences to the Government and to any other person or body (whether in Singapore or elsewhere); (e) to conduct or engage any other person to conduct research in health sciences, and generally to promote the development of health sciences; and (f) to act internationally as the national authority or representative of Singapore in respect of matters related to health sciences. There have been no significant changes in the nature of these activities during the financial year.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 129 | The HSA Journ ey2. Significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of accounting The financial statements of the Authority, have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Health Sciences Authority Act (the \"Act\") (Chapter 122C, 22 RevisedEdition) and the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (\"FRS\"). The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.The financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars (SGD or $).The accounting policies have been consistently applied by the Authority and are consistent with those used in the previous financial year. 2.2 FRS and INT FRS not yet effective The Authority has not applied the following FRS and INT FRS that have been issued but not yet effective: The Authority expects that the adoption of the above pronouncements will not have a significant impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application,except for FRS 107 and the amendment to FRS 1 as indicated below. FRS 107, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and amendment to FRS 1 (revised), Presentation of financial statements (Capital Disclosures)Effective date (annual periods beginning on No. Title or after) FRS 1 : Amendment to FRS 1 (revised), Presentation 1 January 2008 of Financial Statements (Capital Disclosures) FRS 40 : Investment Property 1 January 2007FRS 107 : Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2008 FRS 108 : Operating Segments 1 January 2009 INT FRS 108 : Scope of FRS 102, Share-based Payment 1 May 2006INT FRS 109 : Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 INT FRS 110 : Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 INT FRS 111 : Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007INT FRS 112 : Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1302.2 FRS and INT FRS not yet effective (cont'd) FRS 107 introduces new disclosures to improve the information about financial instruments. It requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aboutexposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimumdisclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysisto market risk. The amendment to FRS 1 requires the Authority to make new disclosuresto enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the Authority's objectives,policies and processes for managing capital. The Authority will apply the amendmentto FRS 1 and FRS 107 from annual period beginning 1 April 2008 2.3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements Estimates, assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Authority'saccounting policies, reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, anddisclosures made. They are assessed on an on-going basis and are based on experienceand relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances. (a) Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing amaterial adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within thenext financial year are discussed below. The cost of property, plant and equipment and intangibles for the operations of the Authority is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives. Managementestimates the useful lives of these property, plant and equipment and intangiblesto be within 5 to 60 years and within 3 to 5 years respectively. These are commonlife expectancies applied in this industry. The carrying amount of the Authority'sproperty, plant and equipment and intangibles at 31 March 2007 was $90,122,739(2005: $91,853,803) and $11,960,395 (2005: $13,273,797) respectively. Changesin the expected level of usage and technological developments could impact theeconomic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore futuredepreciation charges could be revised.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 131 | The HSA Journ ey2.3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (cont'd) (b) Critical judgements made in applying accounting policies The judgement made by management in the process of applying the Authority's accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amountsrecognised in the financial statements is discussed below. Impairment of financial assetsThe Authority follows the guidance of FRS 39 on determining when a financial asset is other-than-temporary impaired. This determination requires significantjudgement. The Authority evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extentto which the fair value of a financial asset is less than its cost; and the financialhealth of and near-term business outlook for the financial asset, including factorssuch as industry performance, changes in technology and operational and financingcash flow. 2.4 Functional and foreign currency Foreign currency transactionsTransactions in foreign currencies are measured in SGD, the functional currency of the Authority and are recorded on initial recognition in SGD at exchange rates approximatingthose ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies are translated at the closing rate of exchange ruling at the balancesheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in aforeign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initialtransactions. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income and expenditurestatement. 2.5 Property, plant and equipment All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulateddepreciation and accumulated impairment loss.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1322.5 Property, plant and equipment (cont'd) The initial cost of fixed assets comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of bringing theasset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditure incurredafter the fixed assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance,is normally charged to the income and expenditure statement in the period in whichthe costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that theexpenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected tobe obtained from the use of an item of fixed assets beyond its originally assessedstandard of performance, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost of fixedasset. In general, plant and equipment costing less than $2,000 each, are charged to the income and expenditure statement in the year of purchase. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Leasehold land and building 60 years (based on lease period) Building improvements 20 years (based on useful life of asset)Computer hardware 3 to 5 yearsMotor vehicles 10 yearsScientific and medical equipment 5 yearsOther equipment, furniture and fittings 5 to 10 years Assets under construction included in plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not available for use. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistentwith previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economicbenefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arisingon derecognition of the asset is included in the income and expenditure statement inthe year the asset is derecognised. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 133 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 2.6 Intangibles Intangible assets acquired, which comprise of computer software development costs, are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangibleassets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulatedimpairment losses. Amortisation of intangibles is calculated on the straight-line method to write-off the costs over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years. The amortisation expense onintangible assets is recognised in the income and expenditure statement through the'amortisation of intangible assets' line item. The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 2.7 Impairment of non-financial assets The Authority assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testingfor an asset is required, the Authority makes an estimate of the asset's recoverableamount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset,unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of thosefrom other assets or groups of assets. In assessing value in use, the estimated futurecash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate thatreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specificto the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount,the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income and expenditurestatement as 'other operating expenses'. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses recognised for an asset may no longerexist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount isestimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has beena change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since thelast impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of theasset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceedthe carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had noimpairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Reversal of an impairmentloss is recognised in the income and expenditure statement. The HSA Journ ey | 1342.8 Financial assets Financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet when, and only when, the Authority becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Such assets areinitially recognised at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs andsubsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains andlosses are recognised in the income and expenditure statement when the loans andreceivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. The Authority classifies the following financial assets as loans and receivables: Cash and short term deposits Trade, grants and other receivables. 2.9 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to aninsignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and short term deposits carried in the balance sheet are classified and accounted for as loans and receivables under FRS 39. The accounting policy is stated in Note 2.8. 2.10 Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables, including amounts due from related parties, are classified and accounted for as loans and receivables under FRS 39. The accounting policy forthis category of financial assets is stated in Note 2.8. An allowance is made for uncollectible amounts when there is an objective evidence that the Authority will not be able to collect the debt. Bad debts are written off whenidentified. Further details on the accounting policy for impairment of financial assetsare stated in Note 2.12 below. 2.11 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in first-out method) and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurredin bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 135 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 2.12 Impairment of financial assets The Authority assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the differencebetween the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effectiveinterest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset isreduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognisedin the income and expenditure statement. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment wasrecognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequentreversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income and expenditure statement,to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised costat the reversal date. 2.13 Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received is recognised in the income and expenditurestatement. 2.14 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables and accruals, which are normally settled on 30 day terms, and loan payable and payables to related parties.Financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when, and only when, theAuthority becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value of consideration received lessdirectly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised costusing the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income and expenditure statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. The liabilitiesare derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled orexpired. The HSA Journ ey | 1362.15 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Authority has a present obligation (legal or constructive) where, as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow ofresources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation anda reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodyingbenefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. 2.16 Employee benefits (a) Defined contribution plans The Authority makes contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. These contributions arerecognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed. (b) Defined benefit pension plan The Authority operates unfunded defined benefit schemes for certain employees under the provisions of the Pension Act (Chapter 225). Following the Civil Service Pension Fund's (CSPF) decision to decentralise the management of the Government Pension Fund, the Authority assumed theresponsibility of managing the pension entitlements of certain officers from 1 April2001. These officers are those who did not opt for the CPF scheme launched in1955 and continued to be entitled to pension benefits under the CSPF scheme. Upon retirement, the pension entitlements of these officers will be met by both CSPF and the Authority in proportion to their length of service before and afterthe establishment of the Authority on 1 April 2001. Accordingly, pension payableto pensionable officers prior to 1 April 2001 are excluded in arriving at theAuthority's pension liabilities.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 137 | The HSA Journ ey2.16 Employee benefits (cont'd) Retirement benefits for these employees are assessed using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The cost of providing for retirement benefitsis charged to the income and expenditure statement so as to spread the regularcost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the actuarial valuationcarried out during the year. The provision for retirement benefit is measured asthe present value of the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates ofSingapore Government Securities which have terms to maturity approximating theterms of the related liability. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the yearthese gains and losses arise. Such benefits are unfunded. The expenses relatingto pension are included as part of staff costs. (c) Employee leave entitlement Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave andlong-service leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balancesheet date. 2.17 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are generally expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of aqualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities toprepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures andborrowing costs are being incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assetsare ready for their intended use. If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceedsits recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recorded. 2.18 Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Authority substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the leaseat the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimumlease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised.Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of thelease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balanceof the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income and expenditure statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Authoritywill obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1382.18 Leases (cont'd) Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income and expenditure statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit ofincentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expense overthe lease term on a straight-line basis. 2.19 Income recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Authority and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following criteriamust also be met before revenue is recognised: (a) Income from the rendering of services that are of a short duration, such as laboratory analysis fees, patient laboratory testing fees, forensic investigating fees andprofessional services fees are recognised when the services are completed. (b) Income from blood processing fees are recognised when the processed blood products are used by the hospitals. (c) Licence fees income are recognised on an accrual basis over the licence period.(d) Fines and forfeitures are recognised on an accrual basis.(e) Interest income is accrued on a time proportionate basis, by reference to principal outstanding and at the interest rates applicable, on an effective yield basis. 2.20 Statutory contribution to consolidated fund In lieu of income tax, the Authority is required to make contribution to the Consolidated Fund based on the net surplus of the Authority (before donations) for the financialyear adjusted for any accumulated deficits carried forward from the years that theAuthority was under the contribution framework. The contribution rate used to computethe amount is pegged to the prevailing corporate tax rate that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 139 | The HSA Journ ey2.21 Deferred assets Deferred assets are recognised for carry-forward of unused accumulated deficits, to the extent that it is probable that future surpluses will be available against which thecarry-forward of unused accumulated deficits can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future surpluses willbe available to allow all or part of the deferred asset to be utilised. Unrecogniseddeferred assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to theextent that it has become probable that future surpluses will allow the deferred assetto be recovered. Deferred assets and liabilities are measured at the contribution rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based oncontribution rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balancesheet date. 2.22 Sales tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part ofthe cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable;and Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 2.23 Grants Government grants receivable are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be compliedwith. Government grants to meet the current year's operating expenses are recognised as income in the financial year in which the operating expenses are incurred.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 The HSA Journ ey | 1402.23 Grants (cont'd) Government grants and contributions from other organisations utilised for the purchase/construction of depreciable assets are taken to the deferred capital grantsaccount.

Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the balance of the relateddeferred capital grants is recognised in the income and expenditure statement to matchthe net book value of the assets written-off. 2.24 Related parties Related parties in these financial statements include other Government ministries, statutory boards and restructured hospitals. Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party inmaking financial and operating decisions.

Financial risk management objectives and policies The Authority's principal financial instruments comprise of cash, short term deposits and long term loans. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance theAuthority's operations. The Authority has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. The Authority does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The main risks arising from the Authority's financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Authority reviews and agreespolicies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. (a) Interest rate risk The Authority's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Authority's interest-bearing loans and fixed deposits. Funding requirements areregularly reviewed so that cash in excess of short term operating requirements are placed in fixed deposits to maximise returns. Information on interest rates exposure is disclosed in Notes 7 and 16. (b) Foreign currency risk The Authority does not have any material foreign exchange risk as its operations are substantially transacted in, Singapore dollars. (c) Credit risk The Authority's credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables. The Authority places its cash and cash equivalents with credit-worthy financial institutions. The credit risk with respect to receivables is low as the Authority deals with credit-worthy organisations suchas government bodies and hospitals. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Authority's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Authority has no significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables are spread over a large base of organisations. The maximum credit risk that the Authority is exposed to is represented by carrying amounts of its financial assets as stated in the balance sheet. 159 | The HSA Journ eyNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - 31 March 2007 27. Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont'd) (d) Liquidity risk The Authority funds its operations through a mix of internally-generated funds, government and non-government grants. The Authority regularly reviews itsliquidity reserves, comprising cash flows from its operations and government grants, to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained at all times. The Authority relies on the Government to fund a significant part of its operations. The framework for funding of the Authority's operations is reviewed with the Ministry of Health on a regularbasis.
