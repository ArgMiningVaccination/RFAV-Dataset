It does not include policy changes that occurred since th en. This country profile benefited from input and comments from the Australian Government. Authors are responsible for any error. Contextual information on pharmaceutical coverage and pricing 1. Australian residents are covered for health services by a national scheme (Medicare), which covers a number of program mes. One of these, the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS), assists with the costs of prescription medicines dispensed in the community and private hospitals a nd some pharmaceuticals dispensed to public hospital outpatients and in public hospital emergency departments.1 In addition to the drugs and medicinal preparations listed in the general Schedule of PBS, the federal government also funds a number of drugs , which are distributed under alternative arrangements.2 These are highly -specialised medicines and many cancer drugs. The program me defines maximum quantities and the number of repeats which can be funded. For some of these medicines, prior authorisation is required. 2. Patients contribute to the costs of medicines under the PBS through copayments (up to AUD 35.40 per prescription in 2012 for general patients). Holders of a Commonwealth Concession Card (\"concessional patients\", i.e. pensioners and veterans) are entitled to lower copayments ( AUD 5.80).3 Access to a Concession card is means tested. 3. Australia uses reference pricing for generic clusters and for groups of drugs wit h similar safety and health outcomes that can be used interchangeably (therapeutic groups). The maximum reimbursement amount for a medicine in a therapeutic group is based at the level of the lowest price in the group and patients pay any difference betwee n the price of the drug purchased and the reference price. If a patient cannot take a medicine in the same therapeutic group, due to a clinical reason certified by the doctor, the government will pay the premium contribution on his/her behalf. 1. The responsibility for providing pharmaceuticals to public hospital inpatients lies with state and territory health departments. Residents of all states, except New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, are eligible to PBS access when attending public hospital outpatient and emergency departments. 2. These alternative arrangements are provided for under section 100 of the National Health Act 1953 and often referred to as \"section 100\" listing by opposition to other products of the general PBS schedule (section 85 of the same act). See www.pbs.gov.au/browse/section100 , for the list of medicines. Among the medicines selected for the OECD study boceprevir (for Hepatitis C) is included in \"section 100\" list. 3. www.pbs.gov.au/info/about -the-pbs. 4 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 4. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), a division of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (DHA), grants marketing authorisations. Manufacturers of prescription medicines have to file an application t o the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for their medicine to be subsidised under the PBS. The PBAC must assess whether the medicine is both clinically effective and cost -effective (compared to other treatments) before recommending that a p roduct should be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). In practice, most prescription drugs are included in this list. 5. Once the PBAC has issued a positive recommendation for inclusion in the PBS, the g overnment may seek to regulate its reimbursement price. 6. Since 2006, drugs covered by the PBS are listed in two formularies ( DHA , 2010): Formulary One (F1) consists of drugs which have only one brand each; Formulary Two (F2) consists of drugs which have two or more brands each. Drugs on F1 move to F2 when the first additional brand is listed on the PBS. 7. On a macro -level, PBS expenditure is not capped in Australia. H owever, pharmaceutical prices can be reduced. Pricing and reimbursement: decision making process 8. According to the DHA, the core objectives of Australia's National Medicines Policy are the following (Department o f Health and Ageing, 2010): Timely access to medicines Australians need, at a cost individuals and the community can afford; Medicines that meet appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy; Quality use of medicines; Maintaining a responsible and viable pharmaceutical industry. 9. Manufacturers of prescription medicines have to file an application to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for their medicine to be subsidised under the PBS. The PB AC considers an economic evaluation, at the price initially set by the manufacturer, to determine whether the product should be included in the PBS list. 10. Once the PBAC has issued a positive recommendation, the PBS listing of the drug must be considered by the g overnment. The Minister for Health is t he ultimate decision maker for PBS listing after the positive recommendation from the PBAC . In particular circumstances, such as when the proposed drug and its comparator produce similar clinical results, the PBAC may recommend a lower price than the price proposed by the manufacturer, on the basis of the results of the economic evaluation . In such case, the PBAC recommendation is foll owed by negotiations on price. 5 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 Assessment phase for reimbursement decisions Institutions, experts and stakeholders 11. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is r esponsible for the assessment of manufacturers' submissions for listing of new drugs or substantial changes in listing conditions of drugs already listed. The PBAC has established two sub -committees :4 The Economics Sub -Committee (ESC) advises on cost -effec tiveness policies and evaluates cost - effectiveness aspects of major submissions to the PBAC . The ESC includes 12 experts in health economics or clinical fields (public health, pharmacy, epidemiology and other specialties) and one pharmaceutical industry re presentative. The Drug Utilization Sub -Committee (DUSC) monitors the patterns and trends of drug use and makes utilization data available publicly. The DUSC includes nine qualified experts, a consumer and two industry representatives. 12. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is an independent statutory committee, which meets three times per year. It is assisted by a secretariat and contracted teams of expert academic evaluators. As an independent Commi ttee, the PBAC determines its own decision -making process in closed sessions. Only members of the Committee can participate in the decision -making process. PBAC members are usually appointed for a period of four years by the Minister for Health. Members ar e medical practitioners (specialists, general practitioners and clinical pharmacologists), pharmacists, consumers and health economists. There is no pharmaceutical industry representative on the PBAC. Assessment principles 13. The PBAC has edited Guidelines for p reparing submissions5 to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee whose aim is to provide practical information (including guidance for economic evaluations) to the pharmaceutical industry for making a su bmission to PBAC and to help PBAC assess submissions. 14. The assessment of drugs for inclusion in the PBS lists is based on a pharmaco economic evaluation from a healthcare system perspective. The PBAC prefers to oper ate on an incremental cost per extra QALY gained basis. Value is assessed when PBAC compares the cost and benefits of a new drug with those of an exi sting therapy to calculate its incremental cost -effectiveness r atio (ICER). 15. The PBAC applies the same rules to all medicines in all therapeutic areas. The committee considers a range of relevant factors in addition to incremental co st-effectiveness (Chalkidou et al. , 2012) : Clinical need, particularly for condi tions for which there are no, or few, treatment options; The extent to which a proposed treatment represents a clinically meaningful advance in therapy; The degree of uncertainty in the estimate of incremental cost -effectiveness; 4. www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/participants/pbac 5. Guidelines for preparing s ubmissions to the PBAC - December 2008 can be found here: www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pbacguidelines -index 6 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 The potential total cost t o the PBS or government health budgets; The scope for use of the drug beyond any restriction for subsidy, and the extent to which a restriction can be constructed that satisfactorily distinguishes use that is acceptably cost -effective from use that is not cost-effective; The potential for adverse outcomes arising from availability with subsidy (e.g., the PBAC may restrict subsidized use of certain antibiotics to limit the development of resistant organisms); The affordability of the medicine to the patient in the absence of a subsidy; The \"rule of rescue\" - reserved for drugs for serious or fatal diseases for which no other treatment is available. Submission requirements 16. The PBAC distinguishes three types of submis sions, with different requirements in terms of information (PBAC, 2008) :6 Major submissions must include an economic evaluation, according to guidelines published by the PBAC. Major submissions are needed in the following cases : listing of a new drug (i.e. a new fixed combination product, a new nutritional product, a new vaccine , or a new orphan drug); substantial change in a \"restricted listing\" (e.g. listing for a new indication or lifting of restrictions); request for a review of the comparative cost -effectiveness of a currently listed drug in order to change a PBAC recommendation or obtain a price advantage; listing a new form or strength of a currently listed drug for which a price advantage is requested. Minor submissions do not usually require the su bmission of an economic evaluation. They relate to new forms of previously listed products (with no price advantage sought and small expected impact on volumes) or changes to the conditions of use (e.g. change in maximum quantity per prescription or maximu m number of refills). Submissions to list generic equivalents are assessed by the DHA and usually do not need to be assessed by the PBAC. 17. When considering orphan drugs, PBAC does not set a minimum standard for th e type and level of evidence or other information that can be included in a submission to the committee. Nonetheless, the PBAC is required to consider comparative costs and effectiveness. Types of economic evaluation 18. An economic evaluation is required for all major submissions. However, PBAC requirements differ according to additional benefits of the new medicine over its competitors. PBAC Guidelines indicate which type of evaluation is needed in each case (PBAC , 2008). Cost -utility analysis is generally preferred when the proposed drug is therapeutically superior to the main comparator. 6.

Source : Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee Guidelines (20 13). Criteria for clinical assessment: health outcomes 19. PBAC considers end -point outcomes, such as deaths prevented, life -years gained, or quality - adjusted life -years gained. Surrogate outcomes are accepted when final outcome data are not available, and where the model used in the analysis shows a link between surrogate and final outcomes (PBAC Guidelines, 2008).7 Choice of comparators for comparative effectiveness analysis 20. Pharmaceutical companies are expected to identify \"the main comparator\" in their submissions to the PBAC, defined as \"the therapy that prescribers would most replace with the proposed drug in practice if the PBS subsidises the proposed drug as requested\". The 2008 guidelines include details on the method to identify the main comparator (PBAC, 200 8), w hich are summarised below. 21. In practice, the main comparator can be difficult to identify. In some cases, comparisons with more than one comparator will be necessary. The following rules aim to assist applicants in selecting the appropriate comparator and sponsors can always seek advice from the PBAC Secretariat and/or the Pharmaceutical Evaluation Section: If pharmacological analogues are already listed, the main comparator will usually be the most prescribed one, unless important differences exist in the set of indications. If important differences exist in the set of indications, the main comparator is the drug most prescribed to treat the proposed indication for the proposed drug. 7. www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pbacguidelines -index , consulted on January 15th, 2012. 8 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 If the proposed drug is in a new therapeutic class but will be used for an indication for which there are other drugs widely used to t reat that indication, the main comparator will usually be the drug which is the most prescribed to treat that indication. If no currently listed drug is available, the main comparator will usually be standard medical treatment (this could include a surgica l procedure or conservative management). This should be clearly and consistently defined in both the submission and the comparative randomised trials. 22. If the drug is supplied in a special formulation (e.g. sustai ned release tablets, oral pressurised inhalation), the main comparator selected according to the above criteria should be in a similar formulation, if available. 23. Prescribing practice can change rapidly and a drug chosen on reasonable grounds at the outset as the main comparator may not always be so relevant at the time of submission . This is particularly likely given the long time necessary to obtain primary data as part of Phase III or Phase IIIb trials. Allowanc e will be made for this during the evaluation of submissions. If a sponsor is designing such a trial with a view to eventual submission to the PBAC, the advice of the PBAC Secretariat and/or the Pharmaceutical Evaluation Section may be sought. No guarantee can be given that the PBAC will be constrained by this advice when considering the eventual submission, as important factors could change, such as a different approved indication to that originally anticipated. A submission incorporating a trial based on this advice will be accepted for evaluation, but it may be necessary to present an analysis based on two sets of randomised trials involving the originally chosen comparator as a common reference. 24. If the only com parative randomised trials available use a comparator that is different to the main comparator chosen according to PBAC guidelines (for example, these may be trials conducted overseas where the appropriate comparator is different), it may also be necessary to present an analysis based on two sets of randomised trials involving the overseas comparator as a common reference .8 Assessments of costs 25. The categories of costs considered by PBAC are the following (PBAC, 20 13)9: Direct health care resources : (a) drugs (direct costs of treatment and of drugs used to treat side effects); (b) medical services including procedures; (c) hospital services; (d) diagnostic and investigational services; (e) community -based services; and (f) any other direct medical co sts. Direct non -health care resources: such as social services (home help, day care, meals on wheels, nursing and physiotherapy services etc.) may be relevant only on special occasion , e.g. particular condition under treatment or the age of the patients . Some of these are included in the Manual of Resource Items and their Associated Costs. Natural units of direct health care resources: Define the natural units (such as number of GP consultations or admissions per DRG) used to measure the change in the amoun t of resources provided ( see also the Manual of Resource Items and their Associated Costs) 8. Section B(i), Part III of PBAC (2008) gives f urther advice on presenting such an indirect comparison. 9. Section D.4, Part II and Appendix 9 of PBAC (2013) give further advice on variables to be considered in economic evaluations. 9 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 Indirect economic outcomes: These include potential working time gained or lost measured in time units (days, weeks, years etc). They may also include potential impa ired working time gained or lost by sick patients continuing to work measured in similar time units together with a measure of the extent of impairment. Particular care is needed when considering indirect economic outcomes when using surrogate outcome indi cators (their combination may be inappropriate) or utilities (to avoid double -counting the estimates of benefit, see also Appendix 9 of the 20 13 PBAC Guidelines). Implicit or explicit cost -effectiveness threshold 26. PBAC guidelines do not explicitly specify a threshold under which an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) is considered attractive. Although PBAC does not appear to work with an explicit threshold value, a study reports that observation of the decis ions of the PBAC between 1994 and 2003 point ed to an apparent threshold of AUD 69 900 per QALY gained, above which reimbursement was found to be unlikely (Henry, 2005) . A more recent study analysed t he outcome of the assessment of submissions to the PBAC f or product -indication between July 2005 and November 2009: about 59% of these received a positive recommendation for listing (with or without restrictions) and 41% of decisions were \"deferred \" or negative. Among assessment s including an ICER value (about 5 0% of all assessments), the percentage of positive recommendations decreased when the ICER increased: 51% of submissions with an ICER inferior to AUD 45 000 were accepted, against 33% when the ICER was in the AUD 45 000-75 000 range and 16% beyond AUD 75 000 (Mauskopf et al., 2013). There is however no evidence that this implicit threshold is effectively used to guide PBAC's decisions (Cleemput et al. , 2008). Hence, each application is considered by the PBAC on its merit, with the acceptability of each incremental cost -effectiveness ratio cons idered on a case -by-case basis. 27. PBAC a ssessment reports do not include the exact value of the ICER of the drug evaluated but only indicate the range in which the ICER of the product ( for a specific indication) is included : AUD 15 000 to 45 000; 45 000 to 75 000; 75 000 to 105 000; 105 000 to 200 000. In the sample of products considered in this study, medicines with ICER higher than AUS 75 000 were never recommended for inclusion in the PBS schedule, and medicines (or indications) with an ICER higher than AUS 45 000 were recommended only in exceptional circumstances (high clinical need and no alternative). Consideration of end -of-life treatme nts 28. The PBAC applies similar rules to all medicines with no special treatment for oncology or other \"end -of-life\" medicine. However, the PBAC takes into account the \"rule of rescue\" factor for each drug submission . This is applied rarely and only for medicines for life-threatening condition for which there is no other effective treatment available in Australia, either subsidised or unsubsidised (Cha lkidou et al. , 2012). 29. The Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP) provides subsidised access for eligible patients to expensive life saving drugs for very rare life -threatening conditions where the drugs are not recommended for inclusion on the PBS. Before a drug is made available on th e LSDP it must be assessed by the PBAC as clinically necessary and effective, but not recommended for inclusion on the PBS due to unacceptable cost - effectiveness. During 2010 -11, nine drugs were funded through the program me for the treatment of 210 patient s with seven different disorders.10 Each condition has separate eligibility guidelines, developed 10. Drugs funded through the LSDP in 2013 included the following: im (Naglazyme\u00ae) for MPS Type VI; alglucosidase alfa 10 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 and administered with the advice of an expert disease advisory committee, and any amendments are submitted to the PBAC for consideration (DHA annual report 2010 -2011). Consideration of orphan drugs 30. The PBS provides specific funding for patients treated in public hospitals for certain high cost drugs but there is no special explicit consideration of orphan drugs, apar t from the Life Saving Drugs Program, which operates outside the PBS and funds a small number of \"ultra orphans\" (see above) . Outcome of the process 31. In 2009 -10, PBAC considered 216 submissions, of which 73 were m ajor submissions requiring cost-effectiveness analysis, and 143 were minor submission s which did not require a cost -effectiveness analysis. In 2010 -11, PBAC considered 191 submissions, of which 63 were major submissions and 128 minor submissions (DHA Annua l Report 2010 -2011). 32. PBAC recommendations are provided to product sponsors and the Minister for Health and are publicly available through \"PBAC Outcomes \" (published around 8 weeks after a PBAC meeting) . Public Summary Documents (PSDs) are published around 4 months after the relevant PBAC meeting. The PSD includes information on the economic analysis presented by the company and PBAC evaluation of the cost effectiveness claims , as well as PBAC recommendation and rea sons.11 33. PBAC recommendations are valid for a period of five years. If the PBAC does not make a recommendation to list, the applicant may re -submit with new or additional information at any time. Pricing policy Who sets the price of a new drug? 34. Pharmaceutical companies set the price of their drug in the non -PBS market without regulatory intervention. Where listing on the PBS is sought, the PBAC is responsible for the assessment of the proposed price for listing and can deny inclusion on the list until the company reduces the price or impose restrictions in use to a particular patient sub -group likely to benefit most from the drug. This process is an incentive for manuf acturers to adjust prices in order to receive a positive PBAC recommendation. 35. In addition, the government and the manufacturer must formally agree on the price of a product before listing on the PBS, and, in the c ases of drugs subject to a risk -sharing arrangement, the terms of conditions in any such a rrangement. The g overnment cannot compel a manufacturer to list a product on the PBS. Institutions and stakeholders 36. The Ph armaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority (PBPA) is a non -statutory committee that meets three times a year following PBAC meetings to help the government negotiate the final price at which a drug should be listed on the PBS. It may recommend either a ceilin g price or price range for an item that has been approved by the PBAC following negotiation. The PBPA is supported by a secretariat which operates within the DHA. (Myozyme\u00ae) for infantile -onset p ompe disease; and eculizumab Paroxysmal Nocturnal 11. www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/public -summary -documents . PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 37. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority includes representatives from the pharmaceutical industry (R&D based and generic), from consumers, from the Department of Health and Ageing and from the department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research . How are prices set? 38. The PBPA reviews prices of listed drugs and recommends prices for new drugs which have be en recommended by the PBAC for listing. When considering prices, the PBPA may conside r a range of factors (PBPA, 2011 ; DHA, 2013 ): PBAC comments on clini cal and cost -effectiveness aspects of items; The prices of alternative brands of a drug; Comparative prices of items containing drugs in the same ATC group; Cost information provided by the drug supplier or estimated by the PBPA; Prescription volumes, econ omies of scale and other factors such as expiry dates, storage requirements, product stability and special manufacturing requirements; Prices of items containing the drug in reasonably comparable overseas countries; Other relevant factors which the applica nt company may wish the PBPA to consider; Any directions of the Minister of Health. 39. The level of activity being undertaken by the company in Australia, including new investment, production, research and developme nt\" was explicitly taken into account in the past but is no longer considered (PBPA, 2010). Pricing methods 40. The PBPA uses the following methods to recommend prices (PBPA, 2009): The Cost Plus method consists in granting a gross margin on the costs of manufacturing. This margin is set on a case by case basis. A 30% margin is usually considered reasonable, but higher margins may be recommended for low -volume products (particularly those with a cost to the PBS of AUD 50 000 per annum or less) and lower o nes may be recommended for high -volume products. Reference prices (for clusters of therapeutically similar products) are set according to the principle o f cost -minimisation. The lowest -priced medicine se ts a benchmark price for other drugs of the cluster. The Weighted Average Monthly Treatment Cost (WAMTC) methodology is a particular type of reference pricing, aiming to adjust the prices of drugs providing similar health outcomes so that the monthly trea tment cost is not statistically significantly different. This method is currently applied only to th ose drugs w hich are included in T herapeutic Groups (five classes of drugs: H2 receptor antagonists, angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, proton pump and higher -potency statins group comprising atorvastatin and rosuvastatin). 12 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 41. Where a medicine has more than one indication and a cost-effectiveness that varies across indications, a weighted average price according to expected volumes of use across the indications is set. Risk-sharing agreements 42. Risk-sharing agreements are increasingly used to contain overall costs of drugs included in the PBS or to manage financial risks for the g overnment. At 30 June 2013 , there were 76 agreement s in place or in development (DHA, 2013 ). Risk -sharing agreements a re made on a commercial and confidential basis and are not publicly available. 43. Several types of risk -sharing schemes are employed in Australia (Pugatch, 2010): Price volume agreements (PVAs) are used for individu al medicines or a group of medicines treating a certain disease. In these agreements, any excess in the forecasted budget will lead to price reductions or re bates (% of costs) paid to the g overnment by the company. Some schemes impose rebates on costs gene rated by uses outside of the restrictions set by the PBAC. Other schemes use a combination of both. Some agreements take the form of performance -based agreements. 44. The funding of medicines, including those subject to risk -sharing agreements , may restricted , in accordance with PBAC recommendations , for instance \"to patients with severe cases of the disease, who have failed to adequately respond to cheaper or less toxic existing therapies \". In some cases, patients mu st formally agree that their access to a new treatment will only continue if it produces an adequate response, according to predetermined criteria. Consideration of budget impact 45. The Department of Health and Agein g (DHA) administers the Pharmaceutical Benefit S cheme. Decisions are made on the basis of cost -effectiveness and budget provision must be made by the government in its forward estimates before drugs are included on the Schedule. 46. Until recently, when the budget impact of a single drug was expected to exceed AUD 10 million per year, its inclusion in the PBS required approval from the Cabinet. This could be drugs with low cost and high use or drugs with low utilisati on but very high costs (Lu, 2008). Given the current fiscal environment, the government decided in 2010 -11 that all positive recommendations made by the PBAC and the PBPA for new or amended PBS listings and price increases which have a financial impact for the government, will be considered by the Cabinet (DHA , 2011 ). Price changes 47. The price of each drug listed i n the PBS is reviewed annually by ATC groupings. Manufacturers are asked to submit cost and other data that they wish to be considered in reviewing product prices. 48. Drugs included in the PBS list can be subject to several types of price reductions. Since 2007, the first time a new brand of a currently listed drug is listed on the PBS, the price of all brands of that drug is reduced by 12.5 per cent. This statutory reduction increased to 16 percent from 1 April 2011 for all new first time listings of a new brand of an existing PBS listed medicine. 13 VALUE IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 Additional statutory price reductions of 2% and 5% occurred on 1 February 2011 for all non - exempted medicines on the F2 formulary. A policy of price disclosure has been p rogressively implemented since 2007 for drugs in F2. Manufacturers are required to provide information on the actual selling price of their drugs to the Department of Health and Ageing (i.e. including rebates and incentives to wholesalers and pharmacies). With this information, the DHA computes the \"weighted average disclosed price \" (WADP) to reflect the price at which the drug is being supplied in the market. If this WADP is more than 10 per cent below the PBS price, then the PBS price is reduced to the WA DP. Final decision making Role of government 49. The Department of Health and Ageing (DHA) manages the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. The Medicare part of the Department of Human Services administers the operati ons of the P BS on behalf of the Australian Government. The DHA is responsible for maintaining the Schedule, including by listing new dru gs following approval from the g overnment which takes into account recommendations from the PBAC and the PBPA. The g overnment may reject a positive recommendation from the PBAC, but this happens only rarely (Morgan et al. , 2008). The m inister cannot list a medicine without a positive PBAC recommendation. 50. As mentioned before, since 2011, the Cabinet needs to approve any new listing, or change to an existing listing. Outcome of the process 51. Listing of a new drug in the PBS may be restricted to certain uses. Many medications on the PBS are subsidised for a specific patient group or indication. The DHA distinguishes three categories according to their degree of restriction (DHA website): Unrestricted benefits ( with no restriction in the therapeutic use); Restricted benefits (the medicine can only be prescribed for specific therapeutic uses); And \"authority required benefits\" for which doctors need prior approval from Medicare in the Department of Human Services or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. 52. High -cost medicines are commonly subject to \"prescription requirements\" to control their use (Lu et al., 2 008). For some high -cost drugs (e.g. trastuzumab, imatinib, and gefinitib) , public funding requires confirmatio n that the patient is likely to respond, i.e. carries the specific genetic marke r (Lu, 2008). 53. In 2011 -2012, 142 new PBS medicines or extensions to existing PBS listed medicines were included in the positive list. In addition, one medicine was included on the Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP). Due to a difficult fiscal environment, the listing of seven medicines was deferred for a few months. 12 The government did not include these drugs because therapeutic alternativ es were available in the PBS (Doecke, 2011). All these drugs were finally listed at the end of 2011. 12. The seven deferred medicines PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING - COUNTRY PROFILE: AUSTRALIA \u00a9 OECD 2014 54. In 2010 -11, the PBS subsidised more than 760 medicines available in more than 1,960 forms and more than 3,950 differently branded items (DHA Annual Report 2010 -2011). Published decisions 55. The s chedule, which lists all medicines available under the PBS, is available at www.pbs.gov.au . It is updated monthly to include new listings and the latest changes. Contestability 56.
