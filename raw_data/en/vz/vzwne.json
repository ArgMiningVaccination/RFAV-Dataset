Earlier Americans to the new world came with their own traditions and practices of medicine and treatments that have been passed down from generation to generation. Since most families came to America with no money, they used a lot of natural remedies, and ancient traditions to treat their ailments, which cost little or nothing. This form of medicine and treatment has been forgotten, and more traditional practices have been pushed to the front of mainstream medical community, which is government regulated treatment and medicine. High cost of health care today and the urge to seek new treatments and cures Throughout the years there have been two traditions within the practice of medicine. One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. In modern medicine, alternative therapies are poorly understood and studied. The preference for alternative therapies, and herbal medicine were indicated, and the fear of relinquishing information regarding these practices were almost paralyzing. It seemed as though they were ashamed to admit to cultural healing practices, and did not divulge information to practitioners regarding their usage. The cultural disconnect was present as alternative/complimentary medicines are valued as a culture, and \"modern\" practitioners cast judgment on their usage. This perceived stigma additionally limited the information shared by the cultural participants with modern medical treatments, potentially causing additional harm, as some herbals are potentially toxic. Although alternative healing methods have been historically practiced longer than biomedicine, the culture of biomedicine has in the past few centuries worked to assert itself as a more legitimate form of healing. These claims in part come from the assertion that science has proven the legitimacy and effectiveness of biomedicine and the same cannot be said for alternative healing methods. These differences in healing relate to the fact that they have different views of what causes illness. Additionally the two ideologies often cannot coexist with each other which only leads to more disagreement. The differences between the culture of biomedicine and alternative healing methods stem from different understandings of where illness comes from and therefore how it can be healed. In this day and age, a culture of compromise and understanding from both sides, biomedical and traditional, is necessary for effective treatments. Alternative medicine should not be funded because it is not as successful as conventional treatments. Holistic medicine is nothing more than the study of natural products in an effort to scrutinize what herbs help in a dietary way or revitalize health. When has the study of natural and dietary products become \"alternative\"? David Gorski an associate professor at Wayne State University argues that the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) should not be funded because the agency promotes alternative and complementary therapies in the absence of rigorous scientific evidence that they are effective. Conventional treatments become conventional treatments due to rigorous testing. Rigorous testing is required because it All most all pain treatment and therapies have pros and cons of its use. Nurse should be aware of both the pros and the cons of a treatment modality prior to introduce to a patient. Acupuncture therapy can be a good non-pharmacologic method and has benefits for patients. Many studies claimed that the method is effective to decrease pain related to many health problems and also can reduce inflammation. It can be a good treatment to a wide variety of pain types with low risk of adverse effects as conjunction or an adjuvant therapy with pain medications and other treatments (OPMC). If this therapy works for an individual patient, it could be the life time pain management therapy for the patient even without using medications. Furthermore, not only for pain management, acupuncture has been shown to be promoting a sense of overall wellbeing and relaxation. During the therapy session, patients reported that they feel very relaxed (UC San Diego Center for Integrative Medicine). Unlike pharmacologic modalities, acupuncture is fairly safe and less side effects or interactions with other treatment modalities (Wilkinson, Introduction Today 's modern health care is ever evolving in its approach to health and care of a patient revolves around being culturally and ethnically competent in their treatment. In the United States (US), the growing aging population, brings an increasing public awareness of the major risk factors that are contributing to chronic illness. The availability of knowledgeable healthcare practitioners is also growing to meet the needs of this growing population. Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is aimed to provide a multidisciplinary and educational health care experience. In this project, it will be explained about being culturally and ethnically competent and the use of alternative medicine as an adjunct therapy or a Because many of the treatments of alternative medicine do not adhere to the principles of conventional medicine, whether or not to allow practice of these techniques in the United States is a major concern of the medical community today. The Food and Drug Administration is the decision making body of issues such as this and more often than not, does not approve many of these practices. Due to the fact that holistic medicine sometimes contradicts the fundamentals of biomedicine, health care regulation boards such as the FDA find it difficult to accept many of these treatments. Because the Western world is so unfamiliar with these techniques it is only natural for medical community to often disprove these methods. However, as more and more doctors discover the limitations of This process results in deactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, reducing the body's overall state of stress and excitability, and improving the patient's sense of well-being\" (Hamlin 2017). Aromatherapy causes the release of endorphins and serotonin and can potentially have an effect on every system in the body. A common essential oil that has been effective in reducing pain is lavender. Aromatherapy can be used in a variety of routes including inhalation, topical application or diffusion. Music therapy has many therapeutic effects including decreasing anxiety, improving mood, decreasing heart rate as well as blood pressure, and decreasing the perception of pain. Using the technique of guided imagery, the patient should focus on positive images to distract themselves from their pain. The process of acupuncture is invasive, and patients may shy away from it because of this. In acupuncture, specific points are stimulated in order to unblock a persons 'qi' or chi (Hamlin 2017). Acupressure is similar to The first reason for supporting alternative medicine is because it's effective. In fact, Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for more than 5,000 years with proof of its effectiveness (Sutton, 2010, 95). In addition, TCM has punch of methods for treating patient's widely such as herbs and other (Sutton, 2010, 94-95). That means alternative medicine has proved its worth and won people's respect. CAM is used by million of Americans. Despite its popularity, it remain an ongoing debate. Numerous physicians decline to utilize CAM therapies such as acupuncture and herbal supplements as a method of treating illness. Physician's view in general, however, appears to have a small impact on the increase use of CAM among patients. Although, a variety of treatments are available, more people are turning to CAM therapies to reduce pain and side effects. The popularity of CAM has forced health care providers to examine the use of CAM in medicine. More research is being conducted on the benefits and safety of CAM, and this paper evaluates such data and provides evidence in which these procedures are The use of acupuncture falls into the domain of pseudoscience. Acupuncture stimulates various anatomical points in the body through various techniques. More commonly, thin, metallic needles are utilized to penetrate the skin and access specific acupoints. These thin needles are then manipulated by hand or electrical stimulation in order to By examining some of the most popular, enduring alternative medical systems, one can begin to see some general trends of the systems, understand some recurring flaws, and understand the attraction and usefulness of alternative medicine in today's health care system. However, alternative medicine remains controversial. Whether it can be supported scientifically or not, alternative medicine may be useful to encourage both physical and mental well-being via a placebo effect. For this reason, alternative medicine must be considered by physicians as a complement to modern medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
