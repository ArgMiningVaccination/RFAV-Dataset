In 2017-2018, 42.4% of adults were obese ( [1](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548577) [ General reference Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2.

Prevalence was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian adults (17.4%) as compared to non-Hispanic black (49.6%), Hispanic (44.8%), and non-Hispanic white (42.2%) adults. There were no significant differences in prevalence between men and women among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, or Hispanic adults; however, prevalence among non-Hispanic black women (56.9%) was higher than all other groups. In the US, obesity and its complications cause as many as 300,000 premature deaths each year, making it second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death. General reference 1. [Hales CM, Carroll MD, Fryar CD, et al](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm): Prevalence of obesity and severe obesity among adults: United States, 2017-2018. NCHS Data Brief, no 360. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics, 2020. Etiology of Obesity Causes of obesity are probably multifactorial and include genetic predisposition. Ultimately, obesity results from a long-standing imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, including energy utilization for basic metabolic processes and energy expenditure from physical activity. However, many other factors appear to increase a person's predisposition to obesity, microbiome, factors. Genetic factors Heritability of BMI is about 66%. Genetic factors may affect the many signaling molecules and receptors used by parts of the hypothalamus and gastrointestinal tract to regulate food intake (see sidebar [Pathways Regulating Food Intake](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v886595) [ Pathways Regulating Food Intake ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v886595) ). Genetic factors can be inherited or result from conditions in utero (called genetic imprinting). Rarely, obesity results from abnormal levels of peptides that regulate food intake (eg, leptin) or abnormalities in their receptors (eg, melanocortin-4 receptor). Genetic factors also regulate energy expenditure, metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, and nonvoluntary activity-associated thermogenesis. Genetic factors may have a greater effect on the distribution of body fat, particularly abdominal fat (which increases the risk of [metabolic syndrome](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/metabolic-syndrome) [ Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Causes... read more ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/metabolic-syndrome) ), than on the amount of body fat. Environmental factors Weight is gained when caloric intake exceeds energy needs. Important determinants of energy intake include Portion sizes The energy density of the food High-calorie foods (eg, processed foods), diets high in refined carbohydrates, and consumption of soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol promote weight gain. Diets high in fresh fruit and vegetables, fiber, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins, with water as the main fluid consumed, minimize weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain. Regulatory factors Prenatal maternal obesity, prenatal maternal smoking, and intrauterine growth restriction can disturb weight regulation and contribute to weight gain during childhood and later. Obesity that persists beyond early childhood makes weight loss in later life more difficult. The composition of the gut microbiome also appears to be an important factor; early use of antibiotics and other factors that alter the composition of the gut microbiome may promote weight gain and obesity later in life ( [1](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548595) [ Etiology references Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2. Complications include cardiovascular disorders (particularly in people with excess abdominal fat)... read more ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548595) ). Early exposure to obesogens, a type of endocrine-disrupting chemical (eg, cigarette smoke, bisphenol A, air pollution, flame retardants, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls) can alter metabolic set points through epigenetics or nuclear activation, increasing the propensity of developing obesity ( [2](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548591) [ Regulatory factors ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548591) ). Adverse childhood events or abuse in early childhood increase risk of several disorders, including obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's adverse childhood events study demonstrated that childhood history of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse predicted an 8% increase risk of BMI 30 and 17.3% of BMI to 40. Certain types of abuse carried the strongest risk. For example, frequent verbal abuse had the largest increase in risk (88%) for BMI > 40. Being often hit and injured increased the risk of BMI > 30 by 71% ( [3](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548595) [ Etiology references Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2. Complications include cardiovascular disorders (particularly in people with excess abdominal fat)... read more ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548595) ). Cited mechanisms for the association between abuse and obesity include neurobiologic and epigenetic phenomena ( [4](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v28548595) [ Etiology references Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2.

About 15% of women permanently gain 20 lb with each pregnancy. Insufficient sleep (usually considered < 6 to 8 hours/night) can result in weight gain by changing the levels of satiety hormones that promote hunger. Drugs, including corticosteroids, can cause weight gain. Uncommonly, weight gain is caused by one of the following disorders: Brain damage caused by a tumor (especially a craniopharyngioma) or an infection (particularly those affecting the hypothalamus), which can stimulate consumption of excess calories Hypercortisolism due to [Cushing syndrome](/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/adrenal-disorders/cushing-syndrome) [Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.

This disorder does not include compensatory behaviors, such as vomiting. Binge eating disorder occurs in about 3.5% of women and 2% of men during their lifetime and in about 10 to 20% of people entering weight reduction programs. Obesity is usually severe, large amounts of weight are frequently gained or lost, and pronounced psychologic disturbances are present. Night-eating syndrome consists of morning anorexia, evening hyperphagia, and insomnia, with eating in the middle of the night. At least 25 to 50% of daily intake occurs after the evening meal. About 10% of people seeking treatment for severe obesity may have this disorder. Rarely, a similar disorder is induced by use of a hypnotic such as zolpidem. Similar but less extreme patterns probably contribute to excess weight gain in more people. For example, eating after the evening meal contributes to excess weight gain in many people who do not have night-eating syndrome. Etiology references 1.

Obesity leads to social, economic, and psychologic problems as a result of prejudice, discrimination, poor body image, and low self-esteem. For example, people may be underemployed or unemployed. Diagnosis of Obesity Body mass index (BMI) Waist circumference Sometimes body composition analysis In adults, BMI, defined as weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m2), is used to screen for overweight or obesity (see table [Body Mass Index](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v45679487) [ Body Mass Index (BMI) ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v45679487) ): Overweight = 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 Obesity = 30 kg/m2 However, BMI is a crude screening tool and has limitations in many subpopulations. Some experts think that BMI cutoffs should vary based on ethnicity, sex, and age. For example, in certain nonwhite populations, complications of obesity develop at a much lower BMI than in whites. In children and adolescents, overweight is defined as BMI at the 95th percentile, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [age- and sex-specific growth charts](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/). People of Asian descent and many aboriginal populations have a lower cut-off (23 kg/m2) for overweight. In addition, BMI may be high in muscular athletes, who lack excess body fat, and may be normal or low in formerly overweight people who have lost muscle mass. Waist circumference and the presence of metabolic syndrome appear to predict risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications better than BMI does. The waist circumference that increases risk of complications due to obesity varies by ethnic group and sex. Body composition analysis Body composition\u2014the percentage of body fat and muscle\u2014is also considered when obesity is diagnosed. Although probably unnecessary in routine clinical practice, body composition analysis can be helpful if clinicians question whether elevated BMI is due to muscle or excessive fat. The percentage of body fat can be estimated by measuring skinfold thickness (usually over the triceps) or determining [mid upper arm muscle area](/professional/nutritional-disorders/undernutrition/overview-of-undernutrition#v882731) [ Physical examination ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/undernutrition/overview-of-undernutrition#v882731) . Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can estimate percentage of body fat simply and noninvasively. BIA estimates percentage of total body water directly; percentage of body fat is derived indirectly. BIA is most reliable in healthy people and in people with only a few chronic disorders that do not change the percentage of total body water (eg, moderate obesity, diabetes mellitus). Whether measuring BIA poses risks in people with implanted defibrillators is unclear. Underwater (hydrostatic) weighing is the most accurate method for measuring percentage of body fat. Costly and time-consuming, it is used more often in research than in clinical care. To be weighed accurately while submerged, people must fully exhale beforehand. Imaging procedures, including CT, MRI, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), can also estimate the percentage and distribution of body fat but are usually used only for research.

Physical activity Exercise increases energy expenditure, basal metabolic rate, and diet-induced thermogenesis. Exercise also seems to regulate appetite to more closely match caloric needs. Other benefits associated with physical activity include Increased insulin sensitivity Improved lipid profile Lower blood pressure Better aerobic fitness Improved psychologic well-being Decreased risk of breast and colon cancer Increased life expectancy Exercise, including strengthening (resistance) exercises, increases muscle mass. Because muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than does fat tissue, increasing muscle mass produces lasting increases in basal metabolic rate. Exercise that is interesting and enjoyable is more likely to be sustained. A combination of aerobic and resistance exercise is better than either alone. Guidelines suggest physical activity of 150 minutes/week for health benefits and 300 to 360 minutes/week for weight loss and maintenance. Developing a more physically active lifestyle can help with weight loss and maintenance. Behavioral interventions Clinicians can recommend various behavioral interventions to help patients lose weight. They include Support Self-monitoring Stress management Contingency management Problem solving Stimulus control Support may come from a group, a buddy, or family members. Participation in a support group can improve adherence to lifestyle changes and thus increase weight loss. The more frequently people attend group meetings, the greater the support, motivation, and supervision they receive and the greater their accountability, resulting in greater weight loss. Self-monitoring may include keeping a food log (including the number of calories in foods), weighing regularly, and observing and recording behavioral patterns. Other useful information to record includes time and location of food consumption, the presence or absence of other people, and mood. Clinicians can provide feedback about how patients may improve their eating habits. Stress management involves teaching patients to identify stressful situations and to develop strategies to manage stress that do not involve eating (eg, going for a walk, meditating, deep breathing). Contingency management involves providing tangible rewards for positive behaviors (eg, for increasing time spent walking or reducing consumption of certain foods). Rewards may be given by other people (eg, from members of a support group or a health care practitioner) or by the person (eg, purchase of new clothing or tickets to a concert). Verbal rewards (praise) may also be useful. Problem solving involves identifying and planning ahead for situations that increase the risk of unhealthy eating (eg, travelling, going out to dinner) or that reduce the opportunity for physical activity (eg, driving across country). Stimulus control involves identifying obstacles to healthy eating and an active lifestyle and developing strategies to overcome them. For example, people may avoid going by a fast food restaurant or not keep sweets in the house. For a more active lifestyle, they may take up an active hobby (eg, gardening), enroll in scheduled group activities (eg, exercise classes, sports teams), walk more, make a habit of taking the stairs instead of elevators, and park at the far end of parking lots (resulting in a longer walk). Internet resources, applications for mobile devices, and other technological devices may also help with adherence to lifestyle changes and weight loss. Applications can help patients set a weight-loss goal, monitor their progress, track food consumption, and record physical activity.

Usually, drug treatment results in modest (5 to 10%) weight loss. Orlistat inhibits intestinal lipase, decreasing fat absorption and improving blood glucose and lipids. Because orlistat is not absorbed, systemic effects are rare. Flatus, oily stools, and diarrhea are common but tend to resolve during the 2nd year of treatment. A dose of 120 mg orally 3 times a day should be taken with meals that include fat. A vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after taking orlistat. Malabsorption and cholestasis are contraindications; irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders may make orlistat difficult to tolerate. Orlistat is available over-the-counter. Phentermine is a centrally acting appetite suppressant for short-term use ( 3 months). Usual starting dose is 15 mg once/day, and dose may be increased to 30 mg once/day, 37.5 mg once/day, 15 mg twice a day, or 8 mg 3 times a day before meals. Common side effects include elevated blood pressure and heart rate, insomnia, anxiety, and constipation. Phentermine should not be used in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disorders, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or a history of drug abuse or addiction. Twice a day dosing may help control appetite better throughout the day. The combination of phentermine and topiramate (used to treat seizures and migraines) is approved for long-term use. This combination drug results in weight loss for up to 2 years. The starting dose of the extended-release form (phentermine 3.75 mg/topiramate 23 mg) should be increased to 7.5 mg/46 mg after 2 weeks; then the dose can be gradually increased to a maximum of 15 mg/92 mg if needed to maintain weight loss. Because birth defects are a risk, the combination should be given to women of reproductive age only if they are using contraception and are tested monthly for pregnancy. Other potential adverse effects include sleep problems, cognitive impairment, and increased heart rate. Long-term cardiovascular effects are unknown, and postmarketing studies are ongoing. Lorcaserin (not available in the US) suppresses appetite via selective agonism of serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) brain receptors. Unlike serotonergic drugs previously used for weight loss, lorcaserin selectively targets 5-HT2C receptors in the hypothalamus, which, when targeted, result in hypophagia; it does not to stimulate the 5-HT2B receptors on heart valves. In clinical studies, incidence of valvulopathy was not significantly increased in patients taking lorcaserin compared with those taking placebo. The usual and maximum dose of lorcaserin is 10 mg orally every 12 hours. The most common adverse effects in patients without diabetes are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, and constipation; these effects are usually self-limited. Lorcaserin should not be used with serotonergic drugs, such selective serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from increased central nervous system serotonergic activity that is usually drug related. Symptoms may include mental... read more ](/professional/injuries-poisoning/heat-illness/serotonin-syndrome) is a risk. Lorcaserin was withdrawn from the US market after an increased cancer risk was identified in a postmarketing trial. Naltrexone/bupropion extended-release tablets can be used as a weight-loss adjunct. Naltrexone (used to aid in alcohol cessation) is an opioid antagonist and is thought to block negative feedback on satiety pathways in the brain. Bupropion (used to treat depression and aid in smoking cessation) can induce hypophagia by adrenergic and dopaminergic activity in the hypothalamus. The starting dose is a single tablet of naltrexone 8 mg/bupropion 90 mg; dose is titrated over 4 weeks to the maximum dose of 2 tablets twice a day. The most common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 1 to 3 mm Hg. Contraindications to this drug include uncontrolled hypertension and a history of or risk factors for seizures because bupropion reduces the seizure threshold. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used initially in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide augments glucose-mediated insulin release from the pancreas to induce glycemic control; liraglutide also stimulates satiety and reduces food intake. Studies have shown that liraglutide 3 mg daily results in a 12.2% weight loss after 56 weeks. The initial dose is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once/day; the dose is increased 0.6 mg/week to the maximum dose of 3 mg once/day. Liraglutide must be given by injection. Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting; liraglutide has warnings that include acute pancreatitis and risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide augments glucose-mediated insulin release and reduces appetite and energy intake via effects on appetite centers in the hypothalamus. Semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously has resulted in a mean body weight loss of 14.9% at 68 weeks as compared to 2.4% in patients treated with placebo ( [1](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v54835054) [ Treatment reference Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2. Complications include cardiovascular disorders (particularly in people with excess abdominal fat)... read more ](/professional/nutritional-disorders/obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome/obesity#v54835054) ). Patients on semaglutide also had greater improvements in cardiovascular risk factors as well as patient-reported physical functioning. Like liraglutide, the most common adverse effects of semaglutide include nausea and diarrhea, which are usually transient and mild to moderate in severity. Warnings for semaglutide include thyroid tumors and pancreatitis. The starting dose is 0.25 mg once a week for 4 weeks, increasing every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once a week by week 17. Weight-loss drugs should be stopped if patients do not have documented weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment. Most over-the-counter weight-loss drugs are not recommended because they have not been shown to be effective. Examples of such drugs are brindleberry, L-carnitine, ephedrine, guarana, phenylpropanolamine) have adverse effects that outweigh their advantages. Also, some of these drugs are adulterated or contain harmful substances banned by the US Food and Drug Administration (eg, ephedra, bitter orange, sibutramine).

Risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, hepatic, and other obesity-related complications increases when these children become adults. Risk of obesity persisting into adulthood depends partly on when obesity first develops: During infancy: Low risk Between 6 months and 5 years: 25% After 6 years: > 50% During adolescence if a parent is obese: > 80% In children, preventing further weight gain, rather than losing weight, is a reasonable goal. Diet should be modified, and physical activity increased. Increasing general activities and play is more likely to be effective than a structured exercise program. Participating in physical activities during childhood may promote a lifelong physically active lifestyle. Limiting sedentary activities (eg, watching TV, using the computer or handheld devices) can also help. Drugs and surgery are avoided but, if complications of obesity are life threatening, may be warranted. Measures that control weight and prevent obesity in children may have the largest public health benefits. Such measures should be implemented in the family, schools, and primary care programs. Older adults In the US, the percentage of obese older people has been increasing. With age, body fat increases and is redistributed to the abdomen, and muscle mass is lost, largely because of physical inactivity, but decreased androgens and growth hormone (which are anabolic) and inflammatory cytokines produced in obesity may also play a role. Risk of complications depends on Body fat distribution (increasing with a predominantly abdominal distribution) Duration and severity of obesity Associated sarcopenia Increased waist circumference, suggesting abdominal fat distribution, predicts morbidity (eg, [hypertension](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/hypertension/hypertension) [ Hypertension Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure ( 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure ( 80 mm Hg), or both.

With aging, fat tends to accumulate more in the waist. For older adults, physicians may recommend that caloric intake be reduced and physical activity be increased. However, if older patients wish to substantially reduce their caloric intake, their diet should be supervised by a physician. Physical activity also improves muscle strength, endurance, and overall well-being and reduces the risk of developing chronic disorders such as diabetes. Activity should include strengthening and endurance exercises. Regardless of whether caloric restriction is considered necessary, nutrition should be optimized. Weight-loss drugs are often not studied specifically in older adults, and possible benefits may not outweigh the adverse effects. However, orlistat may be useful for obese older patients, particularly those with [diabetes mellitus](/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/diabetes-mellitus-and-disorders-of-carbohydrate-metabolism/diabetes-mellitus-dm) [ Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.

Even without weight loss, exercise decreases the risk of cardiovascular disorders. Dietary fiber decreases the risk of colon cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Sufficient and good-quality sleep, management of stress, and moderation of alcohol intake are also important. Key Points Obesity increases the risk of many common health problems and causes up to 300,000 premature deaths each year in the US, making it second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death. Excess caloric intake and too little physical activity contribute the most to obesity, but genetic susceptibility and various disorders (including eating disorders) may also contribute. Screen patients using BMI and waist circumference and, when body composition analysis is indicated, by measuring skinfold thickness or using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Screen obese patients for common comorbid disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, fatty liver, and depression. Encourage patients to lose even 5 to 10% of body weight by changing their diet, increasing physical activity, and using behavioral interventions if possible. Try treating patients with orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, or semaglutide if BMI is 30 or if BMI is 27 and they have complications (eg, hypertension, insulin resistance); however, for severe obesity, surgery is most effective. Encourage all patients to exercise, to eat healthily, to get enough sleep, and to manage stress.
