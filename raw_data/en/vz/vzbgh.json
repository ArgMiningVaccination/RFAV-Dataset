As editor and a contributing writer I am seeking writers for remaining unassigned entries. The goal of the 3-volume set is to provide basic information about key terms and concepts in human health and wellness. Those terms and concepts include food, nutrition, diet, and exercise along with preventative choices to avoid disease, alternative medicine, the importance of the mind-body connection, details about medical insurance, and changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Candidates must be willing to write entries totaling at least 2,000 words. Preference will be given to published writers, advanced graduate students, and knowledgeable professionals in the field of health, but others qualified to write about health and wellness will also be considered. Deadlines for submission will begin September 1, 2010, and will include January 1, 2011 and May 1, 2011 for more complex or lengthy assignments. The deadlines are important, so please do not respond to this call unless you are confident in your ability to meet an assigned deadline of 2,000 words or a group of entries totaling that number by your assigned date. Compensation for accepted entries will begin with the 3-volume set of the encyclopedia, which will be sent to contributors at publication. Other forms of compensation will be considered based on experience and length of assignment and will also be available at publication. If you are interested in writing for this reference set, please send a short biographical sketch describing your background and interests in health and wellness and your preferred email and postal address via email to: "}
