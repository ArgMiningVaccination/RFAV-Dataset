I invite you to close your eyes, place your hand on your heart and center into your own soul. Breathe that out and as you breath in to yourself, feel yourself expanding. All that you are is all that you need. The entire is universe inside you In you I can count more than a million stars You are the sum of all of the lives that came before you You are art that can inspire anyone You share a wonderous spirit and in you I see the most beautiful heart You feel everything and it all started with you All that I am is all that I need You have climbed and conquered many intimidating mountains You've towered above the highest of trees You've looked down on abundant forests, entire forests created by a handful of seeds You explored the deepest ocean of emotions As you swell, you crash, and then you're calm. As you swell, you crash, then you're calm You are an unstoppable wave, you feel everything and it all started with you All that I am is all that I need You are a dreamer who became a absorbing vivid dream Your soul sings out to anyone listening, anyone who needs you, you became the stage You believe in magic, you are magic, You believe in love, you are love You are the miraculous, most spectactulous all that you are is all that you need You feel everything and it all started with you All that I am is all that I need, All that I am is all that I need repeating Group Laughing Yoga free-flow meditation laughter sounds | | 11. | | | | Compass To The Familiar Take a large breath and inhale the misty morning as we rise With open eyes see the sun is shining inside your cloudy mind Look to the sun and moon and stars, for a compass to the familiar Close your eyes, find a comfort in the familiar Call me at any time, I'm the sound of the familiar Now close your eyes Close your eyes There's a new world lying around the corner but it's just out of sight There's new hope under every stone you will turn, all in good time Look to the sun and moon and stars, for a compass to the familiar Close your eyes, find a comfort in the familiar Call me at any time, I'm the sound of the familiar Now close your eyes Close your eyes Close your eyes To open your eyes Tim Barlow (Barefootim) Inglis, Manitoba Originally from the Greenfields of England Tim Barlow(Barefootim) has spent the bulk of this century walking the streets of London, sharing the stage with the likes of Ben Kweller, The Ravonettes and The Magic Numbers.
