Established in 1997 in Gold Run, CA, we were one of the first truly holistic veterinary clinics to serve the Sierra Foothills and beyond. Now located in Colfax, California, we practice integrative medicine and specialize in treating small animals with Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM). We use acupuncture and Chinese herbal formulas as well as western herbs and medicine to treat the whole animal. We also have a strong interest in animal behavior and use flower essences and herbs to treat animals whose behavior issues originate from an imbalance. Our mission is to provide a balanced and gentle approach to your pet's healthcare. "}
