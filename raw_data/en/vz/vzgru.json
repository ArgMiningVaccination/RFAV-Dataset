Our History and Mission as an Agency Crystal Stairs is one of the largest private nonprofit child care and child development agencies in California. Our mission is to improve the lives of families through child care services, research, and advocacy. Like many great organizations, Crystal Stairs began with a simple premise: change is possible. As a professor at UCLA, Dr. Karen Hill -Scott en visioned creating an organization that would provide services to the community that would have a measurable impact. In 1978, as Research Director for the Joint Center for Community Studies, she received a three -year federal research grant to study the effe cts of different types of child care on family functioning. Dr. Hill -Scott then brought her trusted friend, Alice Walker Duff, on board, and the seeds of Crystal Stairs were sown. Crystal Stairs started in 1980 with two programs, the Child Care Resource a nd Referral Program and the Child Care Food Program. Over the years, changes in le gislation, funding opportunities and creative management fostered new programs. Crystal Stairs serves several areas in South Los Angeles as well as the cities of Inglewood, Hawthorne, Lawndale, Compton , Gardena , Long Bellflower, Carson, Vernon, Paramount, and Cerritos . Currently we operate the following programs: Subsidized Child C are Alternative Payment Program and CalW ORKs Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 Prog rams Resource and Referral Health Outreach Services Head Start Child Care Sites Our multiethnic, interdisciplinary staff has considerable experience in: Early childhood education Management and delivery of subsidy program services Research and evaluatio n of subsidy programs Technical assistance for child care providers Parent Handbook 2015 What is Crystal Stairs? pg. 7 How We Got Our Name We chose our name from the Langston Hughes poem \"Mother to Son\" because it captures our perspective on life, our aspirations for the future, and our dream that eve ry child's life will have its full measure of \"crystal stairs.\" Mother to Son Well, son, I'll tell you: Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, And splinters, And boards torn up, And places with no carpet on the floor - Bare. But all the time I'se been a -climbin' on, And reachin' landin's, And turnin' corners, And sometimes goin' in the dark Where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard. Don't you fa ll now - For I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin', And life for me ain't been no crystal stair. \u2014Langston Hughes, 1922 \"Mother to Son\" from THE COLLECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES by Langston Hughes, edited by Arnold Rampersad with David Roessel , Associate Editor, copyright \u00a9 1994 by the Estate of Langston Hughes.

Families receiving TANF (cash aid) are exempt from paying fees and CPS/At -Risk families may get their fees waived by a license d professional. Family fees will be assessed at initial enrollment, recertification, and when a status change occurs. Families will be assessed flat monthly family fee based on the total number of certified childcare hours per month. Assess ment of Fees Family Fees will be assessed based on the following criteria: Hours of certified child care need per month o Part-time fees will be assessed when the child has a certified need of less than 130 hours per month. o Full-time fees will be assessed w hen the child has a certified need of 130 hours or more per month. Effective Dates Family Fees effective dates will be implemented in the following ways: When a family is initially enrolled onto the program , the family fee will be effective the first da y child care is authorized o When the initial enrollment is not effective the first day of the month, the family fee will be assessed based on the certified hours for the partial month (part time monthly fee) and the full time fee for the following month bas ed on certified hours When a parent has to complete recertification and/or status changes, fees will become effective on the first day of the month after the 14/19 day appeal request period has exhausted When a parent has reported a change that may resu lt in a decrease or stopping in fees, the change will be effective on the first day of the following month Payment of Fees Family Fees will be indicated on the Notice of Action (NOA), the Certificate of Enrollment (COE) and on the monthly Attendance Recor d (AR). Parents will be required to pay the fee directly to the provider before services are provided and on a monthly basis. Parents and providers will be required to indicate on the monthly AR the amount paid or if they have entered into a family fee payment plan. Parent Handbook 2015 Ongoing Requirements for Parents on the Program pg. 41 Parents are expected to review the Notice of Action as soon as they receive it. If they disagree with the amount of the fee or believe that an error has occurred, they MUST file an appeal by following the instructions on the reverse side of th e notice, by phone, fax, or mail . Parents can also call and request a verbal appeal ( see sections \"Notices of Action,\" pp. 2 1, and \"Appeals,\" pp. 4 6. During a partial month of care, the amount of the fee will not exceed the cost of care. The only reimbu rsement due to the provider will be the family fee. If the parent changes providers mid month, the family fee will be deducted from the payment to the first provider. If the family has been assessed a fee and is paying for child care services for childr en in the family for which Crystal Stairs could not meet the child care needs of, parents may be eligible for a family fee credit. The credit will not exceed the total amount paid to the other provider(s) of these child care services. The credit will be a pplied to the family's subsequent fee billing period. Parents who think they are eligible for a fee credit should notify their Family Services Specialist. If it is determined that parents are eligible for a fee credit, parents MUST provide copies of receip ts or cancelled checks for those other child care services. Parents pay family fees directly to the child care provider, and they should obtain and keep receipts for their records. Fees paid AFTER TH E 3rd CALENDAR DAY OF THE MONTH are considered late. Families whose child care services are terminated for not paying fees may not re -enroll for services until the delinquent fee balance has been paid. Parents who cannot pay the fees in full MUST request a fee repayment plan from their provider. Both the p arents and the child care provider will agree to the terms of the plan. If the provider refuses to give parents a repayment plan, parents MUST contact their Family Services Specialist immediately. If parents adhere to the repayment plan, services will not be terminated. If parents are late paying family fees, child care providers MUST report this immediately to the parents' Family Services Specialist AND record it on the child's Attendance Record. If Crystal Stairs determines that the parents paid the fe es late, they will be issued a Notice of Delinquent Family Fees. To remain on the program , parents MUST pay the outstanding balance in full, parent and provider MUST complete the receipt that was included with the notice and parent MUST submit that receipt to their Family Services Specialist. If this is completed before the termination effective date on the notice, child care services will be reinstated. Family Fees vs. Co -Payments (CCR Title 5 18429) Family fees are not the same as co -payments. Parents who choose a child care provider that charges fees above the reimbursement limit , may have to pay both a family fee AND a co-payment. If parents have questions, they should contact their Family Services Specialist (see section \"Limits on Child Care Reimbu rsements,\" pp. 5 4). Parent Handbook 2015 Changes in Parents' Need or Eligibility for Child Care pg. 42 11. CHANGES IN PARENTS' NEED OR ELIGIBILITY Changes in Need or Eligibility ( CCR Title 5 18102) Parents MUST report changes that affect their family circumstances, such as family size, income, or their need for child care services, within five (5) calendar days of the change .

Parents will be expected to follow the terms of the letter. Continued failure to report changes in family circumstances will result in termination of child care services. If parents fail to complete Attendance Records accurately or daily, or the Attendance Record indicates that services utilized by t he parents were not \" broadly consistent \" with the current child care authorization (a difference of one or more hours a day for most of the month), parents will receive an Attendance Record Issue Warning Letter. Failure to accurately complete Attendance Re cords or using child care hours that are not broadly consistent with the parents' current authorization may result in the termination of child care services. Changing Child Care Providers Parents may change child care providers at any time. Crystal Stairs encourages parents who wish to change or end services to give their provider at least two weeks' notice (14 calendar days) that they are ending services or changing providers. Parents who fail to give their provider two weeks' notice will be solely respon sible for any child care payment due to the provider because the notice was not given OR if the children are removed from the provider before the end of the two week s' notice. Crystal Stairs will NOT pay the provider for services after the last day that t he child ren attended care. Parents should first give notice to their provider and then notify their Family Services Specialist of the last date that child care with that provider will be utilized . Parents should also submit a child care provider identifica tion form indicating the name and information of their new provider. Parents who do not have a new provider may call our Resource and Referral Department at (888) 5437247. Once child care services with the new provider have been approved, parents will receive a Change Notice of Action (NOA) indicating the first day on which Crystal Stairs will begin paying the new provider. The new provider will be sent a Certificate of Enrollment (COE) with a start date and the child care schedule and A ttendance Recor ds for all children authorized to utilize child care with th at provider . Limited -Term Service Leave s of Absence (CCR Title 5 18104) Parents who will not need services on a temporary basis may request a limited -term service leave of absence.

SELECTING A CHILD CARE PROVIDER Parental Choice Once parents receive a Notice of Action authorizing child care services, they can begin looking for a child care provider who agrees to be reimbursed for services by Crystal Stairs. Crystal Stairs will not begin payment to a provider until all required documentation has been submitted and the provider's agreement is completed and ap proved (see below section , \"The Provider Agreement Process \", pp. 52). At Crystal Stairs, our goal is to promote parental choice and to empower parents to make informed choices about child care for their children. Parents can choose from a broad range of services, which include Early Head Start/Head Start program, State Preschool, LA Universal, private centers, family child care homes and licensed exempt providers. Parents are encouraged to make their choice based on their children's age(s) and the child c are provider who best meets the family's needs. We urge parents to study and consider all of the types of child care providers listed in this section before making their choice. Also, we encourage parents of pre -school age children to choose a license d provider who can help prepare them for school.

In California, the following types of providers are required to be licensed: Child Care Centers Small and Large Family C hild Care Homes Child Care Centers Licensed child care centers are regulated by the California Department of Social Services ( CDSS). State law determines the staff size and the educational requirements as well as the health and safety standards of the cent er. DSS will conduct site visits to make sure they meet the licensing requirements. All center staff MUST be cleared of any serious criminal history by the Department of Justice (DOJ). All licensed centers MUST have a license for specific child ages in ord er for them to provide child care services. Small and Large Family Child Care Homes In this type of setting, child care takes place in the provider's home. The provider is licensed to care for no more than eight ( 8) children in a small family child care ho me, or fourteen ( 14) children in a large family child care home . All staff MUST be cleared of any serious criminal history by DOJ. DSS is also responsible for regulating these homes. They do site visits at the homes to make sure that they meet the licensin g requirements. All licensed homes MUST have a license for specific child ages in order for them to provide child care services. Sectarian Child Care Providers As required by the California Department of Education, to receive reimbursement the provider MUS T not conduct religious instruction or worship for children participating in state -funded programs. Providers MUST indicate whether or not they provide religious instruction during the child care hours. License Exempt Child Care Providers Some types of c hild care are not required to be licensed by the state. In addition, t here are no state health and safety regulations that govern e xempt relative and non -relative child care providers . Parents should consider these providers carefully before choosing this type of care. In California, the following types of child care are exempt from licensing: Certain public or private recreation programs (license exempt centers) Care provided by a relative or non -relative License Exempt Centers These centers are exempt f rom licensing because they are regulated by the city's Department of Recreation and Parks. Some public or private recreation programs, including summer camps, are license exempt if they operate only during non -school hours or for fewer than 12 weeks each y ear. Before -and after -school programs operated by public or p rivate schools are also license exempt, as are programs operated by the Boy Scout s, Girl Scouts, Boys and Girls C lubs, and similar organizations. Parent Handbook 2015 Selecting a Child Care Provider pg. 51 License Exempt Relative Providers A relative p rovider is a grandparent, aunt , or uncle of the child receiving services. Parents of children who are receiving child care services are not eligible to be providers for their own children. Licensed Exempt Non -Relative Providers (Registered TrustLine Provid ers) A non -relative provider is anyone other than a grandparent, aunt or uncle of the child receiving services. Non -relative providers MUST be cleared of any serious criminal history. They MUST submit fingerprints and an application to Department of Justic e (DOJ). This process is called TrustLine. Such provider s will not be reimbursed for services until they have been cleared by the TrustLine process. Once cleared, these providers are known as \"Registered TrustLine Providers .\" Parents are also eligible to request child care services with an in -home child care provider. Parent s will need to contact their Family Service Specialist regarding In -Home care requirements. Licensed Exempt Non -Relative Provisional Providers If parent s have an immediate need for ch ild care services and ha ve chosen a non -relative provider, the y can utilize this provider as a provisional provider for a period of up to thirty ( 30) calendar days. The following are required before the provisional provider can be reimbursed for services d uring the 30 day period: The parents ' immediate need is that they are employed, participating in a welfare -to-work activity, in training, or incapacitated AND Crystal Stairs determines that no child care is reasonably available from a licensed or register ed TrustLine provider. The provider becomes a registered TrustLine provider within the 30 -calendar day period If the provider does not become a registered TrustLine provider within the 30 calendar day period, Crystal Stairs will not reimburse the provide r for any child care services provided during the 30 day period. When the provider becomes a registered TrustLine provider, the parents ' Family Services Specialist will notify parent s when and if child care services can start . Provisional child care prov iders will only be approved two (2) times per fiscal year (July 1st-June 30th). Parents are able to choose the same provisional provider twice. Also, a ll licensed exempt relative/non -relative providers MUST complete the provider agreement process before c are can start. A new agreement is needed each time a family utilizes one of these providers (see section on \"The Provider Agreement Process \", below) . All child care providers are responsible for all legal and tax reporting requirements. Crystal Stairs doe s not take out taxes from the provider's reimbursement. However, it does report earnings to the Internal Revenue Service. If care is provided in the parents ' home, the y assume the responsibilities of being the provider's employer and MUST follow all period ic and annual legal, tax reporting, and other employer - related requirements. In this situation, both parents and providers are required to attend a face -to-face orientation before the agreement between them is finalized. Parents should ask their Family Se rvices Specialist for more details. Parent Handbook 2015 Selecting a Child Care Provider pg. 52 The Provider Agreement Process When parent s choose a child care provider that does not currently have an a greement with Crystal Stairs, an agreement MUST be requested, submitted and approved before child care services can begin. The process is as follows: 1. Parent s will inform their Family Services Specialist of the provi der wanted by contacting their specialist and/ or completing a Provider Identification Form . 2. The Family Services Specialist will request the new provider agreement from the Crystal Stairs Provider Agreements Department . 3. The parent and provider will be mailed an agreement to complete and submit back to Crystal Stairs along with the necessary documentation needed to complete the process. 4. If the necessary doc umentation is received, and the agreement is complete, the provider's agreement will be approved and the Family Services Specialist will be notified to approve the child care authorization. 5. Parent s will be mailed a Notice of Action (NOA) indicating the sta rt date of child care, the days and hours of authorized care and the name of the provider authorized to provide care. 6. Provider s will be mailed a Certificate of Enrollment (COE) indicating the names of the family and children authorized to receive child ca re including the start and end date of care, the days and hours of authorized care, and one A ttendance Record per child. The approval of the agreement can be delaye d if both parent and provider do not complete the agreement or submit the required document ation by the due date indicated in the provider agreement packet. If parents have questions regarding the process, they should contact the Crystal Stairs representative indicated on the paperwork in the packet. Licensed Interim Providers Most licensed prov iders in the Crystal Stairs service area already have an established agreement on file with the Provider Agreements Department. If parent s choose a licensed exempt provider or a licensed provider that does not already have an agreement with Crystal Stairs, and the y have an immediate need for services while their chosen provider is completing the agreement process, parent s can choose a licensed interim child care provider. To access the names and contact information of licensed interim care provider s, paren ts will call the Crystal Stairs Resource and Referral (R&R) department at (888) 5437247 Parents will inform the R&R representative that they are currently receiving services from the CDE program and they need referrals for interim child care providers.
