The features of sleep that mediate this ability may change with aging, as percentage of slow-wave sleep is canonically thought to decrease with age, and slow waves are thought to helporchestrate hippocampal-neocortical dialog that supports systems level consolidation. In this study, groups of younger and older subjects performed timed trials before and after polysomnographically recorded sleep on a 3D spatial maze navigational task. Although younger subjects performed better thanolder subjects at baseline, both groups showed similar improvement across presleep trials. However,younger subjects experienced signi cant improvement in maze performance during sleep that was not observed in older subjects, without differences in morning psychomotor vigilance between groups. Older subjects had sleep quality marked by decreased amount of slow-wave sleep and increased fragmentationof slow-wave sleep, resulting in decreased slow-wave activity. Across all subjects, frontal slow-wave activity was positively correlated with both overnight change in maze performance and medial pre- frontal cortical volume, illuminating a potential neuroanatomical substrate for slow-wave activitychanges with aging and underscoring the importance of slow-wave activity in sleep-dependent spatial navigational memory consolidation. /C2112016 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction The ability to consolidate memories during sleep depends on several factors, including the type of memory being integrated and the duration and architecture of ensuing sleep ( Stickgold and Walker, 2013 ). Spatial navigational memory has represented an appealing model memory system to investigate the role of sleep in part because of the potential mechanistic insights offered by studies on rodents. Patterns of hippocampal activity recorded during a period of exploration in an environment were subsequently replayed during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep ( Wilsonand McNaughton, 1994 ), where the replay happened over time scales much faster than occurred during wake, and in REM sleep, where the replay happened with greater temporal delity to wake (Louie and Wilson, 2001 ). These observations raised the possibility that replay during sleep may be contributing to the strengthening of neural connections for spatial navigation formed during explo- ration based on Hebbian models of plasticity. Sharp wave ripple complexes in the hippocampus that occur during slow-wave sleep are temporally coordinated with neocortical slow waves and have been implicated in the transfer of information between the hippocampus and neocortex that could help support spatial memory ( Siapas and Wilson, 1998; Sirota et al., 2003 ). When sharp wave ripple complexes were selectively suppressed in post- learning sleep, rats trained on a spatial radial arm maze task showed signicantly impaired memory ( Girardeau et al., 2009 ).*Corresponding author at: NYU Sleep Disorders Center, NBV-7N2 462 First Avenue, New homepage: www.elsevi er.com/locate/neuaging 0197-4580/$ matter /C2112016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.03.008Neurobiology of Aging 42 (2016) 142 e149In human subjects, signi cantly greater improvement in per- formance on spatial navigational maze tasks occurred across sleep than across a similar period of wakefulness ( Ferrara et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2013 ). Efforts to identify contributions of partic- ular sleep stages have suggested roles for both slow-wave and REM sleep. In a limited number of subjects, neuroimaging sug- gested that the degree of blood flow to the right hippocampus during slow-wave sleep correlated signi cantly with the degree of overnight improvement in a spatial navigation task ( Peigneux et al., 2004 ). For forms of declarative memory, the degree of overnight consolidation has been shown to be proportional to prefrontal slow-wave activity in younger and older subjects, and augmenting prefrontal slow-wave activity using transcranial electrical stimulation during sleep enhanced retention of declar- ative memories ( Marshall et al., 2006 ). REM sleep fragmentation due to obstructive sleep apnea impaired overnight improvement in spatial navigation, and the degree of REM fragmentation correlated with poorer overnight performance improvement (Varga et al., 2014 ). These ndings bear relevance to the changes in sleep architec- ture with aging as two of the well-characterized consequences of aging include increased sleep fragmentation and loss of slow-wave sleep. Although sleep fragmentation is thought to be a general feature of sleep in the elderly, evidence suggests that fragmentation may be preferential to non-REM sleep ( Klerman et al., 2013 ). Such a combination of slow-wave sleep loss and fragmentation of remaining slow-wave sleep with aging could thus impact the overnight consolidation of spatial navigational memories. The overnight consolidation of memory for word pairs, a form of declarative memory thought to be dependent on the hippocampus, was impaired with aging and was correlated with slow-wave ac- tivity particularly in the prefrontal leads of the electroencephalo- gram (EEG) ( Mander et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, this study showed that the degree of atrophy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) appeared to be a signi cant correlate of slow-wave sleep loss and impaired declarative memory consolidation. The present study set out to examine the effects of aging on sleep architecture, sleep fragmentation, and slow-wave activity and examine the relationship between medial prefrontal cortical volume and slow-wave activity in aging. Based on the role of slow- wave sleep in spatial navigational memory and our expectation of reduced and fragmented slow-wave sleep in older subjects, we alsodetermined whether the consolidation of spatial navigational memory that normally occurs during sleep is diminished as a function of age. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Participants Both younger (ages 18 e23) and older (ages 51 e85) subjects were recruited from the community as part of studies on brain and glucose metabolism (younger group) and normal aging (older group). The subjects had no sleep complaints and agreed to un- dergo additional in-lab polysomnography, maze testing, and psy- chomotor vigilance testing for the present study. Subjects were excluded if they were pregnant, had intellectual disability or severe learning impairment (IQ <70; younger group), or had medical conditions or history of signi cant conditions that may affect brain structure or function, such as stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, trau- matic brain injury, any neurodegenerative diseases, depression, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of intracranial mass or infarcts (older group). All included subjects completed a standard neuropsychological test battery and were cognitively normal. Subjects were excluded from analysis if polysomnography revealedmore than mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI4% >10/h) that was incidentally discovered (3 older subjects and 0 younger subjects) or if subjects failed to nd the target in 2 or more of the maze trials before sleep (4 older subjects and 0 younger subjects). The number of older subjects included was 13 (5 men, 8 women; mean age, 68.2 years), and the number of younger subjects included was 18 (8 men, 10 women; mean age, 20.0 years). All subjects provided informed consent before their participation. All procedures wereapproved by the NYU School of Medicine Institutional ReviewBoard. 2.2. Virtual maze performance and psychomotor vigilance test At about 20:00 hours on each night of study, subjects began training on a virtual maze task: a simple 3D environment designed for this research ( Nguyen et al., 2013 ). After a period of general familiarization with joystick controls (Thrustmaster) in a Z-shaped corridor, subjects initially spent 3 minutes exploring a complex maze designed using \"Unreal Tournamant 3 Editor \"(Epic Games, Cary, NC, USA). Avatar walking speed and turning speed were reduced to minimize motion \"cybersickness. \"The game was pro- jected onto a screen in a darkened testing room. The viewing area was 67 /C250 inches, and subjects sat 13 feet away with their vision corrected if they usually required it. Subjects were instructed to remember the layout of the maze environment as well as possible. Subsequently, subjects navigated through the same maze during 3 presleep test trials, in which they were instructed to reach a spec- ied goal point as quickly as possible. Time to reach the goal per trial was capped at 600 seconds. We retrospectively inquired about prior 3D video game experience, and used a construct whereby \"novice \"subjects were de ned as having prior 3D video game experience of less than once per year and \"experienced \"subjects were de ned as having prior 3D video game experience of at least once per year ( Wamsley et al., 2010 ). We obtained responses from 12 of 18 younger and 13 of 13 older subjects. Subjects were connected to polysomnography equipment at about 21:00 hours, and a full night diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG) was performed following standard American Academy ofSleep Medicine (AASM) criteria ( Iber et al., 2007 ). To control for attention effects, subjects performed a standard- ized 20-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) beginning 1 hour after awakening from each night in the sleep laboratory. Thereafter, subjects performed 3 nal test trials on the 3D virtual maze, again instructed to reach the same speci ed goal point as quickly as possible. The primary performance metric on the virtual maze was completion time. Overnight change was calculated as the difference between the averages across the 3 trials before and after sleep, normalized to the average of the 3 trials before sleep for each metric. Positive values represent improvement and negative values represent worsening. Performance metrics on the PVT included reaction time (in milliseconds) and number of lapses (no response after 500 milliseconds). A transform of the number of lapses was done to enable parametric testing [lapses transform \u00bcsqrt (#lapses) Polysomnography All PSGs consisted of a full night spent in the NYU Sleep Disor- ders Center. Monitoring included sleep by electromyography, electrooculography, respiration by a nasal cannula and/or pressure transducer and oral thermistor, effort by rib and/or abdomen impedance plethysmography; single lead electrocardio- graph, and oxygen saturation by nger oximeter. PSGs were scored in to criteria (AASM) for sleepA.W. Varga et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 42 (2016) 142 e149 143and EEG arousals. Total sleep time and percent time spent in wake, non-REM stage 1 (NREM 1), non-REM stage 2 (NREM 2), non-REM stage 3 (NREM 3) (slow-wave sleep), and REM sleep were deter- mined. Respiratory events were scored from the air flow signal using AASM criteria and stage-speci c (REM, non-REM, and total) apnea indices were calculated. Apneas were de ned as absence of airflow for /C2110 seconds. Hypopnea4% was de ned as a reduction in the amplitude of breathing by 30% or more for /C2110 seconds with /C214% decline in blood oxygen saturation, irrespective of the pres- ence of an arousal. Hypopnea (3% or arousal) was de ned as a reduction in the amplitude of breathing by 30% or more for /C2110 seconds accompanied by /C213% decline in blood oxygen satu- ration or an arousal indicated by a sudden increase in the cortical EEG frequency or by sudden increase in the motor tone in the chin or anterior tibialis by electromyography. The apnea-hypopnea index with 4% oxygen desaturation (AHI4%) is de ned as the sum of all apneas and hypopneas with 4% desaturation divided by the total sleep time in hours. AHI-all is dened as the sum of apneas and hypopneas (with 3% desaturation or arousal) divided by the total sleep time in hours. Continuity of sleep was assessed as duration of sleep runs, dened as the duration of consecutive 30-second epochs of sleep scored as that stage, terminated by 1 or more epochs scored as another stage, including wake ( Kishi et al., 2011; Norman et al., 2006 ). EEG data from the experimental night were imported into MATLAB and epoched into 30-second bins. Epochs containing ar- tifacts were rejected, and the remaining epochs were ltered be- tween 0.4 and 50 Hz. A fast Fourier transform was then applied to theltered EEG signal at 30-second intervals with 50% overlap using a Hamming window. Absolute slow-wave activity in an EEG lead was de ned as the spectral power between 0.5 and 4.0 Hz during non-REM sleep. Relative slow-wave activity was de ned as the absolute slow-wave activity divided by the absolute spectral power across all frequencies (0.5 e50 Hz) for a given EEG lead, allowing normalization of spectral power across subjects that may otherwise be in fluenced by interindividual anatomical differences. 2.4. Brain imaging All subjects received structural volumetric MRI scans on a 3T system (Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using standardized imaging procedures described previously ( Glodzik et al., 2011 )w i t h the exception of one older subject, whose MRI was acquired at 1.5 T and was not included in the subsequent analysis. Gray matter cortical volumes were calculated using Freesurfer image analysis software, version 5.1 ( http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ )f r o mM a g n e t i z a t i o n Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo sequences ( Yau et al., 2014 ). Motion correction, skull stripping, Talairach transforms, atlas registration, spherical surface maps, and parcellations were per- formed automatically using a within-subject template ( Reuter et al., 2012 ). Gray matter volumes were rst used to create a medial pre- frontal cortex region of interest using the sum of the following bilateral regions of interest: Desikan et al., 2006 ) and were then normalized to the intracranial volume. The MR images and overlying cortical map were inspected visually for accuracy using the Freeview software included in the Freesurfer package. 2.5. Data analysis Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot version 11.0, IBM SPSS 23, and MATLAB (R 2013b). Comparison of sleep and psychomotor vigilance data was performed between subjects using unpaired ttests for normally distributed data and mean values /C6the standard error of the mean are reported. For data not normally distributed, analysis consisted of Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests, and median values are reported. For maze performance data, analysis consisted of using a 2-way mixed factorial analysis of variance with age group as the between-subjects independent variable and time as the within-subjects independent variable. Average completion time data were natural-log transformed to overcome violation of Lev- ene 's test of equality of variances before analysis. Correlations be- tween normally distributed variables (mPFC volume and frontal relative slow wave activity) were calculated using a Pearson prod- uct moment, and the correlation coef cient r is reported. Correla- tions between variables where one or more variables were not normally distributed (% change in maze performance) were calcu- lated using a Spearman rank-order correlation, and the correlation coefcient rho is reported. For sleep-continuity data, a bootstrap-based analysis that accounted for the number of runs contributed by each subject was performed to determine a cumulative duration probability distri- bution for each stage (REM, NREM 1, NREM 2, and NREM 3). Thus, striking a balance between equivalence among subjects and retaining a suf cient number of data points, for those subjects with more than the median number of runs, runs were randomly sampled up to the median number. Log-rank tests were used to compare younger versus older subjects on the survival curves derived from the sampling procedure. This procedure was repeated 1000 times. At each step of the iteration, a pvalue was estimated from the history of prior pvalues, yielding an increasingly stable result as the number of iterations increases. Results for all statistical analyses were considered signi cant at p<0.05. 3. Results3.1. Effects of aging on sleep architecture and sleep continuity There were no signi cant differences between younger and older subjects in total sleep time or sleep ef ciency. Similarly, there were no signi cant differences in severity of obstructive sleep ap- nea measured by the AHI4% or the AHI-all. We observed the ex- pected signi cant decrease in NREM 3 sleep (slow-wave sleep) in older subjects, which was compensated by numerically smaller but statistically signi cant increases in NREM 2 sleep and REM sleep. There were no signi cant differences between groups in NREM 1 sleep. In line with the decreases in slow-wave sleep in older sub- jects, we observed decreases in the relative slow-wave activity in older subjects that was particularly prominent in the frontal leads (F3 and F4) (Fig. 1 ). These results are summarized in Table 1 . To evaluate the degree of fragmentation of individual sleep stages across groups, we examined the cumulative duration probability distribution of each stage. The cumulative duration probability dis- tribution for slow-wave sleep was signi cantly left shifted in older subjects compared with younger subjects ( p<0.001), indicating slow-wave sleep occurred in shorter bouts in older subjects. There were no signi cant differences in the duration probability distribu- tion of NREM 1, NREM 2, or REM sleep between groups ( Fig. 2 ). In summary, older subjects have signi cantly less slow-wave sleep with less relative slow-wave activity in the frontal leads. Increased frag- mentation of sleep in the older subjects is limited to slow-wave sleep without increased fragmentation of the other sleep stages. 3.2.

In the older subjects, 12 of 13 quali ed as novice and 1o f1 3q u a l i ed as experienced (chi-squared test \u00bc1.39, degree of freedom \u00bc1,p\u00bc0.24). We tracked subjects 'average maze per- formance before and after sleep by the measure of completion time, and observed a signi cant difference across time (F (1,,29)\u00bc 8.2, p\u00bc0.008) and age group (F (1,29)\u00bc18.4, p<0.001), with a signicant interaction between time and age group (F (1,29)\u00bc5.4, p\u00bc0.027). In the 3 presleep trials, older subjects took signi cantly longer to complete the maze than younger subjects (291.2 /C6 34.3 seconds in older subjects vs. 177.7 /C621.5 seconds in younger subjects, p\u00bc0.008, simple main effect; Fig. 3 ). Despite this dif- ference in baseline performance, there was no signi cant inter- action between presleep trial number and age group (F (1,29)\u00bc0.03, p\u00bc0.88), and the degree of improvement from the rst trial to third trial before sleep was similar between the groups, suggestingthat younger and older subjects encode the information similarly (Fig. 4 ). Across a night of sleep, there was signi cant improvement in completion time in younger subjects on morning trials compared with evening trials (177.7 /C621.5 seconds before sleepvs. 122.2 /C618.8 seconds after sleep, p<0.001, simple main effect), representing a 31% improvement. This phenomenon was not observed in older subjects (291.2 /C634.3 seconds before sleep vs. 277.2 /C635.4 seconds after sleep, p\u00bc0.73, simple main effect), where the improvement was only 4.8%. To control for possible effects on attention affecting spatial navigation performance in the morning, subjects performed a twenty-minute PVT immediately before completing the 3 morning test trials on the virtual maze. We observed no signi cant differ- ences between groups in mean reaction times (276.7 ms [median] in older subjects, 310.4 ms [median] in younger subjects, p\u00bc0.327, rank-sum test) or in number of lapses (3.7 [median] in older sub- jects, 5.3 in younger subjects, p\u00bc0.335, rank-sum test; Fig. 5 ). 3.3. Sleep associations with memory and medial prefrontal cortical volume Cortical slow waves in sleep are generated primarily frontally and travel posteriorly ( Murphy et al., 2009 ), and in adults, slow- wave activity is greatest over frontal EEG leads ( Ringli and Huber, 2011 ). Prior studies have suggested that mPFC atrophy in older subjects is associated with reduced slow-wave activity ( Mander et al., 2013 ). Across all subjects, we observed a signi cant positive correlation between mPFC volume and average relative frontal slow-wave activity (r \u00bc0.74, p<0.001; Fig. 6 ). Using a partial correlation to control for age, we showed a continued signi cant positive partial correlation between mPFC volume and average relative frontal slow-wave activity (r \u00bc0.52, p\u00bc0.004), suggesting that controlling for age had little effect on the strength of the relationship between these variables. Owing to the importance of slow-wave sleep in the consolida- tion of spatial navigational memories, we examined the relation- ship between prefrontal slow-wave activity and overnight change in maze performance. Across all subjects, there was a signi cant positive correlation between average relative frontal slow-wave activity and the overnight percent change in maze completion time (rho \u00bc0.45, p \u00bc0.01; Fig. 7 ). A partial correlation controlling Fig. 1. Slow-wave activity in the brain diminishes with aging.

Notably, we did not observe a signi cant correlation be- tween mPFC volume and overnight change in maze performance (rho\u00bc0.19, p\u00bc0.31; Supplemental Fig. 1 ). 4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrate that overnight sleep acts to benet spatial navigational memory performance in younger subjects, but this bene ti ss i g n i cantly attenuated in older sub- jects. The 31% improvement in completion time in the younger group in this study is similar to what has been observed in other studies of overnight improvement in completion time on related virtual mazes in college-aged subjects ( Ferrara et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2013 ). The observation that older subjects take longer to complete the initial trials on the virtual maze before sleep is consistent with prior ndings in which older and youngersubjects performed consecutive trials on a comparable virtual maze ( Moffat et al., 2001 ). However, consolidation of this spatial information during sleep has not previously been examined in older individuals. Studies have demonstrated de cits in sleep- dependent memory consolidation for declarative memories in middle-aged ( Backhaus et al., 2007 )a n do l d e rs u b j e c t s( Mander et al., 2013 ), and for visuospatial object location memory in older subjects ( Cherdieu et al., 2014 ), although there are some discrepancies showing no differences ( Wilson et al., 2012 ). Sleep- dependent consolidation of motor sequence memories also appears to be detrimentally affected with aging ( Brown et al., 2009; Spencer et al., 2007 ), and the degree of the de cit may depend on task demands ( Gudberg et al., 2015 ). The lack of overnight maze performance improvement may depend on factors not strictly related to sleep. For example, it may be related to poor initial encoding of the spatial information or morning sleepiness or inattention related to differences in sleep architecture. However, these possibilities are not likely playing a substantial role in the age group differences because both groups showed similar rates of improvement in completion time across the rst 3 maze trials before sleep, suggesting similar encodingDuration (min)0 2 04 06 0Cumulative Probability Density 00.20.40.60.81REM older subjects younger subjects Duration (min)02468 1 0Cumulative Probability Density 00.20.40.60.81NREM 1 older subjects younger subjects Duration (min)0 1 02 03 04 05 0Cumulative Probability Density 00.20.40.60.81older subjects younger subjects Duration (min)02 0 4 0 6 0 8 0Cumulative Probability Density 00.20.40.60.81NREM 3 (SWS) older subjects younger subjectsNREM 2 ** p < 0.0001B D CA Fig. 2.

That said, older subjects have been shown to rely less on allocentric strategies that use the hippocampus during the encod- ing of spatial navigational information ( Bohbot et al., 2012; Konishi et al., 2013 ), which may then have implications for how these memories are subsequently consolidated in sleep. Initial raw per- formance did not predict subsequent overnight consolidation as there was no correlation between average presleep completion time and subsequent overnight percent change in completion time in all subjects. Differences in attention appear unlikely to account for differences in morning maze performance as there were no signicant differences between the groups in morning reaction time or number of lapses on the PVT, suggesting similar levels of alertness. Prior 3D video game experience may in fluence spatial navigational memory consolidation across sleep ( Wamsley et al., 2010 ). Although we cannot completely rule out this potential confound, we did not observe any signi cant difference in prior 3D video game experience between the younger and older responding subjects.Assuming that sleep is playing an active role in the consoli- dation of spatial navigational memories, there are several poten- tial qualities of sleep differing between younger and older subjects that could be contributing. Older subjects typically have reduced total sleep time and sleep ef ciency compared to younger sub- jects. In Addition, the degree of sleep apnea increases with age, resulting in increased sleep fragmentation ( Ware et al., 2000 ). However, in our populations, there were no signi cant differences in total sleep time, sleep ef ciency, or severity of sleep apnea, a phenomenon possibly achieved by excluding subjects with greater than mild obstructive sleep apnea. Evidence from both animal models ( Bjorness et al., 2005; Smith and Rose, 1996 ) and humans (Varga et al., 2014 ) suggests that REM sleep may be important in the consolidation of spatial navigational memory. The differences in REM sleep in our groups are unlikely to explain the perfor- mance differences observed as the older subjects actually had a slightly greater percentage of REM sleep than younger subjects, and there were no differences in the degree of REM fragmentation. The differences in slow-wave sleep, and in particular, in relative slow-wave activity in the prefrontal region, offer the most parsi- monious explanation for the differences in observed consolidation of spatial navigational memory between the younger and older groups. Percent of slow-wave sleep positively correlated with memory for word pairs in younger, but not older subjects ( Scullin, 2013 ). Slow-wave especi c sleep disruption via auditory stimula- tion without changes in total sleep has been shown to impair declarative memory ( Van Der Werf et al., 2011 ). Conversely, enhancement of neocortical slow waves via auditory stimulation in phase with the ongoing rhythmic occurrence of slow oscillation up states ( Ngo et al., 2013 ) or via transcranial electrical stimulation in younger ( Marshall et al., 2006 ) and older subjects ( Westerberg et al., 2015 ) enhanced declarative memory across sleep. Although the effects of similar bidirectional manipulations of slow-wave sleep on spatial navigational memory have not been completed, imaging studies have demonstrated that the degree of blood flow to the right hippocampus during slow-wave sleep correlated with the degree of improvement across sleep in a spatial navigational task (Peigneux et al., 2004 ). Sleep slow oscillations are thought to generate from an inter- action between thalamic and cortical circuits. Slow waves them- selves are traveling waves that originate frontally over prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and et al., 2004 ). Brain atrophy with aging disproportionately affects frontal cortex and may represent one mechanism by which slow- wave sleep diminishes with age. Our observation that relative frontal slow-wave activity correlates with mPFC volume is consistent with this theory. Our data cannot exclude the possibilityOlder Pre-sleep Older Post-sleep Younger Post-sleep Younger Pre-sleepn.s. ***** 4.8% 31% Fig. 3.

Varga et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 42 (2016) 142 e149 147that the reduced mPFC volume with aging contributes to impaired spatial navigational memory consolidation independent of effects on slow-wave sleep; however, we did not observe a signi cant correlation between mPFC volume and overnight change in maze performance. This is in contrast to the negative correlation observed between orbital prefrontal cortical volume and working memory performance in older subjects, although this study also found larger orbital prefrontal cortical volumes with advanced age (Salat et al., 2002 ). This is also in contrast to the positive correla- tion observed between mPFC volume and overnight declarative memory performance ( Mander et al., 2013 ). Notably though, in this study neither age nor mPFC gray matter volume signi cantly predicted the extent of overnight declarative memory retention when frontal slow-wave activity was included in the statistical model.In sum, we have demonstrated that the sleep of older subjects does not impart the same bene ts toward the consolidation of spatial navigational memory as the sleep of younger subjects. This effect is likely attributable to reduced slow-wave activity in older subjects, the consequence of both decreased amount of and increased fragmentation of slow-wave sleep. It remains possible that impoverished spatial navigational memory, reduced slow- wave activity, and prefrontal brain atrophy are independent hallmarks of aging. However, our data support the emerging model in which these variables are related and open avenues to explore the causal interrelationships between these factors further. Our data highlight the importance of sleep quality that is challenged in aging not only from the natural decreases in slow- wave sleep, but also from factors such as the increased incidence of OSA with aging and the societal tendency to accumulate sleep debt volitionally.mean reaction time (ms) 100200300400500600A PVT lapses - transform 0246810121416B Older subjects Younger subjectsOlder subjects Younger subjects Fig. 5.
