The movement split into severalfactions when the event did not occur as expected.One of these factions evolved into the Seventh-dayAdventist church, distinguished by the observance ofSaturday as the Sabbath and the spiritual leadershipof Ellen G. White (1827-1915), who as a 17-year-oldreported visions during which she received divineinstruction. In part, these instructions, as presentedby White, supported the evolution of the church'sdistinctive philosophy of health by elevating health-ful living into a moral obligation for Seventh-dayAdventists. 1Healthful living as a feature of religious and moral conviction was given institutional form inthe establishment of the Battle Creek Sanitarium,whose most famous director was John HarveyKellogg. 2 By 2001 membership swelled to more than twelve million, roughly 92 percent of whom dwell outside ofthe United States.The Seventh-day Adventist Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions Edited by Edwin R.

Practically,one should have a sound body and mind to ren-der the most effective service to God and to oth-ers. One central Adventist belief is that men andwomen are made in God's image with the free-dom and power to think and act. 3Though each is created a free being, every person is an indi-visible unity of body, mind, and soul, dependentupon God for life and all else. According toAdventist theology, the care of the body\u2014eitherpersonally, socially, or institutionally\u2014is fully anexpression of Christian commitment. SinceAdventists believe that personal health is a God-given trust essential to one's personal prepara-tion for the Second Advent, people have aresponsibility to care for their bodies. Thisresponsibility includes attention to diet, as wellas abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. 4The person who knowingly violates simple healthprinciples, thereby bringing on ill health, dis-ease, or disability, is living in violation of thelaws of God. 5In many ways, therefore, the Seventh-day Adventist patient is ideally recep-tive to holistic, preventive, and rehabilitativeregimes. As a ministry, the church operatesmore than 650 health institutions throughoutthe world. 6 The church's commitment to matters pertain- ing to health and health care remains strong.Generally Adventists favor rational, scientificapproaches to health care over pseudoscientificones because \"laws of the natural world are ofdivine origin.\" Adventists accept the conceptthat there are natural remedies that may be ben-eficial for the treatment of disease, particularlyin the home situation. Such remedies should berational and in harmony with the laws of physi-ology. Adventists would reject many of the cur-rent new age forms of disease treatment becauseof their pseudoscientific nature and mysticalbasis outside of Christian teaching. 7While sup- portive of scientific medicine, Seventh-dayAdventist theology is particularly compatiblewith ideas associated with health reform, for itsholistic view of the human being dispenses withthe traditionally sharp disjunction between bodyand soul that influenced the development ofbiomedicine. Recent studies show that Adventists who fol- low church teaching on healthful living haveincreased longevity. White male and whitefemale Adventists in California live 7 1/4years and 4 1/2years longer, respectively, than their California contemporaries. Further, Adventistswho live a low-risk lifestyle\u2014high physical activi-ty, vegetarian diet, frequent consumption ofnuts, medium body mass\u2014show a 10-yearadvantage in life expectancy, compared to thoseAdventists who have a high-risk lifestyle. 8 The church's posture on many clinical issues is generally consistent with that of many otherProtestant Christian groups. The positions out-lined below are not church dogma but representa reasonable summary of Adventist belief. Theyare based in many cases on articles thatappeared in Seventh-day Adventist publicationsand then were assembled by Albert S. Whiting,former director of the Health and TemperanceDepartment of the General Conference ofSeventh-day Adventists. Many of the documentscited were prepared by a special committee andapproved by church officers or the denomina-tion's executive committee as guidelines or edu-cational material to provide information tochurch members. It should be emphasized thatthese statements do not necessarily representchurch policy or mandates to members butrather should be considered as guidelines andinformation. 2Because the church believes that individuals are created in God's image as free beings, in most matters relating to health care the individ-ual church member makes his or her own choic-es. No hierarchy stands over the individual todictate to him or her in such decisions. CLINICAL ISSUES Self-determination and informed consent For Adventists, God has given humans freedomof choice with the proviso that they use theirfreedom responsibly. This freedom extends todecisions about medical care. As a requirementfor responsible decision making, persons shouldbe adequately informed about their condition,the treatment choices, and the possible out-comes. 9With consideration for the interests of others and with the help of divine guidance, aperson should be given the respect deserved byself-determining individuals. Truth-telling and confidentiality Patients, families, and caregivers should be truth-ful in their relations with each other; \"the truthshould not be withheld but shared with Christianlove and with sensitivity to the patient's personaland cultural circumstances.\" 10In medical matters such as assisted reproduction, \"health care profes-sionals should disclose fully the nature of the pro-cedure, emotional and physical risks, costs, anddocumented successes and limited probabilities.\" 11Adventists believe that trust must be main- tained in human relationships. Since the protec-tion of confidentiality is essential to such trust,Adventists believe that information about a per-son's medical condition or other personal infor-mation should be kept confidential unless theperson elects to share the knowledge. In caseswhere others may suffer serious and avoidableharm without information about another person,there is a moral obligation to share the neededinformation. 12 Proxy decision making and advance directives Adventists believe that decisions about humanlife are best made within the context of healthyfamily relationships after considering medicaladvice. When someone is unable to give consentor express preferences regarding medical inter-vention, an individual chosen by the personshould make such decisions. If no one has beenchosen, someone close to the person shouldmake the determination. Except in extraordinarycircumstances, medical or legal professionalsshould refer decisions about medical interven-tions for a person to those closest to that indi-vidual. Wishes or decisions of the incapacitatedindividual are best made known in writing andshould be in accord with existing legal require-ments. 13 In general, Adventists agree with current practices in health care concerning informedconsent, self-determination, truth-telling, confi-dentiality, and advance directives. 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHE AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATION Based on what Adventists see as God's origi- nal plan for the lives of Adam and Eve, Seventh-day Adventists advocate sexual uniononly through lifelong, monogamous, heterosexu-al marriage. In their drive to be joined, in otherwords, each couple reenacts the first love story.The act of sexual intimacy is the nearest thing toa physical union possible for them. It represents the closeness the couple can know emotionallyand spiritually as well. 14 For most Adventists, the hope of having chil- dren is powerful. Because of their convictionthat God is concerned with all dimensions ofhuman life, they are committed to the principlethat procreation is God's gift and should be used to glorify God and bless humanity.15According to the Adventist tradition, it is God's ideal forchildren to have the benefits of a stable familywith active participation of both mother andfather. At the same time, childlessness shouldbear no social or moral stigma, and no oneshould be pressured to have children with orwithout medical assistance. Decisions aboutfamily and family life are personal matters thatshould be made mutually between husband andwife. There are many acceptable reasons, includ-ing health, that may lead people to refrain fromor limit procreation. 16 CLINICAL ISSUES Contraception Family planning is part of an Adventist's responsi-bility in today's world, and this kind of planningoften involves the need for appropriate forms ofbirth control. Generally speaking, Seventh-dayAdventists regard as acceptable those forms ofcontraception that prevent the formation of life,rather than those that involve the loss of life. 17 Sterilization The church has taken no position on sterilization. New reproductive technologies All forms of surrogate procreation\u2014e.g., artificialinsemination by husband or donor, in vitro fer-tilization, gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer,surrogate motherhood\u2014raise potential of nor-mal parental-fetal and parent-child bonding, thedenial of responsibility for the offspring of pro-creation, and the disassociation of procreationand loving in marriage. Although the Bible doesnot offer specific direction in such matters,Adventists believe that too much of human lifehas been depersonalized and that to depersonal-ize it further by limiting or perverting personalroles in reproduction is a questionable way offulfilling maternal or paternal longing. 18Medical technologies that aid infertile cou- ples, however, may be accepted in good con-science when they are used in harmony withbiblical principles. 19Procedures such as in vitro fertilization require prior decisions about thenumber of ova to be fertilized and the moralissues regarding the disposition of any remainingpre-embryos. 20 At the same time, the church notes that adop- tion is one of the alternatives that infertile cou-ples may consider. 21 Abortion and the status of the fetus Abortion, as understood in Adventist guidelines,is defined as any action aimed at the termina-tion of a pregnancy already established.Abortion is distinguished from contraception,which is intended to prevent a pregnancy. 22 The Bible says nothing explicit on the status of the fetus. For Adventists, however, human lifeshould be treated with respect at all stages ofdevelopment. 23Prenatal human life is a gift of God. According to Gerald Winslow, professor ofChristian Ethics at Loma Linda University,\"Biblical imagery leads us . . . to think of thefetus as one whom God has called by name . . .The principle of respect for human life estab-lishes a strong moral presumption in favor ofpreserving life, including prenatal life.Exceptions such as abortion must always bear aheavy burden of proof.\" 24 At the same time, the principle of respect for personal autonomy establishes a moral presump-tion in favor of the pregnant woman's right todetermine whether to continue the pregnancy.\"The principle calls into question all paternalis-tic attempts to make continuation of the preg-nancy mandatory.\" 25 In sum, abortion should be performed only for the most serious reasons, never for convenience,gender selection, or birth control. 26The exception- al circumstances in which abortion may be con-sidered are when there is significant threat to thepregnant woman's life or health, when severe con-genital defects have been diagnosed in the fetus,and when the pregnancy results from rape or 4 THESEVENTH -DAYADVENTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHEPARKRIDGE CENTERincest. The final decision whether to terminate the pregnancy should be made by the pregnantwoman after appropriate consultation\u2014aided inthis decision by \"accurate information, biblicalprinciples, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit . . .within the context of healthy family relationships.\"Any attempt to \"coerce women either to remainpregnant or to terminate pregnancy should berejected as infringements of personal freedom.\" 27The church, in its efforts to be a supportive community, should commit itself to assist inalleviating the unfortunate social, economic, andpsychological factors that may lead to abortionand to care for those suffering the consequencesof individual decisions on this issue. 28 \"Persons having ethical objection to abortion should not be required to participate in the per-formance of abortions.\" 29 5GENETICS Among recent developments in genetics aregenetic mapping, new means for genetic engineering, and a variety of eugenics strategies.These developments generate potential forimmense good or harm and an accompanyingcall for responsibility in their use. The Seventh-day Adventist church raises three categories ofethical concerns in three areas: 1. Sanctity of human life. \"If genetic determinism reduces the meaning of humanhood to the mecha-nistic outworkings of molecular biology, there for devaluing human life . . . Forexample, new capacities for prenatal genetic test-ing, including the examination of human pre-embryos prior to implantation, generate questionsabout the value of human life when it is genetical-ly defective . . . Some conditions, such as trisomy18, are generally deemed incompatible with life.But the relative seriousness of most geneticdefects is a matter of judgment.\" 30 2. Protection of human dignity. \"The protection of personal privacy and confidentiality is one of themajor concerns associated with the new possibili-ties for genetic testing. Knowledge about a per-son's genetic profile could be of significant valueto potential employers, [to] insurance companies,and to those related to the person. Whether genet-ic testing should be voluntary or mandatory, whenand by whom the testing should be done, howmuch and with whom the resulting informationshould be shared are matters of significant ethical concern . . . At stake is the protection of personsfrom stigma and unfair discrimination on the basisof their genetic makeup.\" 31 Also, \"changes in human reproductive cells couldbecome a permanent part of the human genepool. Interventions may extend beyond the treat-ment of disease and include attempts to enhancewhat have formerly been considered normalhuman characteristics. What are the implicationsfor the meaning of being human, for example, ifinterventions aimed at enhancing human intelli-gence or physique become available?\" 32 3. Stewardship of God's creation. Changes in genetics \"have the potential for being both permanent and,to some degree, unpredictable. What limits togenetic change, if any, should be accepted? Arethere boundaries that should not be crossed intransferring genes from one life form to another?\" 33 CLINICAL ISSUES In order to safeguard personal privacy and pro- tect against unfair discrimination, informationabout a person's genetic constitution should bekept confidential unless the person elects toshare the knowledge with others. In cases whereothers may suffer serious and avoidable harmwithout genetic information about another per-THESEVENTH -DAYADVENTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSson, there is a moral obligation to share the needed information. The obligation to be truth-ful requires that the results of genetic testing behonestly reported to the person tested or toresponsible family members if the person isincapable of understanding the information. 34 The Christian acknowledgment of God's wis- dom and power in creation should lead to cautionin attempts to alter permanently the human genepool. Intervention in humans should be limitedto treatment of individuals with genetic disorders(somatic cell therapies) and should not includeattempts to change human reproductive cells(germ line alterations), which could affect theimage of God in future generations. The primarypurpose of human genetic intervention should betreatment or prevention of disease and alleviationof pain and suffering. Efforts to modify physicalor mental characteristics of healthy persons byusing genetic interventions should be approachedwith great caution. 35 People capable of making their own decisions should be free to decide whether to be testedgenetically. They should also be free to decidehow to act on information that results from test-ing, except when others may suffer serious andavoidable harm. It may be morally responsible to avoid known risks of serious congenitaldefects by forgoing procreation. While such deci-sions about procreation and genetic testing aredeeply personal, they should be made by theindividual with due consideration for the com-mon good. Genetic interventions with plants and animals should show respect for the rich variety of lifeforms. Exploitation and manipulation thatdestroys natural balance is a violation of stew-ardship of God's creation. 36 The benefits of genetic research should be accessible to people in need without unfair dis-crimination, and human dignity should not bereduced to genetic mechanisms. People shouldbe treated with dignity and with respect for theirindividual qualities, not stereotyped on the basisof genetic heritage. Finally, Adventists hold that Christians should avoid that which is likely to prove geneticallydestructive to themselves or to their children,such as drug abuse and excessive radiation. 37 Helping those in need is at the center ofJewish and Christian morality. Based on the belief that one should help and serve others,Seventh-day Adventists who can give anotherperson life or improved health through organand/or tissue donation are strongly encouragedto do so. 38 CLINICAL ISSUES The church has no official position on manyissues, including specific questions related toorgan and tissue procurement and transplanta-tion. Thus individual Adventist physicians andmedical institutions are free to apply Christian principles to issues such as use of human fetaltissue, procurement from anencephalic new-borns, and the preferability of obtaining opposed to livingdonors. Adventist-owned and -operated Loma Linda University in California has pioneered infantheart transplant surgery. In the late 1980s theinstitution had an experimental protocol fortransplanting hearts from anencephalic new-borns, and it also transplanted a baboon heart inthe publicized case of Baby Fae. 6ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERChemical dependency is a biopsychosocial- spiritual disorder that encompasses every aspect of an individual in its etiology, expression,prevention, and treatment. The debilitatingeffects of this disease process are not confinedsolely to the afflicted person but are also experi-enced by the family and others associated withthe chemically dependent individual. This viewof chemical dependency emphasizes that theprevention, expression, and treatment of the dis-ease involve the same principles. Thus the entireprocess of chemical dependency is seen as morefundamental than a particular drug's chemistryor an individual's physical response to a particu-lar drug. 39Since alcohol and tobacco are drugs, the church advocates abstinence from both.40 Although denominational universities now offer advanced degrees in psychology, the churchlong viewed psychotherapy with suspicion. Older members may be reluctant to seek psychothera-py, especially from non-Adventist therapists. CLINICAL ISSUES No official church guidelines exist on involun-tary commitment, psychotherapy and behaviormodification, psychopharmacology, or elec-troshock and stimulation. The church has taken a stance on hypnotism. It has stated that the use of hypnosis is inappropriatebecause the individual submitting to hypnosis isallowing his or her mind to be under the controlof another individual. Thus hypnosis violates thefree agency of persons and creates the possibilityof an uncontrolled influence on one's mind. 41MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH The church has not isssued guidelines on therapeutic and nontherapeutic medical experimentation or research on fetuses, chil-dren, and adults. DEATH AND DYING It is not life itself but a certain quality of life that is of primary importance for Adventists\u2014 namely the personal. When a person possessesthe capacity for responsible behavior, his orher life makes the highest order of claim uponothers. When, however, this capacity will neverreturn or has no potential for ever existing, ahuman may be biologically alive but his or herpersonhood is dead. At this point, the wellbeing of the people who make up the socialenvironment of such an individual begins totake priority. 42The Adventist tradition is balanced in its view of persons. The Bible says nothing explicit onthe status of the permanently comatose or theterminally ill. But biblical principles, with fewexceptions, do express opposition to the takingof human life. Because God has promised eter-nal life, however, Christians need not cling anx-iously to the last vestiges of life on this earth; itis not necessary to accept or offer all possiblemedical treatments when they can only prolongthe process of dying. 43 Adventists recognize that physical, mental,THESEVENTH -DAYADVENTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSand emotional pain and suffering are universal. However, human suffering has no expiatory ormeritorious value\u2014biblically, no amount orintensity of human suffering can atone for sin.Because medical knowledge and technology canonly forestall death, difficult moral and ethicalquestions remain: \"What constraints doesChristian faith place upon the use of suchpower? When should the goal of postponing themoment of death give way to the goal of allevi-ating pain at the end of life? Who may appropri-ately make these decisions? What limits, if any,should Christian love place on actions designedto end human suffering?\" 44 Because of their vulnerable condition, \"spe- cial care should be taken to ensure that dyingpersons are treated with respect for their dignityand without unfair discrimination. Their careshould be based on their spiritual and medicalneeds and their expressed choices rather thanon perceptions of their social worthiness.\" 45 Compared to most Christians, Adventists hold a distinctive view of the soul and death. One's soulis mortal and is the equivalent of one's embodiedself, not an immortal spiritual essence. At deathpersons \"sleep\" in the grave until the resurrectionat Christ's second coming, at which time theredeemed receive eternal life. CLINICAL ISSUES Determining death Church medical institutions in the United Statesare comfortable with and follow state laws indetermining death\u2014either irreversible cessationof cardiopulmonary function or permanent ces-sation of whole brain function. Pain control and palliative care In caring for the dying, Adventists believe that it isa Christian responsibility to relieve pain and suf-fering to the fullest extent possible but to avoidactive euthanasia. When it is clear that medicalintervention will not cure a patient, the primarygoal of care should shift to relief of suffering.Human suffering possesses no innate value. 46Suicide, assisted suicide, allowing to die, and euthanasia Adventists support the use of modern medicine to preserve and extend human life, but they believethat this power should be used in compassionateways that reveal God's grace by minimizing suffer-ing. \"Seventh-day Adventists believe that allowinga patient to die by foregoing medical interventionsthat only prolong suffering and postpone themoment of death is morally different from actionsthat have as their primary intention the direct tak-ing of a life\" 47There is a decided difference between actively terminating life and withholdingtreatment when there is no hope of recovery. ForAdventists in appropriate circumstances\u2014when theperson's condition is by forgoing life-sustaining treatment isaccepted. 48Life-extending medical treatments may be omitted or stopped if they only add to thepatient's suffering or needlessly prolong theprocess of dying. When medical care merely pre-serves bodily functions, without hope of returninga patient to mental awareness, it is futile and may,in good conscience, be withheld or withdrawn. 49 Although Adventists support the withholding or withdrawing of medical interventions thatonly increase suffering or prolong dying, theyare against assisted suicide(Genesis Theyoppose active euthanasia, the intentional takingof the life of a suffering or dying person. 50 Autopsy and postmortem care Although there is no specific church policy,Adventists in general offer no objection toautopsies. The choice of postmortem carebelongs to the individual family. 51 Last rites, burial, and mourning customs Because Seventh-day Adventists believe thateternal life comes solely through faith in Christ'srighteousness, they do not practice last rites as apreparation for a hereafter. 8THEPARKRIDGE CENTERAIDS Adventists recognize that many people with AIDS are rejected by family, friends, and coworkers and that, as a result, they suffer anddie alone. Although Adventists have long advo-cated premarital abstinence and the limitation ofsexual intercourse to the heterosexual marriagerelationship, they see the needs of AIDS suffer-ers as medical, not moral. 52 ATTITUDES TOWARD DIET AND THE USE OF DRUGS The Seventh-day Adventist church advocates complete abstinence from unclean foods as out-lined in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, aswell as alcohol, coffee, tea, and other stimulatingfoods. It has encouraged vegetarianism, arguingthat meat consumption can cause an increase inatherosclerosis, cancer, kidney disorders, osteo-porosis, and trichinosis. However, the churchdoes not require strict vegetarianism nor does itprohibit the use of eggs, cheese, and other dairyproducts. 53 FEMALE CIRCUMCISION Citing its concern for the \"entire person,\" thechurch expresses its opposition to the \"wide-spread practice of female genital mutilation.\"Although the church strongly believes in reli-gious liberty, it strongly objects to this cultural\u2014even religious\u2014practice whose prevalenceexceeds 90 percent in some countries. Church members are called upon to help eliminate thispractice in all its forms because it is disfiguringand causes physical dysfunction and emotionaltrauma. 54 USE OF MIFEPRISTONE (RU-486) The drug Mifepristone, commonly known asRU-486, may provide effective therapy in thetreatment of such medical conditions as cancer.The church states that the drug should be usedin keeping with relevant laws and establishedmedical practice. RU-486 can also be used forcontraception. If the intent is to prevent fertil-ization, its use is ethically permissible. Likeother oral contraceptives, however, RU-486 maysometimes prevent implantation of a fertilizedovum. \"This is ethically problematic to thosewho consider this effect to be abortion . . .When RU-486 is used in legally permissible andmedically appropriate ways for the purpose ofcausing abortion,\" Adventist guidelines on abor-tion should be followed. 55 BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS Seventh-day Adventists embrace all medical pro-cedures that lead to greater holistic health andthe sustaining of life. They therefore approve ofthe transfusion of blood whenever it is medicallyprescribed as a lifesaving measure. 9SPECIAL and position papers. 7.Whiting, personal communication, 1992, 1995; White, Ministry of Healing , 127, 265. 8.Fraser and Shavlik, \"Ten \"Associations\"; Phillips, \"Cancer among Seventh-dayAdventists.\" 9.See, for example, a publication written by the church's Christian View of Human Life Committee, The Seventh-day Adventist Church Focuses on EthicalIssues (hereafter referred to as Ethical Issues ), 8. 16.Ibid., 8. 17 .Whiting, 1992. 18.Ibid.; see also the discussion of assisted human repro- duction in Ethical Issues , 139:13-16; Ethical Issues , 8, 11. 24.Park Ridge Center, Abortion, Religion, and the State Legislator , 19. 25.Ibid. 26.Ethical Issues , 32. 38.Whiting, 1992. 39.General Conference Commission on Chemical Dependency and the Church, Report , 7, cited by Whiting, 1992. 40.Sterndale, \"Alcohol and the Pregnant Woman.\" 41.Whiting, 1995.

Increasingly, healthcare workers face the challenge of providingappropriate care and services to people of differentreligious backgrounds. Unfortunately, manyhealthcare workers are unfamiliar with the reli-gious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of differ-ent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and adminis-trators in their decision making and care giving. Itcan also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated byauthorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should not substitute for discussion of patients' own reli-gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
