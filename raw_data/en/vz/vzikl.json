Dear Committee Members, I am in favor of passing HB 1468 because above all the freedoms I enjoy as an American and as a citizen of North Dakota, is the freedom and responsibility to protect my own personal health, by choosing to accept or reject any and all medical advice, procedures, tests, drugs or vaccines. I also cherish the right to make these decisions for my children. These are rights I believe all human beings should be afforded. I remember in my childhood that my mother would always get very sick and often ended up in the hospital after receiving a flu vaccine. She was asthmatic and the flu vaccine always exacerbated her asthma. I didn't think much of it as a child, and I wasn't the least bit skeptical about vaccines until I had my first child. Previous to having my own children in the early 2000's, I had worked with children for many years as a Nanny and I had nieces and nephews. I knew that children in the 80's received around 10 - 12 vaccines from birth until they reached school age. So, when I took my first born to the doctor for her first well-baby visit in 2002, I was astonished that they wanted to give her 8 vaccines at one time! (Today's children receive 72 or more vaccines from birth till they reach adulthood). I remember a sick feeling of dread and a mother's intuition that 8 vaccine injecting into a tiny baby at one time was safe. I asked the doctor if it was safe to inject so many vaccines into a 10 lb infant. I will never forget her response. She said it was like \"pee in the ocean.\" I was handed a sheet of paper about each vaccine which listed only a few possible adverse reactions such as fever, soreness at the injection site, and crying. Nothing I read seemed too alarming. Still, the feeling of dread in my stomach did not subside, but I made the choice to trust the doctor, in part based on the information that I received on those hand-outs, and I went ahead with the vaccines for my baby. Fortunately, my baby had no serious side effects in the days immediately following her vaccinations, but I did notice that she developed a stuffy nose that would not subside and it eventually became apparent to her doctor that she was now allergic to dairy, which she had not been prior to those vaccines. From the time of those vaccine at her two month doctor visit my baby could no longer tolerate milk so I had to be dairy free while nursing her and supplement with soy formula. Later in life this daughter developed many health conditions which I will not elaborate on to protect her privacy, but I will say that these conditions are related to a genetic mutation that runs in my family and makes a person more susceptible to adverse vaccine reactions, and I will elaborate on that later in this testimony. For now I will say that had I had the knowledge then that I do now, which I would have if doctors were legally required to give proper Informed Consent before administering vaccines, I would have not had my daughter vaccinated and she would not have suffered the lifelong, vaccine-induced afflictions that she has suffered. When my second child was born, I was not terribly hesitant about vaccines because my firstborn had survived without serious injury (I was not aware yet that vaccines likely caused her milk allergy, and other issues, and I was also not aware that many vaccine induced adverse effects do not occurrence immediately). My second child also had no immediate serious side effects but weeks after her vaccines she developed a severe case of eczema. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that her entire face was covered in huge red welts. The only parts of her face that were not covered in angry welts were the tip of her nose, her eyelids, and her lips. Needless to say, I was panicked. Her doctor said that this was the worse case of eczema she had ever seen in an infant. Fortunately, treatment cleared up this first outbreak, but my daughter continued to suffer from painful eczema outbreaks throughout her life. At four months of age my baby daughter received her second round of vaccines. Days later I found her limp and grey in her crib. At the doctor's office I was told that she went limp and turned grey from a high fever and that she had Rotavirus. No mention was made that vaccines could have had anything to do with it. I have since learned that the vaccine insert for most childhood vaccines, which parents never see because the law does not require them this information to be provided) plainly states that SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is a possible avers reaction from childhood vaccines. I will never know what really happened to my daughter that day. But what I do know is that I never received truthful, and complete information about the benefits or risks of vaccines before my children were vaccinated at their well-baby exams. I will note here that there was nothing on the vaccine information hand-outs that I received at the doctor's office about the possibility of vaccines causing eczema or food allergies. I have since learned that the vaccine package inserts do list allergies and eczema as possible adverse reactions to vaccines, but this information was not given to me. I have also learned that the current CDC Vaccine Schedule has never been studied! There are no studies at all to examine the safety of administering numerous vaccines at the same time. Children in my day received fewer than 15 vaccines from birth till adulthood. Today's children receive 72 or more! But the safety of injecting so many vaccines at once has never been studied!! My niece's children were much more severely effected by vaccines. My first great-nephew had no mental or physical health problems whatsoever until he was about 2 years old when he developed an eye tick which the doctor initially said was probably normal and not to worry about it. Sadly, it was not normal and my formerly happy and healthy nephew became deluged with anxiety and phobias. He would not sleep alone, nor leave his mother's side, ever. He became terrified of normal daily objects like the television and radio. He developed a phobia of riding in a car. He began having behavioral problems and his life became unbearable. He also developed severe eczema and food allergies which he did not have prior. After years of searching for answers my sister finally found a doctor who diagnosed him with a condition called PANDAS. PANDAS stands for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections. This condition is as terrifying as it sounds. To be brief, this disease causes a child's body to react to strep throat infection by producing antibodies that attack the brain instead of the strep infection, PANDAS, the doctor told us, is caused by vaccines. My nephew's genetic testing showed that it was the Prevnar vaccine that triggered his PANDAS. My nephew's life was ruined by this condition. Sadly, two years later his baby brother became lethargic and nearly catatonic after his 12 month vaccines. He stopped walking and talking and would do nothing but lay on the floor or sleep all day. He was admitted to the hospital where he spent 6 days. A CAT Scan showed brain swelling which vaccine inserts document is a possible side effect of almost all childhood vaccines (which I might add is not listed on the vaccine information hand-outs given out at doctor's office visits). The doctors said there was nothing they could do but wait. He was behaving very much like an autistic child and we feared the worst. He had to relearn how to walk, and he spent weeks in what looked like some sort of daze. He just wasn't the same child and we all thought he might never recover. Fortunately my great-nephew was one of the lucky ones. It took months, but he did recover for the most part; but like his brother he developed fears and anxieties, as well as food allergies, and eczema. Due to the severity and hopelessness of my first-nephew's condition (PANDAS), my sister and niece began a long journey of research and visits with many medical specialists. Eventually they learned that some people have a genetic mutation called MTHFR. This is a defect that prevents the body from performing normal processes which require methylation. (There are 250 or more processes in the body which rely on methylation). One significant problem with methylation defects is that they prevent the body from detoxing so toxins accumulate in the body and brain. How is this related to vaccines? Well, vaccines contain preservatives which are toxins to the human brain and body. People with MTHFR mehtylation defects cannot detox after vaccinations which leads to all kinds of physical and mental diseases and disabilities. It is worth noting here that vaccine ingredients are rarely, if ever, disclosed to patients or parents of children before vaccines are administered. It is likely that I also have an MTHFR mutation because both of my great- nephews do and genetic testing showed they have a double mutation, meaning they got a copy from both sides of the family, and one of my daughters has been diagnosed with it as well. For this reason, and others, I have decided not to take vaccines for the last 19 years and I have no doubt that that decision has been the right decision for me. In addition to avoiding vaccines, I am a person who cherishes my right to choose when it comes to my health. It would be my worst nigthmare to live in a state or country in which I did not have Health Freedom. Unlike myself, I have a sister who fears nothing when it comes to medical treatment. She had gastric bypass surgery in 2005 and suffered some very serious complications requiring numerous surgeries to correct. She's also undergone back surgery and a surgery to fix a broken arm. As most sisters would, I'd always call her the day before or morning of her surgery to tell her I was thinking of her and praying for her. I would ask, \"What kind of surgery are you having. What are they going to do?\" Her typical response was something like, \"I don't know, something with my intestines.\" I was always flabbergasted that she could be so unconcerned! I, on the other hand, will take my doctors advice home with me and research for days or weeks or months before deciding. I am keenly aware that, while most doctors are well-meaning and wish me no harm, that they are human beings and they make mistakes. And I understand that science is not infallible and that knowledge of science and medicine changes over time. I don't go to a doctor and think of him or her as a god or all-knowing being like my sister does. I feel a burden to research my illnesses and treatments to determine what is best for myself. I am grateful that being an American and a citizen of North Dakota allows me to take my healthcare into my own hands - for the most part. I am very thankful that when a doctor advises me to have surgery, I am given an Informed Consent form which lays out all the possible complications so that I can make a decision based on truthful and adequate information. I am also grateful that when my doctor prescribes a medication, I am given an informative drug information sheet that comes with my prescription so I can decide if I feel comfortable with the risks and benefits of that particular medication. Unfortunately, vaccine administration is not treated the same way as surgery and prescribed drugs. Information on ingredients, and efficacy, and on adverse reactions is not given to patients before vaccines are administered. All that is given is a one page fact sheet with very minimal information usually including only the most common and least serious side effects. No ingredients are revealed to patients or parents. No information on the benefits to risk ratios are disclosed. The truth about efficacy is not revealed. Patients who receive vaccines and parents who consent to vaccines for their children are doing so blindly, and that is wrong and should be criminal. When I go grocery shopping, I read labels. Manufacturers are required to list all ingredients. Why are vaccines manufacturers not required to do the same? I am very fearful about losing my right to decide for myself if a vaccine is safe for my body. Like my mother, I have severe asthma and I have chosen up to this time to avoid vaccines because they made my mother so sick and because the one time I did get a flu vaccine in my adult life, I also became very sick. It is quite likely that I have the MTHRF genetic mutation that runs in my family which means I am at high risk of developing serious adverse reactions and even life long debilitating diseases or conditions if I take a vaccine. In closing, please do pass HB 1468. Patients should have the right to know what is being injected in to their bodies and they should have the right to consent based on truthful, complete, and unbiassed information. Vaccines should only be administered when proper Informed Consent is provided. Sincerely, Christine Miller "}
