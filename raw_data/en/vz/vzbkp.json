Date and time Location Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center7th Floor Community Hall 7A141 3900 Woodland Avenue Philadelphia, PA 19104 United States About this event - 2 hours - Mobile eTicket The Community Healing Ceremony is a service of reconciliation for Veterans and non-Veterans led by VA chaplains, community clergy, and Veterans. The Ceremony invites U.S. citizens to see themselves as sharing responsibility for various harms perpetrated by, or occurring within, the U.S. military. The Ceremony provides a space to celebrate Veterans' moral sensitivity and moral seriousness, share the truth of their military experience, and initiate them in a process of transformation we call \"patient to prophet.\" Veterans who bear moral injury are not sick people with a disorder, they are responsible moral agents who are morally-laden with an unfair burden that will only be relieved when that burden is more equitably distributed among all who own some portion of responsibility for the harmful consequences of warfare. Psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton described the prophetic mission of Veterans this way: \"Their experience parallels that of priests and shaman, the predecessors of biblical prophets, who ventured into the 'land of death' and then 'returned' to bring their people deepened knowledge of the mysteries of life and death.\" He says the essence of their \"truth-mission\" is \"conveying truth at the source\" which is both the basis for \"personal transformation\" and the source of \"regenerative insight\" for the community as a whole. During the Ceremony, Veterans bear witness to the human cost of war and military service while the community listens to, and wrestles with, moral responsibility and civic duty. Blame and guilt is not avoided or abandoned, but shared in a way that advances therapeutic helping and healing. Sharing, and holding one another responsible, for painful truths about the harmful consequences of U.S. authorized warfare is difficult but necessary to authentically honor Veterans, relieve them of the moral burden many too often carry in isolation, and reconcile Veterans both with the society, on whose behalf they were willing to kill and die, and with the people who died in war. The Ceremony shifts the focus of the work away from individual therapy or treatment of the Veteran and gives the work of deep remembering, moral reckoning, and moral engagement back to the community. The presence of non-Veterans and Veterans together is necessary to advance the work of reconciliation and promote human flourishing. Caution: Veterans will testify at this event to the realities of warfare and military service. Some may be disturbed, unsettled, or even overwhelmed by what they hear. Still, we encourage everyone to attend and stay for the entire Ceremony. Special Guidance for all participants: This is first and foremost a therapeutic experience for the Veterans, in which community engagement is crucial. To facilitate this, community members are expected to be active participants and fully present for the full duration (120 minutes) of the program . For in person participants, this means being seated by 3:55pm. For online participants, this means joining with your video on without multi-tasking. The event begins promptly at 4pm EST with a 30 minute mandatory orientation for the community. The event will be locked at 04:05 and latecomers will only be allowed to enter at the discretion of the facilitators. The event will end at 6pm at which time the community may leave or elect to join a reception with Veterans from the Moral Injury Group. Staff will monitor the ceremony room and the online platform during the entire event to help ensure the best possible experience for the Veterans and may remove anyone who is unable to be fully present and engaged. If you are unable to meet these expectations please do not register for this event.

It's good to give the community some of the moral burden.\" -Vietnam Veteran \"Beautiful, devastating, beyond \"I part of the solution\" -civilian VA employee \"we need a moral injury Ceremony in every town in America!\" -Vietnam Veteran About the Moral Injury Group The Moral Injury Group (MIG) at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, meets for 90 minutes for twelve consecutive weeks. During this time, the chaplain and mental health clinician who facilitate the MIG educate Veterans with wisdom from psychology (moral emotions, moral disengagement/engagement, post traumatic growth) as well as spirituality and religion (spiritual disciplines, moral values, collective responsibility, social ethics). In the process, Veterans explore the moral and spiritual dimension of their military experience and rebuild moral identity. After the tenth meeting Veterans hold a Community Healing Ceremony. The aim is not to replace morality with therapy but rather to integrate morality and mental health in order to arrive at moral health-- mental well-being based on moral integrity--both individually and collectively. The intended short-term outcome is better whole health care for Veterans, including moral repair and spiritual development, indicated by greater moral engagement, awareness, trust, and commitment to live in service to values like honesty, compassion, fairness and responsibility. The intended long-term outcome is moral and spiritual development of the whole community, including, perhaps, a greater integration of Veterans into society, a responsible use of the US military, a greater reverence for all life on this fragile earth, and the promotion of human flourishing. Frequently asked questions No. The ceremony includes elements that might best be described as ritual and/ or spiritual practices , like readings, moments for silent reflection, music, guided movement, and handwashing. Yet these are not particular to any one religious tradition. No. The chaplain who leads the ceremony will give people the option to observe or participate in any or all parts of the ceremony. People are invited to participate in the different elements of the ceremony \"as you are willing and able.\" Peoples choice to observe or participate is respected. Absolutely! The success of our ceremony depends upon people like you showing up with open minds and open hearts and a willingness to engage and share responsibility. Our veterans have often remarked how touched they are when ordinary citizens with no personal connection to veterans attend. Tags About the organizer [The "}
