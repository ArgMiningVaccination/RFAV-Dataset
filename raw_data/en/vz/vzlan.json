DIY Turmeric Yogurt Face Mask Why Make Your Own Face Mask? Many beauty products are filled with chemicals and preservatives and are simply not sustainable for the environment with plastic packaging. With a homemade face mask, you know exactly what you're putting in it. You control the ingredients and know with certainty what you place on your body. Making face masks at home is fun, easy, and cheap! My husband and I like to make them during our weekly self-care Sunday evenings. We enjoy the relaxing time together, and it bonds us. You can make this face mask for yourself or a fun girl's night in! And the yellow makes for cool photos for the gram!

[Turmeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric) This flowering plant is native to the Indian subcontinent. Predominantly used in cooking, this root also packs a punch when used in skincare products. It is anti-inflammatory, calms redness and blemishes. It's no wonder that Indian brides and grooms use it before their weddings. Turmeric has been used for centuries in [Ayurveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda) and [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine). This is my husband and me before our wedding during the [Pithi](https://www.14gaam.com/pithi-ceremony.htm) ceremony, a traditional Gujarati pre-wedding event. Our families brushed the mask on our skin for good luck and healthy, glowing skin! Yogurt: Yogurt is a great gentle cleanser for the skin. The lactic acid found in yogurt also is a natural exfoliator. Yogurt also provides excellent moisturization and hydration, keeping your skin supple. Fun Fact: My grandmother only washed her hair with yogurt because it was natural and hydrating. Honey: Honey does wonders for the skin, and many commercial beauty products use this ingredient. Honey is not only antiseptic and anti-inflammatory; it also is a humectant. Meaning it locks in moisture. This powerhouse keeps skin soft and cleans bacteria to help keep acne at bay. Lemon Essential Oil: Lemon is a great brightening ingredient as it naturally lightens the skin. Perfect for evening skin tone and hyperpigmentation. Lemon also helps combat acne. One thing to note is that lemon causes photosensitivity. So you'll want to stay out of the sun when using this on your skin. Always protect your skin with sunscreen when exposed to the sun. When using essential oils, you'll want to use pure unadulterated oils that are free from chemicals and additives. Fragrance and aromatherapy oils are not the same as the ones you put on your skin. I get my oils from [Young Living](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/c/essential-oil-products?msclkid=917efa34ed1f184723c39ad490b73bd8&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search%20-%20YL%20-%20General%20-%20NM%20-%20US%20%5BExact%5D%20-%20B&utm_term=young%20living&utm_content=Young%20Living%20Essential%20Oils) and [Plant Therapy](https://www.planttherapy.com/?msclkid=e7880eb7c6671b8b78b46e57bba3592e&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CPCS%20-%20BR%20Search&utm_term=plant%20therapy&utm_content=Plant%20Therapy%20-%20Exact). Tea Tree Essential Oil: Tea tree oil is great for helping clean the skin and to fight acne. This [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2145499/) found tea tree oil to be as effective as benzoyl peroxide, a common acne treatment ingredient. How To Make Turmeric Yogurt Face Mask at Home Ingredients: 1 tbsp yogurt (I like to use greek yogurt) 1/2 tbsp [Honey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMQD3VS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CMQD3VS&linkCode=as2&tag=bybindi-20&linkId=392267b6585a57ddda180f2f316c65cb) 1 drop [Lemon Essential Oil](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/lemon-essential-oil)* 1 drop Tea Tree Essential Oil* *Essential oils are potent. Always test before using to check for reactions. Follow proper dilution safety for your skin. Directions 1.) Mix turmeric and honey together in a small mixing bowl. 2.) Add honey and mix until incorporated. 3.) Combine lemon and tea tree essential oil. 4.) Apply to the face with a brush or clean fingers. Avoid eye area. I use a brush to avoid contaminating the mask with bacteria from my hands. 5.) Leave on for 10-15 minutes. 6.) Wash off with warm water and a washcloth. Leftovers I keep leftovers in the fridge for a week as it is perishable. Also, keeping the mask cool provides a nice sensation when you apply it to your face. It really feels great on hot summer days. I like to use this face mask 1-2 times a week. You can also use this as a gentle face cleanse. Just apply to your face in the shower and leave it on for a couple of minutes before washing off in a circular manner. Turmeric Face Mask Application Notes and Tips: Turmeric stains everything yellow, and it's incredibly potent. When using this mask, make sure to wear old clothes you don't mind staining. When washing your face, be sure to use a darker color washcloth. Or designate a towel for use with this mask. After using this mask, your skin may show a yellow tint. Don't worry; this isn't permanent! There are a couple of ways to combat turmeric stains on your face. 1.) Use a washcloth to take off the mask. This also helps with extra exfoliation. 2.) Dab a cotton ball soaked with witch hazel and swipe across your face. Whatever residue is leftover will go away the next day. I like to use this mask at night for this reason. Don't use this if you need to see people after. Unless you like the yellow look, then go for it! I hope you enjoy this recipe for a quick DIY turmeric yogurt face mask for glowing skin.
