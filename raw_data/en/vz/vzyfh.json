Enhancing the spiritual energy between two people is a part of our mental and physical health. When we isolate, we cut off this energy and learn how to build it. You can do it. Most relationship tools focus on communication skills. These skills help us relate to people at work and in society. These skills do not deal with the spiritual aspect of relationships. We need strong spiritual connections. They are the key to health. They build strong relationships and enhance physical, mental, and [spiritual health](https://seekerproject4se.org/2023/06/07/a-holistic-health-routine-nine-elements-of-daily-spiritual-practice-developing-a-daily-spiritual-practice/). The key is learning how to create strong spiritual links. The Essence of The Soul To understand spiritual energy, we must first look at [what the energy of the spirit means](https://seekerproject4se.org/2023/08/13/what-does-living-in-the-spirit-mean-being-in-the-spirit-means-living-in-the-spirit-means-discovering-your-shadow-self-and-live-in-the-spirit/). A general definition of energy is the momentum derived from fuel used to power an engine. Here, we are concerned [with the power of the connection](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/02/21/connecting-with-the-universal-mind-what-is-the-universal-mind-universal-consciousness-the-mind-body-soul-connection/) that links people. The energy we are talking about has nothing to do with elements of personality. It is the energy connection with our soul or [\"The Observer\"](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/04/04/what-is-true-freedom-watching-the-thinker-observing-the-thinker-freedom-starts-with-you/) of our awareness. The energy of our spiritual nature is the essence of the soul. The Observer is the person you talk to inside your head. It is that aspect of awareness which experiences your [dreams](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/12/04/dream-interpretation-dream-symbolism-interpreting-dreams-spiritual-symbols-meaning/). This experience is not a [pure reflection](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/02/13/through-the-minds-eye-your-eyes-only-see-what-the-geography-of-the-mind-allows/) of who we are because all experience happens within the mind, and Ego connects our bodies to consciousness. Still, behind this tainted [window](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/08/13/what-do-windows-symbolize-the-symbolism-of-windows-and-doors-portals-of-consciousness-four-windows-of-self/) of observation sits our Observer, our soul or spirit. The Observer is our unique [vibrational](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/10/10/how-to-raise-your-vibration-spiritual-frequencies-and-vibrations-determine-your-vibrational-frequency/) signature. There isn't anyone or anything like you in the entire universe, yet we are a part of the whole. You will create strong, healthy relationships if you know how to connect with this energy. The Spiritual Energy Between Two People If we want to strengthen the connection, both people need to be on the same [vibrational frequency](https://seekerproject4se.org/2023/07/28/dark-and-light-energy-ley-lines-world-energy-grid-ley-lines-and-vibrational-geometry/). Thankfully, there are tools available to do just that. A [mantra](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/08/16/expand-your-mind-advanced-tools-of-consciousness-catalog-of-mantras-and-sutras/) is one tool that transcends the Ego level of the mind. So, using almost any mantra will align people together to some extent. We can base relationships on external interests or intrinsic bonds. If we create a connection based on interests, these things can change. Hobbies and jobs can create opportunities to meet people, but these are not always permanent. It's important to remember that the spiritual energy between two people [ebbs and flows](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/07/02/the-spiritual-meaning-of-ebb-and-flow-in-life-changing-spiritual-tide/). A soul bond is a more powerful link than physical attraction or intellectual interests. A soul [connection is a powerful spiritual](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/11/11/out-of-sight-but-not-out-of-mind-a-soul-connection/) conduit. A mantra is an easy way to create or enhance this kind of energy. A mantra connects the essence of the soul with infinite consciousness. If we use the energy of our spiritual essence to anchor the relationship, it does not matter if there are differences in opinion. It doesn't matter what [religious or philosophical beliefs](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/02/24/the-pros-and-cons-of-religion-or-the-dangers-of-organized-religion-danger-of-make-believe-in-god/) each of you may have. The right mantra takes us beyond these superficial issues and strengthens the bond on the [level of consciousness](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/09/08/what-are-the-ten-levels-of-consciousness/). The Dual Aspects of Mind and Spirit \"By mastering both aspects of our being, we remember not only how to think, but what to think. What I'm clear about now is that the mind is a tool, a mechanism, and the soul provides the fuel for that machine. The less fuel you use, the more inefficiently the engine will operate. On the other hand, if your soul fills your mind with spiritual energy, you will be Mind-Full - and the workings of this engine can produce miracles.\" \u2014 Neale Donald Walsch The problem arises when we mistake the machine of the mind for who we are. Our modern culture emphasizes the body and mind while ignoring our spirit and soul. Once we can put things in proper perspective, we learn to do what Mr. Walsch suggests. When two people meditate nearby, we can feel the energy. It connects our soul or being with the source of life. \"The natural essence of the Soul is being.\" \u2014 Christelle Koornhof Theron We have difficulty understanding our soul or being because we focus outwardly on the physical world. \"Experience shows that Being is the essential, basic nature of the mind; but, since it commonly remains in tune with the senses projecting outwards toward the manifested realms of creation, the mind misses or fails to appreciate its own essential nature, just as the eyes are unable to see themselves.\" \u2014 [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi] Meditating with other people magnifies the experience, which is one way we know on an experiential level how connected we are. It's the reason many cultures use a circle as a focal point. It is easy to see how this evolved from people gathering around a fire for warmth, only to discover something more between people than meets the eye. The essence of the soul desires to connect with life. When people sit and [meditate](https://seekerproject4se.org/2023/05/28/why-everyone-should-meditate-unlock-your-inner-power-practicing-meditation-techniques/) together, this is a way of [aligning](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/02/08/skill-set-of-proper-body-alignment-is-everything/) on a fundamental level\u2014the coherence increase if they use the same mantra. The Maharishi effect is the positive impact [resulting from people meditating](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/06/13/your-thoughts-become-your-reality-think-positive/) in groups. It reduces crime rates and other negative social phenomena. They named it after Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He is the first to bring awareness of these benefits to the West. \"Contemplate yourself, surrounded by the conditions you wish to produce and know you can attract [divine energy]to help you. Dormant forces come alive when you put your attention on what you intend to manifest and when you stay connected to your source of [well-being], your source of kindness, and your source that excludes no one.\" \u2014 Wayne Dyer [Modern culture](https://seekerproject4se.org/2023/09/05/why-do-you-get-tunnel-vision-what-gives-you-tunnel-vision-culture-is-a-mass-hallucination/) capitalizes on our instincts to sell us things. When most people think of energy between two people, they equate it with sexual attraction. But this is not the energy that we are referring to here. Physical attraction and common interests can bring people together. However, being attracted to someone does not ensure the relationship's success. Because you share the same interests or values does not mean you can build a lasting friendship or relationship. It takes more than sex appeal to build a healthy relationship or friendship. Common interests help, but interests can change. A friendship built on superficial things fades and falls apart. The spiritual energy between two people is a much greater force than physical attraction. It is possible to cultivate the connection of physical attraction. However, those with a soul or [spirit](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/03/24/what-is-the-soul-does-the-soul-exist-proofs-of-the-human-spirit/) link always share a strong energy connection. The moment we meet them, we realize that a kinship already exists. Some people call this a soulmate connection. However, this has been morphed to mean a romantic attachment, but this interpretation is incorrect. Someone who is a soulmate is often a friend, associate, or colleague. \"A soul connection is a resonance between two people who respond to the essential beauty of each other's individual natures, behind their facades, and who connect on this deeper level.\" - John Welwood Strengthening The Spiritual Energy Between Two People If you want to enhance your spiritual connection with another person, there are several things you can do. The glue that holds any group together starts with strengthening the bonds between each person. 1) Be present. Don't take friendships or relationships for granted. When you are with them, really \"show up\" and give them your attention. Being with friends is an excellent time to practice being fully present and living in the moment. You can tell when someone cares enough to listen and pay attention. 2) Mediate at the same time. Using the same meditation together enhances our connection with others. When you become [grounded](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/10/28/grounding-techniques-what-are-grounding-exercises-why-is-grounding-important/) through meditation, you naturally improve your relationship with those engaging in the practice. We recommend Japa or Transcendental Meditation because it is the best meditation process to reach the [4th state](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/04/06/practice-of-sahaj-samadhi-meditation-sahaj-samadhi-yoga-the-4th-state-of-consciousness-the-benefits-of-samadhi/) of pure consciousness. Some mantras have a dramatic [effect on the spiritual](https://seekerproject4se.org/2023/08/09/12-symptoms-of-spiritual-awakening-spiritual-ascension-stages-of-spiritual-ascension-and-spiritual-transition/) energy between two people. 3) Simultaneously engage in other spiritual training or practices. [Shared knowledge](https://seekerproject4se.org/mission-and-vision/mission-one/) creates common bonds. The [Enneagram](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/07/30/the-enneagram-personality-profile-cognitive-science-tool/), the [Repeating Question](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/02/23/the-repeating-question-repetitive-question-subconscious-mind-exercises/) Exercise, and [Comparative Analysis](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/05/18/core-beliefs-worksheet-understanding-core-beliefs-core-beliefs-test-comparative-analysis-comparative-religious-study/) are all excellent tools for this goal. So too, are many forms of the healing arts. 4) Volunteer together. Find a humanitarian or environmental cause you both share. You always receive double the return in positive energy when helping others. When you help, you express [ kindness and compassion](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/07/14/unblock-your-way-to-oneness-our-journey-to-oneness-achieving-oneness-with-higher-self/). When you do this together, you are building a spiritual energy bond. 5) Share your deepest secrets. [Sharing the vulnerable parts of our life](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/10/05/sharing-your-life-story-with-others-five-great-reasons-to-share-your-life-story/) and emotions can build bonds. Make sure the sharing is equal and honest for both parties. If one person feels the other is not sharing everything to the extent they are, it can create conflict instead of increasing the bond. 6) Manage healthy expectations and limits. No matter how significant, one person can and should not meet all your needs for friendship. Don't extract all of your needs from one person. There is no limit on the number of close friends you can have, but you should limit your expectations of one person. The key here is to diversify your friends, interests, and hobbies so that you have new information to share. 7) Handle Disagreements with respect. Eventually, even the best friends will have different opinions about something important. Working through these differences can strengthen the bond of trust. Here are some tips to help manage these rough spots: - - Stop the discussion and take a break if tempers flare. - - Don't make blaming statements. When discussing issues that affect you, use I versus You statements. Instead of saying, you make me angry, when say I get angry when. This slight difference makes all the difference. Instead of blaming the other person for your feelings, you are telling them how you feel about something. - - Don't bring up the past or other issues. Stick one thing at a time. - - If you make a mistake, admit it as soon as possible, and apologize. In Conclusion We are social beings, and our relationships bring health and [happiness](https://seekerproject4se.org/2022/04/12/practice-the-art-of-living-what-does-art-of-living-mean/). But relationships are dynamic, just like the weather. Learn to enjoy the sunshine and the rain. "}
