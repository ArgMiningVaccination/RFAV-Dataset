I keep an array of Wishgarden products on hand, and find they offer similar but unique benefits. I sometimes combine more than one, or I stagger them throughout my day if I'm feeling the need for an extra somethin-somethin. These products are consistently fantastic!! I use half the dosage in my morning water and it keeps me going the whole day. I don't have any side effects and can sleep at night. It gives me an even keel of energy for the day. As with nearly every other supplement which I use, I have used this product in conjunction with others--'energy-boosters' such as vitamin B12--and would have to say that it indeed contributes to the sense of overall well-being that helps us to 'be on our A-game' on an ongoing basis. I have been taking these herbs for decades in supplement capsule form- how fantastic to have them all together in a tincture! Really does give a pep in my step and clears that morning fog! I am not a morning person & this has given me the boost I need when I wake up to get me going. Ready to buy my next bottle! It was nice to get this as a free gift, but I haven't had time to try it. I have, however, been very happy with my order stocking up on my go-to rescue, Digestive Rescue, formerly called \"Mo-Betta Belly\". This stuff is magic and fast-acting and I don't go anywhere without it in my purse. A subtle lift to energy and focus Gentle and calming herbs to invigorate and awaken the senses. This is such a great combination of herbs in one tincture. I am a huge coffee/green tea/energy drink consumer. I drink this first thing before my morning coffee, usually another dose before heading to work, then after lunch if I'm feeling sluggish. Better than coffee for avoiding an acidic tummy, and giving you energy without feeling foggy headed. Please don't stop making this! I felt the difference the first time I took it. "}
