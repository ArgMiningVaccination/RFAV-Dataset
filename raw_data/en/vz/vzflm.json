SPIRIT is [widely endorsed](https://www.spirit-statement.org/about-spirit/spirit-endorsement/) as an international standard for trial protocols. The recommendations are outlined in a [33-item checklist](https://www.spirit-statement.org/title/) and [figure](https://www.spirit-statement.org/schedule-of-enrolment-interventions-and-assessments/). Important details for each checklist item can be found in the [Explanation & Elaboration](https://www.spirit-statement.org/publications-downloads/) paper, or by browsing the menu on the left. The minimum list of items is by no means exhaustive; particular types of trials warrant additional protocol elements. By providing evidence-based guidance on key issues to address in a protocol, SPIRIT is intended to facilitate the drafting of protocols and improve their completeness. High-quality protocols can promote proper trial implementation, reduce avoidable protocol amendments, and facilitate full appraisal of the study's scientific and ethical considerations. "}
