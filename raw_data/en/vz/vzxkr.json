Healing crystals and stones are touted as ancient forms of medicine used in Buddhism, Hinduism, and other cultures and religions throughout history. They have been found by scientists and investigators in different places throughout the world for many years, just like [fossils](https://whalerslocker.com/blogs/news/understanding-different-types-of-fossils). The first cases of crystal healing are tied to Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, Greece, and Rome. People used to include gemstones in \"magically healing\" formulas through time to heal physical, emotional, and spiritual ailments. Many ancient uses and beliefs about healing crystals and stones are still used in spiritual practices today. Now, people cover their necks, homes, cars, and bags with these gems to keep the good vibes around them and protect against negativity. Crystals aren't a substitute for a trip to the doctor, but people can still use them to aid in the process of physical healing. People love to have the positive energy of healing crystals and stones surrounding them and even use them for things like meditation, too. Even though there was never, and still is not scientific evidence behind the use of healing crystals, their metaphysical properties shine through and keep people gravitating towards them. What makes healing crystals so attractive is their diversity. There are tons of different types of stones, and each one has its unique healing quality. For example, amethyst is known to bring peace and tranquility, while smoky quartz ignites passion. Once you understand the purpose behind healing crystals and stones and how to use them, you can start forming a collection to fit every situation in your life. Top 8 Myths About Healing Crystals Amazingly, so many people are on their healing journey and eager to share their stories, but not every spiritual influencer is an expert on the art of healing crystals and stones. There are many misconceptions out there about the proper ways to obtain, use, and cleanse these stones. The most common myths about healing crystals are: - You can heal with crystals on your own. - Crystals are magical rocks. - The prettier and more polished the crystal is, the more powerful it will be. - There is only one way to cleanse your stones. - All crystals can be stored together. - There is a maximum amount of gems you should use at once. - There is only one specific way to connect with healing stones. - The crystal does the healing, not you. We'll debunk all these rumors and set the record straight, so you know exactly how to use your healing crystals and stones. You Can Heal With Crystals On Your Own Since it's a form of alternative medicine, you need to seek help from an expert, just like you would a doctor. Some holistic doctors or spiritual teachers will help you along the journey of healing using crystals. You can also read tons of books to learn more about the history of crystal healing and how to use it in your modern life. Crystals are Magical Rocks As much as we'd love to tell you healing crystals are a little piece of magic, that's not really the case. Just like any other form of healing, it takes time to see results pan out in your life. Just because you bought a rose quartz crystal today doesn't necessarily mean you'll meet the love of your life tomorrow. Remember to have patience and be realistic about your goals and wishes on your healing journey. You can use gems as a tool and a resource to enhance the positivity around you, but don't count on them to completely transform your life. The Prettier and More Polished the Crystal Is, the More Powerful it Will Be A giant, sparkly gem will probably catch your eye over a smaller, dull one, and we don't blame you. However, don't let the aesthetic of the stone cloud your judgment. The beauty of a crystal has nothing to do with the energy it emits. Many people also think that you need to keep your healing crystals in polished, pristine condition for them to stay powerful. While it's a great idea to give your crystals a good cleanse and polish every once in a while, doing so won't change their effectiveness or power. As long as you keep your healing crystals and stones safe and treat them with love and care, they will continue to spread positive vibes. There Is Only One Way to Cleanse Your Stones Speaking of crystal cleansing, of course there are myths out there about how you should do it! While it's not completely necessary to cleanse or polish your stones, doing so can keep them shiny and give their energy a little refresh. Some people believe that there is only one proper way to cleanse all of your gems. Since each healing crystal is different and requires unique maintenance and care, there are actually tons of various ways to cleanse them. One method that is universal for all stones is cleansing in the moonlight. Full moons in particular help to clear away old energy from the rock and invite new vibrations in. Sunlight can also cleanse some healing crystals and stones but is too harsh for vibrant ones like amethyst. Another standard method of cleansing crystals is with water. You can use running water, saltwater, or [moon water](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a34415032/full-moon-water/), but this technique shouldn't be used for soft, porous healing crystals like selenite and kyanite. All Crystals Can Be Stored Together Let us preface this by saying; the way you store your healing crystals is entirely up to you and what works for your journey. However, most people believe you shouldn't store certain gems with others. Some stones are delicate and can scratch easily. The healing crystals to not store together: - quartz - fluorite - apatite - calcite If you want to preserve them for as long as possible, you can wrap them individually in small bags. Other crystals can get damaged in sunlight or water and should be kept in a safe place. If you have crystals with iron, like malachite and magnetite, remember that they could oxidize and rust over time. Consider the qualities of the healing crystals and stones in your collection, but don't stress about where you store them. There Is a Maximum Amount of Gems You Should Use at Once Sure, certain crystal combinations are more or less powerful than others, but that doesn't mean you should limit yourself on the number of gems you collect. Whether you want to keep your healing crystals on display or put them in a box for safekeeping and use them during things like meditation and yoga, you can use as many as you want. Each healing crystal and stone has a unique energy, so the more the merrier! If [Heidi and Spencer Pratt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24OH4TY1ETU) can fill their entire house with crystals and heal themselves, so can we, right? While people form their own beliefs about combining different stones, there are no defined \"bad\" crystal combinations out there. Since every stone is meant to keep vibrations high and get rid of bad energy, their unique qualities can work together. There Is Only One Specific Way to Connect With Healing Stones If you scroll through one too many holistic blog posts, you might find yourself a little confused about how to use the healing crystals and stones in your collection effectively. You will find a hundred different \"right\" or \"best\" ways to connect with your gem and bring its energy into your life. In reality, the most beneficial way to connect to a crystal can only be determined by you. Everyone's healing journey is different, so each person needs to find the best way to incorporate healing stones into their life. Some people love to keep stones under their pillow, on the nightstand, or in a special location at home to keep their space and energy preserved. Others wear healing crystals and stones in jewelry, which carry their energy with them. You can also incorporate gems into your meditation or yoga practice to enhance your mind, body, and soul connection. As long as you feel the positive vibrations, it doesn't matter how you choose to use your healing crystal. The Crystal Does the Healing, Not You You might wish that buying a healing crystal would make all your wishes come true overnight, but that's not really how healing works. Crystals are meant to enhance the positivity around you and protect you from bad vibes, but the real power lies within you. For gems to work their \"magic,\" you have to work yours. Believe in yourself, be patient, and manifest your desires. Your collection of healing crystals and stones will be there to guide you along every step of the way.

They Cleanse and Clear Your Chakras If you're on a spiritual healing journey, you might've heard about the seven chakras. They are various focal points throughout the body that have been used in a variety of ancient practices.

You can tailor your crystal cleansing routine to fit your needs, depending on how often you use them and how concerned you are about their preservation.
