Dry needling is not acupuncture, it's an evidence-based treatment from western neuroanatomy that helps relieve and reduce pain and dysfunction in the neck, shoulder, elbows, and arms, legs and back. Trigger points are localized hyper-irritated hard \"knots\" in the skeletal muscle that radiate pain and can be sensitive to the touch. After long periods of time without treatment, these trigger points may cause significant pain. Physical Therapists use dry needling to help release or deactivate trigger points to relieve pain, reduce muscle pain and improve range of motion.
