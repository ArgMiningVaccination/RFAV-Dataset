For some, certain symptoms and conditions can persist for weeks to months, or even longer, after illness. Post-COVID conditions are found more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness, but anyone who has had COVID-19 can experience post-COVID conditions. Persisting conditions may occur in individuals of all ages and ethnicities. There is no test to diagnose post-COVID conditions, and people may have a wide variety of symptoms that could come from other health problems. This can make it difficult for healthcare providers to recognize post-COVID conditions. Your healthcare provider considers a diagnosis of post-COVID conditions based on your health history, including if you had a diagnosis of COVID-19 either by a positive test or by symptoms or exposure, as well as doing a health examination. The symptoms are similar to those reported by people with ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome). Most people' symptoms slowly improve with time. However, for some people, post-COVID conditions can last weeks, months, or longer after COVID-19 illness and can sometimes result in disability. The best way to prevent post-COVID conditions is to avoid getting COVID-19, even if you have already had it one or more times. There is evidence that being vaccinated against COVID-19 can also reduce your likelihood of experiencing long-term symptoms. The following resources have been developed to help individuals with Post-COVID conditions obtain the treatment, care, support, and information they need.
