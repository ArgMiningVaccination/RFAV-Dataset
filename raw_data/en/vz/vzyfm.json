Regardless, these treatments enjoyed enormous popularity. Followers had lost faith in the ability of doctors to cure using heroic treatments, and unlike heroic methods, alternative medicine did not appear to do harm. Rebelling against the aristocracy of the medical profession, 19th century Jacksonian America believed every man could be his own doctor which led most states to repeal their licensing laws by the 1840s. Many alternative medical treatments were promoted in home medical guides that allowed the public to treat itself and bypass the established medical profession entirely.

Homeopathy was one of the first popular medical movements that could be practiced by the novice at home. It was founded by German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), and gained an American following in the 1830s. The movement was based on Hahnemann's theory simila similibus curantur: treating disease with extremely small doses of drugs that produced symptoms similar to those of the offending disease. The theory held that the lesser symptoms brought on by the weak drugs replaced the stronger symptoms of the original disease and provided comfort for the patient. Not surprisingly, patients preferred this treatment to severe heroic methods. The biggest boost to homeopathy's popularity came during the cholera epidemic of 1832, when conventional bleeding and purging devastated those already weakened by the wasting disease. Homeopathic treatments appeared to cure simply because they lowered the death rate by not further debilitating the patient. Because homeopathic drugs were taken in such small doses, little harm came from them, and they were therefore easy to use in the home without physician assistance. Many homeopathic kits were packaged and sold by mail order or over the counter.

Household libraries contained books like Our Home Doctor, or Gunn's New Domestic Physician. Common in these books were formulas for healing teas and poultices. Some of the books advocated a particular theory, while others described several medical theories: Our Family Physician(Stout, 1886), carefully prescribes the allopathic, homeopathic, hydropathic, eclectic, and herbal (Thomsonian) remedy for each ailment listed. All home medical guides were optimistic in outlook, offering \"cures\" for the likes of baldness and cancer along with treatments for more common afflictions like bee stings.

Introductory essays offered advice on the proper conduct of mothers toward children and husbands toward wives. Gunn's New Domestic Physician begins with two hundred pages on topics like \"The Passions,\" \"The Dread Rich,\" versus Warm Baths.\" Under the heading \"To Husbands,\" Dr. Gunn urged consideration of a wife's \"peculiar tender heart,\" especially if she was in a \"delicate situation.\" Of course, the guides offered frightening examples of what would happen if such advice was not heeded.
