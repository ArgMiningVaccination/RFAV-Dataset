The article, entitled \"Fertility Preservation in Women,\" was authored by two physicians from Belgium's Society for Infertility Research, who reviewed the expansive body of research on fertility preservation to conclude that oocyte vitrification, the method used at Michigan Reproductive Medicine to cryopreserve eggs, provides the best outcomes. NEJM sets the \"gold standard\" for biomedical research and is the most widely read, cited, and influential medical journal in the world. Here are a few important takeaways from the article: For women preserving their fertility for personal reasons or \"benign\" medical reasons, egg freezing is the best strategy. \"Benign\" medical reasons are conditions that aren't cancer but might affect fertility, like endometriosis.

According to the article, \"of all the available means of fertility preservation, oocyte cryopreservation by means of vitrification (very rapid freezing) provides the highest yield... When fertility preservation is carried out for benign indications or personal reasons, oocyte cryopreservation is clearly the highest-yield strategy.\" Learn more about Michigan Reproductive Medicine's [superior vitrification protocol.](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/what-we-do/infertility-treatments/fertility-preservation/) Egg freezing helps preserve more options for future fertility than embryo freezing\u2014which is especially important for single women. As the authors state, egg freezing \"gives women the possibility of reproductive autonomy (i.e., they do not need a male partner or donor sperm to create embryos).\" Age is really important, and for women who freeze eggs before they're 35, success rates are high. According to the article, \"women should be encouraged to freeze their eggs at a younger age for the best chance of having a biologic child.\" The success rate for women who froze at least 10 eggs before they were 35 was twice as high as the success rates for older women who froze the same number of eggs, the authors note.

Data suggests that for women under 35 who freeze 10-15 eggs, success rates\u2014AKA chance of at least one pregnancy later\u2014are 60-80+%.
