Report all accidents and near misses. Report any symptoms which match the pathogen. Report any new medical conditions. 15Daily Schedules It was important to have a schedule in order to maintain a safe, structured environment. Staff reported to the unit15 -30 minutes prior to scheduled shift, depending on level of PPE required. Discussion of daily schedule took place during the family huddle. 16Standard Operating Procedures in the Serious Communicable Disease Unit Provide consistency in how procedures are performed in the unit Allows staff to identify possible deviations when performing the procedure Gave staff confidence knowing they were performing procedures consistentlySCDU SOPs The care team train and validate competency in the following areas: Donning and doffing of PPE Utilization of the \"Buddy System\" Waste management protocols Decontamination and containment protocols Specimen handling for diagnostic testingStandard Operating Procedures Donning \u2014patient room and anteroom and anteroom Toileting \u2014ambulatory and non -ambulatory patient Waste management Spill clean up Needle stick/exposure Creating chemical mats Obtaining and handling lab specimens X-ray process Transferring equipment between patient rooms Cleaning durable medical equipmentemoryhealthcare.orgThe Critical Role of Nursing The ability to provide high -level nursing care and supportive care made a significant impact 24/7 one -on-one nurses allowed for rapid response to changes and adjustment of care Ability to support patients in nutrition, physical therapy, and self care Emotional support Family support Patient -and Family -Centered Model of CarePatient EvaluationPhysical Examination Palpation Slightly diminished by extra gloves Inspection Can be diminished by face shield or goggles Especially if eye protection becomes foggy Plastic can occasionally distort vision Auscultation No skin exposed means layer of Tyvek or Tychem between stethoscope and ear drumClinical Signs and Symptomsemoryhealthcare.orgClinical Characteristics of EVD Acute infection starts as a non - specific febrile illness Fever, severe headache, muscle pain, malaise Progression to include GI symptoms diarrhea and vomiting May appear 2 -21 days after exposure 8-10 days most common Courtesy of Pierre Rollin, CDCClinical Symptoms and Duration 1234567891011121314 Fever Myalgias Chills Headache Sore throat Abdominal pain Diarrhea Vomiting Rash Bleeding Decreased urine MOF/Deathemoryhealthcare.orgClinical Care = Supportive Care No proven therapeutics Unclear availability of any experimental agents Limited safety or efficacy data in humans BUT, we received SIGNIFICANT support and advice from CDC, FDA, and medical and scientific colleagues throughout the world Medical Management Supportive Care Fluid management Electrolyte replacement Life supportFluid Balance Fluid Balanceemoryhealthcare.orgThe Impact of Electrolytes Our patients had MARKED electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional deficiencies Hypokalemia , hypocalcemia and hyponatremia Required both intravenous and oral replacement Used oral nutritional supplements including nutritional drinks high in easily absorbed proteins, minerals and vitamins Laboratory testing for chemistries was critical to provide supportive careemoryhealthcare.orgMonitoring Virologic Status With the help of the CDC, we monitored ebola in blood Progressive declines in viral loads that correlated with improvements in clinical condition Had very low level of nucleic acid detection for several days despite resolution of symptoms 373839Temp (C)25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 080016002400320040004800560064007200 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28EBOV qRT-PCR (Ct Therapy Mechanism Status Convalescent plasma Provide anti -EBOV antibodies Studies have not shown a clear benefit Has been used in multiple evacuated patients in this outbreak Hyperimmune globulin from immunized animals or previously infected humansConcentrated plasma to provide high titers of neutralizing antibodyNot currently available.
