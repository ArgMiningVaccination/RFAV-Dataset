Its ability to do so develops over time, so it's normal for children to experience mild infections like common colds more frequently than adults. Zinc reduces the frequency of children's colds Zinc supports healthy immune system function and helps reduce the frequency with which children catch common colds. In children whose diets contain insufficient zinc, taking a supplement also supports a healthy appetite. Astragalus: supports immune system health in traditional Chinese medicine In Chinese medicine, Astragalus is traditionally used to help improve children's immunity. It also helps reduce the frequency with which children catch common colds, according to traditional use in Chinese medicine. Jade Windscreen Formula Astragalus is the 'chief' or 'emperor' herb in a centuries-old herbal combination called Jade Windscreen Formula (Yu Ping Feng San)1, which is traditionally used to support defensive qi to help reduce the frequency of common colds. In addition to astragalus, Jade Windscreen Formula contains the herbs white atractylodes and fang feng. In Chinese medicine, white atractylodes is traditionally used to nourish the spleen, and is therefore taken to relieve children's loss of appetite. Fang feng, which is also known as wind protector, is traditionally used in TCM to expel wind-heat from the body. (This traditional Chinese terminology describes a symptom pattern that's associated with conditions that arise from outside the body and involve the rapid onset of symptoms, some of which are traditionally considered 'hot' in nature).
