Exchange \u00a3144 per person Join [Geet Fateh Kaur,](https://puravidayourlife.com/geet-fateh/) Medicine Woman, Shamanic Practitioner, Energy Healer & Sound Alchemist for an intimate Healing Ceremony. Working with the beautiful healing modalities of Ceremonial Cacao, Quantum Healing Energy, Sacred Shamanic Drum and Alchemy Crystal Singing Bowls. Sacred Ceremonial Cacao is a beautiful, gentle, heart healing medicine that can help bring clarity where we are feeling unclear, focus where we are feeling scattered and clearing where we are stagnated and stuck. This medicine helps us access realms that are often unavailable to us when we are too caught up in the head and enables connection with the subconscious realms where deep seated healing can take place. With Cacao we drop down from the head into the heart where we can navigate with feeling instead of thought. Cacao helps disperse any blockages around the heart and coupled with the vibrations from the healing sounds we experience healing at a cellular level to rebalance the physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies. Cacao is an incredibly gentle, heart opening plant medicine that encourages us to open, soften, release, and heal. It can enable a space that quietens the noise so that we're able to listen to our own inner guidance more clearly. Cacao contains a high concentration of antioxidants, is rich in minerals and the active ingredient Theobromine acts as a mild stimulant and mood enhancer. This intimate healing ceremony will give us the space and time to tune into the stillness within to connect to our deepest intuition, release any blockages that may be present, bring clarity to any areas that need our attention and help us enjoy a deep sense of peace and well-being. Sound Healing is energy medicine; processing of emotions, restore a sense of calm, improve digestion, enhance life's pleasures, detoxify and strengthen our organs, and so much more... Energy and Sound Therapy is deeply relaxing and profoundly therapeutic for your mind, body, and soul. The vibrational frequencies enter deep within the body and work at a cellular level to restore balance and enhance a greater state of wellbeing. Helping you to improve your health and wellbeing, getting rid of those niggling aches and pains. Reduce your stress levels and anxiety, helping you to sleep better, elevate your mood and develop a deeper connection to you in a more natural and balanced state.

Geet Fateh Xxx About your facilitator: Here's me [Geet Fateh Kaur](https://puravidayourlife.com/geet-fateh/) and [Pura Vida Your Life](https://puravidayourlife.com/), what I do today is a world away from the 27 years I spent working in Human Resources in the Corporate world and building my own HR Consultancy. I have been on quite a journey to get here - the story of me - growing up in the 70's with not a lot of money, trying to find employment in the 80's, being a teenage mum in the 80's, being a single mum in the 90's, building a career in the 00's... leaving the corporate world and a successful HR Career to HR Director for a Global Company, to start out on my own in HR and then leaving all that behind me to stand in my truth today as a Medicine Woman, Shamanic Practitioner, Energy Healer & Sound Alchemist (yes, this is my actual 'job') This is ME! All of this brought failures and successes... I've lived in poverty, and I've lived in prosperity... I've been married and divorced in my early 20's, lost two babies in two ectopic pregnancies in my early 20's, gone through IVF treatment in desperation for more children, loved with all of my heart, been cheated on, had failed relationships, had my car repossessed, fallen into debt and almost had my home repossessed twice.... I thought all of that broke me. BUT it made me, none of that made me a lesser person - it made me human.... I've struggled, I've been blocked, bullied, abused, traumatised, broken, heartbroken, challenged by adversity, I've been to my own version of hell.... And dragged myself out of the darkness of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts and plans to end it all, stamped out addictions to over consume food, alcohol, drugs, and material objects, damaging decisions and broken habits that kept me prisoner in a self-fulfilling prophecy of self-loathing, and silencing the all-consuming thoughts that enslaved me into suffering and turmoil. This is why I AM, and who I AM today, all these 'experiences' - the story of me - means that I understand YOU, I totally empathise with what YOU'RE going through or have gone through... I get YOU... I SEE YOU, I HEAR YOU, I FEEL YOU. This is why it's such a joy to welcome beautiful souls to my offerings in Coventry & Warwickshire and across the UK for Group and 1-2-1 sessions and ceremonies.. It's an honour to be in-service and of-service, to help people to turn a corner and transform their lives. This is why I pour so much love, care, and attention for each person in all of my offerings.
