Specifically , it analyzes the receipt of influenza and pertussis vaccines among pregnant wom - en over a seven-year period from 2012-2018. It also studies whether pregnant women received an influenza vaccine recommendation from their health care provider during the same period of analysis. Background Immunization of women during pregnancy offers protection to moth - ers and their infants in the first six months of life against severe morbidity and mortality from certain vaccine-preventable diseases. In the U.S., influenza vaccination is recommended for pregnant women, as well as women planning to become pregnant, during influenza season.1-3 In addition, since 2012, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that pregnant women also be vaccinated against pertussis.4 During pregnancy, vac - cine-induced antibodies are transferred from the mother to the fetus through the placenta, and following delivery, antibodies are passed to the infant via breast milk. This provides passive immunity to the newborn before routine childhood vaccination can be initiated.5 Despite these benefits, uptake of recommended vaccines remains low among U.S. pregnant women, with only 54% of pregnant women receiving an influenza vaccination before or during pregnancy , and 55% of women receiving a pertussis vaccine during pregnancy.6 Vaccine uptake may vary based on individual and area-level factors including differences in immunization accessibility and delivery. Previous research has shown that access to recommended vaccines among rural residents of the U.S. may be limited in comparison to urban residents.6,7 Women resid - ing in rural areas may experience delays or interruptions to their prenatal care including vaccination due to hospital closures and workforce shortages8, lack of access to transportation that allows women to reach distant perinatal services, inability to pay for perinatal services, or a lack of health insurance coverage.9 One important component of promoting immunization is patient- provider interactions. Provider recommendations can play a critical role in increasing vaccine uptake among pregnant women. Compared to those who do not receive any health care provider recommendation, pregnant women who Pregnant women in rural areas were significantly less likely than pregnant women in urban areas to receive a recommendation for influenza vaccination from their health care provider and were less likely to receive an influenza vaccine during pregnancy. Receipt of influenza vaccine was lowest among pregnant women in rural areas who were 30 years or older, non-Hispanic White or Hispanic, those with lower edu - cational attainment, those without health insurance coverage, and those residing in the South region of the U.S. Trends over time show that from 2012-2018, influenza vaccine uptake for pregnant women in rural areas was lower than for pregnant women in urban areas. This rural-urban gap in influen - za vaccination was apparent for vaccination during pregnancy but not for vaccination prior to pregnancy. A similar proportion of pregnant women received the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy in rural and urban areas; however, pertus - sis vaccination was significantly lower among pregnant women in rural areas who were 35 years or older and residing in the Midwest or South region of the U.S.April 20212 Influenza and Pertussis Vaccination Rates Among Pregnant Women in Rural and Urban Areasreport a recommendation or referral for vaccination by their health care provider during pregnancy are 12% more likely to be vaccinated for influenza and 16% more likely to be vaccinated for pertussis.6 Despite the possibility of place-based disparities in the uptake of vaccines and the receipt of recommended prenatal care, little is known about immunization rates for pregnant women in rural and urban areas of the U.S. This policy brief works to better understand this topic by studying influenza and pertussis vaccination rates among pregnant women in rural and urban areas. This research can be used to understand current patterns in prenatal vac - cination and to inform future vaccine promotion efforts. Methods To study the uptake of recommended vaccines by pregnant women in rural and urban areas, the analysis used data from the 2012-2018 waves of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS is an ongoing state-level, population-based surveillance system implemented since 1987.10 PRAMS monitors selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and shortly after pregnancy through sur - veys conducted by state, territorial, tribal, or local health departments in partnership with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health.10 This policy brief utilizes data from 19 states as well as New York City (n=153,648). The study relied on this set of states because they provide data for the entire period of analysis. The PRAMS survey collects information on three outcomes related to prenatal vaccination: 1) influenza vaccine uptake prior to or during pregnancy, 2) receipt of a recommendation for influenza vaccination from a health care provider during pregnancy, and 3) pertussis vaccine uptake during pregnancy. Rurality in the analysis is based on the 2013 Na - tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Urban-Rural Classification Scheme applied to the respondent's county of residence. PRAMS provides a two-level measure of ru - rality - indicating whether each pregnant woman resided in an urban or rural area of the state. The analysis assessed current factors associated with each outcome using the most recent data available (2016-2018) and additional - ly explored trends over time (2012-2018). All available PRAMS data were used for analysis, which varied by state and year of the survey. Additional information about the data available for use from PRAMS is in Table 1 . The analysis estimated weighted absolute differ - ences in the percentage of women residing in rural and urban areas vaccinated against influenza and pertussis and relied on the same procedure for the analysis of health care provider recommendations. Logistic regression was Table 1.

Results Influenza vaccination uptake Vaccination rates for pregnant wom - en in rural and urban areas during 2016-2018 are presented in Table 2 . These data show that the percentage of pregnant women who received an influenza vaccine prior to or during pregnancy in rural communities was lower than in urban communities. Specifi - cally, the percent of rural pregnant women vaccinated against influenza was 5.5% lower compared to urban pregnant women. Vac - cine coverage varied across levels of rurality based on age, race, ethnicity, gender, region, and insurance status. The greatest disparities in influenza vaccination coverage between rural and urban women occurred for women 35 years of age or older, non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women, those who had less than a high school diploma or with a college degree or higher, those with no insurance coverage, and those residing in West, North - east and South U.S. Census Regions. *Includes data from 2016-2018 from 20 US PRAMS sites including: Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mis - souri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Wyoming, and New York City.

Influenza vaccine uptake prior to pregnancy in rural areas in - creased from 7.5% in 2012 to 9.1% in 2018. Influenza vaccine uptake prior to pregnan - cy in rural areas increased from 7.5% in 2012 to 9.1% in 2018. Conversely, in urban areas, influenza vaccine uptake prior to pregnancy decreased from 11.2% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2018. When examining influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy in rural areas, an increase was observed from 29% in 2012 to 45% in 2018 ( Table 3, Figure 1 ). Similarly, influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy in urban areas progressively increased from 32% in 2012 to 51% in 2018. The percent - age of women vaccinated during pregnancy was 6% lower in rural areas compared to urban areas in 2018.Table 3.

However, rural-urban differences in pertussis vaccination coverage were observed among certain subgroups. For example, pregnant women in rural areas who were at least 35 years old or lived in one of the participating sites in the Midwest or South regions were significantly less likely than pregnant women in urban areas to be vaccinated against pertussis. *Includes data from 2016-2018 for 12 PRAMS sites including: Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and New York City.

A similar increase was seen in the uptake of pertussis vaccine during pregnancy in urban areas from 15.2% in 2012 to 79.3% in 2018. Table 7.

In 2016, the survey question only collected information on pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. For comparability with 2016-2018 data, we have categorized women who received a pertussis vaccine prior to or after pregnancy between 2012 and 2015 as not vaccinated. Significant at P<.05 Figure 3.

When analyzing vaccination against influenza, the study finds consistent evidence that pregnant women in rural areas are less likely to be vaccinated than pregnant women in urban areas. This finding holds when analyzing vaccination in the 12 months prior to delivery and during pregnancy. While the difference between rural and urban areas is not statistically significant in every year, it is significant in several years of the analysis, and suggests that pregnant women in rural areas have been consistently less likely to get this important vaccination over time. Notably, this difference between rural and urban areas is also seen when exploring subgroups of pregnant women. It is particularly pronounced among older preg - nant women, White and Hispanic mothers but not Black mothers, mothers with all insurance types except public insurance, and mothers in all regions except the Midwest. These differences across subgroups could result from differences in recommendations from medical providers to different groups of pregnant mothers, differences in the acceptance of vaccine recommendations across regions, states, and types of providers, or other barriers to health care access. Exploring the origins of these differences is an important direction for future research. The analysis also showed statistically significant differences in influenza vaccine recommendations from health care providers across rural and urban areas. Specif - ically, the results showed that rural pregnant mothers were less likely to have a health care provider recommend influ - enza vaccination than urban pregnant mothers. While this difference between urban and rural areas was small across years - never surpassing 3.9% - it was often statistically significant. Importantly, across rural and urban areas these recommendations appeared to be getting more common - increasing 19.6% in rural areas and 19.8% in urban areas during the period of analysis. Lastly, when examining pertussis vaccination for pregnant women, the analysis found that while vaccination rates were slightly lower in rural areas, the difference was not statistically significant. Despite this, there were some rural-urban differences across subgroups. Rural pregnant women over the age of 35 and living in the South were less likely than urban pregnant women to be vaccinated against pertussis, but rural pregnant women were more likely to be vaccinated than their urban counterparts in the Midwest. The results also suggest that ACIP's recommen - dation that all women be vaccinated against pertussis in 2012 has been effective - increasing pertussis vaccination for pregnant women by 64.8% in rural areas and 64.1% in urban areas in just seven years. Implications This research suggests that while important gains have been made in maternal vaccination, significant differ - ences persist across the rural-urban continuum. Specifi - cally, there is evidence that rural pregnant women were less likely to be vaccinated for influenza or to receive a recommendation from their health care provider to get an influenza vaccination. Notably however, the same cannot be said for pertussis. While rates of pertussis vaccination among pregnant women were slightly lower in rural areas, the difference was not large enough to be statistically sig - nificant in the most recent three year period of data avail - able. Despite these findings, it is important to note that this analysis was restricted to participating PRAMS sites, which did not encompass the entire U.S. Notably, few sites incorporated pertussis vaccination questions into their survey from 2012 through 2018, limiting the geo - graphic representation in these analyses. Using national data would improve the generalizability of this analysis. The findings point to several directions for possi - ble interventions to improve maternal health. First, efforts should be made to increase maternal vaccination against influenza in rural areas. These efforts could include health promotion efforts to inform rural patients and their pro - viders about the importance of maternal vaccination for April 202110 Southwest Rural Health Research Center Texas A&M School of Public Health 212 Adriance Lab Road MS 1266 College Station, TX 77843 For more information, contact Natasha Johnson: Phone | 979.436.9512 Email | nyjohnson@tamu.edu This study was supported by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under cooperative agreement #U1CRH30040.

Based on the results, it would appear that important gains could also be made by focusing on disparities across urban and rural areas for some sub-populations. For example, by developing interventions designed specifically to target older preg - nant women and women with no health insurance in rural areas, the current disparity in immunization could be reduced considerably. Additionally, this policy brief points to several directions for future research. First, more research is needed to understand why there is a larger gap in immunization across the rural-urban continuum for influenza than pertussis. This could result from the fact that recommendations for pertussis vaccination during pregnancy were more recently introduced and may be more favorably received by parents and providers; however, exploring this relationship will be vital to resolving differences in influenza vaccination between rural and urban areas. Second, more work is needed to understand why rural pregnant women in some subgroups are more likely to be vaccinated than others. Understanding why older women, non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women, women with all insurance types except public insurance, and women from certain census regions are less likely to be vaccinated in rural areas will be important to eliminating these disparities.
