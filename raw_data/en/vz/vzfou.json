DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS & MEDICAL DOCTORS Naturopathic Doctors are different than conventional doctors. Some of their training is the same - anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology - but the way they look at the body and health is different. Naturopathic Doctors are different than conventional doctors in that they do not treat symptoms - they treat people. At the end of the day, every person with the same diagnosis did not get there the same way or for the same reasons - and Naturopathic Doctors get that. They do not treat with a one-size fits all approach; every treatment plan is individualized to each person. Naturopathic Doctors see the body as connected. That is, every symptom you are experiencing ties into your other symptoms. You mental, emotional, and physical well-being are all intertwined.
