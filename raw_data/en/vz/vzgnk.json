February 23 -26, 2023.In this workshop I will share several strands of research and work I am actively engaged in with colleagues related to biodynamics.The morning session will introduce an approach to bringing the benefits of the biodynamic preparations to larger, non-agricultural landscapes, that I have been pioneering in partnership with the Viroqua Earth Healing Group. This work seeks to address the question of if and how the biodynamic preparations and other BD practices can bring healing to forests, rivers, mountains, and bioregions, as well as to the climate and the greater \"immune systems\" of the earth.In the afternoon, I will introduce a form of movement-based research that can enhance our ability to sense etheric forces and support the health of the elemental world. We will also explore the potential for these movements to be applied as a methodology for sensing the qualities and \"quality\" of the biodynamic preparations. This form of movement, sometimes called Goethean movement, has been developed by Hugh Ratcliffe, a biodynamic vegetable grower and Goethean scientist living in France, with whom I have been studying for several years. All of the above will be grounded in a deep understanding of the challenges and needs of the elemental beings in our time and their call, if you will, to the heart of every human being, to awaken to our true power as co-creators of the natural world.
