European governments are facing a dilemma over COVID passes. Many have adopted the certificates, or 'green' passes, as a ticket for people to enjoy something approaching a normal social life amid the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 from eating out to going to the theater. In addition, the COVID pass has kept borders open, allowing travel to continue freely between EU countries. The pass demonstrates that its holder is fully vaccinated, has recovered from infection or has recently tested negative for COVID-19. But with vast swathes of countries' populations now vaccinated, most people are using the pass as proof that they're double jabbed. Therein lies the rub: Data now shows that immunity wanes significantly five months after the second shot, especially in older people. For people jabbed longer ago, proof of vaccination could provide false reassurance that it is safe to attend sporting events or travel abroad. You may like And at a time when Europe is again the [epicenter](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-who/) of the global pandemic with cases surging, governments need effective policies \u2014 not ineffective tools \u2014 to fight back against the virus. Countries like Greece and France, alert to the risks, have taken first steps to prevent their COVID passes from effectively becoming obsolete. In the EU, the European Commission wants to continue using its COVID certificate to keep borders open. But it's also considering whether to update the rules around freedom of movement to address the issue of waning immunity, the epidemiological situation and vaccination uptake. \"Our aim is to make life easy for Europeans while respecting safety and following the scientific advice,\" Commission spokesperson Dana Spinant [said](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-213312) during a press briefing this week. \"That's why we keep all our eyes open, and we will be looking towards the refreshing of the rules,\" she added. In Austria, one region has taken proof of vaccination to a new level of freedom. From Monday, unvaccinated people in Upper Austria are being [sent back into lockdown](https://www.politico.eu/article/austrian-region-imposes-lockdown-for-unvaccinated/), while those who can demonstrate with their COVID pass that they are vaccinated can live relatively normal lives. Limited shelf life Countries across the bloc have adopted the EU's [COVID certificate](https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2021/0068(COD)&l=en) to open up society, in confidence that people are unlikely to be spreading infection. Using the digital technology developed for the EU's certificate, it's now commonplace to scan smartphones for proof of vaccination to enter public spaces such as bars and gyms, from Paris to Milan. France and Italy were among the first to introduce the scheme, in part to drive up vaccination rates. And it appears to have worked. \"In France, it increased vaccine uptake tremendously when the measures were put in place,\" said Emilie Karafillakis, European research lead at the Vaccine Confidence Project, hosted by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. But evidence is accumulating on the limitations of vaccination. In July, a study from [Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/23/science/covid-vaccine-israel-pfizer.html) first alerted the world to the waning immunity of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. Since then, further data from across the world has shown that COVID-19 vaccines provide great early protection, but antibody levels start to decline [after just three months](https://pro.politico.eu/news/politico-pro-morning-health-care-delta-surge-spotlights-eu-policies-waning-vax-protection-in-elderly-no-antibody-therapy-for-hospitalized?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=f7aa74e6a3-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_23_05_00&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-f7aa74e6a3-190279369), depending on the vaccine and the individual. French President Emmanuel Macron this week [took a first stand](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-ties-seniors-vaccine-passports-to-booster-shots/) on this issue. From mid-December, the COVID pass for over 65s will only remain valid if French seniors get a top-up booster shot six months after vaccination. Greece is discussing similar measures. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said last week that the government is considering putting an expiry date on the vaccination certificate, which Greeks use to go to the shops, bars, restaurants or the gym without the need for testing. The proposal, submitted by the main opposition Syriza party, mirrors that of France since Greece has also made the booster shot mandatory six months after primary vaccination. If the proposal is adopted, Greeks who refuse the booster shot would see their COVID passes lapse. Winter of chaos? As evidence grows that immunity wanes \u2014 particularly to blocking transmission \u2014 \"it will be inevitable that there will be some sort of time limit\" on vaccination status, said Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. The direction of travel is that \"to be normally vaccinated, we will need to have had three doses of the vaccine at this stage at least,\" he added. That means if one country is administering boosters, they will most likely expect travelers to also have had boosters, Clarke said. With the winter festive and ski seasons approaching, that could cause travel chaos. While the EU's COVID certificate should \" [in principle](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en#recognition-of-covid-certificates-from-third-non-eu-countries)\" exempt travelers from curbs on their freedom of movement, member countries can choose to impose additional restrictions on pass holders if they deem it necessary and proportionate to safeguard public health \u2014 and explain their decision to the bloc. While the Commission has not revealed any immediate plans to update the COVID certificate, it has urged alignment in vaccination policies to avoid travel disruptions. \"Health policies and vaccination policies are national competence,\" said Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker. \"This being said, we've always stressed from the beginning that it's very important that member states talk to each other [and] that they talk to us.\" Alternative route To some, however, the COVID pass on its own isn't enough to protect people from infection as they travel and interact. With a host of different vaccines used across the bloc, each with varying efficacy and rates of declining protection, some scientists think it's time to move to personalized immunity tests. \"The COVID pass is probably only good for maybe two or three months after the date of the second jab,\" said Andrew Shaw, associate professor of physical chemistry at the University of Exeter. \"After that, it really depends on how fast your antibody levels are declining.\" Shaw has developed a blood test that can read out the levels of antibodies developed from vaccination and infection in seven minutes. The results tell you whether your antibody levels are within thresholds considered high enough to fight off infection. The test, developed by his company Attomarker, a spinout from the University of Exeter, is now available in three U.K. cities, at prices comparable to private PCR tests. But the science around immunity thresholds is still somewhat grey. While Shaw says he is confident he has identified a unit quantity of antibodies needed for protection, there isn't yet a consensus on the matter. \"I'm skeptical that we're anywhere near\" knowing what the protective level of antibodies is, said Clarke.
