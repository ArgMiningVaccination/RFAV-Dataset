Beach days, barbecues, and pool hangs are calling our name. The energy of the season is all about joy, connection, expansiveness, and fun. To enjoy the season to its fullest, TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) teaches us how to live in harmony with the season and the feisty element of Fire. Whether you thrive in the heat or want to melt away, this TCM Summer Food Therapy guide is for you! \"Without the knowledge of proper diet, it is hardly possible to enjoy good health.\" \u2014 Sun Si Miao, Tang Dyansty Dietitian Food therapy plays a major role in how we can maintain good health year round. In Chinese Medicine, every food has its own property and temperature and powerful medicinal ability. The key to thriving in the Summer is to include a diet that clears heat, resolves dampness, and strengthens the digestive system and Spleen Qi. Summer is the most Yang time of year. That means both nature and our bodies are at its pinnacle of warmth and activity. Here in the Lowcountry, Summer brings a good dose of heat and humidity on the daily. In Chinese Medicine, we refer to this as Summer-Heat. It's not just hot. There's a damp quality, too, that can leave us feeling lethargic and sluggish on the brightest, sunniest days. Summer corresponds to the Fire element and the Heart and Small Intestine meridian system. Late Summer brings in the Earth element, and the Spleen and Stomach meridian systems. If our body is in balance, we feel joyful and energized by the summer's sun and maintain good health. Signs that our body is out of balance with the Summer season include increased anxiety and agitation (an unsettled heart/spirit), rashes and skin irritation, GI issues, fatigue and lethargy, swelling/edema, and insomnia and sleep disturbance. Eating the right foods can help our body find its homeostasis and being us back into balance. Following TCM Dietary Guidelines does wonders for our seasonal health and physical/emotional well-being.
