Both serum transfer and mAb transfer studies clearly established that the autoimmune insult is induced by humoral immunity. Older mice were more susceptible to autoimmune insult than younger animals. Lens epithelial cell damage invariably proceeded to cortical and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. This mouse model of experimental autoimmune cataract formation will facilitate the exploration of the relation between immune phenomena and human age-related cataract. Copyright \u00a9 1995 by "}
