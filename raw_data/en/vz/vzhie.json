Through different combinations of space -time mode, the ancient four methods of day-prescription of acupoints (Na Jiamethod), hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method), eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods), and eight methods of swift puncturing of needles(Fei Teng Eight Methods) can get four methods to select acupoints at Five Shu acupoints and eight con fluence acu- points according to time. The ancient space -time patterns of Yinyang, Wuxing, Tiangan and Dizhi, the Lo Scroll (Luo Shu ),and Bagua were all based on the ancient people 's observa- tions, tests, and theoretical enhancements of astronomy.When applied to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), they become the space -time link between ancient and modern. The deeper meaning of time acupoints notion cannot beseparated from the support of space. On the basis of in-depth exploration of the space -time mode of time-acupoints selection in ancient times, the concept of space acupointscorresponding to the four ancient methods was put forward.Keywords Acupuncture Time- Acupoints-Space ATAS long COVID vaccine adverse ZiMethod) of ATAS COVID-19 microcirculatory lesions qield effectAbstract Corona Virus disease 2019 ( COVID-19) has become a serious challenge. On the one hand, there is not a single explanation of its pathological mechanism, which directlyaffects the treatment ef cacy. On the other hand, the complicated symptoms of long COVID and COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions involve multiple systems and the number of affected patients is large, which have attracted great attention. Acupunc-ture time-acupoints-space (ATAS) is a new acupuncture technique developed on thebasis of four methods of day-prescription of acupoints (Na Jia method), hour-prescrip-tion of acupoints (Na Zi Method), eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling GuiEight Methods), and eight methods of swift puncturing of needles (Fei Teng EightMethods) in midnight-noon and ebb- flow doctrine (Zi Wu Liu Zhu). The main idea of ATAS is to use the orderly combination of time acupoints and space acupoints to construct a eld to regulate qi movement and treat diseases through the qi eld effect. In France, although traditional Chinese medicine cannot be directly used to treatCOVID-19, hundreds of patients with long COVID and COVID-19 vaccine adversereactions have been treated using the four methods of ATAS. With reference to themicrocirculatory lesions in the pathological mechanism of COVID-19 in Westernmedicine, hour prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) of ATAS showed speci c efcacy for long COVID. received July 10, 2022 accepted after revisionSeptember 22, 2022 article published online 2023DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0043-1762572.

Some Western medicine experts have proposed that novelcoronavirus mainly enters multiple human organs through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a target, which is highly expressed not only in alveolar cells and cardiomyocytes butalso in vascular endothelial cells, and venous thrombo-embolism, etc., which impair the barrier between blood vessels and organ tissues, as well as the basis for transporting blood, oxygen, and nutrients to various tissues, causingdiseases in a wide range. Even when patients are negative for COVID test, these injuries are not easy to be repaired quickly, resulting in complex and diverse long COVID. 11 Clinically, long COVID patients often have blood stasissymptoms such as multiple viscera injury, ecchymosis andpetechial on tongue tip and edge, and sublingual venous varices, so it is believed that microangiopathy devel- oping into long COVID may become one of the commonpathogenesis of the complex symptoms. The ancient hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) is based on the principles of the 28 meridians fornutrient qi in The Spiritual Pivot (Ling Shu ) and the mother- supplementing child-draining method in TCM. The 28 meri- dians for nutrient qi consist of 12 regular meridians, andconception vessel, governor vessel, female yin heel vessel, and male yang heel vessel belonging to eight extra meridians. In this network with the 12 meridians as the dominantsystem and the four vessels as the hidden system, there is not only deep and ubiquitous running of nutrient qi but also original qi and defense qi, which has become an importantcarrier and network of the theory of suf cient healthy qi inside preventing the invasion of pathogenic factors in TCM. In the three major cycles of using Five Shu acupoints to form aday-on-time sensitivity, the hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) runs through the principle of reinforcing and reducing by puncturing along and against the direction ofmeridians, respectively, and mother-supplementing child- draining. That is to say, in the process of flowing the meridians according to the time sensitivity, the mechanism of reinforcement and restraint of the Five Shu acupoints to distinguish the de ciency and excess diseases is applied, and the method of treating de ciency by toni cation and treat- ing excess by purgation is performed based on acupoints combination and therapeutic manipulation. Using time acu-points, hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) creates major meridian-unblocking involving 12 acupoints to clear the qi stagnation and blood stasis, supplement the de ciency of nutrient qi and original qi, and deeply participate in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis in nutrient qi running to assist healthy qi. The structure of theclose combination of time acupoints and space acupoints makes hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) play a speci c role in the treatment of long COVID. Typical Cases Case 1 was 51-year old male. Date of rst visit was at 18:30 on February 22, 2021 (Xin Chou Day 38, Ding You Hour 34). Complaints were on January 2021, the patient received rst aid for one and a half months during hospitalization due to aninfection resulting from the installation of cardiac rst aid equipment and was discharged following multiple negative nucleic acid tests. Underlying condition was type 2 diabetes.Current symptoms were weight loss of 20 kg, fatigue, gasping for breath, and unable to move after 10-m walk in need of support, with joint and muscle aches all over the body,insomnia, blank mind, and complete shutdown of life and work. The painkillers caused stomach pain, which was reduced to the minimum dosage and was almost ineffective,so they were stopped. Pulse was deep, thready, and weak especially at the two chi parts of the wrist, the tongue was fat and teeth marked with the bottom covered with bloodshot, and the coating was white and thick. Western medicine diagnosis was long COVID. TCM diagnosis was the de ciency of spleen and kidney, dampness, and blood stasis blocking meridians and channels. Treatment principle was tonifying spleen and kidney, promoting blood circulation and remov-ing blood stasis, removing dampness, and relieving pain. Therapy included major meridian-unblocking method by hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) of ATASwith Taixi (KI 3) time acupoint for even reinforcing-reducing method from left to right. Space acupoints from left to right were rst Shenmai (BL 62), Dazhui (DU 12), and Qihai (RN 6) consolidate the then sequentially 12 major meridian-unblocking acupoints were Zhiyin (BL 67), (LR 13), Qimen (LR 14), 4), Chongyang Dabao (SP 21), 8), and (BL 11). Targeting acupoints wereZusanli (ST 36) and Tianshu (ST 25). The needle was retained for 40 minutes. During the needle retention, the patient fell asleep deeply and felt relaxed all over the body when theneedle was taken out. Date of the second visit was at 18:30 on February 26 (Yi Si Day 42, Yi You Hour 22). According to the patient, his mental Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 3 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Qi Field Effect of ATAS Zhu e57 state improved and the fatigue was signi cantly reduced. After major meridian-unblocking therapy by hour-prescrip-tion of acupoints (Na Zi Method) of ATAS once a week for 2 months, the patient returned to normal life and work. Case 2 was 48-year old male. Date of rst visit was at 17:00 on May 28, 2021 (Bing Zi Day 13, Bing Chen Hour 33). Complaints were in March 2021, the patient and his wife were simultaneously infected with COVID-19, receiving homeisolation treatment for a month, and the multiple nucleic acid tests were negative before the visit. Current symptoms were fatigue, chest tightness, expectoration, pharynx blockage,nasal obstruction, decreased memory and reaction ability, and unable towork properly. With thehistory of severe attacks of low back pain radiating to the lower extremities, insomnia,and hyperosteogeny of lumbar vertebrae 4 and 5. Pulse was deep and thready, especially at two chi parts of the wrist. The tongue wasfatand teeth-marked with bloodshot at thebottomof tongue, and the coating was white, thick, and greasy. Western medicine diagnosis was long COVID. TCM diagnosis was the de ciency of spleen and kidney, dampness, and blood stasis blocking meridians and channels. Treatment principle was tonifying the spleen and kidney, promoting blood circula- tion, removingdampness, relieving pain.Therapy includedmajor meridian-unblocking of ATAS. Time acupoints adopted Tonggu (BL 66) for even reinforcing and reducing, from left toright; space acupoints were from left to right, rst Shenmai 62), were Dazhu (BL 11), 27), 1), Zhangmen (LR 13), Qimen (LR 4), (ST Dabao (SP 21), and Shaofu (HT 8). Targeting acupoints were Weizhong (BL 40) and Fenglong (ST 40). The needle was retained for 40 minutes. During the needle retention,thepatient fell asleepdeeply. The patientfelt relaxed and lumbosacral pain disappeared when the needle was takenout. After treatment once every 2 weeks for four times, all the symptoms disappeared and returned to normal work. Then, the therapy was performed to strengthen the curative effectonce a month. Note: Thespeci cityof ATAS in the treatment of long COVID lies in that it can not only directly act on nutrient qi flow in meridians to regulate and tonify nutrient qi, defense qi, and original qi but also has effects of unblocking the meridian and blood activating in a wide range. ATAS has become a highlytargeted treatment for microcirculation lesions in long COVID. In addition, the combination of targeting acupoints and em- pirical acupoints is of extensive adaptability, so it has achievedsatisfactory results in the clinic. Mechanism of ATAS in COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Reactions Treatment Discussion on the Mechanism People having COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions are main- ly concentrated in the population with underlying conditions such as cancer, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes,arthropathy, asthma, allergic diseases, anxiety, depression, and uncured long COVID patients. The occurrence of adversereactions is closely related to the patient 's constitutions, that is, the original qi state in TCM. ATAS combined with triple energizer pericardium to connect the original qi in the cycle in the twelve meridians (Na Jia Method), to stimulate the vitality of the original qi in the combination of acquired eight trigrams and nine palaces(Ling Gui Eight Methods), or to use congenital eight trigrams to regulate the original qi (Fei Teng Eight Methods), which are with different qi channels, but their goals are the same toenhance and regulate the original qi. 1 Typical Cases Case 3 was 48-year-old male. The date of rst visit was at 13:15 on November 22, 2021 (Jia Xu Day 11, Geng Wu Hour 7). Complaints were long-term depression with anxiety,alternate use of antidepressant and antianxiety drugs, and intractable low back pain without abnormal imaging nd- ings. Medical history included total prostatectomy in 2018because of prostate cancer. Current symptoms were the patient was infected with COVID-19 in March 2020, was negative for the nucleic acid test after 3 weeks of treatment athome, and was diagnosed and cured by Western medicine. The second shot of the vaccine was given at 10:00 on July 7, 2021. Three weeks later, wandering click-like pain accompa-nied by a sense of burning occurred in the nerve ending, which was called wandering electric sense according to the patient. It usually started at the ngertip of the left hand and radiated to the palm, arm, and shoulder, then to the right shoulder, along the right arm, and palm to the ngertip, and then to the lower extremities, accompanied by muscle flicker pain and contracture, worse in the right lower extremities. Similar symptoms often occurred around the lips. All the examinations results were normal in the department of Internal Medicine and Neurology of Bikier Hospital, Paris Public Hospital, and the adverse reaction of COVID-19 vac-cine was diagnosed by multidepartment consultation. The patient 's physical tness decreased signi cantly, fatigued easily, with muscle weakness all over the body, poorly slept,and easily woke up with normal urination and defecation. Pulse was deep, thready, and hesitant. The tongue was pale, fat, tooth-marked with little coating, and there were bloodstasis nodules at the bottom of the tongue. Western medicine diagnosis was adverse reaction of COVID-19 vaccine. TCM diagnosis was the de ciency of kidney qi, meridian blocking. Treatment principle was tonifying kidney qi, dredging chan- nels, and activating collaterals. Therapy included major meridian-unblocking method in hour-prescription ofacupoints (Na Zi Method) of ATAS. Time acupoints were Shaochong (HT 9). Because the patient 's symptoms started from left body, contralateral meridian needling from right toleft was applied. Space acupoints: due to the main symptoms of pain and burning, 12 acupoints of meridian-unblocking should be punctured rst, that is, (BL 11), 67), 1), Zhangmen (LR 13), Qimen (LR 14), Hegu 4), Yingxiang (LI 20), Chongyang (ST 42), then acupoints to Chinese Medicine and Natural Products V ol. 3 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Q iF i e l dE f f e c to fA T A S Zhu e58 strengthen nutrient qi flow in lower body, Shenmai 14), HN Quchi (LI 11), and Taichong (LR 3). The time-acupoints were replenished by the centripetal oblique insertion rein-forcing method of hour-prescription of and targeting acupoints were nee-dled by oblique insertion of the 12 regular meridians, and the reinforcing method of time acupoints was applied in all acupoints from right to left. The needle was retained for40 minutes and was taken out the needle according to the order of insertion. Second visit was at 13:10 on November 29, 2021 (Xin Si Day 18, Jia Wu Hour 13). Complaints were after acupuncture, the body relaxed and the symptoms of anxiety improved, but the symptoms of limbs did not improve signi cantly. Pulse was deep, thready, and uneven pulse. The tongue was pale, fat, and tooth-marked with little coating. There were dark nodules at the bottom of the tongue. TCM diagnosis waskidney de ciency and liver depression, meridian block. Treatment principle included tonifying kidney and regulat- ing liver, dredging channels, and activating collaterals. Ther-apy included eight methods of swift puncturing of needles (Fei Teng Eight Methods) of ATAS. Time-acupoints were Gongsun (SP 4) and Neiguan (PC 6) in adherence to thecustom of male left body female right from left to right. Starting from the rst trigram where Gongsun (SP 4) is located; the space acupoints were divided lower limbs Bagua acupoints, shown in Fig. 1 . Weizhong (BL 40) was the targeting acupoint. The needle was retained for 40 minutes and was taken out the needle according to the sequence of needle insertion. Third visit was at 12:20 on December 6, 2021 (Wu Zi Day 25, Wu Wu Hour 55). Complaints were the patient accidentally fellon December 5 and the injury of theleft gastrocnemius muscle caused severe low back pain. Pulse was deep, thready, and uneven. The tongue was pale, fat, tooth-marked with littlecoating and bloodshot on the bottom of the tongue. TCM diagnosis and treatment principles were the same as above.Therapy included eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) of ATAS. Time acupoints were Shenmai (BL 62) and Houxi (SI 3). Contralateral meridianneedling was used rst for the left gastrocnemius muscle injury, from right to left; space-acupoints: starting from the rst palace where Shenmai (BL 62) is located, the three groups of acupoints were respectively needled as shown in Fig. 2 , with Weizhong (BL 40), Zulinqi (GB 41), and Zusanli (ST 36) as targeting acupoints. The needle was retained for 40 minutesand was taken out the needle according to the order of insertion. Treatment was performed every 3 days and after 2 months of treatment, the patient 's physical and mental symp- toms gradually improved, and the wandering electric sense of the limbs was reduced by 80%. Note: The patient in this case had kidney de ciency and liver depression for a long time. When COVID-19 infection and vaccine adverse reactions occurred simultaneously, not only the de ciency of kidney was aggravated but also the function of liver and blood to nourish meridian tendons was damaged. During the rst visit, hour-prescription of acu- points (Na Zi Method) of ATAS was used to unblock meri-dians, relieve pain, and tonify kidney qi so that the anxiety and nervousness of patients could be relieved. During the second and third visit, eight methods of swift puncturing ofneedles (Fei Teng Eight Methods) and eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) of ATAS were applied. Time acupoints: Gongsun (SP 4) in combination withNeiguan (PC 6) and thoroughfare vessel in combination with yin link vessel were selected to dredge heart and chest depression; Shenmai (BL 62) in combination with Houxi(SI 3) and yang heel vessel in combination with governor vessel were selected to invigorate kidney and yang qi. The two groups of time-acupoints were the keys to enter the congenital and acquired eight trigrams and qi eld. Space acupoints: on the central axis of congenital and acquiredeight trigrams, the flexible combination of Dazhui (DU 14), Jinsuo (DU 8), Mingmen (DU 4), Baihui (DU 20), Shangxing 23), Shenting (DU 24), neck-back, head-upper limbs, chest-abdomen-lower limbs. Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 3 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Qi Field Effect (RN 4), and Qihai (RN 6) communicates thorough- fare vessel and governor vessel to bene t the original qi. The combination of Fengchi (GB 20), Ganshu (BL 18), Shenshu Tianshu 13), Taichong (LR 3), and Yanglingquan (GB34) on the left and right body not only had the function of curing root causes from liver and kidney but also has the effect of tranquillizing and relieving pain and unblockingmeridians. On the basis of constructing qi eld, the targeting acupoints play the role of keeping waist-back healthy through Weizhong (BL 40) and belly and abdomen throughZusanli (ST 36). This case was a mixed disease of the new and refractory, kidney injury, which could not be cured in a short time, so with the purpose of regulating individual qi eld, it wasflexible to choose from the hour-prescription of acu- points (Na Zi Method), eightfold methods of the sacredtortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) and eight methods of swift puncturing of needles (Fei Teng Eight Methods) of ATAS, and a good effect was obtained. Case 4 was 43-year-old female. Date of rst visit was at 18:00 on January 31, 2022 (Jia Shen Day 21, Gui You Hour 10). The patient had underlying asthma and the third dose of theCOVID-19 vaccine was injected on January 22, 2022. On January 23, the trachea tightened and ached, cough appeared. On the night of January 23, severe pain appearedin the ovary, radiating to the sacral pelvis and back, and the patient was unable to sleep with a continuous secretion of a large amount of white, sticky, and smelly leucorrhea. Thelower limbs were covered with a crimson rash, unbearable itching, and the palms of the hands had felt burning to pain. The patient was sent to the hospital for emergency treatmentand was diagnosed as vaccine adverse reactions. After hospitalization for 3 days, abdominal lumbosacral pain was alleviated and the appearance and smell of leucorrhea wasslightly improved. TCM diagnosis: lung, spleen and kidney damage, phlegm dampness, and blood stasis blocking meri- dians. Treatment principle was invigorating the spleen,tonifying the kidney and regulating the lung, removing dampness, and removing blood stasis to relieve pain. Therapyincluded eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) of ATAS. Time acupoints: Waiguan (SJ 5) and Linqi (GB 41) were selected because of serious gynecologicaladverse reactions from right to left according to the custom of male left female right; space acupoints: the three groups of nine palaces acupoints of neck-back-waist, head-shoulder-upper limbs, and chest-abdomen-lower extremities were used, all started from the third house where Linqi (GB 41) is located; the targeting acupoints were Weizhong (BL 40)and Fenglong (ST 40), needling from right to left. The needle was retained for 40 minutes and was taken out the needle according to the insertion order. Second visit was at 17:00 on February 7, 2022 (Xin Mao Day 28, Bing Shen Hour 33). Complaints were the lumbosa-cral pain in the lower abdomen was reduced by 80%, and the patients could sleep soundly. The rash basically disappeared and the leucorrhea returned to normal. Therapy was eight-fold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) of ATAS . Time acupoints were Zhaohai (KI 6) and Lieque (LU 7) from right to left; space acupoints were the same threegroups as the rst visit, needling from the fth house where Zhaohai (KI 6) is located; targeting acupoints were Zusanli (ST 36) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6). The needle was retained for40 minutes and was taken out the needle according to the insertion order. Third visit was at 13:00 on March 11, 2022 (Gui Hai Day 60, Wu Wu Hour 55). Complaints were symptoms at the rst visit basically disappeared, and the patient hoped to consoli- date the curative effect. Treatment method: eight methods ofswift puncturing of needles (Fei Teng Eight Methods) of ATAS. Time acupoints were Zulinqi (GB 41) and Waiguan (SJ needling the Gua where Zulinqi (GB 41) is located, targeting acupoints were Zusanli (ST 36) Fig. 2 Nine palaces acupoints of neck-back-waist, head-shoulder-uppper limbs, chest-abdomen-lower limbs. Chinese Medicine and Natural Products V ol. 3 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Q iF i e l dE f f e c to fA T A S Zhu e60 and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), needling from right to left. The needle was retained for 40 minutes and was taken out the needleaccording to the insertion order. Note: because this patient had underlying asthma, the vaccine not only caused serious adverse reactions to thelungs but also involved gynecology and dermatology. Among the four methods of ATAS, the application of eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods)was based on two aspects. First, the time acupoints Waiguan (SJ 5) and Zulinqi (GB 41) combined with yang link vessel and belt vessel in the treatment of gynecological emergency wasthe key to entering the treatment qi eld. Second, the three groups of acupoints of eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) could comprehensivelycover a variety of side effects of patients, such as Feishu (BL 13), Zhongfu (LU 1), Danzhong (RN for tightening and (GB eczema and itching rash; Baihui (DU 20), Shangxing (DU Shenting (DU tranquilize andrelieve anxiety; Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong (LR 3) to regulate qi movement all over the body; Dazhui (DU 14), Shenshu (BL 23), and Mingmen (DU 4) to strengthen kidney and bene t essence. The targeting acupoints Weizhong (BL 40) aimed at severe pain in the pelvis and back; Fenglong (ST 40) and Quchi (LI 11) in nine palaces acupoints cooperated to cleardampness and heat. This construction of qi e l do b t a i n e da rapid and immediate effects in the rst visit. The second visit continued to use eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise(Ling Gui Eight Methods) of ATAS, but the time acupoints were changed to Zhaohai (KI 6) and Lieque (LU 7) in combi- nation with yin heel vessel and conception vessel directlysolved gynecological adverse reactions. Eight methods of swift puncturing of needles (Fei Teng Eight Methods) for the third visit with Zulinqi (GB 41) and Waiguan (SJ 5) time acupoints had the same role as Waiguan (SJ 5) and Zulinqi (GB 41) for the rst visit. For the eight trigrams acupoints, Shenshu (BL 23) was (RN 17) to Zhongwan cooperating with the targeting acupoint Zusanli (RN 17) in order to tonify the spleen andstomach and consolidate the curative effect. regulating gy- necology with Sanyinjiao (SP 6).Sanyinjiao (SP 6) was con- tinuously used to regulate gynecological diseases. After threetimes of treatment, the complex symptoms of the vaccine adverse reactions were basically relieved and satisfactory results were obtained. Conclusion The microvascular lesion is an important part of COVID-19 pathology, which can be used as a reference for the patho- logical mechanism of long COVID. On the basis of tonifyingnutrient qi, hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) of ATAS has made great efforts and obtained good ef cacy in removing the stagnation in nutrient qi flow in 28 meridians, tonifying de ciency and dredging depressionas well as treating both symptoms and root causes and suggesting that paying attention to and dealing with therelationship between healthy qi and blood stasis is a key avenue of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions are closely related to the con-stitutions associated with the underlying diseases, that is, the state of original qi in TCM, so the treatment of vaccine adverse reactions is mainly based on the three methods ofATAS, Ziwu Liuzhu Na Jia Method, eightfold methods of the sacred tortoise (Ling Gui Eight Methods) and eight methods of swift puncturing of needles (Fei Teng Eight Methods), andthe hour-prescription of acupoints (Na Zi Method) of ATAS can also be used. In a word, ATAS aims to construct and adjust the exteriorly interiorly connected qi eld, which leads nutrient qi and original qi to the focus with the guidance of targeting acupoints, and the normal pulse can be achieved with a needle without consultation. Althoughthe long COVID and COVID-19 vaccine adverse reaction are major issues never seen before, we have made a rapid response in the clinic with curative effects. 12The mecha- nism of ATAS through constructed qi eld is worthy of further investigation.
