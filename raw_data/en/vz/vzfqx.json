Newborn screening is important for early diagnosis and treatment [Biogen] EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Print Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram This article is part of our special report Life with SMA: challenges and solutions.Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, progressive, neuromuscular disease which affects one in 11,000 births[1]. It is the most common neurodegenerative disease in childhood[2]. Before any treatment was available, a diagnosis of SMA meant either early death or a lifetime of progressive disability. There are now a number of disease modifying treatment options for SMA approved in Europe, with more treatments under development. Alessandro Tempra is the Head of Public Policy & Government Affairs, Europe, Canada and Partner Markets, Biogen. Because symptoms may not be easily detectable at birth and some babies can be asymptomatic for a period of time, diagnosis can be delayed. When this is the case, SMA leads to an irreversible loss of motor neurons; this regression begins early in the perinatal period, with severe denervation in the first 3 months of life and loss of more than 90% of motor units within 6 months of age.[3] Consequently, early diagnosis and urgent initiation of treatment are vital. Newborn screening (NBS), which allows infants to be screened at birth for a list of disorders that are treatable, but difficult or impossible to detect clinically, could allow the identification of patients before the first symptoms emerge and thus maximize treatment outcomes for SMA patients. Despite considerable delays, newborn screening programs have now been initiated in various European countries allowing early detection of SMA. We estimate that in 2021, around 1/3 of the four million babies born within the European Union were tested for SMA at birth and this number is likely to continue growing as governments expand NBS and pilots launched by companies like Biogen becomes routine.[4] However, newborn screening alone is not sufficient. Treatments should be offered to babies urgently after diagnosis so they can fully benefit from existing therapies. This is not currently the case everywhere in Europe, as diagnosed babies have often to wait several days or even weeks before accessing treatment, thus irreversibly losing fundamental neuromuscular functions. For instance, for some of the babies diagnosed as part of an SMA screening pilot in Belgium recently, treatment initiation was delayed for several weeks, which may have impaired the most favourable outcome for these patients despite an early diagnosis.[5] With evidence showing that early administration of SMA therapies is more effective,[6] every SMA diagnosis should be translated into an emergency to treat. Biogen continues to work with authorities across Europe to expand newborn screening to rare diseases for which treatment is available and where early pre-symptomatic treatment can make a difference for patients, such as for SMA. We support the adoption of a common newborn screening framework at the European level, starting from disease selection criteria and mechanisms, with the aim to overcome existing inequalities in terms of newborn screening coverage across Member States. But the opportunity offered by early diagnosis should not be wasted. \"Time is motor neuron\", as some experts well described.[7] Once diagnosed, all pre-symptomatic SMA babies should get on an emergency treatment as soon as possible, regardless of where they live or their choice of therapy.[8] Further Reading[1] Children's national, Pediatric Spinal Muscular Atrophy [2] Sugarman EA, et al.
