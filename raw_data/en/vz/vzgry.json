But, as much as we know we need to protect ourselves from the sun, it turns out we also have to protect ourselves from a lot of the sunscreens out there. It's essential to choose sunscreens that not only provide effective UVA/ UVB protection but are also non-toxic. What to Avoid: Traditional sunscreens often contain chemicals like oxybenzone, octinoxate, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene, which have been linked to hormone disruption and skin irritation and can be bad for the environment. What to look for: Non-toxic sunscreens will prioritize safer ingredients that are gentle on the skin and are environmentally friendly while still providing both UVA and UVB Protection. They avoid harmful chemicals such as parabens, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. Instead, they use mineral protection such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. Where to Find: Not to worry, there are a TON of options out there now! Here are some brands that meet the criteria.
