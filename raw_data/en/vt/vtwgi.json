In this study, the effect of Equi-Strath/C226, the adapted product for horses, on the equine immune system was evaluated. A rou- tine influenza booster vaccination was used as a model to study the effects of Equi-Strath/C226supplementation on the immune response. Twenty healthy Franches-Montagnes stallions with pre-existing antibody levels were randomly divided into a study group (SG, n=10) receiving 0.06 mL/kg bodyweight of Equi-Strath/C226, and a control group (CG, n=10), receiving the same amount of placebo, daily. The supplement and placebo were given from week 1 until week 14 of the trial. After 10 weeks, the horses were vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing equine influenza strains of the H3N8 subtype. Antibody titres in blood were measured at day 0 before vaccination, and 14 and 32 days after vaccination. In addition, a complete blood count (CBC) was performed on day 0 and day 32. A linear increase of haemagglutination inhibition titres in both groups was observed after vaccination, but with no difference between treatment groups. CBC components remained unaf- fected by treatment. In conclusion, daily Equi-Strath/C226supplementation did not affect the adaptive immune response in stallions after a routine commercial H3N8 influenza booster vaccination.

Correspondence: 1, 1580 Avenches, Introduction Successful equine influenza vaccination in horses stimulates an immune response, resulting in an increase of the antigen-specic antibody production (Van Maanen & Cullinane 2002). The extent of the immune response, however, may be affected by sev- eral factors. Folsom et al. (2001) observed how exer- cise alters the immune response to equine influenza virus and may increase susceptibility to infection in ponies. In addition, Horohov et al. (1999) concluded that older horses had a reduced immune function, but were nevertheless more resistant to exercise- induced immune suppression than younger horses. Dietary effects on the immune response in horses have also been reported. For instance, it was shownby several groups that dietary consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can positively affect the immune system in horses (Curtis et al. 2000; Adam et al. 2003). Furthermore, a greater anti- gen-specic antibody response to equine influenza was found in mature horses supplemented with a fourfold increased amount of vitamin E (Baalsrud & Overnes 1986). Knight & Tyznik (1990) observed ahigher antibody response in vitamin E supplemented ponies challenged with packed sheep red blood cells intramuscularly compared to ponies supplemented with low levels of vitamin E. However, there are also reports with dietary supplements that show unaf- fected influenza vaccination responses (Brummer et al. 2013) or decreasing immunoglobulin concentra- tions in response to vaccination (Koke et al. 2015). \u00a92018 The Authors.

Several studies have shown positive effects of this supplement on the immune system in vivo and in vitro . Leslie et al. (1988, 1989) showed that daily administration of Bio- Strath/C226prolonged survival time in old mice, even after infection with Staphylococcus aureus . As mor- tality rates in mice infected with Staphylococcus aur- euswere reduced and no changes in morbidity were observed, it was suggested that Bio-Strath/C226had a stress protectant effect (Leslie et al. 1988). In a study concerning the mode of action yielding higher sur- vival rates, it could be determined that Bio-Strath/C226 administration encourages more rapid and more ef-cient mobilization of leucocytes including helper T- lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes in mice (Joller 1988; Joller & Aeppli 1989). Similar ndings were seen in T-lymphocytes activation in vitro under the stress of low-gravity as part of space biological inves- tigations. The addition of the food supplement partlyrestored or even increased expression of activation markers on T-lymphocytes after low-gravity expo- sure (Schwarzenberg et al. 2000). At present, no sci- entic evidence is available illustrating the effects of Equi-Strath /C226on the horses' health. The present study examined the effect of Equi-Strath/C226supple- mentation on antibody production and haematologi- cal parameters in response to a H3N8 influenza booster vaccination in healthy Franches-Montagnesstallions. Material and methods Animals The experiment was carried out at the Swiss National Stud in Avenches, and included 20 stallions of the Franches-Montagnes breed. All horses used for the study were clinically healthy at the start of the exper- iment and had pre-existing antibody titres. The stal-lions were on average 9.5 /C64.5 years old, and had a bodyweight of 525 /C630 kg (mean /C6standard devia- tion). All of them were primary vaccinated and had received booster vaccinations every 6 months withthe same strain as used in the current study. The stal- lions were kept in individual box stalls with straw orwood chip bedding and were fed hay or haylage. In addition, oats, barley, corn and pellets were fed daily. Water and a mineral salt block were available ad libi- tum. All animals were regularly exercised and were turned out daily into a paddock throughout the study. Experimental design The stallions were randomly divided into two groups (drawn by lot), a study group (SG, n=10; 8.6/C64.9 years, mean /C6standard deviation) and a control group (CG, n=10; 10.5 /C64.1 years, mean/C6standard deviation). The animals of the study group each received daily a 0.06 mL/kg body- weight of Equi-Strath /C226,orally. The control group (CG) received a placebo equivalent in consistency, taste and colour as Equi-Strath/C226, at the same quan- tity daily. The feeding staff were blinded to the group allocation of the stallions. The experiment lasted for 14 weeks starting in October 2013. The supplement and the placebo were given from the beginning of the study (week 0) until week 14 of the trial. This treatment was also used for a parallel study on the effects of Equi-Strath/C226sup- plementation on semen quality and quantity (Burger et al. , manuscript in preparation). Vaccination, blood sampling and immunological assay After 10 weeks of daily supplementation with Equi- Strath/C226, all horses were vaccinated against vet., Animal Health GmbH,Lucerne, Switzerland) as part of their half-yearly routine booster vaccinations which were performed with the same vaccine for the previous 18 months The vaccine was administered by intramuscularinjection in the left side of the neck. Immediately before week 10 of supplementation, which represents day 0 of the present study, and twice after vaccina- tion (days 14 and 32 after vaccination), blood was \u00a92018 The Authors.

Veterinary Medicine and Science (2018), 4, pp. 133-139H.A. van Dorland et al. 134sampled and analysed in order to determine the titres of specic antibodies. All blood samples werecollected from the left jugular vein, immediately cen- trifuged (4000 gfor 10 min) and the serum frozen at /C020\u00b0C until analysis. Antibody titres were deter- mined via the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using the European representative strain A/equine/ Suffolk/89 of subtype H3N8. The HI test was per- formed on microtitre plates according to standard procedures (Ofce International des Epizooti /C19es (OIE), 1996). In addition, a Procyte Dx Haematology analysis Titre data were log2 transformed, and subsequently analysed using the mixed models procedure (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measures. Two age classes were formed with horses <9 years being class 1, and horses 10 years being class 2. The model included the group (horses with Equi-Strath /C226 vs. horses with Placebo), the sampling time-point (day 14 and day 32 after vaccination) and their inter- action, and age class as xed effects. In addition, the titre before the vaccination (day 0) was used as covariable in the model to adjust for initial differ- ences between the two groups. The animal was speci- ed as a random effect to accommodate repeated measures of single individuals. The interaction effect was dropped from the model as this was not shownto be signicant during initial analysis. Data on changes in titre compared to the titre measured before vaccination (Day 0) were analysed with the general linear model (GLM) procedure (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC), including group and age class as xed effects in the model. The interaction was dropped from the model as this was shown to be not signicant during initial analysis. Effects were signicant if P0.05. Model assumptions were checked using a graphical analysis of residuals and normality of errors and random effects were assessedbased on qq-plots. The Mann -Whitney U test was used to compare differences between the two groups (SG vs. CG) for blood count components on day 0 before the vaccination, and for the change in bloodcount components between day 0 and 32 after the vaccination. Results and discussion Antibody titres According to studies in mice infected with Staphy- lococcus (Joller 1988; Joller & Aeppli are expected to be more efciently and more rapidlyactivated after administration of Strath /C226products. To evaluate the effect of Equi-Strath/C226on the immune system of healthy stallions, antibody titres were measured before and after H3N8 influenza vaccination. The results of the present study showed a numerically linear increase in haemag- glutination inhibition titres in both groups after vaccination. However, no statistically signicant effect ( P=0.66) of sampling time-point was observed. In Gildea et al. (2011) as well as in other publications, it was shown that the immuneresponse after vaccination peaks at 2 to 4 weeks. With regard to the treatment, slightly higher titres in response to vaccination were observed in horses supplemented with Equi-Strath /C226compared to the horses receiving the placebo, although the measured antibody titres of the stallions supple- mented with Equi-Strath/C226did not differ cantly across time from those of the stallions supplemented with the placebo ( P=0.65; Fig- ure 1). Likely, our influenza vaccination was not a sufciently high and clinically relevant immune challenge to observe any effects from Equi- Strath/C226on the immune system, as was observed in the studies with mice infected with Staphylo- coccus aureus (Joller 1988; Joller & Aeppli 1989). The difference between day 14 to 0 and day 32 to 0 for means of titres ( DHI; Figure 2) conrms a lin- ear increase of the antibody titres over time, how- ever, no signicant effect of treatment was observed for any of the calculated differences. The sameapplies to the observed differences between day 14 to 32 being without a signicant treatment effect. Furthermore, we found an age class effect with younger horses having more markedly increased HI \u00a92018 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Veterinary Medicine and Science (2018), 4, pp. 133-139Influenza antibodies in horses with Equi-Strath/C226135titres compared to older horses ( P=0.02) during the rst 14 days after vaccination. Similarly Muirheadet al. (2010), showed age was a factor affecting the immune response, with aged horses having a signi- cantly reduced response to influenza vaccination compared to the younger adult horses, likely because they had higher pre-vaccination higher antibodytitres. In their review, Solana & Pawelec (1998) ques- tion the use of booster vaccination in older horses asthis may lead to a state of unresponsiveness due to 'clonal exhaustion' of the the current study, Equi-Strath /C226supplemen- tation did not modulate the immune response in stallions with respect to age.Fig. 1.

Veterinary Medicine and Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Veterinary Medicine and Science (2018), 4, pp. 133-139H.A. van Dorland et al. 136Complete blood count The blood count did not show any signicant differ- ence between the study group and the control group over time from day 0 until day 32. Interestingly, at the day of vaccination, after 14 weeks of supplementation, signicant differences between the groups in the WBC count, neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils(Table 1) were found. The total WBC count was increased in the control group compared to the study group increased in the placebo control group compared to the study group. Even though, the observed differences were statistically signicant, these small effects are not likely to be clinically relevant. As no blood samples for blood count were taken before the beginning of theadministration of Equi-Strath /C226no comparison before and after the 14 week supplementation could be made. Conclusion Daily Equi-Strath/C226supplementation did not affect the adaptive immune response in stallions after aroutine H3N8 influenza vaccination. An effect of clinical relevance of Equi-Strath/C226on the immune system in horses was not demonstrated through the immunological stimulation by booster vaccina- tion in horses with pre-existing immunity. It remains to be elucidated, whether Equi-Strath/C226 supplementation may induce a protective effect inhorses exposed to a stronger immune challenge or in immunologically na \u20acve horses without any previous vaccination.
