The men and women who work with us throughout the City not only have the right to a safe and healthy workplace but to work with a City striving to become the benchmark for all safety and health programs throughout the State of Texas. We have a sen se of urgency regardin g the safety and health of our c ontractors. This urgency will distance us from a reactionary and statutory based approach to a new progressive leadership style approach. This approach will be the driving force behind our safety and health program. We will provide mechanisms for increased hazard awareness, employee involvement, local management ownership , and more City management visibility. This will foster open and clear communication concerning workplace safety and allow us to mo re closely monitor conditions in the workplace and integrate safety and health i nto the normal flow of business as well as improve hazard awareness of our contractors. The safety and health of our contractors and their employees is an investment and not a cost. Implementation of this program will result in the City of Austin leading the way in the health and safety arena within the State of Texas. We will set a standard of e xcellence in health and s afety for others to follow. ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only DISCLAIMER The purpo se of the Project Safety Manual is to assist in the development and implementation of appropriate safety standards. It acts as a guideline to safety during the construction, renovation , and expansion activities to be completed by independent contractors wo rking on any ROCIP project for the City of Austin. The program is based on applicable government regulations, insurance related safety/risk management requirements, accepted safety practices within the construction industry, and common sense. The mainten ance of safe premises, operations and equipment, protection of the employees, and the community, and the avoidance of unsafe conditions and practices (during all construction phases) are the responsibility of the Controlling Contractors and Subcontractors performing the work. Compliance with all the provisions of this Project Safety Manual may not guarantee or ensure compliance with all the requirem ents of the Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 CFR 1926 and 29 CFR 1910) and all othe r applicable standards. This manual is not intended to replace the requirement for each Controlling Contractor and Subcontractor to establish and maintain a proper Safety Program as directed by the Federal Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Act (Titles 29 CFR 1926 and 29 CFR 1910) the State of Texas and all other applicable standards. No part of this manual is intended to circumvent or supersede federal, state, or local regulations. If these regulations exceed the requirements of this manual the federal, state, or local regulation shall take precedence. If the manual exceeds these regulations, the manual shall apply. If the manual does not address a topic the federal, state, or local regulations shall apply. ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Statement of Safety and Health P olicy To: All Contractors and Their Employees Safety and health on all construction projects for the City of Austin must be a part of every operation. Safety and health is the responsibility of each contractor and every employee on the job site regardl ess of level. It is the intent of the City of Austin to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local safety regulations. To do this those responsible must constantly be aware of conditions in the work areas that can produce injury. No supervisor shall require an employee to work at a job he or she knows to be unsafe or unhealthy. The Contractor shall furnish to each of its employees and workers a place of employment and employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or like ly to cause death or serious physical harm to its employees and workers and shall comply and has the general duty to comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Policy and under the OSH Act. Each employee and worker shall co mply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this Policy and Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct. In practice, if the following elements are present, a \"general duty claus e\" violation has occurred: 1) The Contractor failed to keep the workplace free of a hazard to which employees or workers of that Contractor were exposed. 2) The hazard was recognized. 3) The hazard was causing or was likely to cause death or serious physical harm. 4) There was a feasible and useful method to correct the hazard. It is the intent of the City of Austin and the ROCIP Program Safety Manager to enforce these requirements whenever a particular section of this Manual or the federal standard does not explicit ly cover a specifically recognized hazard. Compliance by both the contractors and their employees in detecting hazards controlling them is a condition of continued presence on the job site. Supervisors should be immediately informed of any unsafe conditi on. Where correction of any unsafe situation is beyond a supervisors ability or authority it shall be reported to the ROCIP Safety Team. The personal safety and health of each employee working on any ROCIP project is of primary importance. The preventi on of occupational -induced injuries and illnesses is of such consequence that it shall be given precedence over production at all times. To the greatest degree possible contractors shall provide all means required for the personal safety and health of the ir workers. ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Each c ontractor will maintain a s afety program conforming to the best practices of the construction i ndustry. To be successful such a program must embody the proper attitudes toward injury and illness prevention from all levels of manageme nt and employees. It also requires cooperation i n all safety and health matters not only between supervisor and em ployee but also between each employee and his/her fellow workers. Only through such a cooperative effort can a safety culture be established and maintained. The objective of the City of Austin is a Safety Program that will achieve zero accidents and injuries. All contractor Safety Programs must include: 1. Enforcement and compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local safety re gulations. 2. Provision for the necessary mechanical and physical safeguards to assure maximum protection for employees working on the project and the general public. 3. Provision for a Safety Representative to conduct safety and health inspections, to locate and correct unsafe working conditions or practices, to control health hazards, and to comply fully with the safety and health standards of this program . 4. Provision for training of all employees in safety and health practices. 5. Provision for the necessary personal protective equipment and training for its use and care. 6. Development and enforce ment of safety and health rules and the requirement for all employees to cooperate with the rules as a condition of employment. 7. Provision for prompt an d thorough investigation of every accident to determine the cause and implement corrective action to prevent reoccurrence. 8. Provision to pre -plan all phases of work. No new phase of work will begin until a Job Hazard Analysis (JSA) has been conducted and reviewed and all potentially hazardous job operations are anticipated. 9. Provisions for an Emergency Action Plan and for access for emergency services at all times. ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only The success of this Program relies on the participation of all parties to take responsibili ty for the safety and health on all projects. Contractors are responsible for the implementation of a safety program th at develops a positive attitude in supervision and employees towards safety and is directed to ensure that all operations will be per formed with the utmost regard for the safety and health of all involved. Employees are to be held responsible for a wholehearted genuine cooperation with al l aspects of the Safety Program including compliance with all rules and regulations and for continu ously practicing safety while performing their duties. ____________________________________ __________________________ Contractor s Signature ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only City of Austin ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SAFETY RESPONSIBILITY I, ____________________________________ as a duly authorized representative for the below referenced firm do hereby attest that I have reviewed this ROCIP Project Safety Manual.

Evaluation Testing . The entry supervisor will ensure that the atmosphere of a confined space is analyzed using equipment of suffi cient sensitivity and specificity to identify and evaluate any hazardous atm ospheres that may exist . This is required to ensure that appropriate permit entry procedures can be developed and acceptable entry conditions stipulated for that specific space. Evaluation and interpretation of this data and dev elopment of the entry procedure will be done by, or reviewed by, a technically qualified person based on evaluation of all serious hazards. The internal atmosphere will be tested with a calibrated direct -reading instrument for the following conditions in the order given: (1) Oxygen content (2) Flammable gases and vapors (3) Potential toxic air contaminants Verification Testing. The atmosphere of a permit space which contains a hazardous atmos phere will be re -tested prior to the entrant entering the space for contaminants i dentified by evaluation testing to verify acceptable entry conditions. Results of this testing will be recorded on the permit in the space provided adjacent to the stipulate d acceptable entry condition. Duration of Testing. Measurement of values for each atmospheric parameter will be made for at least the minimum response time of the test instrument specified by the manufacturer. Testing will be continuous for all Permit Required Spaces with at least one monitor inside the space and one monitor outside the space with the ability to test inside the space (active pump monitor with sufficient length hose) if practicable . Testing Stratified Atmospheres. When monitoring for entries involving a n accent or descent into a confined space where the atmosphere may be stratified the atmosphere will be tested at a distance of approximately every 4 feet in the direction of travel and to each sid e. If a sampling probe is used the rat e of progress will be slowed to accommodate the sampling speed and detector response. The stratified atmosphere will be tested by the same means as referenced above. There is a presumption that all spaces are subject to stratified atmosphere and should be tested accordingly. Prior to work beginning the supervisor shall : Implement the means, procedures, and practices necessary for safe permit space entry operations, including, but not limited to, the following: 5 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Specifying acceptable entry conditions .

Competent Person (for ladders) means a person possessing the ability to identify hazardous or dangerous conditions and shall have the authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate these conditions. A Competent Person shall kn ow how to detect defects as well as the proper procedures to follow when equipment is found to be defective. All other definitions of 29 CFR 1926 subpart X shall apply. 5. Requirements 5.1 Ladder Selection Criteria The following table outlines the weight -capacity classifications for approved ladder types: TYPE APPLICATION WORKING LOAD IAA Construction/Services/Shop/Warehouse 375 lbs. Maximum IA Construction/Services/Shop/Warehouse 300 lbs. Maximum I Construction/Services/Shop/Warehouse 250 lbs. Maximum Only type IAA , IA, or I ladder are approved for ROCIP projects . Ladders of these types should only be of fiberglass/non -conductive material. Wood or job -made ladders are discouraged and require approval by a Competent Person for use under special circumstances. 2 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Any future -developed ladder with a rating higher in working load capac ity than the type IAA is acceptable. 5.2 Training Contractor(s) shall provide annual training to all employees utilizing ladders either separately or in conjunctio n with fall p rotection training. Ladder safety shall also be covered as a part of a new employees orientation. Individual refresher training shall be required of all employees engaged in work - related near -miss or injury incidents involving ladders. All training related to applicable ladders shall include: The nature of ladder hazards in the work site . As applicable, the correct procedures for construction (job -made ladders), use, placement and care in handling all ladder types and styles . The maximum intended load -carrying capacities of all ladder types and styles . Applicable standa rds contained in 29 CFR 1926 subpart X and those of this policy section . 5.3 Inspections Ladders shall be visually inspected before use. Ladder defects include but are not limited to: Structural defects -such as bent, broken or missing rungs, cleat s, or steps, broken or split rails, corroded components, or other faulty or defective components . Such ladders shall be immediately removed from service and tagged with \"DANGEROUS -DO NOT USE\" sign/tag and immediately reported to your supervisor or a desig nated Competent Person . Such ladders are to be removed from the work area for proper disposal or repair by personnel trained to manufacturers standards. 5.4 Ladder Use and Transportation 5.4.1 Choosing the Proper Ladder Before a ladder is used i t shall be determined that a ladder is the best device to use. Scaffolds and mechanical lifts may be a better choice for 3 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only certain situations. Once a ladder has been d etermined to be the best option the proper ladder shall be chosen. Ladders shall be chose n in accordance with the job to be performed. Choose ladders based on the ladders rated strength, usable height , and load specification. The combined weight of the user, their tools , and materials shall not exceed the rating of the ladder. Each ladder shal l have a duty rating displayed on a label affixed to the ladder. 5.4.2 Transporting Two people should carry step ladders over 10 feet, and straight/extension ladders 20 feet or greater in length. Any ladder less than ten feet (10) in length can be carried by one contractor when supporting the ladder in the middle and to his/her side. Ladders stored on/in vehicles shall be secured from movement at both ends. Materials used to secure such ladders shall be properly sized and inspected for decay befo re use and discarded if in disrepair. Ladders projecting more than three (3) feet from the vehicle body shall be marked with a red flag. 5.4.3 Setup Rules All ladders shall be placed on firm stable footing. If the ladder is positioned by a door or walkway ensure that the door is locked or the walkway is barricaded to prevent collisions. Keep ladders at least ten feet (10) away from energized power lines (all personnel shall be trained and instructed to watch for overhead power lines before ere cting any ladder). When using portable extensi on ladders identify the best location that allows for the proper securing of the ladder at the base and/or top. Barriers and/or warnings should be posted while working on a ladder in any high -traffic areas. 4 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only 5.4.4 Setup and Use 5.4.4.1 Portable Step Ladders Ensure that the folding cross braces on the ladder are locked in the proper position. Ensure that the bottom areas of the ladder are kept clear and free of debris. Ensure that a portable st ep ladder is never utilized as a straight or extension ladder (for example, leaning it against an object when climbing). Place the top step directly under or slightly in -front of the intended work area. It is good practice to have someone hold any ladd er over twelve feet (12) in height while ascending/descending/ performing work. Where possible, do not work with the side rails facing the working surface. Never climb the back side of a ladde r. 5.4.4.2 Portable Straight and Extension Ladders Place a straight or extension ladder at an angle of 4:1. For every 4 feet of height, the base of the ladder should be out 1 foot (i.e., one horizontal foot from the support point). Ensure that both side rails make contact with the structure at the bearing point. All ladder s must extend at least three feet (3) (approximately three rungs) beyond the surface being accessed. Further overlap adds stability. Straight or extension ladder are not to be placed in a horizontal position as a substitute for a scaffo ld or a runway between two elevated locations. Straight or extension ladder are never to be placed directly against a windowpane or sash. 5 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Ensure that the top and bottom areas of the ladder are kept clear and free of debris. 5.5 General Rules for Use All ladders shall only be used as specified by the manufacturer. Never jump from or onto any ladder. Never slide down a ladder. Never \"walk\" a ladder while working on it. Never \"jump\" a ladder while working on it. Remove any ice, snow, mud or oth er slippery substance from the rungs/steps. Always use the 3 -point rule when climbing up or down. At least two hands and one foot, or two feet and one hand, should be in contact with the ladder at all times. Ladders cannot be moved, shifted or extended while employees are on them. Always face the ladder when ascending or descending. If tools are needed they should be carried in a tool belt or pulled up with a rope once the employee has reached his/her destination. When ascending or descending tools/equipment/supplies that cannot be readily carried in a tool pouch shall be handled by another employee on the ground or lowered/raised to/from the ground by the employee on the ladder once positioned safely on the ladder. Do not store tools or material s on the top of ladders unless specifically designed for this purpose . Do not lean out side the frame rails of a ladder . This could cause the user to lose balance and fall. With a properly positioned ladder the work should always be directly in front of y ou. Wear slip resistance f ootwear for climbing/descending such as work boots. Do not use the top two steps of a portable stepladder and the top four rungs on extension ladders. Those steps/rungs are necessary for balance only. Obtain a larger ladder if more height is needed. 6 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Always climb slowly with your weight centered between side rails. Never join two short ladders to make a longer one. 5.6 Maintenance and Storage 5.6.1 Maintenance Ladder shall be maintained in accordance with the manu facturer recommendations. Ladders should never be painted (other than for property marking) because paint may hide defects that could lead to ladder failure. 5.6.2 Storage Never store ladders in such a way that they present a tripping hazard or could potentially fall on employees . Keep ladders in areas where they will not come into contact with oil, grease , or other slipping hazards. Store and secure ladders in a safe an d dry place out of direct exposure to the sun and other weather elements whenev er possible. 6.

References 29 CFR 1926, 29 CFR Safety Policy & Procedures -11 /10- Authorized Duplication Only Respiratory Protection - 24 1. Policy Employees will be protected from the adverse effects of airborne contaminants or a lack of oxygen. Respiratory protection shall only be used when engineering controls are not feasible or while these engineering controls are being instituted. 2. Purpose To provide guidance for respirator use in order to protect employees from any exposure to airborne hazards. This policy is designed to com ply with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Respiratory Protection Standard (29CFR 1910.134). 3. Scope Applies to all ROCIP projects. 4. Definitions IDLH - \"Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health\". An atmosphere that poses an immediate threat to life, would cause irreversible adverse health effects, or would impair a persons ability to escape from a dangerous atmosphere. Respirator - Any personal protective equipment which is designed to protect a persons respirato ry tract. Respirators include: Negative pressure air purifying devices - Respirators in which the air pressure inside the facepiece is negative during inhalation with the respect to the ambient air pressure outside the respirator. Filtering facepieces ( commonly referred to as dust masks) fall under this category. Positive pressure air supplying devices - Respirators in which the pressure inside the respiratory inlet covering exceeds the ambient air pressure outside the respirator. Self -contained breath ing apparatus (SCBA) certified by NIOSH for a minimum service life of 30 minutes, or a combination full facepiece pressure demand supplied air respirator with auxiliary self -contained air supply are examples of positive pressure air supplying devices. Powe red Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) - Respirators in which ambient air is pulled through a filter by a battery driven motor and forced into either a loose fitting hood or a tight fitting face piece. Escape -only respirators - Respirators intended for use on ly in escaping a hazardous atmosphere (e.g. loose -fitting respirators) Hood - A respiratory inlet covering that completely covers the head and neck and may also cover portions of the shoulders and torso. 2 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Employee Exposure means exposure to a concentratio n of an airborne contaminant that would occur if the contractor were not using respiratory protection. End-of-service -life Indicator (ESLI) means a system that warns the respirator user of the approach of the end of adequate respiratory protection, for e xample, that the absorbent is approaching saturation or is no longer effective. Fit Factor means a qualitative estimate of the fit of a particular respirator to a specific individual, and typically estimates the ratio of the concentration of a substance in ambient air to its concentration inside the respirator when worn. Fit Test means the use of a protocol to qualitatively or quantitatively evaluate the fit of a respirator on an individual (see Qualitative Fit Testing and Quantitative Fit Testing). Oxygen Deficient means an atmosphere with oxygen content below 19.5% by volume. Qualitative Fit Testing means a pass/fail test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individuals response to the test agent. Quantitative Fit Testing means an assessment of the adequacy of respirator fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator. All the definitions of 29 CFR 1910 subpart I apply. 5. Requirements 5.1 Requirements Respiratory protection requirements will be in cluded in all hazard analysis. Confined Space Entry Permits, Welding, Cutting, and Hot Work Permits may also require respiratory equipment requirements for the task(s) being performed. Employees shall not be allowed to enter an area requiring the use of a respirator without meeting a ll of the requirements of this p olicy and federal standards . Medical evaluations shall be required for respirator users. Parameters of the medical evaluation are determined by a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) and required regulations. Training and fit testing shall be required initially (prior to use) and annually thereafter for all respirator users. Respirators not in use shall be maintained according to the manufacturers requirements . 3 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only 5.2 Respirator Selection Respiratory hazards in the workplace must be evaluated to identify relevant workplace and user factors. Respirator selection will be based on those factors. This evaluation will include: Anticipated use of the material and emp loyee exposure potential . Employee monitoring data . Exposure limits set by OSHA or the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) . Recommendation for respiratory protection by the chemical manufacturer . Toxicity of the material . Note : Where the employee exposure cannot be easily ide ntified or reasonably estimated the atmosphere will be considered to be IDLH. A self -contained breathing apparatus will be required for all IDLH or potentially IDLH atmospheres. The respirator selected f or use in non -IDLH service must be appropriate for the state and physical form of the contaminant. Where negative pressure respirators are worn for prot ection against gases and vapors employees must change out cartridges upon usage need and concentratio n level of substances. The number of hours before cartridge change -out is required will be adjusted when there is sufficient data to determine the breakthrough period. Each cartridge shall be dated with the current date upon putting into service. Where negative pressure respirators are worn for protection against particulate (dust, mist, and fumes), an increase in breathing resistance or a change is smell or taste indicates that the filters should be changed out. Disposable dust masks should be changed out when there is an increase in breathing resistance or change in smell and after each use whichever occurs first. All air purifying respirators shall be NIOSH approved for the types and levels of contaminants they are to protect against. All SCBAs shal l be NIOSH approved with pressure demanded -regulators for the types and levels of contaminants they are to protect against. 4 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only 5.3 Respirator Assignment Employers shall be responsible for enforcing regular respirator use. Respirators shall be issued for routine and non -routine work to employees after medical evaluations, training and fit testing. A list of authorized users by respirator type shall be maintained by the employer . 5.4 Training The employer shall provide training to mee t the require ment for respiratory protection. All training will be conducted in accordance with Federal and State laws, and best industry practices. Training will include, but not limited to 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I. Training is required for all employees who wear respira tors prior to initial use. Additionally annual refresher training is required for all employees who wear respirators. Training will be accomplished through one -on-one instruction during the fit -test and through classroom training. The employer is respon sible for developing and conducting the classroom training. Training will consist of: Consequences of improper fit, use, or maintena nce on respirator effectiveness . Limitations and capabilities of the r espirators used by the employee . Instructions on how to change cartridges/canisters when breakthrough occurs . Appropriate use of respirators in emerge ncy situations . Specific instruction on inspection, donning/removing, performing a user seal check, what to do if problems are encountered during inspection, how to report problems , and how to obtain replacement equipment . Procedures for maintenance and sto rage of respirators . A familiarizing period of wear in normal air . How to recognize medical signs and symptoms that may limit or prevent the effective use o f respirators, i.e. shortness of breath or dizziness; and The general intent of the Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134) . In addition t o the annual refresher training retraining in the use of respiratory equipment will be provided if any of th ese situations occur: Changes in the workplace or the type of respirator render the previous training ineffective or obsolete Retraining shall occur before the next use of a respirator if: An employee is observed to demonstrate a lack of knowledge in th e use of a respirator . There are changes in the respiratory equipment . 5 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only In adequacies in the employees knowledge or use of the respirator indicate that the employee has not retained the understanding or skill needed. Any other situation arises in which the need for retraining in order to ensure proper respirator use is indicated. All employees who are required to wear respirators while performing tasks required by their job assignment and those employees who elect to voluntarily wear a respirator shall have respiratory training. Those employees who voluntarily wear a dust mask shall read Appendix D of 29 CFR 1910.134. 5.5 Medical Evaluation & Fit Testing The use of a respirator may place a physiological burden on an employee that can vary with the ty pe of respirator worn, the task being performed, the workplace conditions in which the respirator is being used , and the medical status of the employee. Because of this, it is required that each employee who is required to wear a respirator to perform the task(s) required by his/her job and those employees who voluntarily wear a respirator receive a medical evaluation prior to being fit -tested and prior to being asked to use a respirator. It is not necessary for an employee to have a medical evaluation to wear the escape -only respirator. Initial Evaluation All employees who will be required to use a respirator will com plete a medical questionnaire. In addition to completing t he questionnaire for evaluation employees will be required to have a baseline Pu lmonary Function Test. Additional Evaluations Additional Medical Evaluation will be required if: An employee reports medical signs or symptoms that are related to the ability to use a respirator . Observations during fit testing or in program evaluatio n indicate a need . A change occurs in workplace conditions that may result in a substantial increase in the physiological burden placed on an employee (e.g. significantly increased protective clothing requirements). 6 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Annual Evaluation After the i nitial medical evaluation an annual review is required for personnel who continue to be required to wear a respirator. Fit Testing Before an employee will be allowed to wear a tight -fitting respirator, negative , or positive pressure he/she must pass a fit test for the specific make, model, style, and size of the respirator to be used. Quantitative fit tests will be required for employees who are required to wear any negative pressure or supplied air respirator. In the event that a quantitative fit tes t cannot be performed a qualitative fit test will be performed in its place. The Administrator for Respiratory Protection program or their designee will conduct fit tests. Employees will be fit tested on each type of respirator that they are required to wear. Fit testing will be repeated annually and prior to the employee using a different respirator or type of respirator facepiece. Additional fit testing will also be required if there is a change in the persons physical condition that could affect res pirator fit. Employees who are to be fit tested to wear tight -fitting respirators must be clean shaven in the seal area. Documentation The employees fit test qualification will be kept in his/her file. Use of Respirators Employees are required to perform a user seal check every time they use a tight - fitting respirator. User seal checks are not intended to take the place of the required fit test. When conditions change in the workplace in a way that may affect the effectiveness of a respirator t he respiratory program administrator must be notified so that changes to the respiratory requirements can be made as needed. 5.6 Maintenance, Care, and Storage Cleaning and Disinfecting of Personal Negative -Pressure Respirators Respirators must be kep t clean and disinfected so that they are ready for use at all times. The employee is responsible for cleaning his/her respirator in accordance with the manufacturers requirements at the end of the shift each time the respirator has been used. 7 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Storag e of Respirators All personal respirators shall be stored to protect them from damage, contamination, dust, sunlight, extreme temperatures, excessive moisture and chemical damage. They should not be stored outdoors, in a process area, with tools or chemi cals, or underneath e quipment. The recommended mode of storage for personal respirators is inside a clean plastic bag. Respirators shall not be stored with cartridges attached. Each pair of cartridges is factory sealed in a plastic bag they are dated as to the date of manufacture. The cartridges have a shelf life of three years as long as they are unopened. Inspection of Respirators All respirators used in routine service shall be inspected before each use and during cleaning. The person who will b e wearing the respirator prior to each use must perform a before -use inspection. This includes supplied -air respirators as well as negative - pressure respirators. The inspection must include: A functional check of the respirator, tightness of connections , condition of the various parts including the facepiece, head straps , valves, connecting tube, cartridges and/or filters . A check of the elastomeric parts for pliability and signs of deterioration . Supplied -air respirators must be inspected to ensure that the breathing air cylinder is at least 90% full and that the regulator and warning devices work as designed. Breathing air cylinders that are less than 90% full (below the full mark) should be replaced and arrangements made to have the cylinder refilled. 5.7 Program Surveillance Program effectiveness shall be evaluated through regular inspections of each area/situation where respirators are used and stored. The safety coordinator or supervisor shall be responsible for these evaluations. Work areas where emergency respirator use may be required shall be reviewed . The procedures to be taken during an emergency are included in the emergency action plan established by the General C ontractor. 5.8 Recordkeeping Records of medical evaluatio ns shall be retained and made available per 29 CFR1910.134. 8 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only 5.8.1 Site Administrator for Respirator Protection In accordance with 1910.134, the site shall maintain a site administrator for respiratory protection. This administrator shall be resp onsible for overseeing of the respirator program including fit testing, training, and auditing. The site administrator must attend a refresher training every 3 years. 5.9 Respirator Details 5.9.1 SCBA Basics Open -circuit systems with pressure -deman d regulators are recommended for use in both oxygen -deficient and IDLH atmospheres. The buddy system is required when using SCBA in immediately dangerous to life health (IDLH) environments. All SCBA shall have an alarm that goes off when 20 -25% of the air is left. Any SCBA with less than a 15 -minute air supply may be used for emergency escape only. 5.9.2 Air Line Respirator Basics Air may be supplied from an air cylinder or a compressor (oxygen shall not be used). Cylinders are to be tested and m aintained according to DOT regulations and need to be properly labeled. As related to compressors: Contractor shall ensure that carbon monoxide levels in the breathing air do not exceed 10 PPM . Oil-lubricated types need either a high temperature or CO alarms or both. If only a high temperature alarm is used, the air shall be tested routinely to ensure a CO level of not more than 10 PPM . Alarms are necessary to indicate compressor failure and overheating . Between the compressor and the receiver air sha ll pass through a particulate filter followed by a bed of activated charcoal and moisture absorber. The filters and absorbents shall be inspected regularly and changed as necessary . The intake of the compressor should be protected by locating it away from sources of contamination such as auto ex haust or the exhaust of engines which run the compressor . 9 ROCI P Safety Policy & Procedures - 11/10- Authorized Duplication Only Air-line couplings shall not be the same size or types as other gas system outlets. In an immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) atmosphere: A wearer shall also have an auxiliary self -contained supply of respirable air for escape . A stand -by person with self -contained breathing apparatus shall be available for emergency rescue . Air-line respirators need a flow control valve to govern air flow . Air flow depends on the length of the hose and the mask and is specific for each respirator type, make , and approval. Never circumvent the manufacturers recommendations. Air -line respirators are approved as systems. Any interchange of parts between unit s of different manufacturers or systems shall void the NIOSH/MSHA approval. Breathing air quality shall meet the requirements of 1910.134 6. Responsibilities 6.1 Employer (s) Overall accountability for respiratory protection program with direct program implementation and maintenance assigned to the employers program administrator . The employer will review the effectiveness of the program on a regular basis. Ensure fit testing and training are properly documented.
