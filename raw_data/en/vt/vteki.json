The population's vulnerability grows as a result of a lack of effective helping agents and vaccines against the virus. The spread of viruses can be mitigated by minimizing close connections between people. Social distancing is a critical containment tool for COVID-19 prevention. In this paper, the social distancing violations that are being made by the people when they are in public places are detected. As per CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) minimum distance that should be maintained by people is 2-3 meters to prevent the spread of COVID- 19, the proposed tool will be used to detect the people who are maintaining less than 2-3 meters of distance between themselves and record them as a violation. As a result, the goal of this work is to develop a deep learning-based system for object detection and tracking models in social distancing detection. For object detection models, You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLO v3) is used in conjunction with deep sort algorithms to balance speed and accuracy. To recognize persons in video segments, the approach applies the YOLOv3 object recognition paradigm. An efficient computer vision-based approach centered on legitimate continuous tracking of individuals is presented to determine supportive social distancing in public locations by creating a model to generate a supportive climate that contributes to public safety and detect violations through camera.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-09-10", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
