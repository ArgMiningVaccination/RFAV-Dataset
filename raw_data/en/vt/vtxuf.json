Not only do we heal with herbs and flowers, we recognize the spirit in many substances as having power to heal, through essences and homeopathic preparations as well as through their symbolic associations. Our relationship to nature can be one of the most healing relationships available to us. Nature as a whole connects us with the elements and with the sense of interconnectedness of all that is. It allows us to transcend the illusion of separateness. We have some of our most profound moments of intense presence and peace when we are faced with the grandeur of the natural world. We humans often forget we are part of nature. Our use of language suggests a separateness and our literature often presents themes of man vs nature. What we may fail to realize is that when we are in any kind of conflict with nature we are in conflict with ourselves. [Spirit is an expression of all that is, the great Goddess, God or the limitless unmanifested; whatever we wish to call it, it's all about connectedness and unity. We are part of nature and we are spiritual beings and to heal one heals all.](http://lifeasahuman.com/files/2010/04/3035164894_9063a791d3_o.jpg) Spirit wants nothing more than for us to recognize this interconnectedness and to embrace and become fully conscious of our complete and unified spiritual truth. When we cooperate with nature and with spirit for our healing there is an opportunity for miraculous results on all levels of being. We can heal ourselves through nature and we can heal the planet by healing ourselves, and once we become fully conscious of our true nature we will be all the more inclined to want to do whatever we can to protect and nurture the natural world as it will be experienced directly as part of us, as we are part of it \u2014 sacred, magnificent and filled with Spirit. Spirit is what connects everything together. To be healed is to be whole, and when whole and complete, and unencumbered by inappropriate energies, we will simply heal ourselves naturally. This can be achieved through our connection to Spirit. In the Shamanic view one of the surest ways to invite spiritual healing is to work with our Power animals. I will write about Power Animals and how they benefit us next time, and share my story of how I met my first Power Animal.
