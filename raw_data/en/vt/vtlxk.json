We recommend use by men only. This file gets the process as close to natural as we could possibly get it. For safety, we're connecting with the body's own intelligence to regulate the production of testosterone. This means that the body's own intelligence will ensure that levels increase naturally, so as to not disturb the body's internal environment. When the internal environment is disturbed unnaturally, the body's own processes kick into gear to maintain balance by converting the body's excess testosterone into estrogen, via a process called aromatisation. The YouTube version has been built to be mild, but still potent. This is to ensure that you get results, but we're also mindful that this file may be abused. The advanced version has additional built in safeguards to prevent aromatisation, and slow down estrogen production. This is not a problem you should have, since this field is completely natural, and will work with the body's own intelligence to raise your natural levels. Here, aromatisation will still occur, however at a level which the body can handle, and which may pose beneficial for muscle growth and libido. When testosterone is increased naturally, the estrogen created is not detrimental to the male body. However, the built in safeguards are there 'just in-case'. We also recommend dietary changes to aide in blocking the aromatisation process, by inhibiting aromatase in the body. This involves Increasing regular consumption of celery, red wine, olive oil, oysters, cruciferous vegetables and parsley. Dietary changes are absolutely necessary if you are older in age or overweight. We highly recommend that you use this file in-conjunction with our androgen receptor file. Listen to the androgen receptor file, at least once, prior to listening to the Youtube version 2 - 3 times maximum. If you are planning on using the [advanced version](https://spiritualityzone.com/product/testosterone-megadose-boost-testosterone-naturally-advanced-version/), listen to the androgen receptor file at least twice, before listening to the advanced version once. You may listen to the advanced version once or twice maximum, daily. The [advanced version](https://spiritualityzone.com/product/testosterone-megadose-boost-testosterone-naturally-advanced-version/) increases the power and intelligence of the file dramatically. Besides the added safeguards mentioned above, this increased intelligence allows the user to engage with the energies to direct the body's testosterone production, as well as instruct the body on how best to utilise the increased testosterone. When playing this file, simply speak with it to give it directions. Here at Spirituality Zone, our aim is to produce files that are consciously intelligent, and I can say this may be one of our best so far, allowing you to direct the levels of production. Please be mindful of increased aggression levels, and reduce usage if needed. This is a file that you want to slowly build up use. Please also limit the number of times you play this file daily.
