Supplementary publications include: Presidential documents of the Hoover Administration (two volumes), Proclamations 1870-2037 and Executive Orders 5076-6070; Consolidated Indexes for 1936-1965; and Consolidated Tables for 1936-1965. [[Page vi]] EXPLANATION The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2021), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. [[Page vii]] Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000. ``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010. CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. [[Page viii]] An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume. The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Potts, Director, Office of the Federal Register January 1, 2021 [[Page ix]] EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. The 2020 Compilation contains the full text of those documents signed by the President that were required to be published in the Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation. Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are updated by individual issues of the Federal Register. Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2020 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 9976 appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2020 Comp., p. 1.'' Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.'' This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 2021, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv. For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and statements, can be found in the Compilation of Presidential Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. A selection of these Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Publishing Office, Washington, DC 20402. This book was prepared under the direction of John Hyrum Martinez, Director of the Publications and Services Division; Kimberly R. Tilliman, Supervisor of the Presidential and Legislative Publications Unit; and Lois M. Davis, Editor.

On Religious Freedom Day, we honor the foundational link between freedom and faith in our country and reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding the religious liberty of all Americans. Religious freedom in America, often referred to as our ``first freedom,'' was a driving force behind some of the earliest defining moments of our American identity. The desire for religious freedom impelled the Pilgrims to leave their homes in Europe and journey to a distant land, and it is the reason so many others seeking to live out their faith or change their faith have made America their home. More than 230 years ago, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which was authored and championed by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson famously expounded that ``all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of Religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.'' This statute served as the catalyst for the First Amendment, which enshrined in law our conviction to prevent government interference in religion. More than 200 years later, thanks to the power of that Amendment, America is one of the most religiously diverse nations in the world. [[Page 2]] Since I took office, my Administration has been committed to protecting religious liberty. In May 2017, I signed an Executive Order to advance religious freedom for individuals and institutions, and I stopped the Johnson Amendment from interfering with pastors' right to speak their minds. Over the last 3 years, the Department of Justice has obtained 14 convictions in cases involving attacks or threats against places of worship. To fight the rise of anti-Semitism in our country, I signed an Executive Order last month to ensure that Federal agencies are using nondiscrimination authorities to combat this venomous bigotry. I have also made clear that my Administration will not tolerate the violation of any American's ability to worship freely and openly and to live as his or her faith commands. My Administration also remains cognizant of the stark realities for people seeking religious liberty abroad and has made protecting religious minorities a core pillar of my Administration's foreign policy. Repressive governments persecute religious worshipers using high-tech surveillance, mass detention, and torture, while terrorist organizations carry out barbaric violence against innocent victims on account of their religion. To cast a light on these abuses, in July 2019, I welcomed survivors of religious persecution from 16 countries into the Oval Office. These survivors included Christians, Jews, and Muslims, who all shared similar stories of persecution. At the United Nations in September, I called on global leaders to take concrete steps to prevent state and non-state actors from attacking citizens for their beliefs and to help ensure the sanctity and safety of places of worship. And, last summer, the State Department convened its second Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, where our diplomats engaged a broad range of stakeholders in government and civil society, both religious and secular, to identify concrete ways to combat religious persecution and discrimination around the world and ensure greater respect for freedom of religion and belief. On this Religious Freedom Day, we reaffirm our commitment to protecting the precious and fundamental right of religious freedom, both at home and abroad. Our Founders entrusted the American people with a responsibility to protect religious liberty so that our Nation may stand as a bright beacon for the rest of the world. Today, we remain committed to that sacred endeavor and strive to support those around the world who still struggle under oppressive regimes that impose restrictions on freedom of religion. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2020, as Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that remind us of our shared heritage of religious liberty and that teach us how to secure this blessing both at home and around the world. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 3]] Proclamation 9977 of January 17, 2020 Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On August 28, 1963, nearly a quarter of a million people gathered in the August heat on the National Mall in Washington, DC, to hear the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., speak. People traveled to our Nation's Capital from places as far away as Atlanta and Los Angeles to witness one of the defining moments in American history. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. King articulated the founding dream of America, the vision of our Founders for all Americans to live as ``an heir of the legacy of dignity and worth.'' Today, we pause to honor the incredible life and accomplishments of Dr. King, who helped shape the Civil Rights Movement, gave hope to millions experiencing discrimination, and whose enduring memory inspires us to pursue a more just and equal society. Dr. King dedicated his life's work to fighting for the right of every American to achieve the American Dream. Born the son of a Baptist minister on Auburn Street in Atlanta, Dr. King became an American icon and hero to millions of freedom-loving peoples everywhere, propelled by his powerful and inspiring message of peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance. From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial before thousands to the quiet solitude of a jail cell in Birmingham, Dr. King evinced an unshakable commitment to create a better future, never relenting in his quest for justice. Since its inception, our Nation has served as a beacon of hope and opportunity around the world. America's promise of freedom and justice has guided our people through adversity to prosperity. Dr. King's life and legacy stands as a testament to that promise, one rooted in the inalienable rights of mankind and a commitment to freedom from persecution. Throughout his battle against segregation and discrimination, Dr. King praised his fellow demonstrators for returning ``back to the deep wells of democracy'' that trace their roots to our founding. We honor Dr. King's legacy and our Nation's heritage when we act to protect and expand freedom and opportunity. As President, I remain committed to safeguarding the promise of our Nation and the values we share, the values that Dr. King so ardently worked to achieve. My Administration works each day to ensure that all Americans have every opportunity to realize a better life for themselves and their families regardless of race, class, gender, or any other barriers that have arbitrarily stood in their way. We have seen historic economic growth, with more than 7 million new jobs since my election and record highs in African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American employment. Through a focused effort of deregulation and growth-oriented policies, we have unleashed the potential of the American economy and bolstered the strength of the greatest workforce in the world, the American workforce. We recognize that economic opportunity is the greatest engine for empowering individuals and families to overcome adversity, and we will continue to fight for opportunity for all Americans. On this day, we are reminded of what Dr. King described as ``our noble capacity for justice and love and brotherhood.'' As we pay tribute to Dr. [[Page 4]] King, I urge all Americans to heed his call to action so that we may build the ``Beloved Community'' that he envisioned, living up to the sacred promise for a better future woven into the fabric of our American identity. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2020, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. On this day, I encourage all Americans to recommit themselves to Dr. King's dream by engaging in acts of service to others, to their community, and to our Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9978 of January 21, 2020 National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Every person--the born and unborn, the poor, the downcast, the disabled, the infirm, and the elderly--has inherent value. Although each journey is different, no life is without worth or is inconsequential; the rights of all people must be defended. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, our Nation proudly and strongly reaffirms our commitment to protect the precious gift of life at every stage, from conception to natural death. Recently, we have seen decreases in the total number and rate of abortions in our country. From 2007-2016, the most recent period of analysis, the number and rate of abortions decreased by 24 percent and 26 percent, respectively. The rate of teen pregnancies--the vast majority of which are unplanned--has almost continuously decreased over the last quarter century, contributing to the lowest rate of abortions among adolescents since the legalization of abortion in 1973. All Americans should celebrate this decline in the number and rate of abortions, which represents lives saved. Still, there is more to be done, and, as President, I will continue to fight to protect the lives of the unborn. I signed into law legislation under the Congressional Review Act that allows States and other grantees to exclude organizations that perform abortions from their Title X projects. My Administration has also issued regulations to ensure Title X family planning projects are clearly separated from those that perform, promote, or refer for abortion as a method of family planning; to protect the conscience rights of healthcare workers and organizations, including with respect to abortion; and to ensure the Federal Government does not force employers that object, based on religious belief or moral conviction, to provide insurance for contraceptives, including those they believe cause early abortions. Additionally, I have called on the Congress to act to prohibit abortions of later-term babies who can feel pain. [[Page 5]] My Administration is also building an international coalition to dispel the concept of abortion as a fundamental human right. So far, 24 nations representing more than a billion people have joined this important cause. We oppose any projects that attempt to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, up to the moment of delivery. And we will never tire of defending innocent life--at home or abroad. As a Nation, we must remain steadfastly dedicated to the profound truth that all life is a gift from God, who endows every person with immeasurable worth and potential. Countless Americans are tireless defenders of life and champions for the vulnerable among us. We are grateful for those who support women experiencing unexpected pregnancies, those who provide healing to women who have had abortions, and those who welcome children into their homes through foster care and adoption. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we celebrate the wonderful gift of life and renew our resolve to build a culture where life is always revered. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22, 2020, as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. Today, I call on the Congress to join me in protecting and defending the dignity of every human life, including those not yet born. I call on the American people to continue to care for women in unexpected pregnancies and to support adoption and foster care in a more meaningful way, so every child can have a loving home. And finally, I ask every citizen of this great Nation to listen to the sound of silence caused by a generation lost to us, and then to raise their voices for all affected by abortion, both seen and unseen. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9979 of January 23, 2020 To Further Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Large Residential Washers By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2253), I issued Proclamation 9694, which imposed a safeguard measure for a period of 3 years plus 1 day comprising both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of large residential washers (washers) provided for in subheadings 8450.11.00 and 8450.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) and a TRQ on covered washer parts provided for in subheadings 8450.90.20 and 8450.90.60 of the HTS. I exempted covered imports from Canada and certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the measure. [[Page 6]] 2. On August 7, 2019, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) issued its report pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)), on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic washers industry (USITC, Large Residential Washers: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-204- 013). In its report, the USITC found that imports peaked in November and December of 2017, just before the safeguard measure was imposed, and again in February and March of 2019, at the opening of the second TRQ period. More recent data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection indicate that the number of imported units exceeded the 1.2-million-unit annual limit qualifying for the in-quota rate well before the end of the year in the first year of the measure and in less than 3 months in the second year of the measure. 3. Section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, upon petition of the majority of the representatives of the domestic industry, to reduce, modify, or terminate an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act when the President determines that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition. 4. After taking into account the information provided in the USITC's report, and after receiving a petition from the representative of the majority of the domestic industry, I have determined that the domestic industry has begun to make positive adjustment to import competition but that, despite that adjustment, increased imports of washers at peak times of the year have impaired the effectiveness of the action I proclaimed in 2018 under section 203 of the Trade Act, and modification of the action is warranted. 5. Section 204(b)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(2)) also authorizes the President to take such additional action under section 203 of the Trade Act as may be necessary to eliminate any circumvention of any action previously taken under such section. Pursuant to section 203(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(3)(B)), the President may proclaim a TRQ on the imported article. 6. I have further determined that additional action is necessary to eliminate circumvention of the TRQ by ensuring that within-quota quantities of imports of washers are spread throughout the year, thus eliminating the possibility that importers' concentration of imports of washers in a limited period would distort the quantity of washers in the U.S. market and undermine the positive effect of the TRQ on the domestic industry's adjustment to import competition. Accordingly, I have decided to allocate, on a quarterly basis, within-quota quantities of 1.2 million washers during the third year of the action, beginning February 7, 2020. 7. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: [[Page 7]] (1) In order to modify the quantitative limitations applicable to imports of washers under HTS subheadings 8450.11.00 and 8450.20.00, by allocating the within-quota quantities for the third quota year on a quarterly basis, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. (2) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. (3) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including the Annex hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7, 2020, and shall continue in effect as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. One year from the termination of the safeguard measure established in this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in the Annex to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD January 24, 2020 Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel articles on the national security of the United States, and on January 19, 2018, the Secretary transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States. Both reports were issued pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), and Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's findings that aluminum articles and steel articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. I therefore decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. I also decided to adjust the imports of steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. 3. In Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I decided to further adjust imports of aluminum articles by imposing quotas on such articles from the Argentine Republic (Argentina). In Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust imports of steel articles by imposing quotas on such articles from the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and in Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust imports of steel articles by imposing quotas on such articles from Argentina and the Republic of Brazil (Brazil). 4. In Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, I directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and steel articles, respectively, and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. 5. The Secretary has informed me that domestic steel producers' capacity utilization has not stabilized for an extended period of time at or above the 80 percent capacity utilization level identified in his report as necessary to remove the threatened impairment of the national security. Stabilizing at that level is important to provide the industry with a reasonable expectation that market conditions will prevail long enough to justify the investment necessary to ramp up production to a sustainable and profitable level. Capacity utilization in the aluminum industry has improved, but it is still [[Page 10]] below the target capacity utilization that the Secretary recommended in his report. Although imports of aluminum articles and steel articles have declined since the imposition of the tariffs and quotas, the Secretary has informed me that imports of certain derivatives of aluminum articles and imports of certain derivatives of steel articles have significantly increased since the imposition of the tariffs and quotas. The net effect of the increase of imports of these derivatives has been to erode the customer base for U.S. producers of aluminum and steel and undermine the purpose of the proclamations adjusting imports of aluminum and steel articles to remove the threatened impairment of the national security. 6. The derivative articles the Secretary identified are described in Annex I (aluminum) and Annex II (steel) to this proclamation. For purposes of this proclamation, the Secretary determined that an article is ``derivative'' of an aluminum article or steel article if all of the following conditions are present: (a) the aluminum article or steel article represents, on average, two-thirds or more of the total cost of materials of the derivative article; (b) import volumes of such derivative article increased year-to-year since June 1, 2018, following the imposition of the tariffs in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended by Proclamation 9739 and Proclamation 9740, respectively, in comparison to import volumes of such derivative article during the 2 preceding years; and (c) import volumes of such derivative article following the imposition of the tariffs exceeded the 4 percent average increase in the total volume of goods imported into the United States during the same period since June 1, 2018. The modifications to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States described in Annex I (aluminum) and Annex II (steel) to this proclamation implement the Secretary's determinations in this regard. 7. From June 2018 to May 2019, import volumes of steel nails, tacks, drawing pins, corrugated nails, staples, and similar derivative articles increased by 33 percent, compared to June 2017 to May 2018, and increased by 29 percent, compared to June 2016 to May 2017. From January 2019 to November 2019, import volumes of such articles increased by 23 percent, compared to the same period in 2017. Similarly, from June 2018 to May 2019, import volumes of aluminum stranded wire, cables, plaited bands, and the like (including slings and similar derivative articles) increased by 152 percent, compared to June 2017 to May 2018, and increased by 52 percent, compared to June 2016 to May 2017. From January 2019 to November 2019, import volumes of such articles increased by 127 percent, compared to the same period in 2017. Finally, from June 2018 to May 2019, import volumes of bumper and body stampings of aluminum and steel for motor vehicles and tractors increased by 38 percent, compared to June 2017 to May 2018, and increased by 56 percent, compared to June 2016 to May 2017. From January 2019 to November 2019, import volumes of such articles increased by 37 percent, compared to the same period in 2017. 8. It is the Secretary's assessment that foreign producers of these derivative articles have increased shipments of such articles to the United States to circumvent the duties on aluminum articles and steel articles imposed in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, and that imports of these derivative articles threaten to undermine the actions taken to address the risk to the national security of the United States found in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705. As detailed in the Secretary's reports, domestic [[Page 11]] production capacity to produce aluminum articles and steel articles for national defense and critical infrastructure is essential to United States national security. This domestic production capacity is used to provide the essential inputs of aluminum and steel used in derivative aluminum articles and derivative steel articles. The Secretary has assessed that reducing imports of the derivative articles described in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation would reduce circumvention and facilitate the adjustment of imports that Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended, made to increase domestic capacity utilization to address the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States. 9. Based on the Secretary's assessments, I have concluded that it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to adjust the tariffs imposed by previous proclamations to apply to the derivatives of aluminum articles and steel articles described in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation. This action is necessary and appropriate to address circumvention that is undermining the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended, and to remove the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States found in those proclamations. 10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of certain derivative articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation. Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of derivative aluminum articles specified in Annex I to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty, and all imports of derivative steel articles specified in Annex II to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty, with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2020. These rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), Canada, and the United Mexican States (Mexico) and to imports of derivative steel articles described in [[Page 12]] Annex II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea. The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of the derivative articles described in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation, and shall, from time to time, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative (USTR), review the status of such imports with respect to the national security of the United States. In the event of a surge of imports of any derivative article described in Annex I or Annex II to this proclamation from any excepted country, the Secretary, with the concurrence of the USTR, is authorized to extend application of the tariff imposed by this proclamation on imports of any derivative article experiencing such surge from such country, or to adopt appropriate quotas for imports of such derivative article from such country, or to negotiate a voluntary agreement with such country to ensure that imports of such derivative article from such country do not undermine the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended. The Secretary shall publish such action in the Federal Register and notification shall be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security. (2) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the USTR, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior executive branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to provide relief from the additional duties set forth in clause 1 of this proclamation for any derivative article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations. Such relief shall be provided for a derivative article only after a request for exclusion is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. If the Secretary determines that a particular derivative article should be excluded, the Secretary shall publicly post such determination and notify CBP concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 1 of this proclamation. For merchandise entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date the duty established under this proclamation is effective and with respect to which liquidation is not final, such relief shall be retroactive to the date the request for relief was accepted by the Department of Commerce. (3) Any derivative article described in Annex I or Annex II to this proclamation, except those eligible for admission under ``domestic status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, that is subject to the duty imposed by clause 1 of this proclamation and that is admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2020, may only be admitted as ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading. Any derivative article that is described in Annex I or Annex II to this proclamation, except those eligible for admission under ``domestic status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, that is subject to the duty imposed by clause 1 of this proclamation, and that was admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2020, will likewise be subject upon [[Page 13]] entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading added by this proclamation. (4) Derivative articles shall not be subject upon entry for consumption to the duty established in clause 1 of this proclamation merely by reason of manufacture in a U.S. foreign trade zone. However, derivative articles admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone in ``privileged foreign status'' pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation shall retain that status consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e). (5) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed on any derivative article imposed by clause 1 of this proclamation. (6) The Secretary, in consultation with CBP and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the Federal Register. (7) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD January 24, 2020 National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, we remember the 6 million Jews who perished in the Holocaust and pay tribute to the American soldiers and other Allied Forces who fought tirelessly to defeat the Nazi regime. We also recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism and to the two words that cannot be repeated often enough: Never Again. Driven by virulent hatred and unspeakable cruelty, the Nazis implemented a systematic and methodical plan to exterminate the Jewish people and others they deemed undesirable. Two out of three Jews in Europe and millions of other people were murdered. They were sent to ghettos, concentration camps, and death camps where they were persecuted, imprisoned, starved, tortured, and executed. It is simply unthinkable that such barbarity occurred just 75 years ago. The courageous survivors of the Holocaust continuously relive the nightmares of their experience. But they have persevered to bear witness so that all of us today and in the future never forget the Nazis' unconscionable attempt to destroy the Jewish people. Their undaunted spirit compels us to ensure that their stories live on. Those who are filled with hate must never succeed in their efforts to minimize, deny, or erase the Holocaust from our memories or our history books. We have a fundamental and collective duty to ensure that each new generation knows the truth. The lessons of the Holocaust must forever be engrained in the consciousness of humanity so that we can fulfill our solemn and sacred promise that such evil and hatred will never again come to power. In the ultimate act of defiance, the Jewish people rose up from the ashes of the Holocaust to found and build the modern State of Israel. As I have said in the past, the State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish people. To those who will seek the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people, we say: Never Again. Today, we honor the memory of those who were killed in the Holocaust. We cherish the survivors who ensured the perpetuation of the Jewish people. And we offer a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid to our brave soldiers who sacrificed everything for freedom. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 27, 2020, as a National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz. On this day, I call upon all Americans to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, prayers, and commemorations to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution and also acknowledge the sacrifices of those men and women who helped liberate the victims of this atrocity. [[Page 23]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9982 of January 24, 2020 National School Choice Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Each child is a gift from God who has boundless potential and deserves a fair shot at the American Dream. To have that fair shot, children and their families must be free to pursue an educational environment that matches their individual learning style, develops their unique talents, and prepares them with the knowledge and character needed for fulfilling and productive lives. During National School Choice Week, we ensure America's brightest days are ahead by again committing to fighting for every student's freedom to pursue the best possible education. Sadly, for decades, we have tolerated an education system that continues to fail too many children. At a time when our students need the skills to succeed in an ever-changing world, the ``Nation's Report Card'' shows that about two-thirds of our children are not Proficient readers. That means nearly two out of three students are not where they need to be. Our great Nation can no longer accept a two-tiered education system in which opportunity is decided by a child's neighborhood. The success of future generations determines the success of our Nation. With school choice, we can ensure the underserved children of our Nation are forgotten no more. Education freedom helps inspire and educate students by providing a learning environment that best fits their unique needs, and it allows families to make choices based on their individual situations. A growing number of States and their communities are taking bold action to ensure all students, regardless of background or socioeconomic status, can receive a great education. I applaud State, local, and tribal leaders who are actively working to empower more families with educational choice. The expansion of school choice, including out-of-district public, charter, magnet, private, religious, home, and online education programs, has provided life-changing opportunities to millions of students. My Administration is protecting and building upon efforts to expand access to a wide range of high-quality education options. Today, I renew my call on the Congress to focus on what is best for children and pass a Federal tax credit to support State-based educational choice programs. Through this historic investment, more than one million more students will receive an education that meets their needs, all without taking a single dollar from [[Page 24]] America's great public schools. I also renew the call for the Congress to expand and make permanent the highly successful DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, which has achieved historic success under my Administration. Education can open any door. During this National School Choice Week, we are heartened by the many students whose lives have been changed by the freedom to make their own educational choices. And we are motivated to continue to advance educational choice by the millions who are still denied the opportunity to choose the educational path that best meets their needs. We challenge all lawmakers to work to ensure that every child has the opportunity to fulfill their potential and achieve the American Dream. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 26 to February 1, 2020, as National School Choice Week. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9983 of January 31, 2020 Improving Enhanced Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public- Safety Threats By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In Executive Order 13780 of March 6, 2017 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States), I temporarily suspended entry of nationals of certain specified countries and ordered a worldwide review of whether the United States would need additional information from each foreign country to assess adequately whether nationals of that foreign country seeking to enter the United States pose a security or public-safety threat to the United States, and if so, what additional information was needed. The Secretary of Homeland Security, pursuant to Executive Order 13780 and in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, developed an assessment model using three categories of criteria to assess national security and public-safety threats: whether a foreign government engages in reliable identity-management practices and shares relevant information; whether a foreign government shares national security and public-safety information; and whether a country otherwise poses a national security or public-safety risk. Following a comprehensive worldwide review of the performance of approximately 200 countries using these criteria, the Secretary of Homeland Security presented the results of this review, focusing in particular on those countries that were deficient or at risk of becoming deficient in their [[Page 25]] performance under the assessment criteria. After a subsequent period of diplomatic engagement on these issues by the Department of State, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security submitted a report in September 2017, which found that eight countries were hindering the ability of the United States Government to identify threats posed by foreign nationals attempting to enter the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security then recommended that I impose travel restrictions on certain nationals of those countries. After consultation with relevant Cabinet officials and appropriate Assistants to the President, I issued Proclamation 9645 of September 24, 2017 (Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats). In Proclamation 9645, I suspended and limited the entry into the United States of certain nationals of eight countries that failed to satisfy the criteria and were unable or unwilling to improve their information sharing, or that otherwise presented serious terrorism-related risks. Those travel restrictions remain in effect today, with one exception. On April 10, 2018, I issued Proclamation 9723 (Maintaining Enhanced Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats), removing travel restrictions on nationals of the Republic of Chad. Chad had improved its identity-management and information-sharing practices by taking steps to issue more secure passports and by increasing the integrity of how its government handles lost and stolen passports. Chad also began to share information about known or suspected terrorists in a manner that makes that information available to the United States screening and vetting programs, and it created a new, standardized process for the United States to request relevant criminal information. Pursuant to my directives in section 4 of Proclamation 9645, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has continued to assess every 180 days and report to me on whether the interests of the United States require the suspension of or limitation on entry of certain classes of foreign nationals. DHS has also continued to assess ways to further improve its processes for measuring how countries perform under the assessment criteria. From July 2018 through August 2019, DHS updated its methodology to assess compliance with the assessment criteria, which has allowed for more in-depth analysis and yields even more granularity and increased accuracy regarding each country's performance under the criteria. In this updated methodology, the general overall criteria for review have not changed. The United States Government still expects all foreign governments to share needed identity-management information, to share national security and public-safety information, and to pass a security and public-safety risk assessment. Building on experience and insight gained over the last 2 years, DHS has, however, refined and modified the specific performance metrics by which it assesses compliance with the above criteria. For example, while the prior model determined whether a country shares certain needed information, the revised model accounts for how frequently the country shares that information and the extent to which that data contributes to border and immigration screening and vetting. As another example, the prior system asked whether a country issued electronic passports at all, whereas the refined metrics assess whether a country issues electronic passports for all major classes of travel documents. Similarly, the lost and [[Page 26]] stolen passports criterion previously assessed whether a country had prior instances of reporting loss or theft to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), whereas the revised model now assesses whether the country has reported lost or stolen passports to INTERPOL within 30 days of a report of a loss or theft. The DHS improvements to the assessment criteria also involve additional, and more customized, data from the United States Intelligence Community. DHS's original evaluation under Executive Order 13780 relied on existing intelligence products to assess the threat from each country. With the benefit of 2 years of experience, DHS has worked closely with the Intelligence Community to define intelligence requirements and customize intelligence reporting that offers a detailed characterization of the relative risk of terrorist travel to the United States from each country in the world. This additional detail improves DHS's assessment of national security and public-safety risk. In addition, DHS greatly increased the amount of information obtained from United States Embassies abroad, which work closely with foreign governments. United States Embassies are best positioned to understand their host countries' ability and willingness to provide information to the United States, and United States Embassies' assessments contribute to a clearer understanding of how well a foreign government satisfies the assessment criteria. DHS also consolidated statistical information on operational encounters with foreign nationals. This information speaks to the frequency with which a country's nationals commit offenses while in the United States or otherwise develop grounds for inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Finally, as more precise, granular data became available, it became clear that many countries were only partially implementing each criterion. The 2017 process had three basic potential compliance ratings for each criterion: in compliance, out of compliance, or unknown. The updated methodology allows the United States to account for ways in which countries partially comply with the metrics associated with each criterion. As a result, for example, countries that DHS assessed in the 2017 review have now received more nuanced, partial compliance ratings. In addition, the process now weighs each criterion and risk factor based on its degree of importance to the United States Government for conducting screening and vetting of visa applicants and other travelers to the United States. Using this enhanced review process, DHS conducted its most recent, worldwide review pursuant to Proclamation 9645 between March 2019 and September 2019. The process began on March 11, 2019, when the United States Government formally notified all foreign governments (except for Iran, Syria, and North Korea) about the refined performance metrics for the identity-management and information-sharing criteria. After collecting information from foreign governments, multilateral organizations, United States Embassies, Federal law enforcement agencies, and the Intelligence Community, multiple subject matter experts reviewed each country's data and measured its identity- management and information-sharing practices against the criteria. DHS then applied the data to an algorithm it developed to consistently assess each country's compliance with the criteria. DHS identified the worst-performing countries for further interagency review and for an assessment of the potential impact of visa restrictions. As [[Page 27]] in the worldwide review culminating in Proclamation 9645, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security assessed that Iraq did not meet the baseline for compliance. As part of the interagency review process, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security determined, however, not to recommend entry restrictions and limitations for nationals of Iraq. In his report, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security recognized a close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected government of Iraq, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Acting Secretary of Homeland Security considered another similarly situated country and determined that, for reasons similar to those present in Iraq, entry restrictions and limitations would not be appropriate. In addition, the United States Government, led by the Department of State, continued or increased engagements with many countries about those countries' deficiencies. A number of foreign governments sent senior officials to Washington, D.C., to discuss those issues, explore potential solutions, and convey views about obstacles to improving performance. As a result of this engagement, one country made sufficient improvements in its information-sharing and identity-management practices and was removed from consideration for travel restrictions. On September 13, 2019, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, after consulting with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other appropriate agencies, submitted a fourth report to me recommending the suspension of, or limitation on, the entry of certain classes of nationals from certain countries in order to protect United States national security, including by incentivizing those foreign governments to improve their practices. The Acting Secretary of Homeland Security recommended maintaining the current restrictions on the seven countries announced in Proclamation 9645 (apart from Chad), as well as implementing suspensions and limitations on entry for certain nationals of twelve additional countries. Since the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security issued his report on September 13, 2019, the Secretary of State, consistent with section 4(b) of Proclamation 9645, has continued to engage many foreign governments regarding the deficiencies identified in DHS's report and has continued to consult with the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, and other Cabinet-level officials about how best to protect the national interest. Based on these engagements, in January 2020, those senior officials recommended that I maintain the entry restrictions adopted in Proclamation 9645 (as modified by Proclamation 9723), and that I exercise my authority under section 212(f) of the INA to suspend entry into the United States for nationals of six new countries--Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania--until those countries address their identified deficiencies. The January 2020 proposal recommended visa restrictions on fewer countries than identified by the September 2019 DHS report. For example, the January 2020 proposal recommended no entry restrictions on nationals of one country that had been recommended for restrictions in the September 2019 report. This country made exceptional progress in correcting deficiencies since the September 2019 report, such that it could no longer be [[Page 28]] characterized as a country that is among those posing the highest degree of risk. In addition, the January 2020 proposal recommended that, for five poorly performing countries, foreign policy interests warranted a different approach than recommended in the September 2019 report. Specifically, the January 2020 proposal suggested that diplomatic engagement and requests for specific improvements during a defined 180- day period would be more appropriate and more likely to result in immediate improvements in these five countries. Each of these five countries provides critical counterterrorism cooperation with the United States and therefore holds strategic importance in countering malign external actors. In several of the five countries, the United States has experienced a recent deepening of diplomatic ties that generally mark increased cooperation toward achieving key regional and global United States foreign policy goals. Importantly, all five countries have credibly communicated willingness to work directly with the United States Government to correct their outstanding deficiencies, and the United States believes progress is imminent for several countries and underway for others. For these reasons, these countries will be given an opportunity to show specific improvements in their deficiencies within the next 180 days. Consistent with recommendations contained in the January 2020 proposal, I have decided to leave unaltered the existing entry restrictions imposed by Proclamation 9645, as amended by Proclamation 9723, and to impose tailored entry restrictions and limitations on nationals from six additional countries. I have decided not to impose any nonimmigrant visa restrictions for the newly identified countries, which substantially reduces the number of people affected by the proposed restrictions. Like the seven countries that continue to face travel restrictions pursuant to Proclamation 9645, the six additional countries recommended for restrictions in the January 2020 proposal are among the worst performing in the world. However, there are prospects for near-term improvement for these six countries. Each has a functioning government and each maintains productive relations with the United States. Most of the newly identified countries have expressed a willingness to work with the United States to address their deficiencies, although it may take some time to identify and implement specific solutions to resolve the deficiencies. Consistent with the January 2020 proposal, I have prioritized restricting immigrant visa travel over nonimmigrant visa travel because of the challenges of removing an individual in the United States who was admitted with an immigrant visa if, after admission to the United States, the individual is discovered to have terrorist connections, criminal ties, or misrepresented information. Because each of the six additional countries identified in the January 2020 proposal has deficiencies in sharing terrorist, criminal, or identity information, there is an unacceptable likelihood that information reflecting the fact that a visa applicant is a threat to national security or public safety may not be available at the time the visa or entry is approved. For two newly identified countries that were among the highest risk countries, but performed somewhat better than others, I have decided, consistent with the January 2020 proposal, to suspend entry only of Diversity Immigrants, as described in section 203(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1153(c). Such a suspension represents a less severe limit compared to a general restriction on immigrant visas, given the significantly fewer number of aliens [[Page 29]] affected. The Acting Secretary of Homeland Security considers foreign- government-supplied information especially important for screening and vetting the Diversity Visa population in comparison to other immigrant visa applicants, and I agree with that assessment. In many cases, the United States Government may not have the same amount of information about Diversity Visa applicants compared with other categories of immigrant visa applicants because Diversity Visa applicants, with limited exceptions, do not have the burden to show certain family ties to or employment in the United States, or particular service to the United States Government, as required for other immigrant visa categories. Consistent with the January 2020 proposal, I have decided not to impose any restrictions on certain Special Immigrant Visas for nationals of the six newly identified countries. Applicants under Special Immigrant programs generally do not need to demonstrate the same work or familial ties as other immigrant visas, but do need to show other unique qualifications. This exception is intended to cover those Special Immigrants who have advanced United States interests (and their eligible family members), such as foreign nationals who have worked for a United States Embassy for 15 years or more and are especially deserving of a visa. As President, I must continue to act to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people. I remain committed to our ongoing efforts to engage those countries willing to cooperate, to improve information-sharing and identity-management protocols and procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks. And I believe that the assessment process, including enhancements made to that process, leads to new partnerships that strengthen our immigration screening and vetting capabilities. Until the countries identified in this proclamation satisfactorily address the identified deficiencies, I have determined, on the basis of a recommendation from the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and other members of my Cabinet, to impose certain conditional restrictions and limitations on entry into the United States of nationals of the countries identified in section 1 of this proclamation, as set forth more fully below. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the immigrant entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern. The entry into the United States of nationals of the following countries is hereby suspended and limited, as follows, subject to section 2 of this proclamation. (a) The entry suspensions and limitations enacted by section 2 of Proclamation 9645 are not altered by this proclamation, and they remain in force by their terms, except as modified by Proclamation 9723. (b) Burma (Myanmar) [[Page 30]] (i) Although Burma has begun to engage with the United States on a variety of identity-management and information-sharing issues, it does not comply with the established identity-management and information-sharing criteria assessed by the performance metrics. Burma does not issue electronic passports nor does it adequately share several types of information, including public-safety and terrorism-related information, that are necessary for the protection of the national security and public safety of the United States. Burma is in the process of modernizing its domestic identity-management and criminal-records systems and has worked with the United States to develop some of those systems. It has also recognized the need to make improvements. As its capabilities improve, the prospect for further bilateral cooperation will likely also increase. Despite these encouraging prospects, Burma's identified deficiencies create vulnerabilities that terrorists, criminals, and fraudulent entrants could exploit to harm United States national security and public safety. (ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Burma as immigrants, except as Special Immigrants whose eligibility is based on having provided assistance to the United States Government, is hereby suspended. (c) Eritrea (i) Eritrea does not comply with the established identity-management and information-sharing criteria assessed by the performance metrics. Eritrea does not issue electronic passports or adequately share several types of information, including public-safety and terrorism-related information, that are necessary for the protection of the national security and public safety of the United States. Further, Eritrea is currently subject to several nonimmigrant visa restrictions. Eritrea does not accept return of its nationals subject to final orders of removal from the United States, which further magnifies the challenges of removing its nationals who have entered with immigrant visas. Eritrea has engaged with the United States about its deficiencies, but it also requires significant reforms to its border security, travel-document security, and information-sharing infrastructure. Improvements in these areas will increase its opportunities to come into compliance with the United States Government's identity- management and information-sharing criteria. (ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Eritrea as immigrants, except as Special Immigrants whose eligibility is based on having provided assistance to the United States Government, is hereby suspended. (d) Kyrgyzstan (i) Kyrgyzstan does not comply with the established identity-management and information-sharing criteria assessed by the performance metrics. Kyrgyzstan does not issue electronic passports or adequately share several types of information, including public-safety and terrorism-related information, that are necessary for the protection of the national security and public safety of the United States. Kyrgyzstan also presents an elevated risk, relative to other countries in the world, of terrorist travel to the United States, though it has been responsive to United States diplomatic engagement on the need to make improvements. (ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Kyrgyzstan as immigrants, except as Special Immigrants whose eligibility is based on having provided assistance to the United States Government, is hereby suspended. [[Page 31]] (e) Nigeria (i) Nigeria does not comply with the established identity-management and information-sharing criteria assessed by the performance metrics. Nigeria does not adequately share public-safety and terrorism-related information, which is necessary for the protection of the national security and public safety of the United States. Nigeria also presents a high risk, relative to other countries in the world, of terrorist travel to the United States. Nigeria is an important strategic partner in the global fight against terrorism, and the United States continues to engage with Nigeria on these and other issues. The Department of State has provided significant assistance to Nigeria as it modernizes its border management capabilities, and the Government of Nigeria recognizes the importance of improving its information sharing with the United States. Nevertheless, these investments have not yet resulted in sufficient improvements in Nigeria's information sharing with the United States for border and immigration screening and vetting. (ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Nigeria as immigrants, except as Special Immigrants whose eligibility is based on having provided assistance to the United States Government, is hereby suspended. (f) Sudan (i) Sudan generally does not comply with our identity-management performance metrics and presents a high risk, relative to other countries in the world, of terrorist travel to the United States. Sudan is, however, transitioning to civilian rule, a process which should improve opportunities for cooperation in the future, and it has already made progress in addressing its deficiencies in several areas. For example, Sudan now issues electronic passports and has improved its coordination with INTERPOL in several respects. Sudan has also shared exemplars of its passports with the United States and now permanently invalidates lost and stolen passports and fraudulently obtained travel documents. Because Sudan performed somewhat better than the countries listed earlier in this proclamation and is making important reforms to its system of government, different travel restrictions are warranted. (ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Sudan as Diversity Immigrants, as described in section 203(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1153(c), is hereby suspended. (g) Tanzania (i) Tanzania does not comply with the established identity-management and information-sharing criteria assessed by the performance metrics. Tanzania does not adequately share several types of information, including public- safety and terrorism-related information, that is necessary for the protection of the national security and public safety of the United States. The Government of Tanzania's significant failures to adequately share information with the United States and other countries about possible Ebola cases in its territory detract from my confidence in its ability to resolve these deficiencies. Tanzania also presents an elevated risk, relative to other countries in the world, of terrorist travel to the United States. Tanzania does, however, issue electronic passports for all major passport classes, reports lost and stolen travel documents to INTERPOL [[Page 32]] at least once a month, and has provided exemplars of its current passports to the United States. Further, Tanzania does share some information with the United States, although its processes can be slow, overly bureaucratic, and complicated by limited technical capability. In light of these considerations, different travel restrictions are warranted. (ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Tanzania as Diversity Immigrants, as described in section 203(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1153(c), is hereby suspended. Sec. 2. Scope and Implementation of Suspensions and Limitations. (a) Subject to the exceptions set forth in section 3(b) of Proclamation 9645, any waiver under section 3(c) of Proclamation 9645, and any enforcement provision of section 6(b) through (e) of Proclamation 9645, the suspensions of and limitations on entry pursuant to section 1(b) of this proclamation shall apply to foreign nationals of the designated countries who: (i) are outside the United States on the applicable effective date of this proclamation; (ii) do not have a valid visa on the applicable effective date of this proclamation; and (iii) do not qualify for a visa or other valid travel document under section 6(d) of Proclamation 9645. (b) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall coordinate to update guidance, if necessary, to implement this proclamation as to nationals of the six countries identified in section 1(b) of this proclamation, consistent with the provisions of this section. (c) For purposes of this proclamation, the phrase ``Special Immigrants whose eligibility is based on having provided assistance to the United States Government'' means those aliens described in section 101(a)(27)(D) through (G) and (K) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(D) through (G) and (K), any alien seeking to enter the United States pursuant to a Special Immigrant Visa in the SI or SQ classification, and any spouse and children of any such individual. Sec. 3. Reporting Requirements. (a) Section 4 of Proclamation 9645 is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 4. Adjustments to Removal of Suspensions and Limitations. ``(a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall on October 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, submit to the President the results of an evaluation as to whether to continue, terminate, modify, or supplement any suspensions of, or limitations on, the entry on certain classes of nationals of countries identified in section 2 of this proclamation and section 1(b) of the Proclamation ``Improving Enhanced Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats,'' signed on January 31, 2020. ``(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall not less than every 2 years evaluate whether each country in the world sufficiently shares relevant information and maintains adequate identity- management and information-sharing practices to mitigate the risk that its citizens or residents may travel to the United States in furtherance of [[Page 33]] criminal or terrorist objectives, or otherwise seek to violate any law of the United States through travel or immigration. In doing so, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall: ``(i) in consultation with the Secretary of State, Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, report to the President, through the appropriate Assistants to the President, any instance in which, based on a review conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security believes it is in the interests of the United States to suspend or limit the entry of certain classes of nationals of a country; and ``(ii) in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, regularly review and update as necessary the criteria and methodology by which such evaluations are implemented to ensure they continue to protect the national interests of the United States. ``(c) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, may, at any time, recommend that the President impose, modify, or terminate a suspension or limitation on entry on certain classes of foreign nationals to protect the national interests of the United States.'' (b) Section 5 of Proclamation 9645 is revoked. Sec. 4. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 21, 2020. With respect to the application of those provisions of Proclamation 9645 that are incorporated here through section 2 for countries designated in section 1(b), and that contained their own effective dates, those dates are correspondingly updated to be January 31, 2020, or February 21, 2020, as appropriate. Sec. 5. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the national security, foreign policy, and counterterrorism interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) United States Government obligations under applicable international agreements; (ii) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (iii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. [[Page 34]] (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9984 of January 31, 2020 Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The United States has confirmed cases of individuals who have a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (``2019- nCoV'') (``the virus'') first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China (``China''). The virus was discovered in China in December 2019. As of January 31, 2020, Chinese health officials have reported approximately 10,000 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in China, more than the number of confirmed cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during its 2003 outbreak. An additional 114 cases have been confirmed across 22 other countries; in several of these cases, the infected individuals had not visited China. More than 200 people have died from the virus, all in China. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others circulate among animals, including camels, cats, and bats. Animal coronaviruses are capable of evolving to infect people and subsequently spreading through human-to-human transmission. This occurred with both Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and SARS. Many of the individuals with the earliest confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-human transmission. Later, a growing number of infected individuals reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating human-to-human transmission. Chinese officials now report that sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus is occurring in China. Manifestations of severe disease have included severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Neighboring jurisdictions have taken swift action to protect their citizens by closing off travel between their territories and China. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. [[Page 35]] Outbreaks of novel viral infections among people are always of public health concern, and older adults and people with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk. Public health experts are still learning about the severity of 2019-nCoV. An understanding of the key attributes of this novel virus, including its transmission dynamics, incubation period, and severity, is critical to assessing the risk it poses to the American public. Nonetheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that the virus presents a serious public health threat. The CDC is closely monitoring the situation in the United States, is conducting enhanced entry screening at 5 United States airports where the majority of travelers from Wuhan arrive, and is enhancing illness response capacity at the 20 ports of entry where CDC medical screening stations are located. The CDC is also supporting States in conducting contact investigations of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases identified within the United States. The CDC has confirmed that the virus has spread between two people in the United States, representing the first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus within the United States. The CDC, along with state and local health departments, has limited resources and the public health system could be overwhelmed if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States. Sustained human-to-human transmission has the potential to have cascading public health, economic, national security, and societal consequences. During Fiscal Year 2019, an average of more than 14,000 people traveled to the United States from China each day, via both direct and indirect flights. The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from China. The potential for widespread transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. I have also determined that the United States should take all necessary and appropriate measures to facilitate orderly medical screening and, where appropriate, quarantine of persons allowed to enter the United States who may have been exposed to this virus. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: [[Page 36]] Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation. Sec. 2. Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry. (a) Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to: (i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States; (ii) any alien who is the spouse of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; (iii) any alien who is the parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident is unmarried and under the age of 21; (iv) any alien who is the sibling of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that both are unmarried and under the age of 21; (v) any alien who is the child, foster child, or ward of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or who is a prospective adoptee seeking to enter the United States pursuant to the IR-4 or IH-4 visa classifications; (vi) any alien traveling at the invitation of the United States Government for a purpose related to containment or mitigation of the virus; (vii) any alien traveling as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(C) or (D) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(C) or (D), as a crewmember or any alien otherwise traveling to the United States as air or sea crew; (viii) any alien seeking entry into or transiting the United States pursuant to an A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (as a foreign government official or immediate family member of an official), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO-1 through NATO-4, or NATO-6 visa; (ix) any alien whose entry would not pose a significant risk of introducing, transmitting, or spreading the virus, as determined by the CDC Director, or his designee; (x) any alien whose entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees based on a recommendation of the Attorney General or his designee; or (xi) any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their designees. (b) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to affect any individual's eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the regulations issued pursuant to the legislation implementing the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, consistent with the laws and regulations of the United States. [[Page 37]] Sec. 3. Implementation and Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of State shall implement this proclamation as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this proclamation as it applies to the entry of aliens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish. (b) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that any alien subject to this proclamation does not board an aircraft traveling to the United States. (c) The Secretary of Homeland Security may establish standards and procedures to ensure the application and implementation of this proclamation at United States seaports and in between all ports of entry. (d) An alien who circumvents the application of this proclamation through fraud, willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or illegal entry shall be a priority for removal by the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 4. Orderly Medical Screening and Quarantine. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to regulate the travel of persons and aircraft to the United States to facilitate the orderly medical screening and, where appropriate, quarantine of persons who enter the United States and who may have been exposed to the virus. Such steps may include directing air carriers to restrict and regulate the boarding of such passengers on flights to the United States. Sec. 5. Termination. This proclamation shall remain in effect until terminated by the President. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, as circumstances warrant and no more than 15 days after the date of this order and every 15 days thereafter, recommend that the President continue, modify, or terminate this proclamation. Sec. 6. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on February 2, 2020. Sec. 7. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the national security, public safety, and foreign policy interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or [[Page 38]] (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9985 of January 31, 2020 American Heart Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As the leading cause of death for both men and women nationwide, heart disease devastates hundreds of thousands of families every year. During American Heart Month, we pause to remember the lives lost to heart disease and the families who mourn, and we reaffirm our commitment to preventing and treating this terrible disease that inflicts immeasurable pain and suffering. Evidence-based research has identified several critical risk factors that contribute to heart disease, including elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, physical inactivity, excess body weight, high salt intake, smoking, age, and family history. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about half of all Americans have at least one of three key risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or a history of smoking. While some risk factors are unchangeable, most are avoidable with behavior modification and lifestyle changes like eating a healthy diet, moderating alcohol consumption, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking. Making small, incremental changes and creating healthier habits can lead to life-saving benefits. We must all take decisive action to control our cardiovascular health and support and motivate friends and family members in their efforts to curb unhealthy behaviors. Community groups, educators, and fitness and healthcare professionals can also provide guidance, support, accountability, and encouragement on the journey to better health. American innovation and medical advancements continue to improve treatment options for those who have experienced heart disease. Medical procedures to treat heart conditions are more precise, using less invasive techniques with fewer complications and faster recovery times. Additionally, we have developed medications to more effectively treat high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes, all conditions that contribute to an increased risk of heart disease. We also commend the dedicated healthcare professionals, physical therapists, counselors, volunteers, [[Page 39]] and educators who make a positive impact in the lives of those battling heart disease and undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. Every year, millions of Americans suffer from the healthcare costs, physical disabilities, and premature death caused by cardiovascular diseases and conditions. We can--and must--work to save lives and reverse the somber statistics and cruel grip that heart disease has on our Nation's families. Thanks to scientific research, medical advances, and healthy lifestyle choices, much of the power to combat this disease is within our grasp. During American Heart Month, I urge all men and women to prioritize their health and to take the necessary measures to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle. In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2020 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 7, 2020. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9986 of January 31, 2020 Career and Technical Education Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation's economy is booming, and Americans are thriving. To ensure that our country's workforce remains the best in the world, it is imperative that we equip students and workers with the skills necessary to fill the jobs our economy is creating at an incredible pace and to enable them to reap the benefits of successful careers. During Career and Technical Education Month, we reaffirm our commitment to expanding access to high-quality career and technical education for all Americans. Career and technical education helps develop a 21st century workforce, providing students with the knowledge and technical skills needed to fill the jobs of the future. My Administration appreciates the value of career and technical education, which is why we continue to prioritize access to the best training and retraining opportunities for American students and workers. We are preparing our workforce to flourish amidst advances in [[Page 40]] technology and automation, and we are confident that with the right training, hardworking Americans can harness technology to do their jobs even better and faster than they do them today. In July 2018, I signed an Executive Order establishing the President's National Council for the American Worker to facilitate a much-needed partnership between education and business, which will help resolve pressing issues related to workforce development. As a part of the Council's work, my Administration is asking companies and trade groups throughout the country to sign our Pledge to America's Workers, committing themselves to refocusing resources to retrain our workforce and equip students and workers with the skills they need to be successful right here in the United States. Already, more than 400 businesses have signed the pledge and committed to creating 14.5 million enhanced employment, training, and education opportunities for American students and workers over the next 5 years. We are living in an age of incredible progress, with an abundance of new career fields offering high-wage jobs, especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Career and technical education provides students with the in-demand skills required by these coveted positions, developing their talents and providing them with the tools to be successful in the modern economy. In July 2018, I was proud to sign the bipartisan reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which is benefiting more than 11 million students. This critical legislation is modernizing and increasing access to career and technical education programs, providing students and workers with the necessary training that will strengthen our Nation's economic competitiveness. Given the importance of career and technical education, my fiscal year 2021 budget proposal to the Congress will include significant increases in funding for these programs. This month, we draw attention to the importance of career and technical education in building a stronger American workforce. Our Nation's students and workers are helping to write the next chapter in our proud American legacy of ingenuity and innovation. We will continue to pursue approaches that best fit the needs of individual students and workers and prepare them to unlock their full potential. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2020 as Career and Technical Education Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 41]] Proclamation 9987 of January 31, 2020 National African American History Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Through bravery, perseverance, faith, and resolve--often in the face of incredible prejudice and hardship--African Americans have enhanced and advanced every aspect of American life. Their fight for equality, representation, and respect motivates us to continue working for a more promising, peaceful, and hopeful future for every American. During National African American History Month, we honor the extraordinary contributions made by African Americans throughout the history of our Republic, and we renew our commitment to liberty and justice for all. The theme of this year's observance, ``African Americans and the Vote,'' coincides with the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment, which gave African American men the right to vote. This Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1870, prohibits the government from denying or abridging a citizen's right to vote based on ``race, color, or previous condition of servitude.'' Today, this guarantee is enforced primarily throughout the Voting Rights Act of 1965, an enduring legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Civil Rights movement. This year also marks the 150th anniversary of the first African American to serve in the Congress. In 1870, Hiram Revels, a Mississippi Republican, served a 1-year term in the Senate, where he fought for justice and racial equality. During his lifetime, Senator Revels served as a military chaplain, a minister with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and a college administrator. But it was Revels' tenure in the Congress that truly distinguished him as a trailblazer. He made history serving our Nation in a building that had been constructed by slave laborers just a decade earlier. My Administration has made great strides in expanding opportunity for people of all backgrounds. Over the past 2 years, the poverty and unemployment rates for African Americans have reached historic lows. Through the transformative Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, more than 8,700 distressed communities battling economic hardship have been designated Opportunity Zones, creating a path for struggling communities to unlock investment resources and create much needed jobs and community amenities. I also signed into law the historic First Step Act, which rolled back unjust provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which disproportionately harmed African American communities. The First Step Act provides inmates with opportunities for job training, education, and mentorship. We want every person leaving prison to have the tools they need to take advantage of a second chance to transform their lives and pursue the American dream after incarceration. Additionally, last December, I was proud to sign into law the groundbreaking FUTURE Act, which ensures full support for historically black colleges and universities over the next 10 years. Our great Nation is strengthened and enriched by citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. This month, we celebrate the cultural heritage, diverse contributions, and unbreakable spirit of African Americans. We commend the heroes, pioneers, and common Americans who tirelessly fought [[Page 42]] for--and firmly believed in--the promise of racial equality granted by our Creator, enshrined in our Constitution, and enacted into our laws. We pledge to continue to stand against the evils of bigotry, intolerance, and hatred so that we may continue in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2020 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9988 of February 28, 2020 American Red Cross Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation For 139 years, the American Red Cross has provided comfort and support services to ease suffering before, during, and after emergencies in the United States and around the world. The American Red Cross provides shelter, care, and compassion in response to more than 60,000 disasters a year. It also supplies about 40 percent of our Nation's blood products; teaches skills that save lives; supports our military, veterans, and their families; and provides international humanitarian aid to countries in need. During American Red Cross Month, we thank and honor the selfless volunteers, dedicated employees, and generous supporters who invest their time, talent, and resources to provide compassionate outreach and assistance to so many. Each year, American Red Cross workers and trained volunteers respond to a wide range of emergencies, from natural disasters that destroy entire communities to home fires that displace individual families. In response to last year's devastating hurricanes, wildfires, storms, floods, and earthquakes, the American Red Cross and its partners opened and supported emergency shelters for more than 300 days. During these and other crises, nearly 9,000 American Red Cross workers--90 percent of whom are volunteers--left their homes to work in affected areas, providing refuge, food, relief items, emotional support, recovery planning, and significant assistance to vulnerable families in their darkest hours and times of need. In 2019 alone, the American Red Cross also supported responses to 17 international disasters and humanitarian crises as a key part of the world's largest humanitarian network. Clara Barton, a pioneering nurse from Massachusetts, founded the American Red Cross out of a desire to continue providing help and supplies to people in need following the Civil War. Her words, ``I may be compelled [[Page 43]] to face danger, but never fear it, and while our Soldiers can stand and fight, I can stand and feed and nurse them,'' echo today in the continued dedication of the American Red Cross to our service members, veterans, and their families. Today, the American Red Cross Hero Care Network provides critical and confidential services to our Armed Forces worldwide through local, State, and national resources. Last year, Hero Care Network provided more than 355,000 emergency communication services to nearly 100,000 deployed military members and their families. It is also the largest provider of free professional volunteer services to recovering wounded warriors and their families in military treatment facilities and hospitals. This network is dedicated to supporting programs and services that aid families as they navigate the demands of military life. Across our great country, about 2,500 hospitals and other facilities depend on volunteer blood donors to meet the critical needs of patients. Each year, on average, the American Red Cross collects more than 4.6 million blood donations and nearly 1 million platelet donations from more than 2.6 million volunteers. In 2019, donations of more than 6.4 million blood products helped save and improve the lives of people of all ages, including accident victims, mothers giving birth, surgery patients, and those battling cancer and other life-threatening or altering conditions. Every day, the American Red Cross serves people throughout the United States and around the world. Its lifesaving mission and the indelible mark it leaves around the world are possible only because of the devotion of volunteers, the generosity of donors, and the partnership of community organizations. Together, they bring critical hope, help, and healing in times of crisis, despair, and devastation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2020 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to support the work of the American Red Cross and their local chapters. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9989 of February 28, 2020 Irish-American Heritage Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During Irish-American Heritage Month, we celebrate the countless achievements of Irish Americans and recognize the remarkable contributions they have made to our Nation's character, culture, and prosperity. From America's earliest days, Irish Americans have proven themselves to be confident, [[Page 44]] fierce, tough, and faithful. They never give up, and they never give in, embodying the indomitable spirit that drives us as a people. This month, we recognize their efforts to help build a stronger, prouder America, and we acknowledge the steadfast relationship we have with the Emerald Isle. Irish Americans have played a critical role in our Nation's history and have made significant contributions to our military, government, and economy. During the Revolutionary War, General Henry Knox, the son of Irish immigrants, helped lead General George Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware River. Years later, more than 150,000 Irishmen fought to preserve our Union during the Civil War, shedding their blood so that others would experience the blessings of liberty. And one of our most famous buildings, the White House, was designed by Irish architect James Hoban, who came to the United States after the Revolutionary War. From business and politics to film and music, Irish Americans have risen to distinction and helped move our Nation forward. As we honor the many ways in which Irish Americans have enriched our country, we acknowledge the enduring relationship the United States has with Ireland. This longstanding relationship is only growing stronger thanks to our robust economy. Approximately 700 American businesses have a presence on the Emerald Isle and account for 20 percent of the country's employment. Through our common bond of culture, language, and interests, Ireland provides a great opportunity for our businesses looking to invest in Europe. Likewise, approximately 450 Irish companies are represented in the United States. These companies employ more than 100,000 workers and have invested nearly $150 billion in our country. This month, as we celebrate the vibrant heritage and culture of Irish Americans and partake in St. Patrick's Day festivities on March 17, we pay tribute to the tenacious Irish spirit. We admire the devotion, faith, and resilience of the more than 31 million Irish Americans who help our country flourish, and we look forward to a continued strong and enduring friendship with Ireland for years to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2020 as Irish- American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements of Irish Americans and their contributions to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 45]] Proclamation 9990 of February 28, 2020 Women's History Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Women have influenced and advanced every facet of American life and culture. The strength, ingenuity, and spirit of our female leaders, innovators, and pioneers shape our Nation's character, government, industry, families, and communities. During Women's History Month, we honor the women who have changed our Nation and the world, and we reaffirm our commitment to supporting the next generation of female trailblazers and dreamers as they carry forward this distinguished legacy. This year marks the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, securing the right to vote for women. This milestone in our country was made possible by the devotion, leadership, and perseverance of pioneers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The ratification of the 19th Amendment enabled women to finally have their voices counted in voting booths, paving the way for greater female participation in all levels of government. Heroes emerged like Frances Perkins, who, as Secretary of Labor, was the first woman to hold a cabinet-level position in the Federal Government, and Clare Boothe Luce, an influential journalist, playwright, Congresswoman, and the first woman appointed to a major ambassadorial post abroad. Throughout our history, women have also been pioneers in fields like science, medicine, and engineering. Bessie Coleman, the world's first civilian licensed African-American pilot, and Marie Luhring, the first female truck designer, changed the way we think about aviation and transportation. Saint Katharine Drexel selflessly served those in need and left an indelible mark on nursing and education. NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, who passed away just a few days ago, was behind some of the brilliant work that made possible the first manned spaceflights by United States astronauts. And just last year, two brave American astronauts, Flight Engineers Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, made history by conducting the first all-female spacewalk outside of the International Space Station. My Administration is committed to empowering all women across the Nation and around the world to continue pursuing their dreams and lifting humanity to new heights. As President, I have championed policies that create economic prosperity and opportunity, enabling women to thrive as workers, parents, consumers, innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors. In 2019, women comprised 71 percent of the net increase in employment, the female unemployment rate reached near historic lows, and women for the first time made up the majority of the college-educated labor force. I have also signed into law legislation securing historic levels of funding for child care so that both women and men can better provide for their families, secure in the knowledge that their children are being well-cared for. In addition, we secured the first tax credit for employers who offer paid family leave for those earning $72,000 or less and doubled the child tax credit, benefitting nearly 40 million American families, who received an average of $2,200 in 2019. In December 2019, I was also pleased to sign legislation providing for 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all Federal employees. To [[Page 46]] drive this effort further, I have also called on the Congress to pass a nationwide paid family leave program. On the international front, last year I signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum to direct my Administration to prioritize global women's economic empowerment through the first ever whole-of-government effort dedicated to this issue: the Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative. To date, W-GDP has reached 12 million women through United States Government programs and partnerships, with a goal of reaching 50 million women by 2025. W-GDP's efforts help secure a place for women to thrive and to lead their families, communities, and nations into new arenas of excellence. This month, we pause as a Nation to pay tribute to the women who strengthen and enrich our society through civic action, devotion to family, and tireless dedication to community, innovation, peace, and prosperity. We pledge also to continue fighting for the further advancement of women in our society and around the globe, living up to the promise of our Nation's founding. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2020 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2020, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9991 of February 28, 2020 National Consumer Protection Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since my election, the United States economy has experienced a historic revitalization. Americans across our country have been the beneficiaries of and the driving force behind this extraordinary resurgence. Wages are growing at their fastest rate in a decade; the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in half a century; and for the first time on record, there are more job openings than unemployed Americans. The vitality of our economy has led to high levels of consumer confidence. Even as we grow more prosperous, however, we must remain vigilant for bad actors seeking to harm and exploit honest and hardworking people through deception and other nefarious tactics. During National Consumer Protection Week, we reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding the American consumer from malicious practices and strengthening our efforts to prevent and prosecute fraud. [[Page 47]] Scammers erode consumer confidence, impede the success of businesses, and steal hard-earned money from Americans. A popular tactic deployed by these corrupt individuals is to exploit Americans' trust in their government by falsely claiming to be a government employee or to be affiliated with a government agency. In 2019 alone, my Administration recorded nearly 400,000 reports of criminals representing themselves as affiliates of the Social Security Administration, law enforcement agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service. Some of these con artists tell people that their Social Security number has been suspended and threaten to freeze their assets unless they comply with demands for money or personal information. Frightened consumers are tricked into sending away thousands of dollars, mistakenly believing their money will be more secure or that they will avoid fines or penalties. These types of ploys can be especially harmful to retired Americans who rely on monthly Social Security payments as their main source of income. To protect yourself from these vile criminals, do not trust caller ID, which scammers can easily manipulate to conceal their identity. Never respond to unsolicited incoming calls or correspondence. Instead, contact the real agency on your own. Additionally, report the potential imposter immediately to the Federal Trade Commission. My Administration is committed to using every available resource to protect consumers and bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice. That is why I signed an Executive Order establishing the Task Force on Market Integrity and Consumer Fraud to enhance efforts by the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute cases of fraud on behalf of Americans, including the elderly, veterans, and service members. In order to help Americans better protect themselves against identity theft, I also signed into law legislation allowing consumers to contact each of the three major credit reporting agencies and to have their credit reports frozen for free. Additionally, last year, the Department of Justice announced the largest ever coordinated elder fraud enforcement action, which identified more than 260 defendants who had victimized more than 2 million Americans. The Department of Justice has also taken strong action to block foreign scammers from making billions of fraudulent robocalls to American consumers. During National Consumer Protection Week, government agencies, industry representatives, community groups, and consumer organizations come together in support of the same mission--protecting our Nation's consumers. Consumers are at the heart of our thriving economy, and protecting them must be a shared goal throughout government and across the private sector. This month, we remind all Americans to avail themselves of public and private resources available to them to safeguard their personal and financial information and to protect against fraud. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1 through March 7, 2020, as National Consumer Protection Week. I encourage individuals, businesses, organizations, government agencies, and community groups to take advantage of the broad array of resources offered by the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Department of Justice, and to share this information through consumer education activities in communities across the country. [[Page 48]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9992 of February 29, 2020 Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On January 31, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9984 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk). I found that the potential for widespread transmission of a novel (new) coronavirus (which has since been renamed ``SARS-CoV-2'' and causes the disease COVID-19) (``SARS-CoV-2'' or ``the virus'') by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Because the outbreak of the virus was (and is) centered in the People's Republic of China, I suspended and limited the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, has determined that the virus presents a serious public health threat and continues to take steps to prevent its spread. But CDC, along with State and local health departments, has limited resources, and the public health system could be overwhelmed if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States. Sustained human-to-human transmission has the potential to have cascading public health, economic, national security, and societal consequences. CDC has determined that the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) is experiencing sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of February 28, 2020, Iran had 388 cases of COVID-19, a significant increase from prior days. In response to that increase, on February 28, 2020, CDC raised its infectious disease alert to level 3, its highest level, which recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Iran. According to the World Health Organization, as of February 28, 2020, 97 COVID-19 cases have been exported from Iran to 11 other countries. [[Page 49]] Iran is not a trustworthy state actor, as it has repeatedly demonstrated through its history of engaging in malign activity, and confirmed most recently by its repeated denials of responsibility for shooting down an international airliner. The United States Government is therefore unable to rely on official information disseminated by Iran, undermining the effective evaluation and monitoring of travelers continuing to arrive from that country. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from Iran threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within Iran during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation. Sec. 2. Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry. (a) Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to: (i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States; (ii) any alien who is the spouse of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; (iii) any alien who is the parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident is unmarried and under the age of 21; (iv) any alien who is the sibling of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that both are unmarried and under the age of 21; (v) any alien who is the child, foster child, or ward of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or who is a prospective adoptee seeking to enter the United States pursuant to the IR-4 or IH-4 visa classifications; (vi) any alien traveling at the invitation of the United States Government for a purpose related to containment or mitigation of the virus; (vii) any alien traveling as a nonimmigrant pursuant to a C-1, D, or C-1/D nonimmigrant visa as a crewmember or any alien otherwise traveling to the United States as air or sea crew; [[Page 50]] (viii) any alien (A) seeking entry into or transiting the United States pursuant to one of the following visas: A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (as a foreign government official or immediate family member of an official), E-1 (as an employee of TECRO or TECO or the employee's immediate family members), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO- 1 through NATO-4, or NATO-6 (or seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant in one of those NATO categories); or (B) whose travel falls within the scope of section 11 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement; (ix) any alien whose entry would not pose a significant risk of introducing, transmitting, or spreading the virus, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the CDC Director or his designee; (x) any alien whose entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General or his designee; (xi) any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their designees; or (xii) members of the U.S. Armed Forces and spouses and children of members of the U.S. Armed Forces.

(b) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that any alien subject to this proclamation does not board an aircraft traveling to the United States. (c) The Secretary of Homeland Security may establish standards and procedures to ensure the application of this proclamation at and between all United States ports of entry. (d) An alien who circumvents the application of this proclamation through fraud, willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or illegal entry shall be a priority for removal by the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 4. Amendments to Proclamation 9984. Proclamation 9984 is amended as follows: [[Page 51]] (a) Section 2(a)(viii) of Proclamation 9984 is amended to read as follows: ``(viii) any alien (A) seeking entry into or transiting the United States pursuant to one of the following visas: A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (as a foreign government official or immediate family member of an official), E-1 (as an employee of TECRO or TECO or the employee's immediate family members), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO-1 through NATO-4, or NATO-6 (or seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant in one of those NATO categories); or (B) whose travel falls within the scope of section 11 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement;'' (b) Section 3(c) of Proclamation 9984 is amended to read as follows: ``(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security may establish standards and procedures to ensure the application of this proclamation at and between all United States ports of entry.''

The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, as circumstances warrant and no more than 15 days after the date of this proclamation and thereafter on the first and fifteenth day of each calendar month, recommend that the President continue, modify, or terminate this proclamation and any other proclamation suspending or limiting the entry of foreign nationals into the United States as immigrants or nonimmigrants because of the threat posed by the virus.'' Sec. 5. Termination. This proclamation shall remain in effect until terminated by the President. Sec. 6. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on March 2, 2020. This proclamation does not apply to persons aboard a flight scheduled to arrive in the United States that departed prior to 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on March 2, 2020. Sec. 7. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the national security, public safety, and foreign policy interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9993 of March 11, 2020 Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On January 31, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9984 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk). I found that the potential for widespread transmission of a novel (new) coronavirus (which has since been renamed ``SARS-CoV-2'' and causes the disease COVID-19) (``SARS-CoV-2'' or ``the virus'') by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Because the outbreak of the virus was at the time centered in the People's Republic of China, I suspended and limited the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. On February 29, 2020, in recognition of the sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, I issued Proclamation 9992 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus), suspending and limiting the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, has determined that the virus presents a serious public health threat, and CDC continues to take steps to prevent its spread. But CDC, along with State and local health departments, has limited resources, and the public health system could be overwhelmed if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale. Sustained human-to-human transmission has the potential to cause cascading public health, economic, national security, and societal consequences. [[Page 53]] The World Health Organization has determined that multiple countries within the Schengen Area are experiencing sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. For purposes of this proclamation, the Schengen Area comprises 26 European states: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The Schengen Area currently has the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of the People's Republic of China. As of March 11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 Schengen Area countries is 17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection rates. In total, as of March 9, 2020, the Schengen Area has exported 201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries. Moreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult. The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the Schengen Area. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the Schengen Area threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. The free flow of commerce between the United States and the Schengen Area countries remains an economic priority for the United States, and I remain committed to facilitating trade between our nations. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry.

DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 56]] Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In December 2019, a novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (``the virus'') was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, causing outbreaks of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 that has now spread globally. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), in response to COVID-19. I have taken sweeping action to control the spread of the virus in the United States, including by suspending entry of foreign nationals seeking entry who had been physically present within the prior 14 days in certain jurisdictions where COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred, including the People's Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Schengen Area of Europe. The Federal Government, along with State and local governments, has taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and treat those affected, including by instituting Federal quarantines for individuals evacuated from foreign nations, issuing a declaration pursuant to section 319F-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6d), and releasing policies to accelerate the acquisition of personal protective equipment and streamline bringing new diagnostic capabilities to laboratories. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the COVID- 19 outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic, as the rates of infection continue to rise in many locations around the world and across the United States. The spread of COVID-19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems. As of March 12, 2020, 1,645 people from 47 States have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. It is incumbent on hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country to assess their preparedness posture and be prepared to surge capacity and capability. Additional measures, however, are needed to successfully contain and combat the virus in the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and consistent with section 1135 of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5), do hereby find and proclaim that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. Pursuant to this declaration, I direct as follows: Section 1. Emergency Authority. The Secretary of HHS may exercise the authority under section 1135 of the SSA to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs and of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule throughout the duration of the public health emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. [[Page 57]] Sec. 2. Certification and Notice. In exercising this authority, the Secretary of HHS shall provide certification and advance written notice to the Congress as required by section 1135(d) of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(d)). Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9995 of March 13, 2020 National Poison Prevention Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Far too often, American families bear the burden of preventable tragedies caused by unintentional poisonings. Each day, more than 300 children are treated for poisonings in emergency rooms across the United States. These incidents frequently involve ordinary household items like cleaning products and medicines, including opioids, which are toxic but may be attractive to children because of their bright colors and sweet smells. The responsibility for ensuring that these dangerous products are out of sight and out of reach of our youth falls on all of us. During National Poison Prevention Week, we reaffirm our commitment to raising awareness of the realities of unintentional poisonings and overdoses in our country, and of the ways Americans can educate themselves to avoid accidental injury, overdose, or death in their homes and communities. Every American has a role to play in preventing accidental poisonings and overdoses. Twice per year, my Administration hosts national drug ``Take Back Day'' events for Americans to help protect against the accidental ingestion, misuse, or abuse of prescription drugs by turning in expired or unneeded medications to be disposed of safely. Locking up medications after use and asking local pharmacies or police departments for ways to promptly dispose of expired, unwanted, or unused medications properly can also help prevent tragedies from occurring. In the event of an accidental poisoning, quick action could save a life, and expert help is always [[Page 58]] available through poison control centers. These centers are vital lifelines used by millions of Americans annually, and they serve the public, healthcare providers, public safety personnel, health departments, and law enforcement officials around the clock. Each day, many American families suffer from the pain caused by an opioid overdose death. My Administration is committed to helping eradicate drug addiction from our society and to preventing drug overdoses, which are now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. Over the last 3 years, the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded nearly $9 billion in grants to address the opioid crisis and improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services. As a part of my Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse, I announced a plan to decrease the amount of opioid prescription fills by one-third within 3 years. And in October 2018, I signed into law the SUPPORT Act, the largest and most comprehensive piece of legislation to combat the opioid crisis, which expands access to drug-disposal programs and to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Thanks to our efforts, in 2018, overdose deaths fell nationwide for the first time in decades, and the amount of opioids prescribed nationally since 2017 decreased by 35 percent. Additionally, an increasing number of Americans are receiving life-saving medication-assisted treatment for drug addiction. No American should perish as a result of unintended exposure to poisons or accidental overdoses. This week, we recommit to taking the critical precautions necessary to prevent the deadly realities of unintentional poisonings and drug overdoses, and we ask all Americans to do their part to raise awareness to help combat these issues. To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventative measures, on September 26, 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison Prevention Week.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 15, 2020, through March 21, 2020, to be National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families from poisonous products, chemicals, medicines, and drugs found in their homes, and to raise awareness about these dangers in order to prevent accidental injuries and deaths. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 59]] Proclamation 9996 of March 14, 2020 Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On January 31, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9984 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk). I found that the potential for widespread transmission of a novel (new) coronavirus (which has since been renamed ``SARS-CoV-2'' and causes the disease COVID-19) (``SARS-CoV-2'' or ``the virus'') by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Because the outbreak of the virus was at the time centered in the People's Republic of China, I suspended and limited the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. On February 29, 2020, in recognition of the sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, I issued Proclamation 9992 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus), suspending and limiting the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. And, most recently, on March 11, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9993 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus), suspending and limiting the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, has determined that the virus presents a serious public health threat, and CDC continues to take steps to prevent its spread. But CDC, along with State and local health departments, has limited resources, and the public health system could be overwhelmed if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale. Sustained human-to-human transmission has the potential to cause cascading public health, economic, national security, and societal consequences. CDC has determined that the United Kingdom is experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the United Kingdom had 594 cases of COVID-19, 5 times more cases than there were 7 days prior. The Republic of Ireland has an open border with the United Kingdom in that persons can generally move freely between the Republic of Ireland and [[Page 60]] the United Kingdom--by land to and from Northern Ireland and by ferry or aircraft to and from Wales, England, and Scotland. This general ability to travel freely between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland poses the same challenges that the Schengen Area posed for suspending and limiting entry to the United States by travelers who had been physically present within any of the Schengen Area countries. CDC has also determined that the Republic of Ireland is experiencing ongoing sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the Republic of Ireland had 70 cases of COVID-19, 5 times more cases than there were 7 days prior. The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the United Kingdom, excluding overseas territories outside of Europe, or the Republic of Ireland during the 14- day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. The free flow of commerce between the United States and the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland remains an economic priority for the United States, and I remain committed to facilitating trade between our nations. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the United Kingdom, excluding overseas territories outside of Europe, or the Republic of Ireland during the 14- day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation. Sec. 2. Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry. (a) Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to: (i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States; (ii) any alien who is the spouse of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; [[Page 61]] (iii) any alien who is the parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident is unmarried and under the age of 21; (iv) any alien who is the sibling of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that both are unmarried and under the age of 21; (v) any alien who is the child, foster child, or ward of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or who is a prospective adoptee seeking to enter the United States pursuant to the IR-4 or IH-4 visa classifications; (vi) any alien traveling at the invitation of the United States Government for a purpose related to containment or mitigation of the virus; (vii) any alien traveling as a nonimmigrant pursuant to a C-1, D, or C-1/D nonimmigrant visa as a crewmember or any alien otherwise traveling to the United States as air or sea crew; (viii) any alien (A) seeking entry into or transiting the United States pursuant to one of the following visas: A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (as a foreign government official or immediate family member of an official), E-1 (as an employee of TECRO or TECO or the employee's immediate family members), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO- 1 through NATO-4, or NATO-6 (or seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant in one of those NATO categories); or (B) whose travel falls within the scope of section 11 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement; (ix) any alien whose entry would not pose a significant risk of introducing, transmitting, or spreading the virus, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the CDC Director or his designee; (x) any alien whose entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General or his designee; (xi) any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their designees; or (xii) members of the U.S. Armed Forces and spouses and children of members of the U.S. Armed Forces. (b) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to affect any individual's eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the regulations issued pursuant to the legislation implementing the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, consistent with the laws and regulations of the United States. Sec. 3. Implementation and Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of State shall implement this proclamation as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this proclamation as it applies to the entry of aliens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish. [[Page 62]] (b) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that any alien subject to this proclamation does not board an aircraft traveling to the United States. (c) The Secretary of Homeland Security may establish standards and procedures to ensure the application of this proclamation at and between all United States ports of entry. (d) An alien who circumvents the application of this proclamation through fraud, willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or illegal entry shall be a priority for removal by the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 4. Termination. This proclamation shall remain in effect until terminated by the President. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall recommend that the President continue, modify, or terminate this proclamation as described in section 5 of Proclamation 9984, as amended. Sec. 5. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on March 16, 2020. This proclamation does not apply to persons aboard a flight scheduled to arrive in the United States that departed prior to 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on March 16, 2020. Sec. 6. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the national security, public safety, and foreign policy interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders. Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 63]] Proclamation 9997 of March 14, 2020 National Day of Prayer for All Americans Affected by the Coronavirus Pandemic and for Our National Response Efforts By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In our times of greatest need, Americans have always turned to prayer to help guide us through trials and periods of uncertainty. As we continue to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans are unable to gather in their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship. But in this time we must not cease asking God for added wisdom, comfort, and strength, and we must especially pray for those who have suffered harm or who have lost loved ones. I ask you to join me in a day of prayer for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and to pray for God's healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation. As your President, I ask you to pray for the health and well-being of your fellow Americans and to remember that no problem is too big for God to handle. We should all take to heart the holy words found in 1 Peter 5:7: ``Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.'' Let us pray that all those affected by the virus will feel the presence of our Lord's protection and love during this time. With God's help, we will overcome this threat. On Friday, I declared a national emergency and took other bold actions to help deploy the full power of the Federal Government to assist with efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. I now encourage all Americans to pray for those on the front lines of the response, especially our Nation's outstanding medical professionals and public health officials who are working tirelessly to protect all of us from the coronavirus and treat patients who are infected; all of our courageous first responders, National Guard, and dedicated individuals who are working to ensure the health and safety of our communities; and our Federal, State, and local leaders. We are confident that He will provide them with the wisdom they need to make difficult decisions and take decisive actions to protect Americans all across the country. As we come to our Father in prayer, we remember the words found in Psalm 91: ``He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.'' As we unite in prayer, we are reminded that there is no burden too heavy for God to lift or for this country to bear with His help. Luke 1:37 promises that ``For with God nothing shall be impossible,'' and those words are just as true today as they have ever been. As one Nation under God, we are greater than the hardships we face, and through prayer and acts of compassion and love, we will rise to this challenge and emerge stronger and more united than ever before. May God bless each of you, and may God bless the United States of America. [[Page 64]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 15, 2020, as a National Day of Prayer for All Americans Affected by the Coronavirus Pandemic and for our National Response Efforts. I urge Americans of all faiths and religious traditions and backgrounds to offer prayers for all those affected, including people who have suffered harm or lost loved ones. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9998 of March 23, 2020 National Agriculture Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since our Nation's earliest days, farming communities have been a bedrock of our society. In a letter to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson famously stated that agriculture ``is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and happiness.'' As our Nation continues to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, we pay tribute to the unbeatable strength of America's agricultural producers as they once again answer the call to feed our country and the world. On this National Agriculture Day, and now more than ever, we salute and honor the men and women who contribute daily to our national prosperity. United States agricultural food and fiber production has increased significantly over the past century, while the amount of resources used to produce those goods has largely stayed the same. This incredible productivity is due to innovations that have propelled the American model of agriculture to the top of the world stage, allowing Americans to spend less of their paychecks on food. Americans feed their families with the safest, healthiest, and most affordable food in the world. Thanks to the efficiency of our farmers and ranchers, our rural communities are stronger and more resilient. Since taking office, I have worked tirelessly to deliver on my promise to negotiate better trade deals for our country, directly benefitting agricultural communities. After decades of one-sided trade agreements that left the great men and women of our country behind, my Administration has secured fairer and more reciprocal deals that ensure American workers are put first. Our farmers, whose grit and hard work help feed, fuel, and clothe millions around the world, are key beneficiaries of these historic trade agreements. In 2019, I delivered the United States-Japan Trade Agreement, which is already providing our farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses with new market access to 127 million Japanese consumers. In January, I ended the outdated and unbalanced North American Free Trade Agreement by signing into law the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), [[Page 65]] creating incredible opportunities for American farmers and ranchers. The USMCA empowers American businesses in our vital agricultural sector with greater freedom to sell their goods throughout North America. Thanks to this better deal, American agriculture exports are expected to increase by $2.2 billion. I also signed a new, fully enforceable trade agreement with China, which will help start to rebalance our vital trade partnership. As part of this deal, China has pledged to increase imports of American goods and services over the next 2 years by at least $200 billion, including purchasing more than $80 billion in American agricultural goods. Across our country, farming families and communities demonstrate the timeless American values of hard work, perseverance, and stewardship of the land. Just as they have for centuries, our farmers provide the foundation of a national economic supply chain that is critical to our national security and prosperity. Today and every day, we express our gratitude to these individuals and remember the central place of agriculture in our national identity and American way of life. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 24, 2020, as National Agriculture Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this day by recognizing the preeminent role that agriculture plays in our daily lives, acknowledging agriculture's continuing importance to rural America and our country's economy, and expressing our deep appreciation of farmers, growers, ranchers, producers, national forest system stewards, private agricultural stewards, and those who work in the agriculture sector across the Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 9999 of March 24, 2020 Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our great American experiment was inspired by the ideas about liberty, self-government, and the rule of law that traced their roots to ancient Greece. On Greek Independence Day, we commemorate the rich history shared between the United States and Greece, which is fortified by our love of freedom and commitment to democratic institutions. We join the Greek people in celebrating another year of independence and unity. The great thinkers of ancient Greece stoked the American quest for freedom and a republic founded on the fundamental truth that people have rights that cannot be denied. Decades later, the same values that catalyzed our [[Page 66]] Revolution inspired the people of Greece to seek their own freedom and independence. Recognizing the commonality between the Greeks' fight to establish a representative government and their own, many Americans supported Greek independence, forging an unbreakable bond between our two countries. Today, this same conviction for a freer and more prosperous world bolsters the alliance between the United States and Greece. In October 2019, my Administration worked with Greek officials to strengthen and expand our defense and security partnership by updating the United States-Greece Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement Annex. This agreement paves the way for closer collaboration on national security matters between our two countries for decades to come. We are also grateful for the commitment of Greece, a strong NATO Ally, to our naval presence at Souda Bay on the island of Crete. Through such endeavors, the partnership between our countries advances our strategic national interests in stable and peaceful Eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Western Balkans regions. As noted at the Second United States-Greece Strategic Dialogue last year, an estimated 3 million Americans claim Greek descent. We therefore reaffirm our commitment to building firm institutional foundations that foster deep appreciation of our common ties. To that end, we are proud to have established the Future Leaders Exchange Program, which is further developing educational, cultural, and scientific cooperation between our two countries. Throughout our histories, both of our nations have prioritized interactions between our peoples, which are at the core of our cherished relationship and alliance. The United States and Greece continue to share a long-held belief that political power belongs in the hands of the people. On this 199th anniversary of Greek independence, we confirm the pillars of governance, culture, and patriotism that have forged and continue to sustain the faithful bond our two nations enjoy. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2020, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 67]] Proclamation 10000 of March 30, 2020 National Doctors Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation is tremendously grateful for all Americans who have chosen the noble profession of healing and caring for others. This is especially true as our extraordinary doctors and other talented medical professionals have collectively risen to the challenge of combating the coronavirus pandemic in communities large and small across the United States. This year in particular, on National Doctors Day, we recognize the remarkable men and women who treat their fellow Americans, find cures for the diseases and illnesses we face, and never waver in their efforts to treat every patient with the dignity, respect, and empathy they deserve. As our Nation continues to combat the novel coronavirus, the tireless work and dedication of our medical and healthcare professionals is evident in the hospitals and treatment centers where they care for the sick, inside the labs and research facilities where vaccines and treatments are being developed, and from the podiums where they have continuously reassured and informed the American people. These brave patriots on the frontlines of the war against this invisible enemy are the most talented, innovative, and hardworking medical professionals in the world. Thanks to their incredible, life-saving work, no country is better prepared to fight this pandemic than the United States, and we remain confident that their steadfast resolve will see our Nation through to victory over this disease. This National Doctors Day, we express our immense gratitude to the men and women who are caring for and treating patients across our country and whose commitment to serving others has never been clearer. Their contributions to the health and well-being of every American are immeasurable. As one Nation, we pray for their continued health and strength, and we ask God to bless them with the wisdom and resolute spirit to care for all those who need healing. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 30, 2020, as National Doctors Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 68]] Proclamation 10001 of March 31, 2020 Cancer Control Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During Cancer Control Month, we commend the unwavering courage of those across our country who are battling cancer and remember all who have been taken from us by this horrible disease. We also rejoice with the nearly 17 million cancer survivors in the United States who show us that victory over cancer is possible. We extend our sincere appreciation to the devoted healthcare professionals, scientists, and researchers who have committed their lives to discovering a cure for cancer. While tremendous progress has been made in the fight against cancer, there is still much work to be done. Cancer remains the second-leading cause of death in the United States. Thanks to early detection, preventive measures, and medical innovation, survival rates for the most common cancer types--lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate--have vastly improved, providing much-needed hope to millions of patients and their families nationwide. Despite the decreasing death rate from cancer of nearly 30 percent over the last few decades, the disease claims the lives of roughly 1,600 Americans daily, resulting in nearly 600,000 deaths annually. Research shows that a large proportion of cancers can be prevented, paving the way for millions of Americans to take charge of their lives by avoiding unhealthy behaviors and habits as well as commonly known carcinogens that can cause cancer. For example, the majority of melanoma cancer cases diagnosed annually could have been prevented by protecting skin from ultraviolet radiation through the use of sunscreen with sun protection factor 15 or higher and other preventive measures that shield skin from the sun's harmful rays. Moreover, tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars are responsible for almost 9 out of every 10 cases of lung cancer. Preventive screenings, consulting your physician when detecting abnormalities, and awareness of family history can be the difference between life and death. That is why it is critical for Americans to see their doctors or healthcare providers regularly and stick to a healthy diet and routine physical activity. My Administration is also working aggressively to protect our Nation's youth and ensure their lives are not shattered because of a cancer diagnosis. We initiated a new effort that invests $500 million over the next decade to improve pediatric cancer research. This funding will assist our Nation's most talented health professionals in learning more about the devastating cancer diagnoses our children face and finding the best cures. The National Institutes of Health has announced the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, which supports childhood cancer research and aims to make it easier for researchers to learn from each of the approximately 16,000 children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year. As we observe Cancer Control Month, we honor all those we have lost to cancer by renewing our commitment to raising awareness, emphasizing prevention and early detection, supporting innovative treatments, and prioritizing our health. By remaining steadfast in our dedication to taking preventative measures and finding a cure, we will one day defeat this disease. [[Page 69]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2020 as Cancer Control Month. I call upon the people of the United States to speak with their doctors and healthcare providers to learn more about preventative measures that can save lives. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in appropriate activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing Cancer Control Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10002 of March 31, 2020 National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Childhood should be filled with joy, hope, unconditional love, and acceptance. Tragically, however, far too many of our Nation's young people spend this foundational time of their lives in fear, pain, and uncertainty, enduring abuse and neglect that threatens their health and well-being. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we condemn this horrific depravity and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to protecting our children and strengthening our families. Each year, hundreds of thousands of children across our country suffer from abuse and neglect, a fact that is both sobering and heart- wrenching. In January, I signed an Executive Order to coordinate the Federal Government's efforts to prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children online, protect and support victims of child exploitation, and provide prevention education to raise awareness and help lower the incidence of child exploitation. I also signed into law legislation to enhance our child welfare systems by supporting at-risk families through mental health and substance abuse treatment and programs to develop parenting skills. With our international partners in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, the United States developed the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. The Voluntary Principles establish a baseline framework for companies that provide online services to deter use of the internet as a tool for sexually exploiting and abusing children. Several major technology companies have publicly adopted the principles and more will follow in the coming months. These companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms from becoming a haven for child predators and to also ensure law enforcement is able to investigate and prosecute offenders when children have been victimized. [[Page 70]] Child abuse causes the loss of innocence and hope. Loving, devoted, and caring families can serve as a bulwark against our children suffering from neglect and abuse. Child Welfare Information Gateway, the information service of the Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau, offers several resources on preventing child abuse and promoting healthy families through its National Child Abuse Prevention Month website. Familiarizing yourself with the information provided by the Department of Health and Human Services can help you learn more about what you and your community can do to support children and families during this month and throughout the year. To eradicate this blight on our society, compassionate and concerned Americans must work to effect change and impact young lives. Child welfare agencies, clergy members, educators, medical and law enforcement professionals, neighbors, friends, and extended family members all contribute to protecting and nurturing our Nation's youth. Foster, kinship, and adoptive parents open their hearts and their homes to children in crisis and empower them to find happiness and achieve their dreams. Working together, these forces for good can ensure the welfare of children who have experienced the traumas of abuse or neglect and give them a promising future. The success of our Nation is reflected in our economic and cultural prosperity and military might, but our character is revealed by how we cherish and protect the weak, innocent, and vulnerable. All children are uniquely created in the image of God and gifted with both purpose and unlimited potential. We can and must relentlessly protect our children, homes, and communities from the scourge of these shameful tragedies and support families and communities to ensure that all children have the opportunity to reach their potential. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2020 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to invest in the lives of our Nation's children, to be aware of their safety and well- being, and to support efforts that promote their psychological, physical, and emotional development. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 71]] Proclamation 10003 of March 31, 2020 National Donate Life Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Donate Life Month, we honor the selfless individuals whose remarkable generosity has helped give others the gift of life. Countless Americans have benefited from people who have registered as organ, eye, or tissue donors, and we recognize our Nation's unrivaled medical community for helping make donor transplants possible. Through the talents of doctors all across our country and the gifts of donors, the quality of life for thousands of Americans has been improved. Approximately 60 percent of American adults have registered as organ, eye, and tissue donors. In 2019, almost 40,000 American patients received transplants, which resulted in the most lives saved through organ donations ever during a single year. We all have the power to help: One donor can save up to 8 lives through organ donation and help improve more than 75 other lives through eye and tissue donation. Today, more than 110,000 men, women, and children in the United States are awaiting lifesaving organ transplants. While tremendous progress has been made, the need for additional organ donors is vital. Every 9 minutes another name is added to the long list of Americans desperately waiting for transplants. Additionally, nearly 18,000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with illnesses for which blood stem cell transplantation is the best treatment option. Over 65 percent of these individuals do not have appropriately matched family members and rely upon blood stem cell donors from outside their family to help save their lives. We are grateful for the more than 30 million adults who are currently registered as marrow donors. But more are needed to ensure all who need a transplant can find a match. To help increase access to transplants, in July 2019, I signed an Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health. The Executive Order increases access to kidney transplants by modernizing the organ recovery and transplantation systems and updating and fixing outdated and counterproductive regulations. It also provides increased support for living donors, increasing the supply of transplantable kidneys by removing financial barriers to living donations. Every person is a potential organ or tissue donor with the power to give the gift of life. This month, we are grateful to the generous Americans who register as donors and to the researchers, scientists, and medical professionals who ensure transplants are safe and successful. I strongly encourage all willing and able Americans to sign up as organ or tissue donors to help instill greater hope in those awaiting a donor match and improve and save the lives of their fellow citizens. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2020 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon health professionals, volunteers, educators, [[Page 72]] government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to help raise awareness of the urgent need for organ and tissue donors throughout our Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10004 of March 31, 2020 National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation No person should ever have to endure the anguish and indignity of sexual assault. This horrific crime affects Americans of every age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. During National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting survivors of sexual assault, encouraging strong criminal justice responses to these crimes, and ending the scourge of sexual violence in our homes and communities. Sexual assault is a particularly egregious and dehumanizing form of violence. Even after physical injuries of a sexual assault have healed, emotional and mental trauma can persist. Survivors often struggle with lingering anxiety, fear, anger, shame, and depression. The devastating aftermath of sexual assault can also harm a survivor's relationships with their loved ones. My Administration has made combating sexual assault a top priority. Last year, I signed an Executive Order establishing the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives to address unacceptable acts of violence against Native Americans, particularly women and girls. Too often, sexual assaults are committed in conjunction with other forms of violence against women and girls in Indian Country. This Task Force is enhancing collaboration across the Federal Government to improve the ability of law enforcement and prosecutors to respond to new and unsolved cases in these communities and to ensure they receive vital health and human services. In addition, the Office on Violence Against Women and the Office for Victims of Crime within the Department of Justice (DOJ) are spearheading an initiative to ensure that sexual assault victims in Native and Tribal communities have access to high- quality medical care from trained Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners and other services they may need to heal and achieve justice. DOJ is also providing grant funding to facilitate the analysis of thousands of sexual assault kits in crime laboratories across our Nation to identify criminals. The Department is also making sure that law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and victim advocates have the resources they need to [[Page 73]] support victims and bring offenders to justice. Further, DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services have identified best practices in the collection and preservation of forensic evidence, as well as in the care and treatment of survivors of sexual assault. Human trafficking has become rampant throughout the world, and often includes sexual assault. In 2019 alone, the National Human Trafficking Hotline received reports of nearly 12,000 cases of potential human trafficking in the United States, identifying more than 25,000 victims. More than 65 percent of these cases referenced women, and more than one in five referenced children. My Administration will use every tool at our disposal to dismantle this global problem, deliver justice, and ensure the safety and well-being of the survivors. That is why I signed an Executive Order on Combating Human Trafficking and Online Child Exploitation in the United States, which prioritizes the Federal Government's resources to prosecute offenders, assist victims, and provide prevention education to combat human trafficking and online sexual exploitation of children. I also signed into law legislation authorizing $430 million to fight sex and labor trafficking, and my fiscal year 2021 budget request to Congress seeks an increase of $42.5 million to address human trafficking. And importantly, we are holding these foreign governments that fail to address human trafficking to account by imposing restrictions on foreign assistance. This month, we pause to recognize the devastation caused by sexual assault and to recommit ourselves to eliminating this atrocious crime. We are grateful to the professionals serving in healthcare, victim and human services, law enforcement, and criminal justice for their steadfast resolve against sexual assault while also caring for and supporting survivors. As a Nation, we stand with the courageous men, women, and children who have survived sexual assault and pledge to use every tool at our disposal to help prevent Americans from ever enduring the trauma of sexual assault. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2020 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. I urge all Americans, families, law enforcement personnel, healthcare providers, and community and faith-based organizations to support survivors of sexual assault and work together to prevent these crimes in their communities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 74]] Proclamation 10005 of March 31, 2020 Second Chance Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As Americans, we believe that every person has unbound potential. It is therefore important that we offer former inmates who have served their sentences and learned from their earlier mistakes the opportunity for redemption through a second chance to become productive members of society. During Second Chance Month, we celebrate those who have set out to create better lives following incarceration and recommit to helping former inmates contribute to the strength and prosperity of our Nation. In 2018, I signed into law the First Step Act, landmark legislation that brought needed reform to our criminal justice system. The First Step Act reduced penalties and eliminated the three-strike mandatory life sentence provision for certain non-violent offenders. This legislation also expanded judges' discretion to impose sentences that are below the mandatory minimum for drug offenders with little or no criminal history. Additionally, it allows certain low-level drug offenders to petition the courts for a review of their sentence, which a judge can reduce after reviewing all the circumstances, including public safety, criminal history, and the nature of the offense. Further, through expanded rehabilitative programs my Administration has established in accordance with this legislation, inmates are receiving training and education to help them develop skills that will help them re-enter society successfully. Based on an assessment of their risk of recidivism and needs, inmates that complete some of these programs can secure early release to home confinement or a halfway house. While we must be tough on crime, we can also be smart about reducing recidivism. One of the best ways to break the cycle of crime is to help former inmates find rewarding work. That is why my Administration is promoting second chance hiring to build on the reforms of the First Step Act and help former inmates live crime-free lives. I launched the Federal Interagency Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry Council to create more second chances for those returning home from prison. We are also working to expand Pell Grants to provide education and training to inmates before release and providing grants to States to expand their use of fidelity bonds to help persons with criminal records find gainful employment. This month, we extend our heartfelt thanks to all who know in their hearts that redemption is possible. Second chances are possible only through a network of people who believe in themselves and others, former inmates determined to improve their lives, judges and public servants dedicated to reducing recidivism, and families and community members willing to lend their support to people striving to triumph over their past mistakes. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2020 as Second Chance Month. I call on all Americans to commemorate this month with events and activities that raise public awareness about preventing crime and providing those who have completed their sentences an opportunity for an honest second chance. [[Page 75]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10006 of April 1, 2020 World Autism Awareness Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation World Autism Awareness Day is a tribute to the millions of Americans living with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Their numerous triumphs over many and varied obstacles are a testament to the strength and resolve of the American spirit. We also extend our gratitude to all those who, through their unwavering dedication to supporting Americans with ASD, help empower them to thrive at home, in the workplace, and in their communities. As President, I am committed to ensuring all Americans with ASD can thrive and prosper. Last year, I was proud to sign into law legislation reauthorizing the Autism CARES Act, approving more than $1.8 billion in funding over 5 years to research and develop new treatments and therapies, and enhancing support services for those with ASD throughout their entire lives. This legislation also expanded the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee to include representatives from 17 Federal agencies and stakeholders from throughout the autism community. The enhanced public-private partnerships made possible by these efforts are providing support to those with ASD. Early detection and treatment play essential roles in optimizing the lives of people with ASD. To assist in making every resource available to these individuals during the most critical developmental stage of their life, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently awarded more than $4 million to research, develop, and validate screening tools that detect signs of ASD during the first year of life. NIH has also awarded more than $36 million to enhance healthcare providers' expertise in caring for Americans with ASD. This funding is vital to those living with ASD, expanding opportunities to live lives full of meaning and joy. Approximately 1 in every 59 American children lives with ASD. That means that approximately 500,000 of our Nation's young people who turn 18 over the next decade enter adulthood with ASD. My Administration, along with coordinated efforts at the State and local levels, is committed to providing opportunities to assist in their successful transition into rewarding careers and fulfilling lives. Through the Department of Labor's Youth Policy Development Center and the Apprenticeship Inclusion Model initiative, we are expanding opportunities for Americans with ASD to develop high-demand skills that pair with good-paying jobs. Additionally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has allocated more than $110 million to increase the availability of affordable and reliable housing [[Page 76]] models to enable individuals with disabilities, including ASD, to live independently. Today, we join with the international ASD community in reaffirming our resolve to support all those with ASD as they continue to strengthen our families, our communities, our Nation, and the world. Together, we will work to promote more meaningful connections of respect and build a society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2020, as World Autism Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by individuals with autism, and find ways to support those with autism and their families. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10007 of April 3, 2020 Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Preparing the next generation to lead lives of purpose and significance is one of our foremost responsibilities. Education is essential to cultivating a spirit of curiosity and learning, developing character and conscience, and strengthening the will to work collaboratively. On Education and Sharing Day, we pay tribute to the family members, educators, mentors, clergy members, and other community leaders who invest in the lives of our Nation's youth through education and fostering kindness and caring for one another. Today, we celebrate Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, a compassionate and visionary leader whose influence continues unabated since his passing more than a quarter century ago. This year marks 70 years since Rabbi Schneerson assumed leadership of the international Chabad-Lubavitch movement, building the faith-based network into a dynamic force for good which affects millions of people around the world. Although he witnessed the unimaginable tragedies that beset the world during World War II, the Holocaust, and the oppression and violence of the Cold War, the Lubavitcher Rebbe retained his fundamental belief in the potential of all people and the liberating nature of education. Committed to the idea that education must ``pay more attention, indeed the main intention, to the building of character, with emphasis on moral and ethical values,'' he established schools and centers for education, service, and spiritual growth on college campuses and in communities across our Nation and around the world. His legacy and enduring commitment to [[Page 77]] young people continue as examples of selfless service and devotion for all who know the story of his purposeful life. Knowledge inspired by unwavering virtue and commitment to faith were central to the Lubavitcher Rebbe's life and mission. When put into practice, these values empower people of all ages to fulfill their unique purpose, and in turn to enhance and enrich our great Nation. On this day, let us acknowledge that each person has a unique purpose that can be unleashed through an individual, whole-of-person approach to education, and let us renew our commitment to supporting education as a means by which individuals may grow their gifts, develop their talents, and fulfill their God-given potential. May we work to shape a brighter future by preserving these foundations of freedom and fellowship for generations to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 5, 2020, as ``Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.'' I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10008 of April 8, 2020 National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since our founding, brave men and women who have selflessly answered the call of duty to defend our precious liberty have shaped the fabric of our Nation. In the course of fighting for our freedom and security, many of these heroes have been captured and often subjected to shocking conditions and unimaginable torture. On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we honor the more than 500,000 American warriors captured while protecting our way of life. We pay tribute to these patriots for their unwavering and unrelenting spirit. In every major conflict in our Nation's history, American prisoners of war (POWs) have stared down our enemies, knowing at any moment their captors might torture them yet again or even kill them. These patriots, however, knew that they were fighting for something much larger than individual survival. They persevered for the sake of their fellow POWs, comrades in arms, families, and country. Later this year, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of World War II. Over the course of the war, nearly 94,000 American troops in the European Theater and an additional 27,000 in the Pacific Theater were captured and held as POWs. Subjected to starvation, lack of medical care, and unimaginable suffering, these Americans endured hell on [[Page 78]] Earth. The POWs who returned home were forever changed. Many bore the seen and unseen scars and wounds of war, having experienced the worst of humanity. Though we can never fully understand the depth of their brutal imprisonment and mistreatment, as Americans, it is our duty to ensure all former POWs receive the love, care, compassion, appreciation, and support they deserve. It is our national obligation to remain mindful of the tremendous sacrifices they, their family members, and their loved ones endured over months and years of uncertainty, worry, and heartache. May the stories of these warriors inspire us to live each day with fierce conviction, indomitable will, and everlasting pride for our country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2020, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon Americans to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of all former prisoners of war and to express our Nation's eternal gratitude for their sacrifice. I also call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10009 of April 13, 2020 Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation This year marks 130 years since the spirit of cooperation, hope, and progress brought together the nations of the Americas at the First International Conference of American States. This historic meeting chartered the course for the establishment of the Organization of American States in 1948, an institution that has ever since worked toward peace and prosperity throughout the Americas, encouraging the nonviolent resolution of conflict and promoting mutual social and economic growth. As we celebrate our remarkable progress this Pan American Day and Pan American Week, let us also reaffirm our resolve to uphold and bolster liberty, democracy, and freedom in our Hemisphere. As part of our commitment to advancing dignity and freedom, my Administration will always work to combat human trafficking. This work requires enhanced border security and a well-functioning immigration system. Through our cooperation with the Governments of Mexico and our Central American partners, we have instituted reforms that help ensure the security and well-being of our peoples. By signing the United States-Mexico Joint Declaration last June, the Government of Mexico affirmed its commitment to reducing the number of illegal immigrants who arrive at our southern [[Page 79]] border. We have also signed agreements with the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to enhance our countries' cooperative efforts. These partnerships have helped expand humanitarian protections for asylum seekers, combat transnational criminal organizations, strengthen border security, and reduce human slavery and smuggling. My Administration also remains committed to implementing trade deals that will bolster the economies of the United States and our allies in the Americas. I am proud to have delivered on my promise to end the outdated and unbalanced North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law, modernizing and rebalancing trade in a manner that supports robust economic growth throughout North America. Additionally, through the Am[eacute]rica Crece initiative, we are deepening private-sector investment in energy and infrastructure, enhancing economic opportunity and growth across the Americas, and continuing an historic period of cooperation. We also recognize that citizen-responsive democratic governance, characterized by free and fair elections, is essential to peace and security, and we therefore remain committed to advocating for freedom and democracy for those living under authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. As part of the growing global consensus of nearly 60 countries that have recognized the legitimacy of interim President of Venezuela Juan Guaido, we are doing everything we can to support the Venezuelan people, address the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and the region, peacefully restore democracy, and return Venezuela to its status as a stable and prosperous nation. In February, I was pleased to host interim President Guaido as an honored guest at my State of the Union address. During his visit, I reaffirmed the dedication of the United States to bringing the full range of diplomatic and economic tools to bear on the Maduro regime until its illegitimate rule comes to an end. The United States also remains committed to helping the people of Cuba and Nicaragua create stable and free countries. Together with our regional partners, we will ensure the realization of the democratic dreams of those oppressed by tyrannical regimes. We are grateful for the blessings of freedom enjoyed in the United States and in so many other parts of the Western Hemisphere. We also remain steadfast in our determination to secure a freer and more democratic Western Hemisphere for all. On this day and during this week, let us celebrate the liberty we have fostered together with our regional partners and pledge our continuing support for a future where it is enjoyed even more widely throughout our Hemisphere. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2020, as Pan American Day and April 12 through April 18, 2020, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of the other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities. [[Page 80]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10010 of April 17, 2020 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In 1981, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the first National Crime Victims' Rights Week to acknowledge the abuse and trauma that victims of crimes often experience, and to recognize the tireless work of dedicated advocates who have taken up the cause of supporting crime victims across our country. Thanks to the efforts of these individuals, more victims are receiving the care they deserve and accessing tools to empower them as they recover. This week, we express our appreciation for those who support crime victims, and we reaffirm our strong commitment to reducing the trauma of crime for victims and their loved ones. My Administration remains focused on helping victims of crime recover from and overcome the physical, emotional, and financial suffering they have endured. As one of my first acts as President, I established the Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office within the Department of Homeland Security to serve the needs of Angel Families who suffered as a result of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Additionally, for Fiscal Year 2018 alone, the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime awarded more than $2.3 billion in grants for victim assistance and compensation programs. These dollars financed services for more than 6 million victims, provided millions in compensation, and did not cost taxpayers a dime. It all came from the fines and penalties paid by convicted Federal offenders. As part of our support for crime victims, we are also providing significant funding to operate local domestic violence shelters, elder abuse programs, child advocacy centers, rape crisis centers, homicide support groups, and other victim assistance programs across the United States. Through programs like these, victims of crimes are better able to begin the healing process and work to rebuild their lives. Our Nation's law enforcement officers also provide critical support to crime victims. These brave men and women serve as the first line of response for many victims of crime, and my Administration remains committed to empowering them as they fulfill this and all of their duties to their communities. To further enhance public safety and the oversight of justice, my Administration established the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. This commission, the first of its kind in more than 50 years, is set up to study the biggest threats to law and order and help our law enforcement officers increase the safety of our Nation. By providing more resources to first responders to carry out their mission, we [[Page 81]] are more effectively assisting crime victims and empowering law enforcement to prevent crimes before they occur. This week, we are reminded that in many cases crime victims experience long-lasting trauma and need assistance. We must continue to champion efforts to expand their access to quality services and to fight alongside them to secure the justice they deserve. My Administration will never stop working to achieve this goal, and we will always strive toward a better future for all Americans free from crime. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19 through April 25, 2020, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge all Americans, families, law enforcement, community and faith-based organizations, and private organizations to work together to support victims of crime and protect their rights. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10011 of April 17, 2020 National Park Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our national parks embody the magnificence and grandeur of our great Nation. Every year, more than 300 million visitors enjoy the breathtaking landscapes, abundant wildlife, historic landmarks, and patriotic memorials found at these great American sites. During National Park Week, we recognize the majesty of our national parks, pay tribute to the tranquility and solace they provide, and applaud the men and women who work tirelessly to preserve our heritage for us and for future generations of Americans. This year, the recognition of our national parks is particularly poignant as our country continues to combat the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Where our national parks have been able to remain safely open, they continue to provide a respite for the American people. Guidance from local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has led the National Park Service to determine that access to national parks must be temporarily curtailed, and that entire parks must be closed in some cases, to ensure the safety of visitors, employees, volunteers, and others. In the interim, we have found creative ways for Americans to connect with national parks through virtual opportunities that can be experienced remotely. At the same time, we look forward to when we can once again fully share with the public the benefits of our national parks. Even in challenging times, my Administration remains committed to maintaining and improving the condition and infrastructure of our national [[Page 82]] parks. Since 2017, we have invested in the restoration of the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, the restoration of the Washington Monument, and the construction of a new boardwalk around Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park. My fiscal year 2021 budget proposes the establishment of a Public Lands Infrastructure Fund, which would ensure continued long-term investments in the infrastructure of our Nation's public lands. Additionally, last year, I signed into law the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, the first comprehensive legislation addressing public lands management in over a decade. This legislation permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund, adjusted the boundaries of 15 national parks, and extended 2 national trails. These improvements will allow increased visitor access to our iconic national parks and landmarks. The National Park Service also collaborates with a growing network of States, local governments, and nonprofit organizations to encourage all Americans to use parks and other public lands as resources. The programs offered through these partnerships share the storied history of our Nation's triumphs and challenges with visitors from around our country and the world. For example, this year, we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which secured for women the right to vote. The voices of women whose vision, tenacity, and resilience moved them to tear down barriers and lead reform movements are shared at the Women's Rights National Historical Park in New York, the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, DC, and other sites across the country. The splendor of our Nation's landscapes and landmarks is a true reflection of our rich history and the beauty and greatness of America. As we observe National Park Week, we reaffirm our commitment to providing all Americans with greater opportunities to experience the stunning mountains, plains, deserts, coastlines, forests, and cultural and historical monuments displayed in our national parks. This week, we recognize the importance of our national park system and look forward to reopening all areas of our sites and parks to provide the public with more opportunities to enjoy all of our tremendous national landmarks. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 26, 2020, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate our national parks by learning more about the natural, cultural, and historical heritage that belongs to each and every citizen of the United States of America. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 83]] Proclamation 10012 of April 17, 2020 National Volunteer Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Civic engagement and volunteer service strengthens the fabric of our Nation and reflects the true heart, spirit, and goodness of America. National Volunteer Week is an opportunity to recognize and honor the countless individuals who selflessly invest in the lives of others. These ordinary citizens make extraordinary contributions to individuals, families, neighborhoods, communities, and our Nation. Our national character is measured by the unity, compassion, and initiative shown by Americans who help others. Volunteers serving in community and charitable organizations, faith-based institutions, and nonprofits fulfill critical needs and challenges faced by people of all ages and backgrounds. In soup kitchens, shelters, schools, hospitals, religious organizations, and countless other venues, volunteers foster a spirit of kindness and goodwill in communities large and small throughout the United States. When friends, neighbors, and strangers unite for a common cause, it demonstrates that we have the power to change lives and improve our world. We have never needed the volunteerism of America more than we do today. The coronavirus poses an unprecedented risk to the health, wellbeing, and prosperity of our Nation. True to form, in the midst of these turbulent times, Americans are unifying with unprecedented compassion, courage, and strength, bringing help and hope to those who need it most. Countless Americans have found unique and innovative ways to spread joy and meet the emotional, physical, and spiritual needs of others, despite the need to adhere to social distancing measures. Some are using technology to read stories to children and teach virtual classes; others are delivering necessities, such as groceries and medications, to seniors and others who are most at-risk from the virus. Non-profit organizations and companies are also mobilizing to provide equipment, supplies, resources, and necessities to people in need. Licensed healthcare professionals have stepped up as volunteers like never before for their fellow Americans to combat the coronavirus pandemic. If you have the ability to join their ranks, please visit www.FEMA.gov/ coronavirus/how-to-help. Volunteering to donate blood is especially important right now. Currently, our country's blood and platelet supply is dangerously low, and many blood drives have been cancelled. This extreme shortage poses a severe threat for our Nation's injured and those battling serious illnesses. I urge healthy Americans who are able to help fix this by making an appointment to give blood at a local donation center. Blood donation centers have safety protocols in place to prevent the spread of infections, including the coronavirus. The power of this safe and simple act of service is immeasurable. This National Volunteer Week, we pay tribute to men and women of all ages who devote their time, talent, and resources to the greater good. These unsung heroes expand the capacity of countless organizations across our Nation and around the world. During this pivotal time of uncertainty and shared sacrifice, Melania and I are especially grateful to all Americans who [[Page 84]] demonstrate love, compassion, mercy, and respect for humankind through volunteer service. Their actions enhance their own lives and the lives of those they serve, reflecting the best of America and the enduring principles that bind us together. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19 through April 25, 2020, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10013 of April 17, 2020 Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation's annual observance of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, calls on all Americans to pause and reflect on the horrific atrocities committed by the Nazi regime against minority groups and other ``undesirables'' in the years leading up to and during World War II. Among those murdered in the Holocaust were 6 million Jewish men, women, and children who became victims of the Third Reich's unthinkably evil ``Final Solution.'' As this year's Yom HaShoah commences, let us remember the millions of lives extinguished in the Holocaust, including those of Jewish, Polish, and Slavic ancestry, Roma and Sinti, individuals with mental and physical disabilities, gays, political dissidents, and dozens of other groups, and let us reaffirm our commitment to preserving and carrying forward their stories so that such repugnant acts of evil never occur again. This year's observance is particularly meaningful as earlier in the year we observed the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps throughout Europe. We must never forget the abhorrent anti-Semitism, racial hatred, and discrimination stoked by the Nazi regime and its accomplices and enablers that sent countless people to ghettos, concentration camps, killing fields, and death camps--a monstrous system that resulted in the murder of two out of three Jews in Europe and the imprisonment and torture of millions more. Tragically, far too many Americans of Jewish faith still face persecution. That is why I issued an Executive Order in December of 2019 to further expand and strengthen my Administration's ongoing efforts to combat racist and anti-Semitic discrimination. We must always condemn and confront all forms of racial, religious, and ethnic prejudice, discrimination, and hatred and strengthen the mutual bonds of respect that unite us all as Americans. [[Page 85]] During this time, as we mourn the millions of lives tragically lost during this dark stain on human history, we vow to ensure that future generations know the horrors of the Holocaust so that its crimes are never repeated. We also remember the powerful example that countless victims set through their remarkable determination, courage, and devotion. Together, let us resolve to build a society that always values the sanctity of every human life and the dignity of every faith. In doing so, we will make certain that freedom and liberty always triumph over evil and oppression. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby ask the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, April 19 through April 26, 2020, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, with appropriate study, prayers and commemoration, and to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution by remembering the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10014 of April 22, 2020 Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has significantly disrupted the livelihoods of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. Since then, the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies, including social distancing, to flatten the curve of infections and reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This needed behavioral shift has taken a toll on the United States economy, with national unemployment claims reaching historic levels. In the days between the national emergency declaration and April 11, 2020, more than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment. In the administration of our Nation's immigration system, we must be mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in an environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor. We must also conserve critical State Department resources so that consular officers may continue to provide services to United States citizens abroad. Even with their ranks diminished by staffing disruptions caused by the pandemic, consular officers continue to provide [[Page 86]] assistance to United States citizens, including through the ongoing evacuation of many Americans stranded overseas. I have determined that, without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labor supply outpaces labor demand. Excess labor supply affects all workers and potential workers, but it is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment, who are typically ``last in'' during an economic expansion and ``first out'' during an economic contraction. In recent years, these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups, including African Americans and other minorities, those without a college degree, and the disabled. These are the workers who, at the margin between employment and unemployment, are likely to bear the burden of excess labor supply disproportionately. Furthermore, lawful permanent residents, once admitted, are granted ``open-market'' employment authorization documents, allowing them immediate eligibility to compete for almost any job, in any sector of the economy. There is no way to protect already disadvantaged and unemployed Americans from the threat of competition for scarce jobs from new lawful permanent residents by directing those new residents to particular economic sectors with a demonstrated need not met by the existing labor supply. Existing immigrant visa processing protections are inadequate for recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak. The vast majority of immigrant visa categories do not require employers to account for displacement of United States workers. While some employment-based visas contain a labor certification requirement, because visa issuance happens substantially after the certification is completed, the labor certification process cannot adequately capture the status of the labor market today. Moreover, introducing additional permanent residents when our healthcare resources are limited puts strain on the finite limits of our healthcare system at a time when we need to prioritize Americans and the existing immigrant population. In light of the above, I have determined that the entry, during the next 60 days, of certain aliens as immigrants would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States of aliens as immigrants is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation. Sec. 2. Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry.

(b) The suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to: (i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States; (ii) any alien seeking to enter the United States on an immigrant visa as a physician, nurse, or other healthcare professional; to perform medical research or other research intended to combat the spread of COVID-19; or to perform work essential to combating, recovering from, or otherwise alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees; and any spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old of any such alien who are accompanying or following to join the alien; (iii) any alien applying for a visa to enter the United States pursuant to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program; (iv) any alien who is the spouse of a United States citizen; (v) any alien who is under 21 years old and is the child of a United States citizen, or who is a prospective adoptee seeking to enter the United States pursuant to the IR-4 or IH-4 visa classifications; (vi) any alien whose entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General or his designee; (vii) any member of the United States Armed Forces and any spouse and children of a member of the United States Armed Forces; (viii) any alien seeking to enter the United States pursuant to a Special Immigrant Visa in the SI or SQ classification, subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may impose, and any spouse and children of any such individual; or (ix) any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees. Sec. 3. Implementation and Enforcement. (a) The consular officer shall determine, in his or her discretion, whether an immigrant has established his or her eligibility for an exception in section 2(b) of this proclamation.

The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement [[Page 88]] this proclamation as it applies to the entry of aliens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish in the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion. (b) An alien who circumvents the application of this proclamation through fraud, willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or illegal entry shall be a priority for removal by the Department of Homeland Security. (c) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, consistent with the laws of the United States. Sec. 4. Termination. This proclamation shall expire 60 days from its effective date and may be continued as necessary. Whenever appropriate, but no later than 50 days from the effective date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Labor, recommend whether I should continue or modify this proclamation. Sec. 5. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on April 23, 2020. Sec. 6. Additional Measures. Within 30 days of the effective date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall review nonimmigrant programs and shall recommend to me other measures appropriate to stimulate the United States economy and ensure the prioritization, hiring, and employment of United States workers. Sec. 7. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or, (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any [[Page 89]] party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10015 of April 24, 2020 World Intellectual Property Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation's history is defined by discovery, ingenuity, and innovation. Americans are known for their resourcefulness and ability to find solutions to a wide range of challenges, including the development of technologies that advance our security, health, and prosperity. This resourcefulness has been a driving force of economic growth and human development since the founding of our Nation, and our future depends on the continued protection of our intellectual property. On World Intellectual Property Day, we renew our resolve to protect and secure the works and innovations of American artists, inventors, and other creators who continually push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding. Our Founding Fathers recognized the vital role that intellectual property plays in society and in supporting a robust economy. The Intellectual Property Clause of the Constitution reflects their understanding that laws must be in place to ``promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' More than two centuries later, we remain committed to this idea, upholding and strengthening an intellectual property system that encourages greater American innovation and advances our global competitiveness. My Administration is building on our Nation's history of securing intellectual property rights. In the United States, intellectual property-intensive industries account for nearly one-third of all employment and approximately 40 percent of our country's gross domestic product, an estimated $6.6 trillion. To support these industries, in January of this year I signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law, replacing the outdated and unbalanced North American Free Trade Agreement. USMCA furthers my Administration's pro-growth agenda by establishing ground-breaking protections for trade secrets, strengthening border security, and enhancing trademark, copyright, and patent provisions. These are the most comprehensive intellectual property standards ever included in a free trade agreement. Additionally, earlier this year I signed an Executive Order on [[Page 90]] Ensuring Safe and Lawful E-Commerce for United States Consumers, Businesses, Government Supply Chains, and Intellectual Property Rights Holders, which is aimed at finding improved ways to protect intellectual property rights holders from an increasing amount of counterfeit and pirated goods marketed online. The importance of intellectual property has never been more apparent than it is now, as we continue the ongoing battle against the coronavirus. To respond to this national and international emergency, the Federal, State, and local Governments have partnered with the private sector to develop new and powerful tools to combat the spread of the virus and provide care to those in need, focusing every available resource on the fight against the invisible enemy. Relying on strong intellectual property protections, these industries are able to act boldly to invent new tests, begin developing experimental treatments and vaccines, and rapidly produce and reengineer medical equipment to help win this war. These efforts are saving tens of thousands of lives and reflect the unrivaled power of American industry and innovation. This month, we pay tribute to our Nation's long history of ingenuity and advancement, and we recommit to protecting, promoting, and prioritizing a business and economic environment that supports those who carry on this legacy. The pioneering spirit of these artists, authors, inventors, and other creators has improved our lives and the lives of millions of people around the world, and will continue to propel us toward a better future. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 26, 2020, as World Intellectual Property Day. I encourage Americans to observe this day to celebrate the benefits of intellectual property to our economy and our country. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10016 of April 29, 2020 Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Throughout our Nation's history, Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent have made significant contributions to every aspect of our society, from business and politics to literature and the arts. Their accomplishments have enriched our Nation and stand as a testament to the power of the American Dream. During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we celebrate the indelible mark these individuals have left on our culture and pay tribute to the myriad ways in which they continue to strengthen our Nation. [[Page 91]] One story among many that exemplifies the values of intelligence, hard work, and determination that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have contributed to our Nation is that of An Wang, a Chinese American and pioneer in electronics engineering who helped shape the tech revolution during the latter half of the 20th century as an entrepreneur and innovator. An exceptionally skilled inventor and forward-thinking businessman, Wang held 40 patents and founded Wang Laboratories, one of the most successful American technology companies during the 1980s. Wang Laboratories' products became essential equipment in offices throughout the United States, helping bolster a thriving American economy. Wang also generously gave back to his community, donating his time and resources to the arts, hospitals, higher education, and cultural institutions. The United States also remains committed to strengthening our ongoing relationships with our Asian and Pacific partners. Last year, I was proud to stand alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an event in Houston, Texas, and earlier this year I made my first official visit to India as a demonstration of our Nation's enduring friendship with one of the world's largest and most diverse countries. During this historic visit, I had the honor of speaking about the importance of the relationship between our two countries before more than 110,000 Indian citizens. The visit also reaffirmed that India and the United States are committed to building a comprehensive global strategic partnership grounded in shared interests and common purpose, benefitting both of our countries. This month, we recognize the more than 20 million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who make irreplaceable contributions to our Nation's economy, security, and culture. We are especially grateful for those who have served and are currently serving in our Armed Forces, and those serving their communities as first responders. Together, we will continue to live out the promise of our founding and build a better future for all Americans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2020 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The Congress, by Public Law 102-450, as amended, has also designated the month of May each year as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.'' I encourage all Americans to learn more about those of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander heritage and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 92]] Proclamation 10017 of April 29, 2020 Jewish American Heritage Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In 1654, the first Jewish settlers arrived in New Amsterdam, present day New York City, seeking the freedom to practice their faith. In the centuries since, Jewish Americans have contributed in countless ways to our country's culture and character. From the arts and sciences to business and public service, nearly every facet of our society has benefitted from the talent, inspiration, vision, expertise, ingenuity, and sacrifice of Jewish Americans. We honor their spirit and resiliency during Jewish American Heritage Month and celebrate the myriad of ways they enrich our country and the world. Throughout history, the Jewish people have demonstrated an unbreakable spirit, overcoming suffering, cruel oppression, violence, and bigotry. Tragically, Jewish men, women, and children continue to face anti- Semitic discrimination, persecution, and violence today, and Jewish institutions and places of worship remain targets of vandalism and destruction. Our country has wept too many times in the aftermaths of horrific attacks, including last April when a murderer opened fire in a synagogue in Poway, California, taking innocent life and shattering families in a cowardly display of evil. Such unconscionable acts are an abomination to all decent and compassionate people. Hatred is intolerable and has no place in our hearts or in our society. We must therefore vigorously confront anti-Semitic discrimination and violence against members of the Jewish community. That is why I signed an Executive Order last December, bolstering my Administration's efforts to combat the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States and build a culture of respect, humanity, and equality. This month, we reaffirm our commitment to never compromise our steadfast support for the Jewish community, our rejection of anti-Semitic bigotry, and our disdain for malicious attacks of hatred. Jewish Americans strengthen, sustain, and inspire our country through dedication to family, respect for cherished traditions, and commitment to the values of justice and equality that unite Americans of every faith and background. We give thanks for the profound contributions that Jewish Americans continue to make to our society, and way of life. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2020 as Jewish American Heritage Month. I call upon Americans to celebrate the heritage and contributions of American Jews and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 93]] Proclamation 10018 of April 29, 2020 Law Day, U.S.A., 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation More than 230 years ago, the Founding Fathers of our Nation crafted a revolutionary and unique form of Government rooted in the rule of law. Today, we continue to enjoy liberty, justice, and equality under the law as set forth and preserved in our Constitution. On Law Day, we celebrate the distinctive framework of our system of Government, which secures individual liberties and protects against arbitrary exercise of government power so that all citizens have the right and the freedom to pursue their American Dream. In arguing for the ratification of our Constitution, James Madison wisely recognized that in a government ``administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' The Framers understood the inherent dangers of consolidated government power and that, in order for our Republic to survive, the power to make, execute, and interpret laws could not be vested in one individual or one institution. They knew that ``ambition must be made to counteract ambition,'' and accordingly devised an arrangement whereby separate and coequal branches share the power of the Federal Government, each limiting and checking the prerogatives of the others. They also created a system of enumerated powers for the Federal Government, reserving all other powers to the States. In doing so, the Framers limited the powers of the Federal Government and preserved a place of prominence for State and local lawmaking, which they rightly believed to be more responsive to the unique needs of each community. This year also marks both the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 15th Amendment, which prohibited denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which prohibited denial of the right to vote based on sex. The women and men who fought to win a voice for people of color and women in the electoral process strengthened our Union and helped the country better fulfill the founding promise of our Nation--that the power to enact and enforce laws be truly derived ``from the consent of the governed.'' As we mark these milestones, we pay tribute to the courageous spirit of the trailblazers who made this achievement possible, and take inspiration from their righteous struggle as we continue working to root out and destroy injustice. We know that our Republic can continue to shine as a beacon of liberty only if Americans diligently defend our Constitution and ensure that its limits are strongly enforced. My Administration has sought to simplify and streamline America's statutory and regulatory code, checking encroachments by government on individual liberty and unleashing the spirit of genius and innovation that has made America the freest and most prosperous country in the world. Furthermore, one of my top priorities as President has been to nominate and appoint judges who are faithful to the proper role of the judiciary--to interpret the law, not to make it. In all of these [[Page 94]] efforts, we aim to ensure that the Government can continue to perform its fundamental responsibility to the American people, articulated in the Preamble of the Constitution, to ``secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' On this Law Day, I urge all Americans to honor our shared inheritance of respect for the principles of the rule of law, limited government, and individual liberty. Let us rededicate ourselves to remaining ever vigilant in defending our rights secured by the Constitution so that our experiment in self-government continues in perpetuity. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2020, as Law Day, U.S.A. I urge all Americans, including government officials, to observe this day by reflecting upon the importance of the rule of law in our Nation and displaying the flag of the United States in support of this national observance; and I especially urge the legal profession, the press, and the radio, television, and media industries to promote and to participate in the observance of this day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10019 of April 30, 2020 National Foster Care Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Families are the foundation of our communities and our country. All children deserve a stable, supportive, and loving home in which to grow, thrive, and realize their full potential. During National Foster Care Month, we honor the selfless men and women who open their homes to nurture at-risk children and promote healing, unification, and family- based empowerment. Foster care plays a critical role in providing young people who have had to be removed from their homes a critical place of refuge. It is an invaluable resource for keeping children safe in temporary circumstances and providing stability, direction, and comfort to our Nation's most vulnerable sons and daughters. The dedicated individuals, families, professionals, and faith-based and community organizations who support children in foster care help maintain essential parent-child relationships and support parents working to regain custody of their children. A focus of my Administration has been to keep families together by working to prevent the situations that necessitate children being removed from their homes. In 2018, I enacted the Family First Prevention Services Act to enhance the ability of American families to keep their children safe at [[Page 95]] home whenever possible. It provides funding for community-based treatment and intervention services that have been proven to curtail abuse and neglect and to help families address the issues that might require separation. These services include access to skills-based parenting classes, family counseling, mental health therapy, and treatment for substance abuse and addiction. In addition, this legislation encourages States to place children with families rather than in group homes, which can minimize the risk of additional trauma. Last year, I signed into law legislation to encourage States to fully implement the Family First Prevention Services Act as quickly as feasible in order to connect families with appropriate resources and transition to a more proactive and prevention-based system. In cases where intervention becomes necessary, it is important to place children in the best position to maintain their family, school, and other social connections. It is also critical that older youth in foster care establish permanent bonds with a family member or caring adult before they exit the system and enter adulthood. For these reasons, my Administration is funding programs to provide in-family caregivers with the services and support they need to succeed. In partnership with the States, we are promoting more family-friendly options that reduce additional trauma to the children who must enter foster care. This month, we encourage all Americans to invest in the lives of children and to provide them with unconditional love, support, guidance, and every available resource to ensure their health and well-being. We acknowledge with gratitude the selfless citizens who open their hearts and homes to children in need and the organizations that tirelessly support foster and kinship caregivers. Together, they are giving hope and the promise of a better tomorrow to countless children and families. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2020 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking time to help children and youth in foster care, and to recognize the commitment of those who touch their lives, particularly celebrating their foster parents and other caregivers. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10020 of April 30, 2020 National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation This year, National Mental Health Awareness Month coincides with one of the most complex and challenging periods in our Nation's recent history--combatting the coronavirus pandemic. Not only has the virus caused immense physical suffering and loss for many people, it has also resulted in [[Page 96]] mental and emotional hardship. The stress and worry over the health and safety of family and friends, forced isolation, and financial distress can all result in anxiety, depression, substance misuse and abuse, and, tragically, even suicide. There is no question this is a difficult and unprecedented time for Americans. Yet, we know that there are ways to help people cope during these uncertain times, and we are committed to caring for those in need. Mental illness can affect anyone and can develop at any time. Its effects spread well beyond the individual to family, friends, and coworkers. As a Nation, we must fight the stigmas surrounding mental illness and empower those affected by emotional distress and their loved ones to seek care. We also recommit to strengthening our efforts to ensure every individual living with a mental illness, including children and young adults, our Nation's fastest growing population diagnosed with behavioral, mental, or emotional issues, receives the care and treatment they need to enjoy the blessings of a fulfilling and productive life. One of my first actions in response to the pandemic was to ensure easy access to vital medical resources. Expanded access to medical care through telemedicine is essential to fighting the virus. Through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, we have simplified access to health care and treatment without fear of the transmission of COVID-19 and other illnesses. By expanding Medicare telehealth coverage for the duration of the public health emergency, we have enabled our most vulnerable and high-risk populations to access important medical care from the comfort and safety of their home. Additionally, we have given $19.6 billion to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to further support our veterans through this crisis. This funding covers things like expanded telehealth services, including for mental health, and additional access to the VA Video Connect app, which offers a free, secure, virtual platform for patients to receive direct care from their VA medical providers through video. Providing an uninterrupted connection to essential mental health treatment and social support groups through telehealth technology can be lifesaving, especially for the more than 11 million American adults who struggle with serious mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder. That is one of the reasons I have overseen a historic expansion of telehealth services to give people in need easier access to mental health treatments, crisis interventions, and other vital resources. We must continue to find innovative ways to link doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers to people who need their help. As President, it is my top priority to ensure the health and wellness of all Americans, especially during the present crisis. Through the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides critical funding to every State to support community services for adults with serious mental illnesses and children with significant emotional disturbances. Through these grants, States and communities have increased ability to make substantial improvements in treatment delivery and to greatly expand access to those in need of behavioral healthcare services. As the virus began to take hold, I ensured that SAMHSA very quickly began releasing [[Page 97]] $360 million in emergency grant funding to provide Americans with substance use treatment and mental health services. Additionally, to help meet the needs of Americans during this crisis, I authorized the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to make crisis counseling and training services available to States hardest hit through the Stafford Act. Tragically some individuals feel their problems are insurmountable, lose their will and hope, and succumb to suicide. We must prevent these tragedies. The Federal Communications Commission has designated a national three-digit number for suicide prevention to connect directly to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The proposed abbreviated number, 988, would make crisis help more widely available to Americans. Additionally, in March of 2019, I signed an Executive Order to establish the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS), which unites State and local governments, faith communities, employers, schools, and healthcare organizations through a whole-of-government and whole-of-Nation approach to provide world-class, evidence-based tactics for veteran suicide prevention. Rather than waiting for veterans in need to seek help, this program actively empowers veteran communities through local and national support networks. In response to the current crisis, the PREVENTS initiative-- with Second Lady Karen Pence as Lead Ambassador--has launched the MoreThanEverBefore campaign to encourage all Americans to compassionately reach out to veterans in need. My fiscal year 2021 budget requests $313 million--a 32-percent increase from the enacted fiscal year 2020 level--to support and sustain these initiatives. My Administration will always champion policies and treatments to help all Americans appreciate the full and abundant potential of life. No American should ever feel alone. Let us recommit to lifting up our struggling friends, family members, and neighbors with the touch of humanity. There is always the promise of recovery, healing, and renewal. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2020 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illnesses, raise awareness of mental health conditions through appropriate programs and activities, and commit our Nation to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 98]] Proclamation 10021 of April 30, 2020 National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we encourage all Americans to maintain more physically active and healthy lifestyles, which can help improve our overall well-being. We also recognize the important role that sports play in American society and the ways sports help unite us. Through friendly competition, the development of lifelong skills and character traits, and memorable times spent with family and friends, sports help bring communities together, entertain us, and improve our health. As our Nation continues to practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, regular physical activity at home can be an effective way to improve and maintain physical fitness. Even during this difficult time, Americans should strive to engage in the recommended amounts of physical activity--at least 60 minutes a day of moderate-to- vigorous physical activity for youth ages 6-17, including aerobic activities and activities that strengthen muscles and bones, and at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity activity, plus two or more days a week of muscle-strengthening activities, for adults. In addition, adults 65 years and older should do multicomponent physical activities that include balance training, such as standing on one foot. Even as we social distance, we can do jumping jacks or push-ups, household chores, tend our lawns and gardens, and engage in numerous other activities that promote a healthy and active lifestyle. The United States Department of Health and Human Services' Move Your Way campaign has tools and resources to help Americans of all ages and abilities live healthier lives through increased physical activity. As our country defeats the coronavirus, sports will once again help unite us as a Nation. Participation in sports instills values such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership that transcend the field or court and help everyone, especially our youth, flourish in life. Last September, we launched the National Youth Sports Strategy, which awarded $6.7 million in grants to help increase youth sports participation. This bold initiative is the first Federal roadmap designed to unify the American youth sports culture around a shared vision that one day all youth will have the opportunity to play sports--regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, ability, or zip code. I have also appointed more than 20 youth sports advocates to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. These individuals have been encouraging families to stay active even while they are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Once sports programming resumes, this Council will continue to ensure that children and youth have access to safe places to play sports, encouraging healthier lifestyles. By providing a solid foundation for participation in safe, fun, inclusive, and accessible sporting opportunities, our children and youth will be better suited to thrive. This month, I urge all Americans to invest in the health of our great Nation by incorporating physical activity into their daily lives and by promoting the positive effects of sports on youth development. Through regular physical activity, we can achieve our shared goal of living healthier lives. [[Page 99]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2020 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make physical activity and sports participation a priority in their lives. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10022 of April 30, 2020 Older Americans Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Older Americans are cherished and invaluable members of our society, deserving our utmost respect, gratitude, and admiration. During Older Americans Month, we pause to draw upon the wisdom, spirit, and experience older adults bring to our families, our communities, and our Nation. We also recognize that during this time of crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, we can persevere and prevail by emulating the resolve, tenacity, and determination of America's more experienced individuals who have endured and overcome life's most challenging times. Older Americans have built our economy, defended our freedom, and shaped our Nation's character. They have raised families and dedicated themselves to improving the quality of life for future generations. They sacrificed in times of hardship and took pride in a job well done. Many served honorably in our Armed Forces during some of the darkest times in the history of our Republic. Older Americans have lived lives of service and sacrifice, bound by devotion to the sacred principles of our country. Although no one could begrudge them rest and respite during their retirement years, having worked decades to support and grow their families and nurture their communities, many older Americans spend their time volunteering for those in need, mentoring young people, or learning new skills. They pour love into their extended families, places of worship, and neighborhood centers, and offer profound perspective and insight gleaned from years of life lessons. My Administration remains committed to enacting policies that benefit our Nation's older adults. In an effort to lower the cost of prescription drugs, the Food and Drug Administration has approved more generic drugs each year during my 3 years in office than any other year in the history of our country. We have also developed a path to allow less expensive prescription drugs to be imported from Canada. Additionally, I ended the terrible gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling patients when they could pay less out of pocket by not using their insurance. I have also taken executive action to improve seniors' access to medical care and to bolster [[Page 100]] Medicare's fiscal sustainability by reducing regulatory burdens and eliminating unnecessary barriers. This action puts older Americans first by strengthening the program and helping to ensure its success for years to come. Our Nation's older Americans are among the most susceptible to fraud and other financial schemes. To help counter these vile crimes, I have instructed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prioritize protecting older Americans from financial exploitation and use every tool they have to disrupt and prosecute these criminals. Over the last year, DOJ has taken unprecedented action against transnational fraud schemes that target seniors, the networks of ``money mules'' that move stolen funds from Americans' bank accounts to overseas fraudsters, and telephone companies that knowingly facilitate billions of fraudulent robocalls. DOJ has also launched an Elder Fraud Hotline (1-833-FRAUD-11) so that America's seniors can more easily report fraud, find resources, and better protect themselves from this abhorrent criminal behavior. Older Americans are among those most vulnerable to the ravages of the coronavirus. As they continue to adhere to the special guidance put in place to protect them, we must acknowledge that far too many are facing hardships of loneliness and social isolation. Many families are unable to visit elderly parents and grandparents, and many men and women in retirement and nursing homes have been cut off from personal contact and meaningful social connections. During this precarious and stressful time, we must remember our treasured older adults and recommit to doing what we can to support and care for them. I urge all Americans to reach out to loved ones, neighbors, and strangers to extend love, compassion, and encouragement. By delivering food and supplies to the homebound, mailing greeting cards, or using technology to stay connected, we can support our seniors as we defeat the virus. Older Americans know how to overcome. They have done it their whole lives. With the country rallying behind them we can ensure that they can continue to live lives of dignity, joy, and purpose long after the threat of the virus has faded. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2020 as Older Americans Month. I call upon all Americans to honor our elders, acknowledge their contributions, care for those in need, and reaffirm our country's commitment to older Americans this month and throughout the year. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 101]] Proclamation 10023 of April 30, 2020 Loyalty Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The United States has been a strong Nation for more than two centuries not only because of the ideals that we share as a people, but also because of the love we have for our home and the loyalty we have for each other. From the beginning of our history and through trials of war and peace, Americans have always been filled with a devotion to freedom, a fierce spirit of independence, a courageous dedication to the cause of self-government, and a sacred commitment to our shared and glorious destiny. Together, we honor the wisdom of our Founders. We revere the words of our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence. We celebrate the heroes of our history and treasure the majesty of America's natural beauty. We marvel at the achievements of American artists, scientists, engineers, inventors, business leaders, and pioneers. And we cherish the nobility of the American way of life. For all of these reasons and more, the United States is the most just and virtuous nation in the history of the world--and the American people are exceptional citizens of an exceptional republic. Americans rightly take pride in our country--and we take pride in the unique culture of freedom that has been forged over nearly 250 years. Our national character is defined by the values of faith and family, liberty and fairness, and hard work and personal responsibility. Generations of Americans have poured out sweat, blood, soul, and tears to defend these values--and on this day, we rededicate ourselves to protecting them in our own time, and for unborn generations to come. Americans have always been loyal to their Nation--and they deserve a government that is always loyal to them in return. As we confront the global pandemic that is now afflicting our country, we draw strength from the bonds of duty, love, and loyalty that have always sustained our Nation through trying times. An army of doctors, nurses, truckers, clerks, scientists, service workers, researchers, and first responders are doing everything in their power to heal the sick, find a cure, and care for the needs of every American--often at grave risk to themselves. All across our country, Americans are courageously fighting a daily battle against an invisible enemy. In light of the extraordinary heroism and dedication we have witnessed, each of us will go forward from this challenging time stronger and even more certain that when duty calls, we will answer it. On this Loyalty Day, we recognize that as long as we take pride in our country, defend our great inheritance, and love our Nation, America will rise to every occasion and achieve a magnificent future. In order to reaffirm our loyalty to our country, to our freedoms, and to each other, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as ``Loyalty Day,'' and has requested the President issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate activities. On this day, we honor the United States of America and its values, as well as those who have fought and continue to fight for our freedom. [[Page 102]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2020, as Loyalty Day. I call on all Americans to observe this day by learning more about the proud history of our Nation. I urge all Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings and grounds on that day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10024 of May 1, 2020 National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As we observe National Hurricane Preparedness Week, I call on Americans in hurricane-prone regions to take appropriate measures to help mitigate the devastation that these storms can produce. Through proper preparation, we can bolster our resilience against any challenge we face from these incredibly powerful storms. Accurate forecasting is crucial for communities across our country, which need advance notice to protect lives and property from hurricanes. My Administration remains dedicated to enhancing our hurricane tracking and prediction capabilities. As we have entered a new era of supercomputing, we have been able to increase our computing capacity and ensure the United States has the most accurate weather forecasting models in the world. Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Prediction Innovation Center continues to improve our knowledge of severe weather and further increase our forecasting accuracy. Innovators like these are helping to protect the lives of Americans living in hurricane-prone areas, giving them access to critical information before a hurricane arrives and enabling appropriate preparations. While these strides in improving our predictive abilities are significant, the power of preemptive planning for every hazard created by hurricanes cannot be discounted. In the United States, storm surge and inland flooding from heavy rains have historically caused more hurricane-related deaths than the winds generated by the storms. The National Weather Service's Weather-Ready Nation initiative and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Ready Campaign are excellent resources for preparing your defense against the destructive potential of hurricanes and other severe storms. Emergency planning--including putting together an emergency supply kit; ensuring your house and business are hurricane-ready; considering flood insurance options; creating communication plans with family members; and, when a storm approaches, determining if you live in a hurricane evacuation zone--will help empower you, your community, and our Nation to be more prepared and responsive. Hurricane season can also place a heavy burden on our medical professionals, first responders, and critical infrastructure workers. We know these [[Page 103]] very same people are already operating under great strain to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. We extend to them our deepest gratitude and vow to provide them any support they need during these challenging times. This week is an opportunity for all Americans living in areas susceptible to hurricane-related harm to take proactive measures to protect their families, businesses, communities, and livelihood. Taking action now to keep our loved ones and property safe from the threats posed by hurricanes will help us be an even more resilient Nation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 3 through May 9, 2020 as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon everyone to take action this week by making use of the online resources provided by the National Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to safeguard your families, homes, and businesses from the dangers of hurricanes and severe storms. I also call upon Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management officials to help inform our communities about hurricane preparedness and response in order to prevent storm damage and save lives. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10025 of May 1, 2020 Public Service Recognition Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During Public Service Recognition Week, we pay tribute to our Federal, State, and local government employees for their unwavering dedication to civil service. On the front lines in times of prosperity and adversity alike, our world-class workforce remains ready and willing to serve their fellow Americans. At all levels of government, our civilian personnel have made our Nation stronger and more prosperous. In recent weeks and months, our Nation's civilian officials have united with unprecedented urgency and resolve to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Their tireless efforts are ensuring Federal, State, local, and tribal governments continue to provide necessary services to their constituents, are helping forge productive government-private sector partnerships, and are bolstering our ongoing recovery efforts. Our public health experts, who always play an integral role in protecting the health and wellbeing of our people, have provided critical and timely guidance to Americans on how to stay healthy and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Emergency managers, first responders, and law enforcement are continuing to provide life-saving care, comfort, and support to those affected. Postal workers are delivering essential supplies and communications. Sanitation workers are [[Page 104]] keeping our communities clean. School teachers and educators are continuing to provide virtual education and support to students. And countless other public servants are diligently and humbly supporting our American way of life during this crisis. Through their dedicated efforts, the American people are protected and supported despite the unprecedented challenges we face. As we start to see a promising forecast and eventual recovery--thanks in large part to the extraordinary sacrifices the American people have made on behalf of their fellow citizens--we can begin the critical work of reopening our country. We know that our public service employees will play a crucial role in restarting our economy and getting our society fully revitalized, while also protecting American lives. My Administration remains committed to supporting these men and women at all levels of government during this process, ensuring they have the resources and information they need to continue serving the American people while also safeguarding their own wellbeing. Together, we will complete the work of rebuilding and restoring our Nation. This Public Service Recognition Week, we are especially grateful to our devoted public servants. Their experience, expertise, and commitment to service will lift our Nation up during these difficult times and help ensure a swift recovery. We will forever be indebted to them for their hard work, dedication, and courage, always remembering their irreplaceable contributions to our people and our country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 3 through May 9, 2020, as Public Service Recognition Week. I call upon Americans and all Federal, State, tribal, and local government agencies to recognize the dedication of our Nation's public servants and to observe this week through appropriate programs and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10026 of May 5, 2020 Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The American Indian and Alaska Native people have endured generations of injustice. They experience domestic violence, homicide, sexual assault, and abuse far more frequently than other groups. These horrific acts, committed predominantly against women and girls, are egregious and unconscionable. During Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day, we reaffirm our commitment to ending the disturbing [[Page 105]] violence against these Americans and to honoring those whose lives have been shattered and lost. Resiliency, collaboration, and resourcefulness are all necessary to eradicate the heartbreaking incidents of missing persons and fatal violence experienced by American Indian and Alaska Native communities across our country. My Administration stands squarely behind the tribal governments that are leading the efforts to address this pattern of violence so that their people can live in peace and thrive. The Yakama Nation in southern Washington is using the State's major violent crime database to track the disappearance of tribal members. On the Navajo Reservation, the Missing and Murdered Din[eacute] Relatives Work Group is working to end sex trafficking, child abductions, and other challenges within the largest tribal jurisdiction in the Nation. In Montana, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes are engaged with State officials to prioritize cases of missing and murdered tribal citizens. Beyond these and other efforts, tribal communities are leveraging rich cultural traditions of healing ceremonies and spiritual practices to offer refuge, compassion, and comfort to individuals and families in crisis. Under my Administration, tribal governments are not alone in fighting the epidemic of violence against American Indian and Alaska Native people. In October of 2019, the Department of Justice (DOJ) awarded more than $270 million in grants to improve public safety, serve victims of crime, combat violence against women, and support youth programs in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The DOJ's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Initiative is placing coordinators in 11 United States Attorneys' offices to develop comprehensive law enforcement responses to missing persons cases. These responses also include the use of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's advanced capabilities, enhanced data collection, and analysis to support local efforts when required. The Department of the Interior (DOI) is also taking action to address the critical concerns of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. DOI's Bureau of Indian Affairs has launched a series of ``Reclaiming Our Native Communities'' roundtables focused on domestic violence prevention of missing or murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women, children, and men. The Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Justice Services (BIA-OJS) is equipping officers to handle long-standing cold cases and child abduction investigations, including positioning Special Agents on cold-case task forces in strategic locations throughout the country. BIA-OJS has partnered with the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System to aid in identifying missing persons cases involving Native Americans. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made the health and safety of American Indian and Alaska Native communities a priority. HHS is developing a comprehensive, whole-person approach for strengthening these vulnerable populations through prevention, health, and education activities. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) partners with tribes and tribal organizations to strengthen responses to Native American victims of domestic violence. ACF will soon disburse $22 million to increase the public health response and expand shelter and supportive services to victims of family violence, domestic violence, and dating abuse in tribal communities. [[Page 106]] To help bolster these efforts to address this terrible crisis, last November, I was proud to sign an Executive Order establishing Operation Lady Justice. This interagency task force is developing an aggressive government-wide strategy for ending the cycle of violence and providing grants to improve public safety in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The task force is consulting with tribal leaders to develop and strengthen investigative protocols to resolve new and unsolved cases, improve information and data sharing, establish best practices for communicating with families throughout an investigation, and raise public awareness through outreach to affected communities. Tragically, violence is prevalent in tribal communities, but we are determined to reverse this unacceptable trend. Through partnerships across Federal, State, and tribal governments, we are aggressively working to ensure that members of tribal communities can live lives free from fear of violence. We will not waver in our mission to bring healing, justice, hope, and restoration to our American Indian and Alaska Native communities. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2020, as Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans and all Federal, State, tribal, and local governments to increase awareness of the crisis of missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives through appropriate programs and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10027 of May 6, 2020 National Day of Prayer, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On this National Day of Prayer, Americans reaffirm that prayer guides and strengthens our Nation, and we express, with humility and gratitude, our ``firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence.'' As one Nation under God, we share a legacy of faith that sustains and inspires us and a heritage of religious liberty. Today, we join together and lift up our hearts, remembering the words of 1 John 5:14 that tell us when ``we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.'' From our earliest days, our dependence upon God has brought us to seek His divine counsel and unfailing wisdom. Our leaders have often encouraged their fellow citizens to seek wisdom from God and have recognized God's power to lead our Nation ahead to brighter days. When the prospects for our independence seemed bleak, General George Washington proclaimed a national day of ``fasting, humiliation and prayer, humbly to supplicate the mercy of Almighty God.'' Following the devastating destruction [[Page 107]] of the Civil War, President Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address and invoked the power of prayer to ``bind up the nation's wounds.'' And more than 100 years later, President Reagan noted our long reliance on prayer throughout our history, writing that ``through the storms of revolution, Civil War, and the great world wars as well as during times of disillusionment and disarray, the Nation has turned to God in prayer for deliverance.'' Today, as much as ever, our prayerful tradition continues as our Nation combats the coronavirus. During the past weeks and months, our heads have bowed at places outside of our typical houses of worship, whispering in silent solitude for God to renew our spirit and carry us through unforeseen and seemingly unbearable hardships. Even though we have been unable to gather together in fellowship with our church families, we are still connected through prayer and the calming reassurance that God will lead us through life's many valleys. In the midst of these trying and unprecedented times, we are reminded that just as those before us turned to God in their darkest hours, so must we seek His wisdom, strength, and healing hand. We pray that He comforts those who have lost loved ones, heals those who are sick, strengthens those on the front lines, and reassures all Americans that through trust in Him, we can overcome all obstacles. May we never forget that prayer guides and empowers our Nation and that all things are possible with God. In times of prosperity, strife, peace, and war, Americans lean on His infinite love, grace, and understanding. Today, on this National Day of Prayer, let us come together and pray to the Almighty that through overcoming this coronavirus pandemic, we develop even greater faith in His divine providence. In 1988, the Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a National Day of Prayer, ``on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 7, 2020, as a National Day of Prayer. I encourage all Americans to observe this day, reflecting on the blessings our Nation has received and the importance of prayer, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in their houses of worship, communities, and places of work, schools, and homes consistent with the White House's ``Guidelines for Opening up America Again.'' IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 108]] Proclamation 10028 of May 6, 2020 National Nurses Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Every day, nurses provide quality, compassionate, and critical care to patients during both routine medical visits and in times of great vulnerability, fear, and uncertainty. Over the past weeks and months, as our nurses have worked heroically on the frontlines of the coronavirus response, their contributions to the health and well-being of our citizenry have been exponentially magnified. On National Nurses Day, we honor and celebrate the extraordinary men and women who devote themselves to this vital and noble profession. Nursing is not merely a vocation; it is a special calling to serve others selflessly, particularly in times when help is needed most. Throughout our Nation's history, in times of war, natural disaster, medical emergencies, and both epidemics and pandemics, nurses have rushed in--undaunted by danger, personal sacrifice, and discomfort to provide hope, help, and healing to people in need. Few times has our reliance on nurses been more profoundly evident than during the coronavirus outbreak. In the midst of this crisis, nurses have displayed incredible examples of humanity, selflessness, and sacrifice as they have fought to care for their fellow citizens and save lives. Nationwide, in hospitals, clinics, and other treatment centers where Americans are suffering from the virus, these warriors have steadfastly provided remarkable care and vital assistance to patients. In spite of fatigue and the threat to their own health, nurses soldier on in combat against this invisible enemy. Often the first to treat patients in our hospitals, they provide critical support to doctors, alleviating burdens throughout our healthcare system. They are adaptable and capable of enduring and overcoming unbearable hardship, immeasurable stress, tremendously long hours, and extreme mental and emotional exhaustion so that others may live. Nurses are awe-inspiring and truly worthy of admiration and praise. Nurses reflect the character of America and epitomize the inexhaustible capacity of the human spirit. These remarkable caregivers exhibit professional expertise, selfless dedication, unrelenting advocacy, and unsurpassed mercy, strength, and compassion. On this National Nurses Day, Melania and I urge all citizens to join us in offering our wholehearted gratitude, uncompromising support, and utmost respect to these invaluable healthcare professionals. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2020, as National Nurses Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. [[Page 109]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10029 of May 7, 2020 Military Spouse Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Military spouses, who stand alongside our men and women in uniform, share in our service members' heroic endeavors through selfless service, immeasurable contributions, and noble sacrifices. Through their dedication to their loved ones, military spouses support the mission of our Armed Forces to defend our Nation and preserve our liberty. On Military Spouse Day, we pay tribute to these extraordinary individuals who strengthen and enrich our fighting forces, our communities, and our Republic. The abiding capacity of our Nation's military spouses to balance the many demands of military life reflects their unwavering spirit, fortitude, and grace. They support loved ones who have answered our country's call to duty, raise children far from extended family, and invest in their communities through volunteer service. At the same time, demonstrating their loyal devotion to a cause greater than self, many of them pursue their own educational and career goals and routinely face the stress and uncertainty of frequent moves, as well as the heartache and loneliness of deployment. Their individual stories, interests, and talents are unique, but military spouses share the common bonds of selflessness, strength of character, and faithfulness to a Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman, or member of the Space Force. Our Nation's military spouses bring considerable talent, expertise, and experience to the workplace, and their employment is critical to military recruitment, retention, and readiness. My Administration recognizes that our military spouses face unique obstacles in obtaining and retaining employment. Occupational licensing requirements disproportionally affect them; they earn substantially less than other labor market participants earn; and they currently face an elevated unemployment rate. To help solve this problem, last December, I signed into law legislation that changed residency requirements to allow military spouses to retain their State of residency for business purposes, eliminating the long and expensive process of having to re- register their business following a change in duty station. This legislation also doubled the reimbursement amount for occupational licensing and recertification costs from $500 to $1,000 for military spouses who have a permanent change of station, helping to defray costs for those who work in fields that require documentation. My Administration is also working with the private, public, and non- profit sectors to help create meaningful jobs, careers, and economic empowerment for military spouses. Through the Department of Defense's Military Spouse Employment Partnership program, we have secured commitments [[Page 110]] from more than 400 American companies and 13 Federal agencies to recruit, hire, train, retrain, and support military spouses. Additionally, last year, we held two business summits at the White House that resulted in participating companies pledging to work to improve military employment opportunities for military spouses. These patriotic employers are making efforts to review and reduce requirements for certain jobs, partner with other companies to assist with job relocation after a change in duty station, and educate managers on the lifestyle of military spouses and the challenges they face. Today, we salute the spirit and patriotism of the exceptional women and men who serve as military spouses and embody the best of America. Military spouses are among our country's unsung heroes, serving as the heart of the home front and providing tremendous strength to our Armed Forces. On this Military Spouse Day, the First Lady and I urge our fellow Americans to extend sincere gratitude to our Nation's incredible military spouses. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2020, as Military Spouse Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10030 of May 8, 2020 National Charter Schools Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Nearly 30 years ago, in a small town in southeast Minnesota, freedom- loving Americans on both sides of the political aisle opened the doors to our Nation's first public charter school, enabling families to more effectively choose the best learning environment for their child. This historic action sparked a movement that now spans 44 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. There are currently more than 7,400 public charter schools providing individualized education and learning opportunities to more than 3 million students and their families throughout our Nation. During National Charter School Week, we recognize the contributions of public charter school leaders, teachers, students, and parents and reaffirm our commitment to further expand access to public charter schools and all high-quality education opportunities throughout our Nation. Every American family should have the right to choose the learning environment that works best for their child. Despite this, for decades the idea that all children can thrive under a one-size-fits-all approach to learning has defined American education. This antiquated and monolithic model leaves far too many of our Nation's young people trapped in a learning environment that does not meet their individual needs. Public charter schools [[Page 111]] ensure individual choice and empower students to fulfil their potential. These important educational options also disproportionately serve low- income students and students of color, and have a proven track record of serving these children better than neighboring public schools. Although public charter school enrollment has increased at least eightfold in the past 18 years, there are currently more than 1 million students still on waitlists throughout the country. My Administration remains committed to ensuring these children are able to receive the best education possible by expanding access to alternative education options. Since my first day in office, I have championed school choice and education freedom for every American student, acknowledging that a family's zip code or socioeconomic status should not determine a child's future. My Administration has invested nearly $1.5 billion in the development of public charter schools, while also taking action to restore local control over education and expand access to high-quality education opportunities. Together, we are empowering students and families to be able to access learning environments that meet their unique needs. This week, public charter schools, families, and supporters will share inspirational stories of success, recognize leaders in the charter sector, and build awareness of the unique public charter school model that offers flexibility to try different instructional methods while being accountable for student achievement and outcomes. During National Charter Schools Week, and every week, let us celebrate the extraordinary work of public charter schools in advancing education freedom, excellence, and innovative approaches to learning. By continuing to support public charter schools and students, we will give power back to families and build a brighter future for all Americans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 10 through May 16, 2020, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's successful public charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to help students and empower parents and families by supporting high-quality charter schools as an important school choice option. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 112]] Proclamation 10031 of May 8, 2020 National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation's transportation infrastructure system is central to the ability of our manufacturers and exporters to get their goods to market and provides vital support for our national defense. On National Defense Transportation Day and during National Transportation Week, we recognize the critical contributions of the hardworking and dedicated Americans who ensure the safety, efficiency, and reliability of our transportation infrastructure systems. Our Nation has a proven history of transportation innovation and might. We built the Transcontinental Railroad that led to today's interconnected freight rail network, engineered interstate highways and inland river infrastructure that connect the heartlands to our coastlines and beyond, and pioneered aviation with the advent of flight in Kitty Hawk. Our legacy of innovative practices, combined with the American spirit, has led to a robust, intricately connected country. After decades of use, however, many of our Nation's roads, rails, ports, and airports are in disrepair. One of the chief causes of delay in infrastructure improvements is the broken permitting process. Completing the average environmental impact statement (EIS) process for highway projects takes more than 7 years. Some have taken more than a decade. To improve Federal agency coordination and make environmental reviews and permitting processes far less time-consuming, I directed Federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy and complete environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects within 2 years. My Administration has also proposed the first comprehensive update to the regulations that implement the National Environmental Policy Act in more than 40 years. These new regulations will codify important aspects of the One Federal Decision policy to reduce the average time to complete an environmental impact statement through increased interagency coordination, cooperation, and communication within the Federal Government without sacrificing environmental protection. As a Nation, we must revitalize our crumbling infrastructure to promote commerce, protect public safety, and enhance our national defense. Our country's security and prosperity are inextricably linked, and the ability to move and travel freely throughout the country helps to ensure our Nation's preparedness and military readiness. Americans deserve nothing less than the most efficient, modern, and safe transportation infrastructure system that stimulates economic growth, creates jobs, supports the delivery of necessities during times of crises like these, and effectively facilitates the flow of supplies and equipment to our service members. My Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to invest in the repair and modernization of our transportation infrastructure. To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, [[Page 113]] by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), has designated the third Friday in May of each year as ``National Defense Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), has declared that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as ``National Transportation Week.'' In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the dedication and patriotism of our Nation's transportation workers have never been more evident as they risk their own health to ensure that grocery store shelves stay stocked and healthcare professionals receive essential products and equipment. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 15, 2020, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 10 through May 16, 2020, as National Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities to learn more about how our transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and the prosperity of our Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10032 of May 8, 2020 Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we commend the brave men and women of our law enforcement community for continually summoning the courage to fulfill their solemn oath to protect and serve. We also pause to remember all those who have lost their lives and who have suffered permanent disabilities defending their communities and the rule of law, including the heroes we have lost this year to the coronavirus. Throughout our Nation's history, law enforcement officials have never wavered in the face of crisis or tragedy. During uncertain times, law enforcement officers bravely face challenges and continue to protect the American people. They steadfastly ensure the safety of our communities, providing a much needed sense of security for our citizens, and our country is extremely grateful for their efforts. My Administration remains committed to ensuring our Nation's Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers have the resources and support they need to perform their duties safely and effectively. Last October, I was proud to sign an Executive Order to establish the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice--the first commission on law enforcement in half a century. This Commission identifies ways to reduce crime while simultaneously bringing law enforcement officers and the communities they serve closer together. We have also worked to expand lifesaving programs like the National Blue Alert Network. Thirty-five States have enacted Blue Alert plans, which provide early [[Page 114]] warnings to law enforcement agencies, the media, and the public by transmitting Blue Alerts to cell phones, television stations, and other devices. These alerts disseminate information on suspects who pose an imminent and credible threat to the safety of our officers, and this network demonstrates how we can work together to provide proactive programs, innovative resources, and cutting-edge technology to support and advance our law enforcement personnel. We must continue working toward a time when all people respect and understand the important work that law enforcement officers do. Unfortunately, our law enforcement officers do not always receive the respect they deserve. These brave men and women must operate in an environment where their moral and legal authority is constantly being scrutinized, and they undertake the critical yet difficult task of addressing the actions of those affected by addiction, homelessness, and mental illness. Their ability to work well in the face of these and other challenges is extraordinary, and we have incredible appreciation for their public service and selflessness. On behalf of our grateful Nation, we proudly recognize the more than 900,000 sworn members of law enforcement for their resolve and dedication in the face of dangerous uncertainty. The thoughts and prayers of our Nation are with them and their families, and we will always owe them our appreciation and support. By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (Public Law 87-726, 76 Stat. 676), and by section 1 of Public Law 105-225 (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the week in which it falls as ``Police Week.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2020, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 10 through May 16, 2020, as Police Week. In honor of our hardworking law enforcement officers, Melania and I will light the White House in blue on May 15, 2020. I call upon all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag from their homes and businesses on that day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 115]] Proclamation 10033 of May 8, 2020 Mother's Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On Mother's Day, we celebrate the exceptional mothers in our lives. It is through the unwavering love, comfort, and guidance of these extraordinary women that we first learn to experience joy and the wonders of life. Whether they became mothers through birth, adoption, foster care, or other means, these women are deserving of our unending gratitude and praise this day and every day. The intuition and wisdom passed from mother to child strengthens the fabric of our Nation and preserves generations of wisdom and familial values. In our earliest days, our mothers provide us with love and nurturing care. They often know our talents before we do, and they selflessly encourage us to use these God-given gifts to pursue our biggest dreams and most admirable ambitions. As we grow, our mothers teach us to be productive, contributing members of society and to care for one another as they have cared for us. As life-long supporters, mothers provide reassurance and guidance when needed most. President Abraham Lincoln described this spirit of compassion: ``I remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life.'' Our mothers embrace us for who we are and help guide us to who we are meant to be. They advocate for us and counsel us, and above all else provide us with a steadfast and enduring love each day. Today, on Mother's Day, we celebrate mothers everywhere and thank them for all that they do to enrich our lives, honoring how they raise us with a special grace and endurance. Their character, courage, and compassion are gifts that transcend time and span generations. May today be filled with the joy of knowing their contributions to our society are immeasurable, and their love for us does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. In recognition of the contributions of mothers to American families and to our Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day, and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 10, 2020, as Mother's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their love and respect for their mothers or beloved mother figures, whether with us in person or in spirit, and to reflect on the importance of motherhood to the prosperity of our families, communities, and Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 116]] Proclamation 10034 of May 15, 2020 Armed Forces Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In times of war and peace alike, on land, at sea, in the skies, in cyberspace, and beyond the Earth's atmosphere, the men and women of our Nation's Armed Forces serve with honor and distinction and stand ready to selflessly defend our Nation. On Armed Forces Day, we pay tribute to these patriots, whose work enables our country to shine always as a beacon of freedom and hope for the world. Throughout our Nation's history, our Armed Forces have protected our country, our liberty, and our founding principles. Earlier this month, we marked the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, when United States and Allied forces liberated Europe and North Africa from tyranny and oppression. The courageous actions of these heroes will stand always as monuments to the very best of our Nation. Today, many of our service members have been called into action on the home front to aid in our fight against a new type of enemy--the coronavirus. Our Guardsmen, engineers, logisticians, and medical service members have provided critical lifesaving treatment, protective equipment, facilities, and other vital services and provisions quickly and efficiently to those in need. In March, I was honored as Commander in Chief to salute those aboard the USNS Comfort as these heroes set sail from the shores of Norfolk, Virginia, to bring aid and comfort to people in need of care in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. As they have shown throughout this crisis, working to ease the burdens on healthcare workers and first responders, our Armed Forces can adapt to any challenge and succeed in any mission. My Administration will always remain committed to ensuring our Nation has the strongest and most advanced military in the world. We owe it to our warriors to ensure that we provide them with the necessary training and equipment to meet current and future challenges. Since I took office, we have invested a historic $2.2 trillion in the United States military, purchasing the finest American-made planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and other pieces of military equipment. Additionally, last year, I was proud to sign into law legislation that provided a 3.1 percent pay raise for our troops--the largest pay raise for our military men and women in a decade--in recognition of their unparalleled duty, honor, courage, and commitment. This year, we also celebrate the historic creation of the United States Space Force, the first new military branch since the establishment of the United States Air Force more than 70 years ago. We recognize that to combat the evolving threats of a 21st-century world, we must look to the newest warfighting domain and address malign activities in space. America's leadership in space is unparalleled, and with the addition of the United States Space Force, we are now even better positioned to meet the evolving threats in this emerging frontier of technology, exploration, and discovery. Approximately 16,000 military and civilian personnel have already been assigned to the Space Force, embarking on their mission to organize, train, [[Page 117]] and equip these new fighters responsible for protecting the United States and allied interests in the vast domain of space. Today, and every day, we reaffirm our unwavering support for the millions of American patriots who fill the ranks of our Armed Forces. We are eternally grateful for every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman, and member of the Space Force, and we deeply appreciate the sacrifices their families and loved ones make on our behalf. As one Nation, we pledge to always honor this service and this devotion given to our great country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the tradition of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day. I invite the Governors of the States and Territories and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year. Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day. Proclamation 9892 of May 17, 2019, is hereby superseded. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10035 of May 15, 2020 National Safe Boating Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Safe Boating Week, I am proud to join with the United States Coast Guard and its Federal, State, and local partners in encouraging all Americans to institute the safe boating practices necessary to enjoy our Nation's waters responsibly. For more than 60 years, raising awareness of safe boating procedures has helped reduce injuries and fatalities, even as the number of Americans spending time out on the water has continued to grow. Boat operators can help reduce the number of water-related accidents through proper preparation and sensible precautions. A free vessel safety check conducted by the United States Coast Guard is an essential first step in ensuring a boat is ready for navigation on the water. New boaters can take courses to learn how they can ensure that everyone returns from the [[Page 118]] water unharmed. Life jackets also remain indispensable in preventing drowning, the most common cause of boating fatalities. For this reason, every boat needs to be equipped with proper life jackets for everyone onboard, and they should be worn while on the water. Additionally, individuals must never pilot a boat while intoxicated, and passengers should moderate their alcohol consumption as a precaution against accidents. By taking the necessary steps, we can make our Nation's waters even safer for all who enjoy them. This week, I call upon all Americans to ensure that they are prepared to have safe boating experiences. Through preventative measures and responsible behavior, we can help keep everyone out of harm's way while engaging in boating activities on our Nation's beautiful oceans, lakes, and rivers. In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe Boating Week.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 2020, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities. I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety through events and activities that align with the White House's ``Guidelines for Opening up America Again.'' IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10036 of May 15, 2020 Emergency Medical Services Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During Emergency Medical Services Week, we honor all of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers who play such a critical role in our Nation's health and safety. These incredible professionals respond to daily calls for urgent assistance and work tirelessly to serve their communities. Most recently, they have made significant contributions and immeasurable sacrifices during our Nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic, one of the most daunting and demanding challenges the country has ever faced. This week, we recognize these heroic men and women for their efforts to deliver life-saving care and compassion to their fellow Americans, and we acknowledge that our country is a safer and healthier place because of their work. [[Page 119]] EMS providers--many of whom are volunteers--make up a coordinated and comprehensive network of highly trained workers. They are prepared to respond immediately to any crisis with pre-hospital assessment, trauma care, and medical transport, and they also share valuable data with their public health partners. They do all of this under incredible pressure that can take an emotional and physical toll on even the most seasoned professionals. At a moment's notice, these dedicated men and women rush to employ their specialized knowledge, experience, and leadership to reduce the severity of injuries and save lives, often in very high-risk situations. Every day, EMS personnel stand ready to help those in peril, responding faithfully to the needs of their fellow citizens when lives are on the line and every second matters. The far-reaching and devastating scope of the coronavirus pandemic has increased the demands on our Nation's EMS professionals, including those from our military service branches. These heroes have courageously risen to the challenge. They remain undeterred in their efforts to deliver critical assistance to their fellow Americans. EMS personnel are often the first point of contact with patients who are experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Acting quickly and decisively, they evaluate and triage patients, transport them to hospitals or treatment facilities, and clearly and compassionately communicate with family members who are anxious about their loved ones. During this unprecedented time in our Nation's history, we are ceaselessly inspired by the sense of duty, selfless service, and sacrifice that epitomize EMS personnel. This week, we honor all who provide emergency medical services across our country for their tenacity and life-saving skills. Thanks to their incredible efforts, our communities and our Nation are stronger, safer, and more resilient. Especially in these trying times, we are immensely proud of these brave Americans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 2020, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this occasion by showing their support for local EMS professionals through appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10037 of May 15, 2020 World Trade Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As the global leader in innovation and commerce, the United States is willing to do business with any country strongly committed to open, fair, and [[Page 120]] competitive markets, benefitting our Nation's farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, service providers, and entrepreneurs. During World Trade Week, we reaffirm that free, fair, and reciprocal trade is essential to driving economic growth and ensuring a secure and prosperous future for our Nation. For far too long, other countries have taken advantage of American workers and producers through unfair and unbalanced trade deals. Since my first day in office, my Administration has worked tirelessly to rebalance these harmful agreements in order to protect the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of the American people. We are negotiating with unrelenting and uncompromising drive to modernize and improve existing trade agreements and to secure new deals that are fair and reciprocal. As a result, our Nation now enters this new decade with deals in place and a philosophy of trade that will benefit American workers, producers, and consumers for years to come. In January, I was proud to deliver on my promise to end the outdated and unbalanced North American Free Trade Agreement, and I signed into law the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act. This new agreement opens up markets throughout North America for American small- and medium-sized businesses across all sectors of the economy. My Administration also significantly updated one of our most consequential trade deals, the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, to include key provisions that increase American exports and secure high-paying manufacturing jobs in our Nation's auto industry. I also signed two trade agreements with Japan to substantially expand market access for American farmers and preserve America's role in the growing digital economy. My Administration is also delivering on our promise to begin rebalancing our trade relationship with China. Through tough, honest, and open negotiations, we reached a new deal with the People's Republic of China this past January. The agreement preserves tariffs while securing historic protections for intellectual property, commitments to combat counterfeit goods, safeguards against forced technology transfer, a mechanism to address unfair currency practices, promises for the purchase of $40 to $50 billion in agricultural goods each year for the next 2 years, and a strong dispute resolution mechanism to ensure timely and effective implementation. In every negotiation, we are putting American jobs and American workers first, and we will continue working to secure a level playing field for all American farmers, ranchers, and businesses. This week, we recommit to supporting trade deals that benefit hardworking Americans, continuing our legacy as producers of world-class manufacturing, agriculture, services, and technology. Through adhering to the principles of free, fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade, we will continue unleashing the limitless potential of American workers and industry, building a better world for individuals and communities throughout our Nation and around the world. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 2020, as World Trade Week. I encourage Americans to observe this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate the benefits of global trade to our country. [[Page 121]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10038 of May 21, 2020 National Maritime Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since the founding of our great Nation, we have relied on merchant mariners to deliver goods to market and strengthen our national security. On National Maritime Day, we recognize the United States Merchant Marine for all it does to facilitate our commerce and protect our interests at sea. Our Nation's merchant mariners enable peaceful trade with countries around the world and provide vital sealift support to our Armed Forces. Whether on the ocean or our inland waterways, merchant mariners support our economy by transporting billions of dollars of imported and exported goods. These men and women also sail bravely into combat zones to deliver supplies and weapons to our military men and women, playing a critical role in the success of their mission. This year, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, we pay tribute to the United States merchant mariners who served as the ``Fourth Arm of Defense'' for our Nation during the war. Earlier this year, I was proud to sign into law long-overdue legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the valiant civilian merchant mariners who maintained critical supply lines to our overseas troops and allies during the Second World War. Many of these mariners endured brutal attacks from German U-boats, and more than 6,000 of them perished at sea or were held as prisoners of war. This number includes 142 students of the United States Merchant Marine Academy--distinguishing it as the only one of the five service academies authorized to carry a battle standard. As we remember the tremendous sacrifices of the World War II merchant mariners, we also continue to honor the present-day citizen mariners who make up our Nation's world-class Merchant Marine. Today, we pay tribute to their expertise, patriotism, and dedication to serving our country and ensuring our national security. The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day'' to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 by the S.S. Savannah. By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2020, as National Maritime Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and [[Page 122]] to display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10039 of May 21, 2020 Honoring the Victims of the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation mourns for every life lost to the coronavirus pandemic, and we share in the suffering of all those who endured pain and illness from the outbreak. Through our grief, America stands steadfast and united against the invisible enemy. May God be with the victims of this pandemic and bring aid and comfort to their families and friends. As a mark of solemn respect for the victims of the coronavirus pandemic, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, May 24, 2020. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10040 of May 21, 2020 Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since the first shots fired in the Revolutionary War, Americans have answered the call to duty and given their lives in service to our Nation and its sacred founding ideals. As we pay tribute to the lives and legacies of these patriots on Memorial Day, we also remember that they sacrificed to [[Page 123]] create a better, more peaceful future for our Nation and the world. We recommit to realizing that vision, honoring the service of so many who have placed love of country above all else. As Americans, we will always defend our freedom and our liberty. When those principles are threatened, we will respond with uncompromising force and unparalleled vigor. Generation after generation, our country's finest have defended our Republic with honor and distinction. Memorials, monuments, and rows of white crosses and stars in places close to home like Arlington, Virginia and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, as well as far- flung battlefields in places like Flanders Field in Belgium and Busan in Korea, will forever memorialize their heroic actions, standing as solemn testaments to the price of freedom. We will never take for granted the blood shed by these gallant men and women, as we are forever indebted to them and their families. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Allied victories over Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in World War II. As we commemorate these seminal events, we also remember the tremendous cost at which these victories came. More than 400,000 souls of the Greatest Generation perished during this titanic struggle to liberate the world from tyranny. In his address to the Nation on Japan's surrender, President Truman's words remind us all of our enduring obligation to these patriots for their sacrifice: ``It is our responsibility--ours the living--to see to it that this victory shall be a monument worthy of the dead who died to win it.'' As we pause to recall the lives lost from the ranks of our Armed Forces, we remain eternally grateful for the path they paved toward a world made freer from oppression. Our fallen warriors gave their last breath for our country and our freedom. Today, let us pause in quiet reverence to reflect on the incredible dedication of these valiant men and women and their families, invoking divine Providence as we continue pursuing our noble goal of lasting peace for the world. In honor and recognition of all of our fallen heroes, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 25, 2020, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer. I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I also request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that, on Memorial Day, the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United [[Page 124]] States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10041 of May 24, 2020 Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. It is the policy of the United States to respond to the ongoing, unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS- CoV-2) with every tool and resource available to the United States Government. Consistent with this policy, I have suspended and limited the entry of aliens recently present in certain foreign jurisdictions where significant COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred. These jurisdictions include the People's Republic of China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau), the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), and the Republic of Ireland. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, has determined that the Federative Republic of Brazil is experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of May 23, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the Federative Republic of Brazil had 310,087 confirmed cases of COVID-19, which is the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the Federative Republic of Brazil threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security, and I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Federative Republic of Brazil during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. The free flow of commerce between the United States and the Federative Republic of Brazil remains an economic priority for the United States, and I remain committed to facilitating trade between our nations. [[Page 125]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and [[Page 127]] (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders.

DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10043 of May 29, 2020 Suspension of Entry as Nonimmigrants of Certain Students and Researchers From the People's Republic of China By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The People's Republic of China (PRC) is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property, in part to bolster the modernization and capability of its military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The PRC's acquisition of sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property to modernize its military is a threat to our Nation's long-term economic vitality and the safety and security of the American people. The PRC authorities use some Chinese students, mostly post-graduate students and post-doctorate researchers, to operate as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property. Thus, students or researchers from the PRC studying or researching beyond the undergraduate level who are or have been associated with the PLA are at high risk of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC authorities and provide particular cause for concern. In light of the above, I have determined that the entry of certain nationals of the PRC seeking to enter the United States pursuant to an F or J visa to study or conduct research in the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States as nonimmigrants of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that [[Page 129]] their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States as a nonimmigrant of any national of the PRC seeking to enter the United States pursuant to an F or J visa to study or conduct research in the United States, except for a student seeking to pursue undergraduate study, and who either receives funding from or who currently is employed by, studies at, or conducts research at or on behalf of, or has been employed by, studied at, or conducted research at or on behalf of, an entity in the PRC that implements or supports the PRC's ``military-civil fusion strategy'' is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation. For the purposes of this proclamation, the term ``military-civil fusion strategy'' means actions by or at the behest of the PRC to acquire and divert foreign technologies, specifically critical and emerging technologies, to incorporate into and advance the PRC's military capabilities. Sec. 2. Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry. (a) Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to: (i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States; (ii) any alien who is the spouse of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident; (iii) any alien who is a member of the United States Armed Forces and any alien who is a spouse or child of a member of the United States Armed Forces; (iv) any alien whose travel falls within the scope of section 11 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement or who would otherwise be allowed entry into the United States pursuant to United States obligations under applicable international agreements; (v) any alien who is studying or conducting research in a field involving information that would not contribute to the PRC's military-civil fusion strategy, as determined by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the appropriate executive departments and agencies (agencies); (vi) any alien whose entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General or his designee; or (vii) any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees. (b) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, consistent with the laws of the United States. Sec. 3. Implementation and Enforcement. (a) Persons covered by sections 1 or 2 of this proclamation shall be identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of State's designee, in his or her sole discretion, pursuant to such standards and procedures as the Secretary of State may establish. For [[Page 130]] purposes of subsections 2(a)(v), 2(a)(vi), and 2(a)(vii) of this proclamation, the Secretary of State shall provide for identifications of aliens based on the further determinations and recommendations provided for in those subsections by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security. (b) The Secretary of State shall implement this proclamation as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish in the Secretary of State's discretion.

(a) The Secretary of State shall consider, in the Secretary's discretion, whether nationals of the PRC currently in the United States pursuant to F or J visas and who otherwise meet the criteria described in section 1 of this proclamation should have their visas revoked pursuant to section 221(i) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(i). (b) Within 60 days of the effective date of this proclamation, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the heads of appropriate agencies, shall review nonimmigrant and immigrant programs and shall recommend to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, any other measures requiring Presidential action that would mitigate the risk posed by the PRC's acquisition of sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property. (c) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, within the scope of their respective authorities and in coordination with the heads of appropriate agencies, take action to further mitigate the risk posed by the PRC's acquisition of sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to the President, within 60 days of the effective date of this proclamation, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, any such planned and executed actions. (d) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider issuing updated regulations and guidance, as appropriate, implementing the inadmissibility provisions in section 212(a)(3)(D) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(D). Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or [[Page 131]] (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10044 of May 29, 2020 African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The lyrics and melodies of African-American music have played a powerful role in defining America's unique soundscape. From the soulful streets of the Big Easy to the recording studios of Los Angeles, African- American music has shaped our American culture. During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we pay tribute to the monumental achievements of African-American artists who pioneered and evolved the blues, jazz, gospel, rock and roll, rap, hip-hop, and other iconic genres. Throughout our Nation's history, African-American music has expressed the pain and suffering brought on by injustice as well as the faith and joy of the resilient American spirit. Sam Cooke's triumphant ``A Change Is Gonna Come'' gave wind to the sails of millions of African Americans in their righteous fight for equality during the Civil Rights Movement. The divine voice of Mahalia Jackson, the ``Queen of Gospel,'' helped heal our grieving Nation in the days following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. At major sporting events, African-American musical icons, such as Whitney Houston and Ray Charles, have captivated America with striking renditions of patriotic ballads such as the National Anthem and ``America the Beautiful.'' This month, we lost the Architect of Rock and Roll, Richard Wayne Penniman--better known and beloved as Little Richard--who is responsible for breaking down racial barriers through the universal love of his music. He was an unforgettable entertainer, an innovator, and an American icon. Our Nation mourns his passing. This month, we express our appreciation for the countless contributions of African-American singers, songwriters, and musicians, whose remarkable talents continue to inspire the soul of our Nation. With classic guitar riffs, memorable hymns, and uplifting beats, the works of African-American artists undeniably represent true musical excellence. [[Page 132]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2020 as African- American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and appreciation of African-American music. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10045 of May 29, 2020 Great Outdoors Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation is blessed with abundant natural beauty that can be enjoyed every season from coast to coast. During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate the majestic mountains, forests, canyons, beaches, and rivers that provide recreation and renewal for all Americans, enriching our lives and strengthening an enduring connection to our national heritage. Our parks, recreational areas, and public lands are some of our greatest national treasures. For centuries, Americans have looked to the sprawling expanse of America's outdoor spaces as a source of adventure, sustenance, and inspiration. From the lands and waters that constitute our National Park System, to State, local, and city parks, to our own backyards, every unique experience of the great outdoors helps improve our health and offers opportunities for families, friends, and communities to connect over a shared appreciation for the natural world. My Administration remains committed to restoring and preserving our land, air, and waters while also opening up more recreational opportunities for all Americans. We have provided increased access to public lands, expanding hunting and fishing opportunities at national wildlife refuges and national fish hatcheries across 1.7 million acres. Last year, I was proud to sign the largest public lands legislation in a decade, designating 1.3 million new acres of wilderness and increasing recreational access for hunters, fishers, boaters, and campers. Additionally, I announced that the United States will be joining the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector partners and further our commitment to maintaining our natural world. Through these actions, we are actively promoting a conservation ethic that drives responsible stewardship of our environment. Whether hiking on world-class trails, camping under the stars, or fishing our Nation's abundant waterways, exploring the great outdoors provides adventurers of all ages endless opportunities to create lifelong memories. [[Page 133]] This month, we pause to appreciate the extraordinary natural beauty of our country, and we recommit to protecting and preserving our natural wonders for future generations. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2020 as Great Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors while acting as stewards of our lands and waters. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10046 of May 29, 2020 National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation From America's earliest days, Caribbean Americans have contributed to the success, spirit, and character of our Nation. For generations, their skills, knowledge, innovation, and initiative have enhanced and advanced many aspects of our society. During National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we celebrate the rich history and vibrant culture of the more than 4 million Americans with origins in the Caribbean. Caribbean Americans have helped improve our Nation by leading communities, advancing science and medicine, and advocating for the common good. We are especially grateful for the Caribbean-American men and women who proudly wear our Nation's uniform as members of the Armed Forces and those serving as first responders, medical professionals, and other essential personnel on the front lines in the fight against the coronavirus. Our Nation is safer, stronger, and healthier because of their service and sacrifices. Caribbean Americans have also left indelible marks on American culture. Roberto Clemente, a native of Puerto Rico and legendary baseball player, is one of many shining examples. He not only had a stunning Hall of Fame baseball career, but he also dutifully served our Nation as a member of the United States Marine Corps Reserve for 6 years and served others throughout his life with profound care and compassion. Like so many other Caribbean Americans, he continues to inspire us today and remind us of the strong connection the United States will always have with the Caribbean region. The United States is also the primary trading partner for the Caribbean nations that make up our Nation's ``third border.'' My Administration is dedicated to maintaining and strengthening our partnerships within the Caribbean regions, which are forged through bonds of friendship, diplomacy, [[Page 134]] and a shared commitment to democratic principles. We will continue strategic engagement in the areas of human rights, maritime security, crime prevention and interdiction, education, health, energy, economic growth, and disaster recovery and relief. Stability in the Caribbean-- achieved through increased trade, job creation and investment, and efforts to counter organized crime and illicit trafficking--ensures a more secure, prosperous United States. This month, we pay tribute to Caribbean Americans for all they have done to drive our country forward. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2020 as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to join in celebrating the history, culture, and achievements of Caribbean Americans with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10047 of May 29, 2020 National Homeownership Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation For generations, homeownership has sustained and empowered Americans. Recently, we have been reminded that our homes are central to our health, our independence, and the well-being of our families. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, millions of Americans have transformed their homes into safe havens, virtual workplaces, classrooms, and, most importantly, places to nurture hopes and dreams for the future. During National Homeownership Month, we acknowledge the many benefits of secure and affordable homeownership. Thanks to my Administration's swift and decisive action to assist millions of homeowners affected by the coronavirus, we have protected the wealth that hardworking Americans have built up through homeownership. To help ensure that homeowners do not lose their homes unnecessarily due to this crisis, I signed into law the unprecedented Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This legislation provided direct cash payments to Americans and authorized mortgage-payment relief for eligible homeowners with federally backed mortgages struggling to make their payments. As our Nation's economy begins to recover, my Administration remains focused on getting government out of the way of responsible homeownership and reforming our housing finance system. We have supported affordable homeownership by eliminating outdated and unnecessary regulations, and [[Page 135]] we are strengthening investment in underserved communities through the designation of Opportunity Zones. Through the work of the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, we are continuing to collaborate with States and local jurisdictions to ease the burden of regulations that needlessly hinder opportunities for Americans to become homeowners. Additionally, last year, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development released plans to define the limited role of the Federal Government in the housing finance system, enhance taxpayer protections against future bailouts, and promote competition in the housing finance system. This month, we renew our commitment to helping pave the way for more Americans to achieve the financial benefits and stability of homeownership. Building on the roaring success we were experiencing prior to the coronavirus pandemic, our economy will rebound and create the jobs that Americans need to achieve the American dream of owning a home. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2020 as National Homeownership Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10048 of May 29, 2020 National Ocean Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our ocean and coastal waterways are essential to our national security, international trade, maritime commerce, global competitiveness, and transportation. The jobs of more than 3 million Americans depend on our ocean economy, which generates more than $300 billion of economic activity annually. During National Ocean Month, we reaffirm our commitment to responsible stewardship of our ocean resources to strengthen and expand economic opportunities, while also ensuring that the natural beauty and wonder of the oceans are preserved and maintained for future generations. There is much that remains undiscovered in the world's vast oceans, and my Administration is working to improve our understanding of its incredible resources. Today, roughly 18.6 percent of our Nation's oil and gas production is conducted offshore, employing thousands of Americans and helping keep prices low for American families and businesses. There is enormous opportunity for our country to bolster these numbers and expand this critical and profitable industry, generating even more jobs for hardworking Americans. Only 40 percent of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), an oceanic area larger than the combined land area of [[Page 136]] the 50 States, has been mapped. Even less of the EEZ's natural resources have been characterized through exploration. For this reason, last year, I signed a historic Presidential Memorandum that prioritizes mapping, exploring, and characterizing our ocean waters. Building upon these efforts, last month I signed an Executive Order Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth. This Executive Order will increase America's competitiveness in the seafood industry and create new opportunities for American products in the global marketplace, including through continued support of our commercial fisheries and promotion of domestic aquaculture. My Administration is committed to expanding maritime commerce, increasing seafood production, promoting conservation, enhancing national security, and advancing energy exploration, development, and production by expanding efforts to study, understand, and unlock the full potential of our oceans. As we continue to unlock the economic opportunities in these flourishing bodies of water, my Administration is also diligently working to put an end to one of the biggest challenges facing the global environment: increased pollution in the oceans. Recognizing that 80 percent of marine litter comes from land-based resources resulting from insufficient solid waste management, we have been working hard, with our domestic and international partners, to improve waste management systems around the world and deploy innovative technologies to put an end to the mass amounts of litter washing into our shared waters. In addition, I signed the Save Our Seas Act of 2018 into law, which prioritizes cleanup activities and addresses international sources of pollution. The task of balancing the uses of America's oceans cannot be accomplished by the Federal Government alone. The 2019 White House Summit on Partnerships in Ocean Science and Technology highlighted that our continued use, conservation, observation, and exploration of the ocean requires innovative engagement and collaboration with key partners, including private industries, States, territories, academia, philanthropic groups, Native American and Tribal organizations, and other stakeholders. By working together and harnessing our collective power, knowledge, and experience, we can better promote resource stewardship, create and maintain jobs for American workers, and ensure our Nation's prosperity while conserving the marine environment. Many of the most pressing challenges facing mankind may have solutions in the oceans. My Administration is committed to advancing technology and innovation to better understand how our oceans may help us address current and future challenges facing our Nation. Establishing energy infrastructure, discovering and developing novel marine-derived pharmaceuticals, improving weather predictions, and advancing offshore aquaculture operations are just some examples of innovative initiatives supported by my Administration. These bold efforts have the potential to promote economic prosperity, create jobs, and strengthen our maritime and homeland security for current and future generations of Americans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2020 as National Ocean Month. This month, I call upon Americans to reflect on the value [[Page 137]] and importance of oceans not only to our security, environment, and economy but also as a source of recreation and enjoyment. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10049 of June 5, 2020 Modifying the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In Proclamation 9496 of September 15, 2016, and exercising his authority under section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the ``Antiquities Act''), the President established the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, reserving for the care and management of objects of historic and scientific interest approximately 4,913 square miles of water and submerged lands in and around certain deep-sea canyons and seamounts situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government. The President prohibited commercial fishing, with a phase-out period for American lobster and red crab fisheries, within the monument's boundaries. This proclamation lifts the prohibition on commercial fishing, an activity that is subject to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens), 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., and other applicable laws, regulations, and requirements. This proclamation does not modify the monument in any other respect. Proclamation 9496 identifies a number of canyons and seamounts as objects of historic and scientific interest. The monument is designated in two units, which correspond to two distinct geological features. The Canyons Unit comprises three underwater canyons that start at the edge of the continental shelf, whereas the Seamounts Unit consists of four undersea mountains. Both units are located in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone. In addition to the geological features, Proclamation 9496 designates the natural resources and ecosystems in and around the Canyons and Seamounts Units as objects of historic and scientific interest. Proclamation 9496 describes diverse ecological communities in the canyon and seamount areas, which include seabirds, whales, dolphins, turtles, and highly migratory fish species, such as tunas, billfish, and sharks. Proclamation 9496 observes that some of these species have appeared in the canyon and seamount areas in large aggregations and increased numbers. In support of the monument designation, Proclamation 9496 notes that ``[t]hese canyons and seamounts, and the ecosystem they compose, have long been of intense scientific interest,'' with ``[s]cientists from government and academic oceanographic institutions'' studying ``the canyons and seamounts using research vessels, submarines, and remotely operated underwater vehicles for important deep-sea expeditions.'' [[Page 138]] As part of the management of the monument, Proclamation 9496 prohibited, subject to the phase-out period previously noted, all commercial fishing within the monument's boundaries. As explained herein, following further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in Proclamation 9496 and the protection of those objects already provided by relevant law, I find that appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of scientific and historic interest that the monument protects at risk. Indeed, Proclamation 9496 allows for recreational fishing and further acknowledges that ``[t]hroughout New England, the maritime trades, and especially fishing, have supported a vibrant way of life, with deep cultural roots and a strong connection to the health of the ocean and the bounty it provides.'' With respect to fish in particular, many of the fish species that Proclamation 9496 identifies are highly migratory and not unique to the monument. Some of the examples of fish species that Proclamation 9496 identifies are not of such significant scientific interest that they merit additional protection beyond that already provided by other law. Moreover, the fish species described in Proclamation 9496 are subject to Federal protections under existing laws and agency management designations. For example, Magnuson-Stevens regulates commercial fishing to ensure long-term biological and economic sustainability for our Nation's marine fisheries, taking into account the protection of associated marine ecosystems. Magnuson-Stevens establishes regional fishery management councils, supervised by the Secretary of Commerce in coordination with the States and affected stakeholders, that develop fishery management plans to regulate our Nation's fisheries, using the best available science and observing strict conservation and management requirements. Magnuson-Stevens requires a similar process of science- based fisheries management for highly migratory species, including the tunas referenced in Proclamation 9496. In addition, Magnuson-Stevens provides that fishery management plans may include, among other measures, management measures to conserve target and non-target species and habitats, including measures to protect deep-sea corals. A host of other laws enacted after the Antiquities Act provide specific protection for other plant and animal resources (including coral species) both within and outside the monument. These laws include the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. 703-712, the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, 16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee, the Refuge Recreation Act, 16 U.S.C. 460k et seq., the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq., the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., the Oil Pollution Act, 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq., the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C. 1431 et seq., and Title I of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (Ocean Dumping Act), 33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq. For example, the Endangered Species Act generally prohibits the taking of fish and wildlife species listed as endangered, and also generally ensures that Federal actions, including fisheries management, are not likely to jeopardize the existence of any such species. The Marine Mammal Protection Act provides protections for marine mammals, and prohibits their take, subject to some exceptions. Numerous other statutes, including the Clean Water Act, Oil Pollution Act, and Ocean Dumping Act, address both land-based and ocean-based sources of pollution and help ensure that water quality continues to support plankton and other pelagic organisms. [[Page 139]] After further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in Proclamation 9496 and the protection of those objects already provided by Magnuson-Stevens and other relevant law, I find that a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time, necessary for the proper care and management of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, or the objects of historic or scientific interest therein. WHEREAS, Proclamation 9496 of September 15, 2016, designated the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean and reserved approximately 4,913 square miles in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone for the care and management of objects of historic and scientific interest identified therein; WHEREAS, I find that removing the restrictions on commercial fishing set forth in Proclamation 9496 to allow for well-regulated commercial fishing use is in the public interest and that the objects in the monument can be, and are currently, protected pursuant to carefully tailored regulation and management under existing Federal law: NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim that Proclamation 9496, which established the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, is amended as follows: (1) in the section entitled ``Prohibited Activities,'' by deleting paragraph 6; and (2) in the section entitled ``Regulated Activities,'' by deleting paragraph 5 and by re-designating paragraphs 6 and 7 as paragraphs 5 and 6, respectively. Furthermore, nothing in paragraph 4 in the section entitled ``Prohibited Activities'' in Proclamation 9496 shall be deemed to apply to commercial fishing that is carried out in accordance with Magnuson-Stevens and other applicable laws, regulations, and requirements. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to revoke, modify, or affect any withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation, other than the one created by Proclamation 9496. Nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the areas designated and reserved by Proclamation 9496, except as explicitly provided in this proclamation. If any provision of this proclamation, including its application to a particular parcel of land, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and its application to other parcels of land shall not be affected thereby. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 140]] Proclamation 10050 of June 12, 2020 Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On Flag Day and throughout National Flag Week, we pay tribute to the American flag, the most recognizable symbol of the principles for which our Republic stands. For more than 200 years, the Stars and Stripes has represented liberty, justice, and the rule of law. Recently, as our Nation has come together to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, our flag has been a reminder of the courage, tenacity, and loyalty that define the indomitable American spirit. Our great flag causes us to reflect humbly on the immeasurable price that has been paid to keep it ``so gallantly streaming.'' Throughout our Nation's history, proud patriots have nobly answered the call of duty when our country needed them most. The Star Spangled Banner serves as an everlasting remembrance of the sacrifices heroes of every generation have made in conflicts from the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our flag ensures that we never forget the incredible sacrifices our men and women in uniform have made to defend our liberty and way of life. This year, Old Glory has waved over millions of brave Americans fighting the invisible enemy, often at risk to their personal health and wellbeing. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare professionals have treated and cared for those sickened by the virus, and countless American patriots have provided critical goods and services to their fellow citizens in these uncertain times. These dedicated individuals have risen to the challenge, meeting the virus on the frontlines with the same conviction and unwavering determination that has empowered our Nation to overcome previous trials. Just as we prevailed in those struggles, we will emerge victorious against this new enemy and again raise our flag in triumph. The American flag represents the unity of our country and its people. No matter what may divide us, Old Glory should be revered and cherished, as a symbol of all that makes America the greatest country in the world. As we honor our beautiful flag on this day and throughout this week, let us vow never to forget the tremendous sacrifices made by patriots from generation to generation to ensure that the red, white, and blue continues to fly high and free. Today, and every day, I am proud to join my fellow Americans in standing tall and saluting our great American flag. To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling on all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2020, as Flag Day, and the week [[Page 141]] starting June 14, 2020, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10051 of June 19, 2020 Father's Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Fathers are instrumental in helping prepare children for life, instilling in them the values essential to one day becoming responsible, grounded, and successful adults. As a Nation, we are grateful to the men dedicated to raising well-rounded children. On Father's Day, we honor and celebrate our fathers and father figures for their daily contributions to thriving families and communities. The presence of fathers in the lives of our Nation's children is important to their growth, development, and well-being. Fathers serve as role models to their children, exemplifying hard work, devotion to family, self-confidence, and faith. Through their character, determination, strength, and direction, they guide our futures toward happiness. Thus, it is no surprise that research increasingly shows involved fathers can help foster self-esteem, success in school, empathy, and positive behavior in their children. By raising children to be happy, productive, and responsible adults, fathers play a critical role in shaping our society. Our fathers set an example for us of how to be our best in every aspect of our lives. The lessons they teach us guide us as we strive to care for our families, succeed at school and at work, serve others, and contribute to our communities. They are integral to raising future generations of Americans who will continue to build an ever-stronger Nation. That is why my Administration continues to provide grant funding to organizations across our country that work to strengthen relationships between fathers and their children, foster responsible parenting, and help fathers find and keep gainful employment. Our Nation is indebted to the men who have embraced the great blessing and solemn duty of fatherhood. Every day, they make sacrifices to ensure their children, whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, receive the care and affection they deserve. Today, we express our everlasting gratitude to our fathers and father figures for their love and commitment, and for all they have done to shape our lives. [[Page 142]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 21, 2020, as Father's Day. I call on United States Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Father's Day and invite State and local governments and the people of the United States to observe Father's Day with appropriate ceremonies. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10052 of June 22, 2020 Suspension of Entry of Immigrants and Nonimmigrants Who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has significantly disrupted Americans' livelihoods. Since March 2020, United States businesses and their workers have faced extensive disruptions while undertaking certain public health measures necessary to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The overall unemployment rate in the United States nearly quadrupled between February and May of 2020--producing some of the most extreme unemployment ever recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the May rate of 13.3 percent reflects a marked decline from April, millions of Americans remain out of work. In Proclamation 10014 of April 22, 2020 (Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak), I determined that, without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labor supply outpaces labor demand. Consequently, I suspended, for a period of 60 days, the entry of aliens as immigrants, subject to certain exceptions. As I noted, lawful permanent residents, once admitted pursuant to immigrant visas, are granted ``open-market'' employment authorization documents, allowing them immediate eligibility to compete for almost any job, in any sector of the economy. Given that 60 days is an insufficient time period for the United States labor market, still stalled with partial social distancing measures, to rebalance, and given the lack of sufficient alternative means to protect unemployed Americans from the threat of competition for scarce jobs from new lawful permanent residents, the considerations present in Proclamation 10014 remain. [[Page 143]] In addition, pursuant to Proclamation 10014, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security reviewed nonimmigrant programs and found that the present admission of workers within several nonimmigrant visa categories also poses a risk of displacing and disadvantaging United States workers during the current recovery. American workers compete against foreign nationals for jobs in every sector of our economy, including against millions of aliens who enter the United States to perform temporary work. Temporary workers are often accompanied by their spouses and children, many of whom also compete against American workers. Under ordinary circumstances, properly administered temporary worker programs can provide benefits to the economy. But under the extraordinary circumstances of the economic contraction resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, certain nonimmigrant visa programs authorizing such employment pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers. For example, between February and April of 2020, more than 17 million United States jobs were lost in industries in which employers are seeking to fill worker positions tied to H-2B nonimmigrant visas. During this same period, more than 20 million United States workers lost their jobs in key industries where employers are currently requesting H-1B and L workers to fill positions. Also, the May unemployment rate for young Americans, who compete with certain J nonimmigrant visa applicants, has been particularly high--29.9 percent for 16-19 year olds, and 23.2 percent for the 20-24 year old group. The entry of additional workers through the H-1B, H-2B, J, and L nonimmigrant visa programs, therefore, presents a significant threat to employment opportunities for Americans affected by the extraordinary economic disruptions caused by the COVID- 19 outbreak. As I described in Proclamation 10014, excess labor supply is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment--those who are typically ``last in'' during an economic expansion and ``first out'' during an economic contraction. In recent years, these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups, including African Americans and other minorities, those without a college degree, and Americans with disabilities. In the administration of our Nation's immigration system, we must remain mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor. Historically, when recovering from economic shocks that cause significant contractions in productivity, recoveries in employment lag behind improvements in economic activity. This predictive outcome demonstrates that, assuming the conclusion of the economic contraction, the United States economy will likely require several months to return to pre-contraction economic output, and additional months to restore stable labor demand. In light of the above, I have determined that the entry, through December 31, 2020, of certain aliens as immigrants and nonimmigrants would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)) and section [[Page 144]] 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of Proclamation 10014, except as provided in section 2 of Proclamation 10014, and persons described in section 2 of this proclamation, except as provided for in section 3 of this proclamation, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Continuation of Proclamation 10014. (a) Section 4 of Proclamation 10014 is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 4. Termination. This proclamation shall expire on December 31, 2020, and may be continued as necessary. Within 30 days of June 24, 2020, and every 60 days thereafter while this proclamation is in effect, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Labor, recommend any modifications as may be necessary.'' (b) This section shall be effective immediately. Sec. 2. Suspension and Limitation on Entry.

[[Page 145]] Sec. 4. Implementation and Enforcement. (a) The consular officer shall determine, in his or her discretion, whether a nonimmigrant has established his or her eligibility for an exception in section 3(b) of this proclamation. The Secretary of State shall implement this proclamation as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor, may establish in the Secretary of State's discretion. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this proclamation as it applies to the entry of aliens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish in the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion. (i) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish standards to define categories of aliens covered by section 3(b)(iv) of this proclamation, including those that: are critical to the defense, law enforcement, diplomacy, or national security of the United States; are involved with the provision of medical care to individuals who have contracted COVID-19 and are currently hospitalized; are involved with the provision of medical research at United States facilities to help the United States combat COVID-19; or are necessary to facilitate the immediate and continued economic recovery of the United States.

(b) The Secretary of Labor shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, as soon as practicable, and consistent with applicable law, consider promulgating regulations or take other appropriate action to ensure that the presence in the United States of aliens who have been admitted or otherwise provided a benefit, or who are seeking admission or a benefit, pursuant to an EB-2 or EB-3 immigrant visa or an H-1B nonimmigrant visa does not disadvantage United States workers in violation of [[Page 146]] section 212(a)(5)(A) or (n)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)(A) or (n)(1)). The Secretary of Labor shall also undertake, as appropriate, investigations pursuant to section 212(n)(2)(G)(i) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(G)(i)).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10053 of June 29, 2020 To Take Certain Actions Under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act and for Other Purposes By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On November 30, 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada entered into the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (the ``USMCA''), attached as an Annex to the Protocol Replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (the ``Protocol''), and on December 10, 2019, the United States, Mexico, and Canada amended the USMCA through the Protocol of Amendment to the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada. The Congress approved the Protocol and the USMCA, as amended, in section 101(a) of the United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USMCA Implementation Act'')(Public Law 116-113, 134 Stat. 11, 14 (19 U.S.C. 4511(a))). 2. On April 24, 2020, pursuant to authority delegated to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the USTR submitted to the Congress the written notice required under section 106(a)(1)(G) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (title I of Public Law 114-26, 129 Stat. 319, 350 (19 U.S.C. 4205(a)(1)(G))) and, in accordance with section 101(b) of the USMCA Implementation Act, notified the Congress that the USMCA will enter into force on July 1, 2020. 3. Section 103(c)(1) of the USMCA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 6.2, and 6.3, the Schedule of the United States to Annex 2-B, including the appendices to that Annex, Annex 2-C, and Annex 6-A of the USMCA. 4. Section 103(c)(4) of the USMCA Implementation Act requires the President to take such actions as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate quotas set forth in the Schedule of the United States to Annex 2-B of [[Page 148]] the USMCA to ensure that imports of agricultural goods do not disrupt the orderly marketing of agricultural goods in the United States. 5. Section 103(c)(5)(A) of the USMCA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim, as part of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), the provisions set forth in Annex 4-B; the provisions set forth in paragraph 2 of article 3.A.6 of Annex 3-A; the provisions set forth in paragraph 5 of Annex 3-B; and the provisions set forth in paragraphs 14(b), 14(c), and 15(e) of section B of Appendix 2 to Annex 2-B of the USMCA. 6. Section 103(c)(5)(A) of the USMCA Implementation Act also authorizes the President to proclaim any additional subordinate category that is necessary to carry out section 202 and section 202A of the USMCA Implementation Act consistent with the USMCA. 7. Section 103(c)(5)(B) of the USMCA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the provisions proclaimed under the authority of section 103(c)(5)(A), subject to the consultation and layover provisions of section 104, as are necessary to implement an agreement under article 6.4 of the USMCA. 8. Section 105(a) of the USMCA Implementation Act authorizes the President to establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office to serve as the United States Section of the Secretariat established under article 30.6 of the USMCA. 9. Section 202 of the USMCA Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for purposes of implementing preferential tariff treatment provided for under the USMCA. Section 202A of the USMCA Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for determining whether certain automotive goods are originating goods for purposes of implementing preferential tariff treatment provided for under the USMCA. I have decided that it is necessary to include the rules of origin set forth in sections 202 and 202A of the USMCA Implementation Act in the HTS. 10. Section 207 of the USMCA Implementation Act authorizes the President to take certain actions relating to trade with Canada and Mexico, including with respect to textile and apparel goods. 11. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972 (Textile Trade Agreements), as amended, established the Committee for Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the USTR, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned by the President to the CITA, the officials collectively exercising those functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. 12. Section 324 of the USMCA Implementation Act authorizes the President to take certain actions if the United States International Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') finds that United States long-haul trucking services are being, or are threatened with being, materially harmed. [[Page 149]] 13. Section 611(a) of the USMCA Implementation Act requires the President to consult with the appropriate congressional committees and stakeholders before each joint review under article 34.7 of the USMCA. 14. Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the ``1988 Act'') (Public Law 100-418, 102 Stat. 1107, 1151 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a))) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005) if the President determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention'') and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States. 15. In Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, the President proclaimed modifications to the HTS to conform it to the Convention, to promote the uniform application of the Convention, to establish additional subordinate tariff categories, and to make technical and conforming changes to existing provisions. These modifications to the HTS were set forth in Annex I of Publication 4653 of the Commission, which was incorporated by reference into the proclamation. 16. On May 6, 2003, the President entered into the United States- Singapore Free Trade Agreement (the ``USSFTA''). The USSFTA was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USSFTA Act'') (Public Law 108- 78, 117 Stat. 948, 949 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). 17. Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the USSFTA with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the USSFTA Act, incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USSFTA. 18. Section 201 of the USSFTA Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.12 and Annex 2B (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) of the USSFTA. The United States and Singapore are parties to the Convention. 19. I have determined that, pursuant to section 201 of the USSFTA Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded to originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 9549 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 7747. 20. On November 22, 2006, the United States entered into the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (the ``USCTPA''), and on June 28, 2007, the United States and Colombia amended the USCTPA. The Congress approved the USCTPA, as amended, in section 101(a) of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USCTPA Act'') (Public Law 112-42, 125 Stat. 462, 463-64 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). 21. Proclamation 8818 of May 14, 2012, implemented the USCTPA with respect to the United States and, pursuant to sections 201(a) and 203(o) of [[Page 150]] the USCTPA Act, incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USCTPA. 22. Section 201 of the USCTPA Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1.13, and Annex 2.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) of the USCTPA. The United States and Colombia are parties to the Convention. 23. I have determined that, pursuant to section 201 of the USCTPA Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded to originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 9549 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8818. 24. Section 203 of the USCTPA Act provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a party to the USCTPA and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the USCTPA. A rule of origin was inadvertently omitted from general note 34 to the HTS in Proclamation 8818. I have determined that a technical correction to general note 34 to the HTS is necessary to provide for the intended tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USCTPA to originating goods of Colombia. 25. On June 30, 2007, the United States entered into the United States- Korea Free Trade Agreement (the ``KORUS''). The Congress approved the KORUS in section 101(a) of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``KORUS Act'') (Public Law 112-41, 125 Stat. 428, 430 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). 26. Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, implemented the KORUS with respect to the United States and, pursuant to sections 201(a) and 202(o) of the KORUS Act, incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the KORUS. 27. Section 202 of the KORUS Act provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a party to the KORUS and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the KORUS. Section 202(o)(2)(B)(i) of the KORUS Act authorizes the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set forth in the KORUS, and, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 104, to proclaim modifications to such previously proclaimed rules of origin. 28. The United States and Korea have agreed to modify a certain rule of origin under the KORUS and to apply the modified rule to their bilateral trade. On August 14, 2019, in accordance with section 104 of the KORUS Act, the USTR submitted a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives that sets forth the proposed modification to the specific textile rule of origin of the KORUS incorporated in the HTS. The consultation and layover period specified in section 104 expired on October 14, 2019. [[Page 151]] 29. In order to reflect the agreement between the United States and Korea related to the KORUS rules of origin, I have determined that it is necessary to modify the HTS. 30. Proclamation 8783 inadvertently omitted a rule of origin from general note 33 to the HTS. I have determined that a technical correction to general note 33 to the HTS is necessary to provide for the intended tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the KORUS to originating goods of Korea. 31. On June 28, 2007, the United States entered into the United States- Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the ``USPATPA''). The Congress approved the USPATPA in section 101(a) of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USPATPA Act'') (Public Law 112-43, 125 Stat. 497, 498-99 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). 32. Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012, implemented the USPATPA with respect to the United States, and, pursuant to sections 201(a) and 203(o) of the USPATPA Act, incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USPATPA. 33. Section 203 of the USPATPA Act provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a party to the USPATPA and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the USPATPA. 34. A rule of origin was inadvertently omitted from general note 35 to the HTS in Proclamation 8894. I have determined that a technical correction to general note 35 to the HTS is necessary to provide for the intended tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USPATPA to originating goods of Panama. 35. In Proclamation 9955 of October 25, 2019, after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (the ``1974 Act'') (Public Law 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978, 2066- 69 (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c))), and in particular section 502(c)(7) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(7)), I suspended the duty-free treatment accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.) to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand. In order to reflect in the HTS this suspension of certain benefits under the GSP with respect to Thailand, Annex 2 of Proclamation 9955 modified general note 4(d) and certain subheadings of the HTS. 36. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 37. Annex 2 of Proclamation 9955 inadvertently omitted changes with respect to seven subheadings of the HTS. I have determined, pursuant to section 604 of the 1974 Act, that it is necessary to modify the HTS to correct those inadvertent omissions so that the intended tariff treatment is provided. 38. Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, modified the HTS to provide for the tariff treatment of goods covered by the 2015 World Trade Organization [[Page 152]] Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products, pursuant to section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809, 4819-20 (19 U.S.C. 3521(b))). Proclamation 9466 modified the HTS in part by deleting all rates of duty in the ``Rates of Duty 1-Special'' subcolumn for certain subheadings. 39. In Proclamation 9687 of December 22, 2017, after considering the factors set forth in section 502(b) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)), and in particular section 502(b)(2)(E) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(2)(E)), I terminated the suspension of Argentina's designation as a GSP beneficiary developing country. In order to reflect in the HTS the termination of the suspension of Argentina's designation as a GSP beneficiary developing country, Annex IV of Proclamation 9687 modified general note 4(d) and certain subheadings of the HTS. 40. In Proclamation 9687, after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, and in particular section 502(c)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(5)), I suspended the duty- free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles that are the product of Ukraine. In order to reflect in the HTS the suspension of certain benefits with respect to Ukraine, Annex III of Proclamation 9687 modified general note 4(d) and certain subheadings of the HTS. 41. Proclamation 9687 inadvertently modified general note 4(d) to the HTS to include certain subheadings for which the rates of duty in the ``Rates of Duty 1-Special'' subcolumn were deleted by Proclamation 9466. I have determined, pursuant to section 604 of the 1974 Act, that it is necessary to modify the HTS to reflect the deletion of the rates of duty in the ``Rates of Duty 1-Special'' column for those subheadings. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 103(c), 105(a), 207, 324, and 611(a) of the USMCA Implementation Act; section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act; section 201 of the USSFTA Act; sections 201 and 203(o) of the USCTPA Act; sections 201 and 202(o) of the KORUS Act; 201 and 203(o) of the USPATPA Act; section 604 of the 1974 Act; and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim that: (1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment being accorded under the USMCA, to set forth rules for determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain originating goods of Canada, and to provide certain other treatment to originating goods for purposes of the USMCA, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of Publication 5060 of the Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement'' (Publication 5060). Publication 5060 is incorporated by reference into this proclamation. (2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty reduction provided for in the USMCA, to provide for future staged reductions in duties for originating goods provided for in the USMCA, and to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain goods provided for in the USMCA, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II of Publication 5060. [[Page 153]] (3) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the dates indicated in Annexes I and II of Publication 5060. (4) In order to reflect in the HTS the termination of tariff treatment under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex III of Publication 5060. (5) The USTR is authorized to exercise my authority under section 103(c)(4) of the USMCA Implementation Act to take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate quotas set forth in the Schedule of the United States to Annex 2-B of the USMCA to ensure that imports of agricultural goods do not disrupt the orderly marketing of agricultural goods in the United States. This action is set forth in Annex II of Publication 5060. (6) The CITA, after consultation with the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the ``Commissioner''), is authorized to consult with representatives of Canada and Mexico for the purpose of identifying particular textile or apparel goods that are mutually agreed to be hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry, hand-made cottage industry goods made of those hand-loomed fabrics, traditional folklore handicraft goods, or indigenous handicraft goods, as provided in article 6.2 of the USMCA. The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 103(c)(1) of the USMCA Implementation Act to provide duty-free treatment with respect to a good provided for under article 6.2 of the USMCA. The Commissioner shall take action as directed by the CITA to carry out any such determination by the CITA. (7) The USTR is authorized to fulfill the obligations of the President under section 104 of the USMCA Implementation Act to obtain advice from the appropriate advisory committees and the Commission on the proposed implementation of an action by Presidential proclamation; to submit a report on such proposed action to the appropriate congressional committees; and to consult with those congressional committees regarding the proposed action. (8) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise the authority of the President under section 105(a) of the USMCA Implementation Act to establish or designate an office within the Department of Commerce to carry out the functions set forth in that section. (9) The CITA is authorized to review requests for modifications to a rule of origin for textile and apparel goods based on a change in the availability in the territories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico of a particular fiber, yarn, or fabric; to establish procedures governing such a request, providing that the person making the request bears the burden of demonstrating that a change is warranted, and ensuring appropriate public participation in review of a request; and to make a recommendation as to whether a requested modification to a rule of origin for a textile good based on a change in the availability of a particular fiber, yarn, or fabric is warranted. (10) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 207(a)(2)(B) of the USMCA Implementation Act to direct appropriate action under section 207(a)(2)(D) with respect to textile and apparel goods. [[Page 154]] (11) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 207(a)(1)(B) of the UMSCA Implementation Act to direct action under section 207(c) with respect to textile and apparel goods. (12) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to exercise my authority under section 207(a)(1)(B) of the USMCA Implementation Act to direct action under section 207(a)(1)(B)(i) or section 207(c) with respect to goods other than textile or apparel goods. (13) The USTR is authorized, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to exercise my authority under section 324 of the USMCA Implementation Act. (14) The USTR is authorized to exercise the function assigned to the President under section 611(a) of the USMCA Implementation Act to consult with the appropriate congressional committees and stakeholders regarding joint reviews under article 34.7 of the USMCA. (15) In order to reflect in the HTS the modifications to the rules of origin under the USSFTA, general note 25 to the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex IV of Publication 5060.

DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10055 of June 30, 2020 Pledge to America's Workers Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic on our Nation's economy and workforce have been unprecedented. Businesses of all sizes have been forced to close, downsize, or restructure; countless employees have transitioned to working remotely; and tens of millions of Americans have found themselves newly unemployed. Despite the hardship caused by the pandemic, it has not encumbered the American spirit or the unyielding resolve of our Nation's workers. The United States economy added 2.5 million jobs in May, rebounding with historic strength and beginning the transition back to strong economic growth. During Pledge to America's Workers Month, we celebrate the resilience and unlimited potential of America's workers and industries; honor the State and private-sector organizations that have pledged to train, educate, and reskill American workers; and reaffirm our unparalleled support for our workforce as we emerge from the grip of this crisis. In July 2018, I established the President's National Council for the American Worker in order to develop and implement a national strategy to reshape the education and job training landscape to better meet the needs of American students, workers, and businesses. In coordination with the Council, my Administration has called on States, businesses, and trade groups to sign the Pledge to America's Workers, by which they commit to expanding programs that educate, train, and reskill workers of all ages. A strong, bipartisan majority of our Nation's Governors and over 430 companies, trade associations, and unions have signed the Pledge, promising to provide education and training opportunities for 16 million American students and workers over the next 5 years. I also established the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board to glean expertise and input from a broad spectrum of leaders in the public, private, education, and not-for-profit sectors. At the time of its creation, our country was experiencing a historic economic boom, record- low unemployment rates, and soaring consumer confidence. The rapid changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic have further revealed the critical need to invest in our workers to get our Nation back to work. The Board is focused on numerous challenges, and recently issued a National Workforce Recovery Call-to-Action to spur economic recovery by expediting American workers' return to employment and upward mobility through investment in career pathways and implementation of skill-based hiring practices. The Call-to- [[Page 157]] Action also emphasizes removing obstacles to modernizing workforce education and building the technology infrastructure needed for the future of work. My Administration is committed to helping every citizen find the path to economic success and professional fulfillment that works for them. It is critical that we explore and promote non-traditional pathways to family- sustaining careers, including through enhancing data transparency that can help match workers with available jobs; modernizing candidate recruitment, hiring, and training practices; and advancing lifelong learning opportunities. By broadening our vision for America's workforce and igniting ingenuity and innovation, we can bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans. Although the coronavirus pandemic has tested the mettle of our Nation's workers, our country has steeled its resolve to overcome and persevere. The same resourcefulness and determination with which we have confronted this crisis will be the catalyst for our economic resurgence. American workers are the engine of our country's future prosperity. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 2020 as Pledge to America's Workers Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fourth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10056 of July 17, 2020 Captive Nations Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Tragically, hundreds of millions of people around the world continue to suffer under repressive regimes. During Captive Nations Week, we condemn the cold grip of tyranny that holds nations under unjust rule, and we reaffirm our commitment to all who are fighting to overcome oppression. We renew our deep devotion to the principles of liberty, justice, and the rule of law, and we know the United States will continue to shine as an unparalleled example for all nations. President Dwight D. Eisenhower first proclaimed Captive Nations Week in 1959 to declare our Nation's steadfast support for people throughout the world who are denied fundamental rights by their governments. The belief that a just government's powers are derived from the consent of the governed is sacrosanct in our country, but it is not shared universally. In many countries, citizens who peacefully speak their views, practice their religion, or strive to hold their governments accountable for abuses experience reckless disregard for their rights. Recently, authoritarian regimes have used the coronavirus pandemic to justify increased restrictions on individual human [[Page 158]] rights. These regimes have suppressed the free flow of timely and accurate information about the pandemic by censoring or imprisoning people who dare to share unapproved information or opinions. The most notable example today is China, where the virus originated and government suppression led directly to this global pandemic. In addition, the Chinese government has seized upon this opportunity to snuff out freedom in Hong Kong, which had been the only bastion of liberty in that captive nation. The United States encourages all nations to respect individual liberty, uphold the rule of law, and be accountable to their people through consent-based governments. Authoritarian regimes that do not respect the inherent dignity of every individual hold the dreams and potential of their people captive, enabling poverty, repression, and anguish to flourish as they deny their people their God-given rights. We will never waver in our firm belief that liberty, justice, and the rule of law unleash the fullness of life that God intended for everyone. This week and always, we stand with all people who yearn to live freely, securely, and prosperously under rights-respecting, transparent, and accountable governments rooted in the consent of the governed. The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as ``Captive Nations Week.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 19 through July 25, 2020, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to supporting those around the world striving for liberty, justice, and the rule of law. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10057 of July 18, 2020 Death of John Lewis By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As a mark of respect for the memory and longstanding public service of Representative John Lewis, of Georgia, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions through July 18, 2020. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. [[Page 159]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10058 of July 24, 2020 Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we celebrate the landmark legislation that helped opened the door for every person with a disability to participate fully and independently in our society. Today, we reflect on the progress we have made as a Nation in securing equal rights and defending the inherent dignity of all Americans, and we reaffirm our commitment to further advancing accessibility for those with disabilities. Since the ADA became law three decades ago, it has facilitated greater opportunities for Americans with disabilities to engage in their communities, improving access to employment, government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and public transportation. Building on this foundation, my Administration is supporting the full participation and inclusion of the more than 61 million Americans currently living with disabilities by continuing to work to expand their access to everyday life. We have established an unprecedented level of coordination across the Federal Government in addressing the significant gaps in employment between Americans with and without disabilities through our Multi-Agency Task Force on Improving Employment for People with Disabilities. We also continue to encourage research that will advance technology and medicine to allow Americans with disabilities to live more independent lives. Additionally, in order to help ease the financial burdens that Americans with disabilities often face, we are raising awareness of Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts, which allow money to be saved for qualified disability-related expenses without having to pay taxes on earnings. As our Nation continues to battle the coronavirus, my Administration has remained committed to the principles of the ADA, working to ensure that no American is denied the care they need because of a disability. We have removed barriers and invested in communities and States to help those with disabilities safely stay home if they become ill. In April, the Department of Health and Human Services announced nearly $1 billion in grants to help meet the needs of older Americans and persons with disabilities during the crisis. This funding is providing in-home care to those who need it and direct support and services to those who are experiencing disruptions to their independent, community-based living due to the pandemic. It is also helping to connect people at greatest risk of serious illness from the coronavirus, as well as to services needed to practice social distancing and to mitigate issues such as social isolation. [[Page 160]] Through their tenacity and grit, Americans with disabilities have made contributions that have strengthened our country. As we reopen workplaces, we will once again implement an economic agenda that delivers unprecedented opportunities to people with disabilities. Already, Federal agencies are working together to help people who acquire disabilities due to illness, including the coronavirus, or injury return to their jobs and support their families. My Administration's Retaining Employment and Talent after Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN) demonstration project, managed by the Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration, is testing new ways to help ill or injured workers stay on the job or resume employment as soon as medically possible so they can keep supporting their families and contributing to the economy. At the same time, my Administration's historic investment in apprenticeship is paving new career pathways, and we are committed to ensuring that they are accessible to all, including youth and adults with disabilities. The Apprenticeship Inclusion Models (AIM) demonstration project at the Department of Labor is piloting approaches to open up new pathways to high-demand careers in industries such as technology and healthcare. On this milestone anniversary of the ADA, we recommit to the full inclusion of all persons with disabilities in America. Together, we will continue to remove the barriers that prevent Americans with disabilities from harnessing their full potential. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2020, as a day in celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that celebrate the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to renew our commitment to achieving the promise of our freedom for all Americans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10059 of July 24, 2020 National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Sixty-seven years ago today, guns fell silent along the Korean Demilitarized Zone after more than 3 years of brutal fighting to defeat the expansion of communism on the Korean Peninsula. On National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we pause to remember the uncommon courage and sacrifice of ordinary Americans who fought to defend freedom and protect the values we hold dear. [[Page 161]] This year marks the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. When the conflict began, Americans were still rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of World War II, enjoying the blessings of peace and looking toward a future filled with hope and prosperity. When freedom and democracy were under threat on the Korean Peninsula, however, 2 million Americans left their homes, put on our Nation's uniform, and answered their country's call to duty. Their resolve was tried and tested in once obscure and unfamiliar places, such as Pork Chop Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Chipyong-ni, Pusan, and the Chosin Reservoir, and in unnamed locations known only by grid coordinates or hilltop elevations. Alongside tens of thousands of coalition troops from our allies around the world, these individuals fought, bled, died, went missing, and suffered brutal captivity to defeat a determined foe amid the harshest of conditions, including sweltering heat, bone-numbing cold, and deep snow that buried valleys and rugged ridgelines. Their unquestioned valor, determination, and patriotism halted communist aggression and restored liberty and dignity for the South Korean people. In our Nation's Capital, the black granite wall of the Korean War Veterans Memorial stands as a testament to their sacrifice, etched with the words ``Freedom is Not Free.'' In total, more than 36,000 Americans gave their lives in the Korean War, more than 103,000 were wounded, and nearly 8,000 went missing in action. Today, the Republic of Korea, once decimated in the aftermath of the war, is one of the world's most vibrant, dynamic, and economically prosperous democracies--and one of our strongest allies. Our Armed Forces continue to proudly serve side-by-side with our Korean military counterparts. This ironclad alliance, forged in war and reinforced by a shared love of liberty and deep ties of friendship, is vital to peace and stability in both Asia and the world. As we commemorate the 67th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice, we renew our commitment to the principles of liberty for which our Korean War veterans so valiantly fought. We are eternally grateful for the families that endured the unimaginable sacrifices and heartache of war, and we are thankful for all the men and women who helped change the fate of a nation. The 38 months of bloody warfare represent the honorable legacy of a selfless and courageous generation of American patriots. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2020, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to our distinguished Korean War Veterans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 162]] Proclamation 10060 of August 6, 2020 Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Canada on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada. In particular, the United States agreed on a range of measures with Canada that were expected to allow imports of aluminum from Canada to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary's report. These included measures to monitor for and avoid import surges. 4. In light of this agreement, I determined that, under the framework in the agreement, imports of aluminum from Canada would no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I decided to exclude Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. I noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, and that I may revisit this determination as appropriate. [[Page 163]] 5. In Proclamation 9704, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports. 6. The Secretary has now advised me that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, which accounted for 59 percent of total aluminum imports from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020, increased substantially in the twelve months following my decision to exclude, on a long-term basis, Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020 increased 87 percent compared to the prior twelve-month period and exceeded the volume of any full calendar year in the previous decade. Moreover, imports of these articles from Canada continue to increase, reaching in June of this year the highest level of any month since I decided to adjust imports of aluminum articles in Proclamation 9704. The increase in imports of these articles from Canada is principally responsible for the 27 percent increase in total aluminum imports from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020. 7. Canada is the largest source of United States imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum, accounting for nearly two-thirds of total imports of these articles from all countries in 2019 and approximately 75 percent of total imports in the first five months of 2020. The surge in imports of these articles from Canada coincides with a decrease in imports of these articles from other countries and threatens to harm domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization. 8. In light of the Secretary's information, I have determined that the measures agreed upon with Canada are not providing an effective alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security from imports of aluminum from Canada. Thus, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to re-impose the 10 percent ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada, commensurate with the tariff imposed on such articles imported from most countries. 9. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, including with respect to imports of other aluminum articles. In particular, the United States will monitor for import surges of articles that continue to be exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, to ensure that exports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum to the United States are not simply reoriented into increased exports of alloyed, further processed, or wrought aluminum articles. 10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. [[Page 164]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting ``and'' before ``(d)'' and inserting before the period at the end: ``, (e) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, and Mexico; and (f) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, from Canada, except with respect to imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum provided for in subheading 7601.10, which shall be subject to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty''. (2) The Secretary, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the Federal Register. (3) The modifications made by clause 1 of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. (4) Any exclusion of aluminum articles from Canada granted by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, that has not expired shall be valid under the modifications to the HTSUS made by this proclamation. Previously granted exclusions that have expired may be renewed. (5) Any imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada provided for in subheading 7601.10 that were admitted into a United States foreign trade zone under ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41 prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, shall be subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date to the 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amended. Any imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada provided for in subheading 7601.10, except any articles that are eligible for admission under ``domestic status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, that are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, shall be admitted only as ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and shall be subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date to the 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amended. (6) Non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles provided for in subheading 7601.10 shall not be subject upon entry for consumption to the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, merely by reason of manufacture in a U.S. foreign trade zone. However, non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles provided for in subheading 7601.10 admitted to a U.S. foreign trade zone in ``privileged foreign status'' pursuant to [[Page 165]] clause 5 of this proclamation, shall retain that status consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e). (7) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this proclamation. (8) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD August 14, 2020 National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In the early days of our Nation's quest for independence, volunteer forces and militias formed the backbone of our armed resistance. These first patriots fought valiantly when called upon to defend liberty, and then returned to their everyday jobs as farmers, blacksmiths, cobblers, merchants, and a host of other occupations when the fighting was over. Today, the citizen warriors of the National Guard and Reserve carry forward this proud legacy and are essential to our prosperity, resilience, and national defense. During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we honor the employers who hire and support these brave men and women and who stand beside them in their mission to ensure the security of our Nation. Our National Guard and Reserve service members are critical to businesses and organizations in every sector of our economy, from education and healthcare to construction and agriculture. Just as they deliver meaningful contributions in civilian life, these men and women also provide strategic depth and operational capability to the Joint Force in uniform, deploying in support of critical missions throughout the world and responding to natural disasters and numerous other challenges on the home front. This year in particular, we have clearly seen their courage and unwavering resolve as they have selflessly served on the front lines of our Nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the risk to their own health, they have supported medical staff at hospitals and nursing homes, distributed food to hard-hit communities, built, staffed, and equipped alternate care facilities, and delivered life-saving medical equipment and supplies. Because of the vital importance of our National Guard and Reserve forces to our national security, those who employ them are key partners in the defense of our Nation. Their support in providing stability and flexibility to these men and women is critical to the country's ability to mobilize quickly in times of crisis. These employers often make great financial sacrifices themselves to ensure that their National Guard and Reserve employees are able to carry out their missions and responsibilities quickly and effectively. As one Nation, we extend our gratitude and respect to the men and women who employ our National Guard and Reserve forces for their role in ensuring the readiness and retention of our fighting force. Our military is the finest in the world thanks in no small part to our brave service members and their patriotic employers. During this week of recognition, I salute and honor all employers who cooperate and partner with our National Guard and Reserve service members for their unwavering support and selfless commitment to protecting our Nation and preserving our American way of life. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 16 through August 22, 2020, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve [[Page 169]] Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks to the civilian employers who provide critical support to the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve. I also call on State and local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10062 of August 18, 2020 100th Anniversary of the Ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On this day in 1920, the 19th Amendment to our Constitution was ratified, securing the right to vote for women and marking a monumental step toward the ``more perfect Union'' envisioned by our Founders. This milestone in American history was the product of the tireless efforts of suffragists and other advocates for women's rights, who steadfastly pursued their vision of a more just and equal society. In the early days of our Nation's fight for independence, future First Lady Abigail Adams penned a letter to her husband, John Adams, urging him to ``remember the ladies'' as he fought to preserve the fledgling United States. She advised him that ``if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.'' In the decades that followed, bold trailblazers like Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Forten Purvis, and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper carried forward and fought for the fundamental right of women to vote. The road to suffrage was long and challenging, but the faith, fortitude, and resolute determination of those committed to this noble cause brought about a victory that continues to inspire today. As we commemorate this historic event, we also celebrate the incredible economic, political, and social contributions women have made to our Nation. As President, I am committed to building on these accomplishments and empowering all women and girls to achieve their fullest potential. As part of this effort, in February of last year, my Administration launched the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, the first whole-of-government effort to advance women's economic empowerment around the globe. My Administration also released our Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security in June of last year to increase the political participation of women at home and abroad, recognizing that women's participation in conflict resolution and ending violent extremism can set the course toward a more peaceful world. We are also prioritizing the safety and well-being of women and girls through our commitment to combatting sex trafficking and empowering survivors, who are disproportionately women, and through [[Page 170]] Operation Lady Justice, the Presidential Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives. My Administration also understands that empowering women means implementing an economic agenda that enhances freedom and creates opportunities for women and working families. As part of this effort, the historic 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the Child Tax Credit, and I signed legislation that provided for the largest ever increase in funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which will help ease the burden of child care borne disproportionately by mothers. Additionally, in December of last year, I signed legislation providing for 12 weeks of paid parental leave for Federal employees. As I have since my first day in office, I continue to call on the Congress to pass a nationwide paid family leave program. My Administration's unprecedented investment in working families is already paying dividends. Women's unemployment in the United States reached the lowest level in 65 years. And in 2019, women filled 71 percent of all new jobs in the United States. Today, as we celebrate a major step forward for our Nation, we pay tribute to the countless women, known and unknown, throughout our history who struggled for equality. In doing so, we recommit to ensuring our Constitution is faithfully upheld so that all Americans can pursue their dreams and fulfill their God-given potential. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 18, 2020, as a day in celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Ratification of the 19th Amendment. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10063 of August 25, 2020 Women's Equality Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Recently, our Nation celebrated the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution. On the commemoration of this historic day, I was proud to issue a Proclamation honoring the women's suffrage movement and sign a full pardon for one of its greatest leaders, Susan B. Anthony, who was unjustly convicted for voting on account of her sex. On Women's Equality Day, we remember the trailblazers like Anthony who worked tirelessly to achieve a more just and equal United States, and we recognize the myriad ways in which women contribute to our society and strengthen our country. [[Page 171]] Women are an essential part of the political, economic, and social fabric of our Nation. All American women--regardless of the role they play in the workplace or at home--contribute every day to the success of our great country. In addition to being homemakers, caregivers, mothers, and counselors, along with a host of other important roles, women also fill critical jobs in every sector of our economy, contributing to the financial security of their families and our Nation. Currently, more than 200,000 women serve in our Armed Forces, and tens of thousands more courageously protect our communities as first responders. The women who call our Nation home epitomize the grit, determination, and work ethic that is indicative of the American Spirit, and their wisdom and compassion are among the greatest virtues of our society. Recognizing that women contribute to the strength and security of our Nation, my Administration will always make supporting women and working families a top priority. In December of last year, we secured 12 weeks of paid family leave for Federal workers, and we continue to call on the Congress to pass a similar paid family leave program nationwide. Additionally, we doubled the child tax credit through the historic 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and signed legislation providing for record funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, supporting working mothers and families throughout the United States. We have also worked to expand opportunities for women globally through policies like the Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, the first ever whole-of-government approach to increase economic opportunities for women worldwide. W-GDP helped enhance economic opportunities for 12 million women in its first year and has a goal of reaching 50 million women by 2025. My Administration recognizes that by empowering women at home and abroad, we are safeguarding the cultural foundation of our Nation and creating a more prosperous future for all global citizens. On Women's Equality Day, we honor all of the women who inspire and improve our Nation. Their talent and hard work strengthen our economy, our families, and our communities, and sustain our unique American way of life. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2020, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with appropriate programs and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 172]] Proclamation 10064 of August 28, 2020 Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that steel articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of these steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. 3. In Proclamation 9705, I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel article imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require. 4. In Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I noted that the United States had agreed in principle with the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil) on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by steel articles imported from Brazil. In Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I noted that the United States had agreed on measures with Brazil that would provide effective, long-term alternative means to address Brazil's contribution to the threatened impairment to our national security. These included quantitative limitations that restrict the volume of steel articles imported into the United States from Brazil. In light of these agreed-upon measures, I determined that steel article imports from Brazil would no longer threaten to impair the national security and decided to exclude Brazil from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, as amended. I further noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of those measures to address our national security needs. 5. In Proclamation 9759, I also directed the Secretary to monitor implementation of quantitative limitations applicable to steel article imports from [[Page 173]] Brazil and inform me of any circumstance that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate that an adjustment of the quantitative limitations is necessary. 6. The Secretary has advised me that there have been significant changes in the United States steel market since the time I decided to exclude, on a long-term basis, Brazil from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, as amended. The United States steel market has contracted in 2020. After increasing in 2018 and 2019, steel shipments by domestic producers through June of this year are approximately 15 percent lower than shipments for the same time period in 2019, with shipments in April and May of this year more than 30 percent lower than the shipments in the same months in 2019. The Secretary has further advised me that domestic producers' adjusted year-to-date capacity utilization rate through August 15, 2020, is below 70 percent and that the current rate has been near or below 60 percent since the second week of April. Brazil is also the second largest source of steel imports to the United States and the largest source of imports of semi-finished steel products. Moreover, imports from most countries have declined this year in a manner commensurate with this contraction, whereas imports from Brazil have decreased only slightly. 7. In light of these significantly changed market conditions, I have determined that the alternative measures regarding Brazilian steel imports, without any modifications, will be ineffective in eliminating the threat to the national security posed by imports of such articles, in the current environment. The United States and Brazil have held consultations regarding Brazil's steel exports to the United States. As a result of these discussions, the United States will lower, for the remainder of 2020, one of the quantitative limitations set forth in Proclamation 9759 applicable to certain steel articles imported from Brazil. In my judgment, this modification will preserve the effectiveness of the alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security by further restraining steel article exports to the United States from Brazil during this period of market contraction. In light of this modification, I have determined that steel article imports from Brazil will not threaten to impair the national security and thus have decided to continue to exclude Brazil from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, as amended. The United States and Brazil will hold further consultations in December 2020 to discuss the state of the steel trade between the two countries in light of then- prevailing market conditions. 8. I have been informed that a reduction in this quantitative limitation set forth in Proclamation 9759 applicable to certain steel article imports from Brazil may delay or disrupt specific production activities in the United States for which imports of the steel articles covered by the quantitative limitation have already been contracted for delivery in the fourth quarter of this year. In light of these circumstances, and after considering the impact on the economy and the national security objectives of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, I have determined to direct the Secretary to provide relief from the quantitative limitation set forth in this proclamation in certain limited circumstances specified in more detail below, in addition to the relief from the quantitative limitations that the Secretary is already authorized to provide pursuant to clause 1 of Proclamation 9777 of August 29, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States). [[Page 174]] 9. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) For purposes of administering the quantitative limitation applicable to subheading 9903.80.57 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for Brazil, the annual aggregate limit for Brazil set out in the Annex to this proclamation shall apply for calendar year 2020. This aggregate limit, which shall take into account all steel article imports from Brazil covered by this subheading since January 1, 2020, shall be effective for steel articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, under this subheading, between August 28, 2020 and December 31, 2020. For calendar year 2021 and for subsequent years, the annual aggregate limit for Brazil shall revert to the aggregate limit for Brazil set forth in the Annex to Proclamation 9759, unless that limit is further modified or terminated. (2) The Secretary shall, on an expedited basis, grant relief from the quantitative limitation applicable to subheading 9903.80.57 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for Brazil, as set out in the Annex to this proclamation, for any steel article where (i) the party requesting relief entered into a contract or other written agreement for the production and shipment of such steel article before August 28, 2020; (ii) such agreement specifies the quantity of such steel article that is to be produced and shipped to the United States prior to December 31, 2020; (iii) such steel article is to be used in production activities in the United States and such steel article cannot be procured from another supplier to meet the delivery schedule and specifications contained in such agreement; and (iv) lack of relief from the quantitative limitation on such steel article would significantly disrupt the production activity in the United States for which the steel article specified in such agreement is intended. The volume of imports for which the Secretary grants relief under this clause shall not exceed 60,000,000 kilograms in the aggregate. (3) The Secretary shall grant relief under clause 2 of this proclamation only upon receipt of a sworn statement signed by the chief executive officer and the chief legal officer of the party requesting relief, attesting that (i) the steel article for which relief is sought and the associated contract or other written agreement meet the criteria for relief set forth in clause 2(i) through (iv) of this proclamation; (ii) the party requesting relief will accurately report to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in the manner that CBP prescribes, the quantity of steel articles entered for consumption, [[Page 175]] or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, pursuant to any grant of relief; and (iii) the quantity of steel articles entered pursuant to a grant of relief will not exceed the quantity for which the Secretary has granted relief. The Secretary shall notify CBP of any grant of relief made pursuant to this proclamation. The Secretary shall revoke any grant of relief under clause 2 of this proclamation if the Secretary determines at any time after such grant that the criteria for relief have not been met and may, if the Secretary deems it appropriate, notify the Attorney General of the facts that led to such revocation. (4) As soon as practicable, the Secretary shall issue procedures for the requests for relief described in clauses 2 and 3 of this proclamation. The issuance of such procedures is exempt from Executive Order 13771 of January 30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs). CBP shall implement relief provided under clause 2 of this proclamation as soon as practicable. (5) Until such time as the applicable quantitative limitation provided in subheading 9903.80.57 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for Brazil has been reached, CBP shall count any steel article for which relief is granted under clause 2 of this proclamation toward such quantitative limitation at the time when such steel article is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. Any steel article for which relief is granted under clause 2 of this proclamation must be entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or before December 31, 2020, and, before January 1, 2021, further relief may not be granted for such article by the Secretary under clause 1 of Proclamation 9777. Steel articles for which relief is granted under clause 2 of this proclamation shall be subject to the duty treatment provided in subheading 9903.80.62 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for Brazil, as established by the Annex to this proclamation. (6) Subdivision (a)(iii) of U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by striking ``9903.80.61'' and inserting in its place ``9903.80.62''. (7) Subdivision (c) of U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by striking, in the last sentence, ``and 9903.80.61'' and inserting in its place: ``, 9903.80.61, and 9903.80.62''. (8) Subdivision (d) of U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by striking, in the first sentence, ``and 9903.80.61'' and inserting in its place: ``through 9903.80.62''. (9) The superior text to subheadings 9903.80.05 through 9903.80.58 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by striking ``and 9903.80.61'' and inserting in its place: ``through 9903.80.62''. (10) To implement clause 2 of this proclamation, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. (11) The modifications to the HTSUS made by clauses 6 through 10 of this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 28, 2020, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. [[Page 176]] (12) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD August 31, 2020 National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month is a time to honor and celebrate the millions of Americans who have found a pathway from addiction to a life of renewed purpose. The theme of this year's Recovery Month is ``Join the Voices for Recovery: Celebrating Connections.'' For those in or seeking recovery, developing and nurturing connections and relationships is essential. Despite challenges to developing and fostering meaningful connections caused by the coronavirus, Americans in recovery have demonstrated resilience and resolve by creating new and innovative means of connecting to fill the void of in person interactions. From establishing virtual peer support groups that embrace technology like videoconferencing to holding health and wellness classes remotely or in person following social distancing guidelines, Americans in recovery are finding strength in their communities. Throughout these unprecedented and challenging times, my Administration has taken historic action to ensure the road to recovery remains open. Among other measures, we have expanded access to telehealth services and ensured addiction treatment medications have remained available, including in rural and other underserved areas. In March, I signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act to provide millions of dollars in emergency funding for a wide range of prevention, treatment, and recovery services during the pandemic. My Administration is also working tirelessly to increase access to effective treatments and to build up the Nation's peer recovery support services infrastructure. To help end the scourge of addiction, my Administration released our National Treatment Plan for Substance Use Disorder, which outlines steps for improving the quality of treatment across a full continuum of care. This includes early identification and intervention services, and increased access to addiction treatment and recovery support services. Additionally, in June, I signed an Executive Order that requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to survey community support models addressing addiction and to make recommendations to ensure successful models are widely adopted and implemented. It is within a communal framework of love, compassion, and understanding, nurtured by the shared experiences of strength, hope, and healing, that we can find understanding and inspiration in one another. As our Nation continues to recognize those who are successfully breaking the chains of addiction and drug and alcohol misuse, we applaud the healthcare and treatment professionals, counselors, peer recovery coaches, faith leaders, first responders, family members, friends, and advocates who are vital in helping them achieve and sustain recovery, whether in person, over the phone, or virtually. Together, we can help more Americans live healthy and meaningful lives while building a stronger Nation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and [[Page 180]] the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2020 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10066 of August 31, 2020 National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Childhood should be a time of joy, laughter, innocence, and wonder. Sadly, more than 15,000 American children and adolescents endure the pain, heartache, and uncertainty of a cancer diagnosis each year. Today, cancer is the leading cause of death from disease beyond infancy for our Nation's youth, and in 2020 alone, it is expected to take the lives of approximately 1,200 children under 15 years of age. During National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the courage and strength of the brave children battling a cancer diagnosis, and we reaffirm our commitment to combating pediatric cancers and supporting these children and their families and friends in their fight. Over the last half century, substantial progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of several types of childhood cancer. Yet our resolve to ensure that every child can grow up cancer-free has never been stronger. We remain dedicated to the goal of ending childhood cancer and continuing to improve the care that all of these children receive. To achieve these goals, my Administration is working with the Congress to invest $500 million over the next decade to provide our Nation's best researchers and clinicians with unparalleled opportunities to better understand, treat, and ultimately cure childhood cancer. The National Cancer Institute is implementing the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, which will collect, analyze, and share data to advance pediatric cancer breakthroughs. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration's Pediatric Oncology program is working to accelerate the development of safe and effective new drugs to treat childhood cancers. These efforts will spur critical innovation in diagnoses, treatment, and prevention that will save lives. During National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the memory of the precious children and adolescents lost to cancer, and we pray for their families and friends as they remember their loved ones. We recommit to providing help, compassion, and encouragement to those children who are in the midst of a difficult battle. And we reaffirm our admiration and respect for the healthcare professionals who have continued to work tirelessly for these children during the coronavirus pandemic so that every child can enjoy a future filled with promise, good health, and hope. [[Page 181]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2020 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I ask every American to reach out and help a family battling childhood cancer. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to support the fight against childhood cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10067 of August 31, 2020 National Preparedness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Preparedness Month, we pause to reflect on the importance of mitigating the effects of disasters and tragedies on our lives by devoting time and resources to being prepared. As we observe National Preparedness Month this September, I encourage all Americans to take intentional, precautionary measures to ensure the resilience of their families, homes, communities, and businesses. Over the last year, our Nation has endured and persevered through many threats. Last week, hurricane Laura struck the Gulf Coast and affected the lives of millions in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi. My Administration is monitoring Federal response efforts and coordinating with State and local authorities to provide aid to the affected areas. In recent months, we have also responded to the coronavirus pandemic with unparalleled vigor and resolve, leveraging historic partnerships between the public and private sectors to produce and provide needed medical equipment and to develop therapeutics and a vaccine. We remain committed to safely reopening our country while protecting the most vulnerable among us. We have also faced wildfires, earthquakes, and storms, including a devastating weather system on Easter Sunday of this year that spawned more than 120 tornadoes in the southeastern United States. Despite the unprecedented nature and scope of the challenges we have faced, the American people have remained resolute in their determination to overcome any adversity. My Administration will continue to work with State, local, tribal, and territorial partners to ensure the country is prepared to meet any challenges that may arise. National Preparedness Month is also an opportunity to reiterate our gratitude for the selfless service of the brave men and women who help prepare [[Page 182]] our Nation for disasters and take action when they strike. Our first responders, critical infrastructure and other frontline workers, and disaster response volunteers often take great personal risks to perform their duties. These patriots are essential to the security of our Nation, and we remain committed to supporting them in their mission. Promoting a culture of resilience through preparedness helps enable communities and individuals to take the preparatory actions necessary to overcome the threats and hazards that present themselves. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Ready Campaign, which can be found by accessing Ready.gov, can help all Americans prepare for crisis situations. This easy-to-use response can help individuals and families create an emergency fund for unexpected expenses, set up a designated shelter area within a home, subscribe to local emergency alerts on mobile devices, and determine a reliable out-of-town contact during times of crisis. By taking these steps, people can mitigate damage and speed up recovery efforts across the country when disaster strikes. During National Preparedness Month, I encourage all Americans to adopt a proactive mindset and take the necessary steps to prepare their families and communities to withstand and recover from unexpected events. We cannot always know when the next crisis will occur, but we can know that we will be prepared by committing ourselves to a culture of resilience. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2020 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans, including Federal, State, tribal, and local officials, to take action to be prepared for a disaster or an emergency by making and practicing their emergency response plans. Each step we take to become better prepared makes a real difference in how our families and communities will respond and persevere when faced with the unexpected. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10068 of August 31, 2020 National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As our Nation recognizes National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month, we do so with an unwavering commitment to a future in which people with the condition live fully, without pain and impediments, and ultimately experience a cure. My Administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is leading unprecedented activity in research, medical education, and models of care in support of people with [[Page 183]] Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). A cure is within reach, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved new treatments and more are on the horizon, and several initiatives are underway to make better use of all available tools in the battle against this disease. SCD is a chronic, debilitating, inherited condition that afflicts 100,000 Americans--primarily African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. One in 13 African-Americans and approximately one in 100 Hispanic- Americans carry the gene for this disease. Those individuals with two copies of the gene have blood cells that are sickle-shaped, instead of cylindrical, which causes a disruption in blood flow that can damage many organs, including the brain and kidneys. A person with SCD can begin experiencing the negative effects in early childhood, including pain, organ damage, and risk of stroke. Unfortunately, it is estimated that only one in four patients with SCD in America receive the care that they need. My Administration puts action behind our words, which is why I signed into law the ``Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018'' (Public Law 115-327). The bill reauthorizes an SCD prevention and treatment program and authorizes initiatives for research, surveillance, prevention, and treatment of heritable blood disorders. HHS is leading the way to identify and address barriers to care for patients, and several organizations have joined in developing education and training programs to better equip healthcare providers to identify and treat this disease. HHS has also begun collaborating with States on new payment models that will enable children living with SCD to receive the care they need. We have made exciting progress towards our goal of extending the lives of Americans with SCD by 10 years and finding a cure by 2029. In January 2020, HHS launched a new, one-of-a-kind Sickle Cell Disease Training and Mentoring Program (STAMP), to train primary care providers on the basics of SCD evaluation and management. This innovative program is the result of critical collaboration between the Office of Minority Health and the Health Resources and Services Administration. The FDA has approved two new drugs to help prevent the complications of SCD, is providing leadership to reduce barriers and hasten the development of new treatments, and has developed multi-media educational resources for patients and their families. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has initiated an aggressive portfolio of research, education, and capacity building, including the ``Cure Sickle Cell Initiative'' to accelerate gene therapies to cure the disease. NIH reports that the most promising genetic-based curative therapies for SCD could be available in clinical trials in the very near future. My Administration is leading on SCD advancements both in the United States and throughout the world. In May 2019, HHS leaders convened a roundtable with African health ministers, international health leaders, and SCD experts to chart a course to save hundreds of thousands of children around the world. Through NIH, we will continue to support the Sickle Pan African Research Consortium, and other Public Private Partnerships to develop gene-based cures. [[Page 184]] The United States is helping raise the profile of SCD as a public health priority, by drawing attention to the work underway to create meaningful programs that immediately improve patients' lives. My Administration is committed to advancing treatment, research, and quality-of-care to improve the lives of people with SCD--and ultimately to deliver a cure to the world. This month, we take a moment to recognize all Americans with SCD and celebrate our progress toward future treatments. Together, we will secure a healthier future for all Americans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim September 2020 as National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities to eliminate a disease we have known about for more than a century and to work to improve the quality of life of those living with SCD. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10069 of September 4, 2020 Labor Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On Labor Day, we recognize and celebrate the workers of our great Nation. The American workforce is the best in the world and, since day one of my Administration, I have been standing up for the American worker. As recent global challenges have tested our mettle, the dedication of our workforce has once again proven that Americans' resolve will never be overcome. Today, we celebrate all workers, across every sector of our economy, whose efforts have never been more appreciated than in recent months. Since the founding of our Nation, American workers have deployed their talents to build beautiful cities, develop new technologies, and shape the global economy. Now, our country depends on these hardworking patriots as we continue to aggressively fight the coronavirus pandemic. In particular, we celebrate every American who has worked tirelessly to ensure we maintain our way of life in this unprecedented time. These vital workers include medical professionals, grocery store and pharmacy clerks, farmers, meatpackers, truckers, factory workers, and the many employees who are important to the supply chain that makes essential goods and medications accessible to all Americans. Essential workers and volunteers like these and others have enabled my Administration to respond swiftly to the coronavirus pandemic and have safeguarded the prospects of countless American businesses and the lives and personal health of millions of people. [[Page 185]] From my first day in office, my Administration has acted to foster an environment for growth, jobs, and prosperity. Having built the greatest economy the world has ever seen, my Administration will do it again. We will not rest until American workers are safely back at work. In March, I signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which established the Paycheck Protection Program that gave small businesses the resources to keep their employees on payroll during the pandemic. I also issued an Executive Order continuing the work of the National Council for the American Worker, which coordinates resources across our Federal Government to ensure our Nation's workers have the skills necessary for the jobs of the future. In addition, my Administration's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget includes $200 million for apprenticeship programs--up $25 million from current funding levels and more than double from when I first took office--to further support and expand a highly skilled workforce that is essential for global competitiveness. Even in the face of tremendous adversity, we have set record numbers in job growth along with record low unemployment--a trend that will continue with the help of millions of hardworking Americans across our country. On this Labor Day, we express our deep gratitude to workers of every generation who helped create the greatest economy in the world and the workers whose tireless efforts will ensure our country and workforce bounce back with full force as we defeat the virus. Together, we will continue the great American comeback. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 7, 2020, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working Americans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10070 of September 3, 2020 National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we pay tribute to the nearly 3,000 precious lives lost on September 11, 2001. We solemnly honor them and pray that those who bear the burdens of unimaginable loss find comfort in knowing that God is close to the brokenhearted and that He provides abiding peace. The memories of that fateful morning still touch American hearts and remind us of our Nation's reliance on Almighty God. When cowardly terrorists attacked our homeland, we witnessed the unthinkable as each successive plane struck the very heart of our Nation. As the Twin Towers fell and [[Page 186]] the Pentagon was hit, the peace and calm in the lives of innocent families were shattered. Our Nation watched in shock as courageous first responders faced great peril to save the lives of their fellow Americans. Onboard United Flight 93, a group of heroic individuals braced themselves to stop hijackers from hitting our Nation's Capital. Passenger Todd Beamer told Lisa Jefferson, a call center supervisor in Chicago who stayed on the phone with him until the end, that he would ``go out on faith'' and asked her to recite the Lord's Prayer with him over the phone, beginning: ``Our Father, who art in heaven.'' Despite immeasurable loss, we were not defeated. Our Nation's darkest hour was pierced by candlelight, our anguish was met with prayer, and our grief was met with unity. Like so many times before in our country's history, we sought peace and strength through faith. Today, at Ground Zero in New York City, the ``Survivor Tree'' stands as an enduring symbol of our faith and national restoration. As it blooms with the seasons and reminds us of its triumph over destruction, we remember the words of John 1:5: ``The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.'' In the nearly two decades that have passed since this tragedy, our Nation has grown stronger and more resilient. As one country, we honor all of the mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters who perished on that day. They are forever remembered. On these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we pray for the families of all those who were lost and honor the courageous heroes who came through for our Nation when we needed them most. Together, as one Nation under God, we renew our vow to never forget. We cherish each other as fellow Americans and look proudly to our flag--an unwavering reminder of freedom's triumph over fear. And, above all, we thank God for the strength and courage He has provided us, and take heart that our beloved departed now rest in His loving embrace. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 4, through Sunday, September 6, 2020, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I call upon the people of the United States to observe these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 187]] Proclamation 10071 of September 9, 2020 Revision to United States Marine Scientific Research Policy By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Convention) generally reflects customary international law. Section 3 of Part XIII of the Convention provides that coastal states, in the exercise of their jurisdiction, have the right to regulate, authorize, and conduct marine scientific research in their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and on their continental shelf. Marine scientific research in the EEZ or on the continental shelf shall be conducted with the consent of the coastal state. In Proclamation 5030 of March 10, 1983 (Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States of America), the President announced the establishment of the EEZ of the United States. The Proclamation asserts the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the United States in its EEZ and confirms the rights and freedoms of all states, as provided under international law. In an accompanying Presidential Statement of March 10, 1983 (United States Oceans Policy), the President acknowledged that international law allows coastal states to exercise jurisdiction over marine scientific research in their respective EEZs, but stated that the United States had elected not to do so to the fullest extent permitted under international law, in an effort to encourage such research. Presidential Decision Directive-36 of April 5, 1995 (United States Policy on Protecting the Ocean Environment), emphasizes that the policy of the United States is to protect and monitor the ocean and coastal environment and conserve living marine resources, recognizing that doing so, in an open and collaborative manner, supports our economic and national security interests. In Executive Order 13840 of June 19, 2018 (Ocean Policy to Advance the Economic, Security, and Environmental Interests of the United States), I reaffirmed that the United States will continue to promote lawful use of the ocean by agencies, including the Armed Forces, and that the United States will continue to exercise its rights and jurisdiction and perform duties in accordance with applicable international law, including customary international law. Further, the United States will use the best available ocean-related science and knowledge, in partnership with the science and technology communities, to inform decisions and enhance entrepreneurial opportunities. In the Presidential Memorandum of November 19, 2019 (Ocean Mapping of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and the Shoreline and Nearshore of Alaska), I affirmed the importance of understanding our ocean systems and natural resources to our security, economic, and environmental interests. Likewise, the exercise of jurisdiction by the United States over marine scientific research in its EEZ and on its continental shelf will result in greater access to data collected during such research and will increase maritime domain awareness, thereby reducing potential exposure to security, economic, and environmental risks. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the following: [[Page 188]] Section 1. Policy. The United States will exercise its right to regulate, authorize, and conduct marine scientific research, with a specific requirement to authorize, in advance, all instances of foreign marine scientific research, in the United States EEZ and on its continental shelf to the extent permitted under international law. Sec. 2. Implementation. The Secretary of State (Secretary) shall have lead responsibility for implementing this proclamation, in consultation with relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) and with the Ocean Policy Committee established in Executive Order 13840 (Ocean Policy Committee). Sec. 3. Intelligence. The Intelligence Community of the Federal Government shall support the implementation of this proclamation, as appropriate. Sec. 4. Information Sharing. To facilitate the process for reviewing applications for marine scientific research, agencies not part of the Intelligence Community shall share information related to marine scientific research with the Department of State, to the maximum extent authorized by law. Sec. 5. Termination. This proclamation shall remain in effect until terminated by the President. At any time, but not less frequently than every 2 years from the date of this proclamation, the Secretary may recommend that the President modify or terminate this proclamation. Any such recommendation by the Secretary shall be coordinated with the National Security Council staff and the Ocean Policy Committee. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 189]] Proclamation 10072 of September 10, 2020 Patriot Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In 2001, our Nation, united under God, made an unbreakable promise never to forget the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were senselessly killed on September 11. On this sacred day--Patriot Day--we solemnly honor that commitment. As the bells toll, we call by name those who perished in the terrorist attacks in New York, New York; Arlington, Virginia; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. In cities and towns across our great country, we stand in solidarity to remember the victims and mourn their stolen hopes and dreams. On a day that began as ordinary as any other, terrorists carrying out a sadistic plan murdered thousands of our fellow compatriots. With shock and disbelief, we watched our first responders, encumbered by heavy equipment and hindered by debris and smoke, rush with conviction and courage into the void to rescue those in despair. With pride and sorrow, we felt the tremendous bravery of those aboard Flight 93, who summoned the courage to charge the terrorists in a counterattack that saved countless American lives. As the day closed, America steadied its resolve to hold accountable those who had attacked us and to ensure it would never happen again. The courage, heroism, and resilience Americans displayed on 9/11, and in its aftermath, are perpetual testaments to the spirit of our country. While our Nation was anguished by this attack, the grit displayed that day--the very essence of America--was a reminder that our citizens have never failed to rise to the occasion. Heroes sprang into action in the face of great peril to help save their fellow Americans. Many laid down their lives. As we reflect on the events of that September morning, let us recommit to embrace the stalwart bravery displayed and reaffirm our dedication to defending liberty from all who wish to deny it. To fulfill our collective promise never to forget, we impart the memory of that fateful day to our children and grandchildren. The smoke that rose from the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania field carried away the souls of innocent Americans. As we recall the images of our American Flag raised from the ashes of Ground Zero and the Pentagon, we are reminded that good triumphs over evil. We recommit ourselves to fortifying our cherished American values so that future generations will know in their souls that the United States is the land of the free and the home of the brave. This Patriot Day, we commemorate the lives of those who perished on September 11, 2001, we pray for the families who carry on their legacies, and we honor the unmatched bravery of our Nation's first responders. We also commend those who, in the days and years following the attack, answered the call to serve our country and continue to risk their lives in defense of the matchless blessings of freedom. By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot Day.'' [[Page 190]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2020, as Patriot Day. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day in honor of the innocent people who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of the innocent people we lost that day and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor those victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10073 of September 11, 2020 Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Each day, more than one million minority-owned employers in the United States contribute to the economic vitality of our Nation. These incredible enterprises uplift their surrounding communities and help fuel the futures, livelihoods, and dreams of Americans throughout the country. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we celebrate the contributions of our great minority-owned businesses and reaffirm our commitment to supporting their continued growth, development, and success. Since my first day in office, I have been committed to fostering an environment where all businesses, including minority-owned businesses, can thrive. The historic 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided for the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history, benefitting all Americans. This legislation also created Opportunity Zones, a landmark program that encourages investment in distressed communities and creates jobs for those who are most in need of opportunities for economic empowerment. My Administration has also cut burdensome regulations at an unprecedented rate, loosening Government restraints on growth and allowing minority-owned businesses to thrive. To reinforce our commitment to these critical enterprises, in April of this year, the Department of Commerce, through the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), announced the creation of the Minority Business Enterprise Inner City Innovation HUBs, which will award $2.8 million over 2 years to support minority-owned businesses. Through this initiative, we are helping to fund and sustain minority-owned startups, including those that support digital innovation, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and technology transfer. My Administration has also been relentlessly committed to helping minority-owned businesses recover from the economic hardships brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. As part of the historic Coronavirus Aid, Relief, [[Page 191]] and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which I signed into law in March of this year, the Federal Government has allocated $10 million in supplemental funding to MBDA Business Centers and minority chambers of commerce to provide training and advising services for minority business enterprises, empowering them to be leaders in our economic recovery. In addition, the nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have produced $75 billion in investment for countless minority neighborhoods throughout the United States. My Administration understands that supporting minority businesses promotes a strong national economy, and we will do everything in our power to assist minority-owned businesses as our Nation continues our economic resurgence. This week and every week, we celebrate the vast contributions minority- owned businesses make to our great country. As President, I will always proudly stand by minority entrepreneurs and their businesses. My Administration will continue to promote their interests and decrease regulatory burdens to help them unleash their full potential. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 13 through September 19, 2020, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with programs, ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of American minority business enterprises. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10074 of September 11, 2020 Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to ending the opioid crisis in our country, and we pledge to help our friends, family, and colleagues with addiction as they work toward a drug-free life. Addiction undercuts human personal potential, damages families, and disrupts relationships. This month, and every month, we must continue to raise awareness about the dangers of opioid misuse and resolve to build a healthier and happier Nation. Since my first day in office, my Administration has taken aggressive action to confront and dismantle the driving forces behind the opioid crisis. In October 2017, we declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency, and in 2018, we secured $6 billion in new funding to fight the opioid crisis. Most recently, I signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [[Page 192]] (CARES) Act, which strengthened these efforts by providing millions of dollars in emergency grant funding to healthcare providers treating those with substance use disorders. Additionally, to ensure that access to addiction support services remains uninterrupted, I eased the regulatory burdens on the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services, which are now ensuring greater access to treatment by expanding telehealth options. To fight over prescribing, a significant contributor to the widespread opioid addiction, my Administration launched the Safer Prescribing Plan in 2018, which built on our early progress and set an ambitious goal of cutting opioid prescription fills by one-third within 3 years. This initiative is a major reason why the total amount of opioid prescriptions filled in America has dropped by 31 percent since I took office. We have also developed partnerships between the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Truth Initiative, and the Ad Council to educate young adults about the dangers of misusing opioids. These efforts are preventing Americans from falling victim to the potent and dangerous grip of opioid addiction. My Administration is also taking decisive action to keep dangerous drugs out of our country. Synthetic opioids are extremely deadly and generally originate outside of the United States. Our Nation's law enforcement officers are working night and day to keep this poison from crossing our borders. In 2018 alone, they seized almost 5,000 pounds of fentanyl at our border--enough to kill 1.2 billion individuals, the equivalent of every American four times over. Although we have made great progress through these actions, my Administration remains as committed as ever to using the power of Federal law and the expertise of our Nation's dedicated law enforcement officials to prevent the illegal importation and distribution of opioids, which could otherwise devastate countless American families. To help those already struggling with addiction, my Administration is working to champion evidence-based treatments and provide recovery support resources. In 2018, I signed the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, which uses a whole-of-government approach to better monitor prescribing, improve treatment, prevent addiction, and curb the use of illegal drugs. We have also awarded nearly $50 million in planning grants to 15 States to increase the capacity of Medicaid providers to deliver substance use disorder treatment and recovery services. And beginning in January of this year, Medicare began covering services for its beneficiaries at opioid treatment programs. Together, these efforts will help expand treatment access and provide crucial support to those who need it. This Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we redouble our efforts to defeat our Nation's opioid crisis. We can never forget the hundreds of thousands of lives lost, nor the families forever altered due to this scourge. We will always support those around us who are suffering from addiction, encourage those struggling in private to reach out for help, and celebrate those who have found a pathway from addiction to recovery. Together, we will continue to build awareness and work toward a healthier, safer society where every community, family, and individual can flourish. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and [[Page 193]] the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 13 through September 19, 2020, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week. I call upon my fellow Americans to observe this week with activities of awareness and remembrance of the lives lost and commitments to continue the fight. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10075 of September 11, 2020 National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation For more than 180 years, our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have exhibited remarkable excellence in higher education and served as engines of opportunity and advancement for thousands of Black Americans. During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we celebrate the achievements of HBCUs and their students and pledge our continuing support to the nearly 300,000 individuals currently pursuing their dreams at HBCUs throughout the United States. For nearly two centuries, HBCU graduates have profoundly shaped American life and culture. In science and technology, HBCU graduates have led the way in innovation, like engineer and inventor Otis Boykin, who held more than 20 patents during his lifetime, including for a wire precision resistor used in radios and televisions, and for a control unit used in pacemakers that helped save countless lives. From thought leaders like Booker T. Washington and civil rights heroes like Martin Luther King, Jr., to great legal minds like Thurgood Marshall and renowned authors like James Weldon Johnson, our Republic is more vibrant because of HBCUs and their students. My Administration will always stand beside these wonderful colleges and universities as they pursue their mission to provide their students with a high-quality education. In order to further promote the success of HBCUs in the years to come, I signed an Executive Order in February of 2017 on the White House Initiative to Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This action established the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, and as a result, 32 Federal departments and agencies now have plans in place to help HBCUs secure available Federal resources and opportunities. Additionally, my Administration recently released a Framework for the Development of a Federal HBCU Competitiveness Strategy, further facilitating productive partnerships between HBCU students and faculty members and public and private-sector entities. [[Page 194]] This year, National HBCU Week also coincides with the 150th anniversary of two of South Carolina's great historically black institutions: Allen University and Benedict College. Our Nation joins these schools in celebrating this significant milestone and their incredible legacies. Last year, at Benedict College, I was proud to highlight an increase of more than 13 percent in Federal funding for HBCUs under my Administration. In addition, I signed into law the FUTURE Act, which reauthorized more than $85 million in funding for HBCUs, securing permanent funding for our Nation's historically black institutions and helping ensure their financial security for future generations. My Administration has also continued to prioritize HBCUs during the coronavirus pandemic, and we remain committed to helping them safely reopen for in-person classes. As part of this effort, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which I signed into law in March of this year, provided $930 million in higher education emergency relief funds for HBCUs. During these challenging times, my Administration is working to meet the needs of these great institutions and their students as they seek to safely reopen their doors. We know full well the important role they will play in our ongoing national recovery. HBCUs help empower young Americans from all backgrounds to achieve their American Dream. This week, we proudly reaffirm our support for HBCUs and pledge to continue to promote their success and provide support to their vital educational mission. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20 through September 26, 2020, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, and further proclaim September 21, 2020, as National HBCU Colors Day. I call upon educators, public officials, professional organizations, corporations, and all Americans to proudly don institutional colors and observe this week and day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the countless contributions these institutions and their alumni have made to our country. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities and to boldly, joyfully, and proudly don institutional colors. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10076 of September 14, 2020 National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we celebrate the countless contributions of more than 60 million Hispanic Americans to our culture and [[Page 195]] society. Hispanic Americans are the largest minority group in the United States today, and generations of Hispanic Americans have consistently helped make our country strong and prosperous. They contribute to our Nation beyond description. Hispanic Americans embody the best of our American values, including commitment to faith, family, and country. They serve in our military and protect us as members of law enforcement. In fact, Hispanic Americans make up half of our Border Patrol agents. The Hispanic-American community has left an indelible mark on our government, culture, and economy. As part of our commitment to promoting the success of Hispanic Americans, my Administration will always promote educational opportunity for our Nation's Hispanic-American communities. Hispanic Americans benefit greatly from school choice programs, including the Nation's largest school choice program in Florida, where more than one-third of the recipients are Hispanic-American students. No American student should ever be trapped in a failing public school or a school that does not meet his individual needs. Additionally, we have spurred the creation of more than 16 million education and training opportunities through our Pledge to the American Worker. My Administration is also working to increase economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans by providing pathways to in-demand jobs and investing in Hispanic-American communities. On July 9, 2020, I signed an Executive Order to establish the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to promote educational and workforce development, encourage private-sector action and public-private partnerships, and to monitor how Federal programs best provide opportunities for Hispanic Americans. Additionally, this Executive Order established the President's Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity, which is dedicated to advising my Administration on ways to improve access to educational and economic opportunities for the Hispanic-American community. This year, my Administration also delivered $1 billion in funding to Minority-Serving Institutions, including Hispanic-Serving Institutions. And since I signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 into law, nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones have attracted an estimated $75 billion in new capital investment in economically distressed areas, helping to bring wealth and jobs to the neighborhoods where many Hispanic Americans live. We are already seeing the positive results of these policies in communities throughout the United States. In the 2017-2018 academic year, the graduation rate for Hispanic students at public high schools rose to 81%, the highest level ever recorded. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the median income for Hispanic Americans had reached its highest level in history. Unemployment reached the lowest rate ever recorded. The poverty rate for Hispanic Americans also hit a record low. And from 2017 to 2018, 362,000 Hispanic Americans became new homeowners, the largest net gain for Hispanics since 2005. In the past 4 months as we have recovered from the coronavirus, we added 3.3 million jobs for Hispanic Americans. It is my promise to the Hispanic-American community and to all Americans that my Administration will continue to do everything in its power to rebuild the economy, ensure opportunity, grow wages, and cut regulations so every family can achieve their own American Dream. [[Page 196]] Hispanic Americans will play an incredible role in our country's great years to come, and my Administration proudly stands with them. Their steadfast commitment to America's core values, their steadfast opposition to socialism, and their innumerable contributions to our prosperity enrich our Nation and add to our unmatched culture and way of life. To honor the achievements of Hispanic Americans, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as ``National Hispanic Heritage Month.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2020, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call on public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10077 of September 17, 2020 Constitution Day, Citizenship Day, and Constitution Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In the summer of 1787, fifty-five delegates from throughout the fledgling United States gathered at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, intent on erecting a government that would stand the test of time and protect hard-won freedoms secured during the Revolutionary War. Two hundred and thirty-three years later, the document they produced--our Constitution--remains the bedrock of our system of government, one rooted in equality under the law and an unyielding commitment to individual liberty. On this day and during this week, we celebrate our great founding charter as an enduring beacon of freedom and strive toward active citizenship in service of its ideals. With profound wisdom, the Framers of our Constitution divided political power among three separate and coequal branches, and further between the Federal and State governments, ensuring that a government of the people, by the people, and for the people would remain accountable to its citizens, from whom all legitimate political power is derived. Our Constitution outlines a government that encourages individuals to flourish while still empowering the state to perform necessary functions like protecting law and order and providing essential public goods. This revolutionary concept has made and continues to make our Nation the most free and just society in [[Page 197]] the world. Because its principles are timeless and rooted in truth, our Constitution has fostered freedom at home, as well as the liberation of countless oppressed peoples around the world. In the more than 2 centuries since its ratification, it has served as an unparalleled engine for human progress. A key feature of our Constitution is an independent Federal judiciary, which helps safeguard its structure and ensure individual rights. In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton describes the proper role of the courts as keeping the legislature ``within the limits assigned to their authority,'' handing down decisions in accordance with the principle that ``a constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law.'' In reverence of the wisdom of the Founders, I have made it a top priority to nominate to the Federal bench only those judges who have demonstrated a commitment to enforcing the Constitution as written. To date, I have nominated and the Senate has confirmed more than 240 judges who will faithfully adhere to this foundational judicial principle, including two incredible Supreme Court Justices. While freedom-loving Americans rightfully venerate and defend our Constitution, we must also remain cognizant that there are those in our society who wish to tear down our institutions and threaten our sacred constitutional freedoms. In recent months, statues of great American heroes like Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt have been threatened, torn down, defaced, and destroyed. In cities throughout our country, radical groups have attacked monuments honoring the unrivaled contributions our Founding Fathers made to human freedom. These groups and individuals are attempting to topple constitutional law and order--the very foundation of self-government--by attacking the Constitution and the integrity of our national heroes, falsely decrying our country and its institutions as evil and unjust. As President, I will never allow such heinous attacks to go unpunished. I will continue to honor the legacy of our history by protecting our freedoms and safeguarding our Constitution and the boundless opportunity it affords to the people of our great Nation. We should always celebrate the brave Americans who fought tyranny to secure the very liberty that these extremists take for granted. To this end, in June of this year, I signed an Executive Order on Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues, and Combating Recent Criminal Violence, ensuring that anarchy and base criminal acts will no longer tarnish memorials built to honor the heroes who have served our country and defended our Constitution. On this Constitution and Citizenship Day, and during this Constitution Week, we recommit to upholding our constitutional system, to honoring its Framers and those who have sacrificed to defend it--who knew the true price of liberty--and to embracing the duty we as citizens have to preserve the society it has built. The Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and [[Page 198]] the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2020, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17, 2020, through September 23, 2020, as Constitution Week. On this day and during this week, we celebrate the citizens and the Constitution that have made America the greatest Nation this world has ever known. In doing so, we recommit ourselves to the enduring principles of the Constitution and thereby ``secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10078 of September 17, 2020 National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Throughout our Nation's history, America's sons and daughters have heroically safeguarded our precious freedoms and defended the cause of liberty both at home and abroad. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we remember the more than 500,000 prisoners of war who have endured incredible suffering and brutality under conditions of extraordinary privation, and the tens of thousands of our patriots who are still missing in action. Although our Nation will never be able to fully repay our debt to those who have given so much on our behalf, we commemorate their bravery and recommit to working for their long-suffering families who deserve answers and solace for their missing loved ones. Today, I join a grateful Nation in honoring those POWs who faithfully served through extreme hardship and unimaginable physical and emotional trauma. Their lives and resilience reflect the best of the American Spirit, and their immeasurable sacrifices have ensured the blessings of freedom for future generations. On this day, we also reaffirm our unceasing global efforts to obtain the fullest possible accounting of our MIA personnel. The search, recovery, and repatriation of MIA remains help bring closure to families bearing the burden of the unresolved fate of their loved ones. That is why in 2018, I worked to secure the historic repatriation of remains from North Korea, and why we are continually working to bring more home from around the world. My Administration will never waver in fulfilling our country's obligation to leave no service member behind. This year, as we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II and reflect upon both the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War and the 45th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, we pause to recognize the men and women who were held as POWs or deemed MIA in these conflicts against repressive ideologies. These service members and civilians, many from the Greatest Generation, deserve a special place of [[Page 199]] honor in the hearts of all Americans because of their selfless devotion, unflinching courage, and unsurpassed dedication to our cherished American values. On September 18, 2020, our Nation's citizens will look to the iconic black and white flag as a powerful reminder of the service of America's POWs and service members who have gone MIA. This flag, especially when flying high above our military installations abroad, conveys the powerful message of American devotion to the cause of human liberty and our commitment to never forget the brave Americans lost defending that liberty. On this National POW/MIA Recognition Day, our Nation takes a special moment to pay tribute to those who endured the horrors of enemy captivity and those lost in service to our country. Our Nation will continue to be resolute in our relentless pursuit of those remains of service members who have yet to return home from war and our steadfast promise to their families that their loved ones will never be forgotten. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18, 2020, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. Together with the people of the United States, I salute all American POWs who, in the presence of great dangers and uncertainties, valiantly honored their duty to this great country. Let this day also serve as a reminder for our Nation to strengthen our resolve to account for those who are still missing and provide their families long-sought answers. I call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10079 of September 18, 2020 National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since our Nation's founding, agriculture has played an integral role in the American way of life. America's farmers and agricultural workers are critical to our economy, and concern for their physical and mental safety must remain a top national priority. Together, we must continue to ensure our farmers, ranchers, and foresters have the ability to work safely and effectively as they provide food, fiber, and fuel for our country. During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we raise awareness of safety and health issues on farms, ranches, and in rural communities, and we commit to improving the well-being of those who live and work in rural settings for generations to come. [[Page 200]] The theme of National Farm Safety and Health Week this year, ``Every Farmer Counts,'' reminds us that every American must prioritize the safety and health of those who provide us with essential goods. The fall harvest is one of the busiest and most dangerous seasons of the year for agricultural workers. In preparation, and to propel continued innovation in farm productivity and safety, my Administration is supporting 21st- century artificial intelligence and greater precision in agricultural applications. Additionally, we have made significant investments in rural hospitals, rural broadband, and access to telemedicine. My Administration has also prioritized the expansion of prevention, treatment, and recovery programs for the misuse of opioids in rural America. This week, we rededicate ourselves to these efforts to maximize the safety and health of agricultural producers through best practices, innovative technologies, and production methods that reduce risk and create safer, more productive work environments. Addressing farm safety and health concerns requires more than just protecting agricultural workers from routine farm injuries. Our efforts also include addressing disease outbreaks and health crises, such as the coronavirus pandemic. This past spring, I instructed our Federal agencies to publish coronavirus safety guidelines addressing the specific needs of agricultural workers and food processing workers, all of which work hard to ensure America's critical food supply remains strong. To aid producers affected by the pandemic, my Administration is providing $34 billion to America's farmers through a variety of programs, including $30 billion in direct payments through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program and the innovative $4 billion Farmers to Families Food Box Program, which supports American food producers and communities in need. This National Farm Safety and Health Week, we also commend our first- class medical professionals and brave first responders serving in rural communities throughout the country. When our agricultural workers experience illness, injury, or health crises, our rural emergency medical responders are their heroes. With the support of these committed Americans, and our continued support for programs enhancing farm safety, we will ensure every farmer--and every American life in rural and remote communities--counts. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20 through September 26, 2020, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. Please join me in promoting safe and healthy practices on our farms and ranches as producers enter the harvest season across the United States. I also urge all Americans to express their appreciation and gratitude to our farmers, ranchers, and foresters for their important contributions and tireless service to our Nation. The United States was built on the foundation of agriculture, and agriculture was built on the foundation of family farmers and their enduring values. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 201]] Proclamation 10080 of September 18, 2020 National Gang Violence Prevention Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Gang Violence Prevention Week, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to ensuring gang members are removed from our streets and prosecuted for their crimes, so all Americans can live and thrive in a safe and peaceful environment. Our Nation's law enforcement officials are our first line of defense against gang violence, and we continue to express our eternal gratitude for their selfless devotion to upholding the rule of law and keeping us safe. Street gangs pose grave threats to the safety of communities and the well-being of children, teenagers, and families. Gangs aim to perpetuate the trafficking and smuggling of humans, weapons, and drugs. They destroy public and private property, corrupt America's youth, and ruin businesses. To break the pernicious cycle of gang violence and crime, my Administration has enacted comprehensive solutions focused on prevention, intervention, and suppression. In July, we launched Operation LeGend--a sustained and coordinated law enforcement surge in communities across the Nation. Operation LeGend is named in honor of 4- year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot and killed while he peacefully slept early in the morning of June 29 in Kansas City, Missouri. This unfathomable tragedy is one of many examples of the scourge gangs pose to our youth and to our communities. The eponymous operation spans every Federal law enforcement agency and is being executed in conjunction with State and local officials. Our national effort to fight violent crime will protect our Nation's children and bring violent criminals to justice. Every child in America should enjoy a youth without any risk of falling victim to violence, drugs, or other harmful criminal acts that can destroy their future. And every parent should see their children grow into the people that God intended for them to become. It is the responsibility of all public leaders to do everything in our power to make this possible. As President, my highest obligation is to protect our Nation's citizens, which is why we are relentlessly working to restore law and order throughout our country. In the past year, the Department of Justice has prosecuted thousands of violent gang members, including hundreds of leaders, members, and associates of transnational criminal organizations such as MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. The spread of these vicious groups, and the human suffering they bring, is accomplished through a sophisticated and well- organized campaign of violence meant to intimidate neighborhoods and boost illegal money-making activities. In response, my Administration has taken strong actions to secure our borders, shut down smuggling networks, and expedite the removal of illegal immigrants associated with these transnational criminal networks. Additionally, the Attorney General's Joint Task Force Vulcan has taken steps to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately destroy MS-13, including strategically targeting the highest ranking leaders and bringing terrorism charges against the organization. Through these initiatives, and working with our foreign law enforcement partners in Operation Regional [[Page 202]] Shield, we have reduced the ability of transnational criminal organizations to commit murders and other violent crimes, as well as hindered their funding by stopping crimes such as robbery, extortion, drug and gun smuggling, and despicable acts of human trafficking. Under my Administration, the Department of Justice has revitalized the Project Safe Neighborhoods program, which provides crucial support to local law enforcement agencies across the country to combat gang violence and prevent violent crime. This community-based initiative targets the most violent criminals in the most dangerous areas of our country and has successfully delivered justice by getting them off the streets and behind bars. None of these significant strides would be possible without the dedicated law enforcement officials of our great Nation. In light of the growing, radical movement attacking the police, I take this opportunity to once again reemphasize my unending support for our Nation's heroes in blue. We are forever grateful for the incredible men and women of law enforcement who risk their lives every single day to combat crime and mayhem. As a Nation, we must band together in the fight against criminal gangs that threaten our democracy and terrorize our children, families, and communities. National Gang Violence Prevention Week is a time to reflect on the honorable service of our heroes in law enforcement and dedicate ourselves to doing all that we can to prevent criminal gangs from infiltrating our communities with violence and crime. We will not rest until we have removed the scourge of gangs and transnational criminal organizations from our country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of September 20 through September 26, 2020, as ``National Gang Violence Prevention Week.'' I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10081 of September 18, 2020 Death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Today, our Nation mourns the loss of a trailblazer, not only in the field of law, but in the history of our country. Ruth Bader Ginsburg served more than 27 years as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She was a loving wife to her late husband Martin, and a caring mother to her two children Jane and James. [[Page 203]] Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an inspiration to all Americans. Having lost her older sister and mother before graduating high school, she entered law school as both a wife and a mother, and one of the few women in her class. After graduating from law school in 1959, she worked tirelessly for more than 34 years as a litigator and jurist and, in 1993, she became just the second woman to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States. Renowned for her powerful dissents at the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg epitomized powerful yet respectful argument; that you can disagree with someone without being disagreeable to them. Justice Ginsburg's work helped bring about greater equality for women, secure rights for the disabled, and will continue to influence our Nation for generations to come. In addition to her quick mind, she brought flair to the bench with her stylish jabots and her warm friendships among colleagues, even those with whom she often disagreed, most notably with the late Justice Antonin Scalia. A fighter to the end, Justice Ginsburg defeated cancer and the odds numerous times--all while continuing to serve on the Court. Her commitment to the law and her fearlessness in the face of death inspired countless ``RBG'' fans, and she continues to serve as a role model to countless women lawyers. Her legacy and contribution to American history will never be forgotten. As a mark of respect for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the United States, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 7 of title 4, United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the day of interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10082 of September 19, 2020 National Small Business Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Small Business Week, we celebrate the resolve and ingenuity of American businesses, entrepreneurs, and workers. America's small businesses are at the very core of our Nation's identity and prosperity, and this week we pay tribute to these patriots for their contributions to our Nation's economy and culture. [[Page 204]] This year, as we collectively recover from an unprecedented pandemic, my Administration remains intensely focused on helping every American enterprise remain viable, recover, and once again, thrive at historic levels. Our Nation's more than 30 million small businesses, which employ nearly half the private-sector workforce and create two-thirds of all net new jobs, are the key to propelling our economy to the prosperity levels America has enjoyed over the past 3 years. That is why, as part of our extraordinary, whole-of-government economic response to the coronavirus, we have placed the small business sector front and center. We have delivered nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars in timely, economic relief to distressed small business entrepreneurs and their employees throughout the country, including $525 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, $190 billion in COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), $20 billion in EIDL Advance grants, and additional healthcare funding. Additionally, American small businesses have been critical in revitalizing economically distressed areas. That is why my Administration worked with Congress to designate thousands of Opportunity Zones in underserved communities, and as a result, we are creating unprecedented new economic opportunities. We have also made extraordinary strides in the cultivation of entrepreneurship among underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, and veterans. In fact, under my Administration, Latinos are the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs. These numbers are an important reminder that in the United States anyone who is dedicated and hard-working is capable of achieving their own American Dream. Across our country, small businesses are essential to their communities, creating jobs and giving back during times of prosperity and challenge. My Administration is committed to investing in small business owners, and therefore advancing solutions that make it easier for them to exceed their goals. During this National Small Business Week, we celebrate the success of our American entrepreneurs who have chartered their own courses to provide jobs and a bright future for millions of American workers. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20 through September 26, 2020, as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the critical contributions of America's entrepreneurs and small business owners as they grow our Nation's economy. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 205]] Proclamation 10083 of September 25, 2020 Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The brave men and women of our Armed Forces represent the very best of our great Nation, matched only by the families who walk beside them in their service. It is our sacred duty to recognize the unending and immeasurable sacrifices our military families make in support of their loved ones and for our country, and we are cognizant of the fortitude they show enduring the anguish of knowing that their hero may never return home. On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, we solemnly honor the memory of every lost Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Coast Guardsman, and we humbly grieve with their families who persevere with remarkable courage, strength, and grace. Today, and every day, we hold in our hearts those who have answered the knock on the door, accepted the flag folded with precision, said their final farewell, and borne the absence of their fallen hero. Gold Star Families deserve our utmost respect, admiration, and support for their tenacity and resilience, and for the work they do to preserve the memory of those who gave their lives to our Nation. The true strength and success of our Armed Forces is found in the love, support, and unity of our Nation's military families, and this is reflected best in our country's inspirational Gold Star Mothers and Families. Shouldering their profound grief, they find the courage and conviction to move forward, transforming their heartache into hope, meaningful service, and outreach to veterans, support organizations, and other military families coping with the death of a loved one. Their ability to overcome, persist, prevail, and in turn, enrich the lives of others, exemplifies the true American Spirit. On behalf of our grateful Nation, I commend and honor them for their continued commitment to our military heroes. Americans of every generation owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women who gave their lives in service to this Nation and to their families who remain forever changed. On this solemn day of remembrance, we hold these families in our hearts, remember them in our prayers, support them in our words and deeds, and join them in honoring their hero's ultimate sacrifice. May God provide them continued strength, comfort, and care, and may God bless the United States of America. The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold Star Mother's Day.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 27, 2020, as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag of the United States over Government buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's gratitude and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and Families. [[Page 206]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10084 of September 25, 2020 National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we pause to reflect on the breathtaking natural wonders and resources that abound throughout our great Nation. American hunters, anglers, and outdoorsmen are entrusted with stewardship of these treasured blessings, sustaining our lands and waters through recreation and conservation efforts. These men and women also make substantial contributions to local economies, supporting individuals and communities and preserving longstanding American sporting traditions. As they have been since the founding of our country, hunting and fishing remain an integral part of the American identity. In addition to being great stewards of the land, hunters and anglers are also keepers of our rich ecological and conservation traditions, which have been passed down through generations. Hunting and fishing have long functioned as an effective means to manage certain wildlife populations, and time spent in nature promotes awareness of best practices for effectively managing ecosystems throughout the United States. In addition, sales of licenses, tags, and other permits support conservation efforts and contribute to research that furthers our understanding of how to best care for our natural environment. The men and women who hunt and fish our lands and waters cultivate a deep respect for our natural resources and foster greater understanding of mankind's relation to nature, sustaining a uniquely American ethos rooted in the values of individualism and self- sufficiency. In addition to the importance of hunting and fishing to our cultural heritage, hunters and anglers also help fuel our economy. In 2017, outdoor recreation in the United States supported 5.2 million jobs. These jobs and the activities they support contribute more than $70 billion to our economy and account for more than 2 percent of the United States' gross domestic product. Many hunting and fishing jobs are located in rural communities, focusing economic activity in areas that are often in need of investment and support. Because of the vital importance of hunting and fishing to the health of our lands and waters and the strength of our national economy, I have championed conservation efforts and supported American outdoorsmen since my first day in office. In March of 2019, I signed into law the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, marking the most important public lands designation in a decade. This legislation, combined with other actions taken at my direction by the Department of the Interior, [[Page 207]] has expanded or proposed to expand nearly 4 million acres across the country to hunting and fishing. To further preserve our Nation's natural resources for the American people, this past August I signed the Great American Outdoors Act--the largest single investment ever in America's public lands. This historic legislation provides $900 million a year in permanent funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, allocates $9.5 billion over 5 years to restore our public lands, and won the endorsement of more than 850 conservation groups and 43 sportsmen and sportswomen groups. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we emphasize our appreciation for the majestic natural beauty of our Nation, and we celebrate the stewards of the great American traditions that are tied to our lands and waters. Together, we commit to supporting hunting and fishing throughout the United States and passing on these cherished traditions to future generations, securing a future for sportsmanship and conservation in our country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 26, 2020, as National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day by sharing the great outdoors with your family and friends, and practice conservation and preservation with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10085 of September 30, 2020 National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the incredible fortitude of breast cancer survivors and offer our heartfelt support and prayers to those currently battling this disease. As one Nation, we remember the precious lives lost to breast cancer and the families forever changed as a result. This month, we devote ourselves to fighting to eradicate breast cancer, working with conviction and compassion to develop treatments and find a cure. This year, an estimated 276,000 Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and more than 42,000 will likely die from this terrible disease. Thankfully, through early detection and improved treatments, today there is a 90 percent five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with breast cancer. The First Lady and I strongly encourage all Americans to meet with their physicians and discuss their individual risks for breast cancer. Increased awareness, especially of family history and other common risk factors, preventive care, and regular screenings, including mammograms, can help save lives through early diagnosis and prompt treatment. [[Page 208]] As President, I am deeply committed to ensuring that Americans have access to cutting-edge treatments and life-saving medications for conditions like breast cancer. In 2018, I signed into law historic ``Right to Try'' legislation, which ensures those diagnosed with a terminal illness greater autonomy in choosing their treatment path and increases their access to potentially lifesaving drugs. My Administration also has taken decisive action to lower prescription drug prices and eliminate burdensome regulations that, for too long, undercut the potential of our researchers to develop innovative treatments and medications. We are also relentlessly committed to protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions, including conditions that may put someone at a greater risk of developing breast cancer. In the fight against this disease, we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to provide Americans with the best possible treatments and medications to save lives. This month, as we celebrate the incredible resilience of breast cancer survivors and remember those lost to this disease, we also pray for comfort and strength for those currently battling breast cancer. Together, united by compassion and resolve, we will continue in our effort to find new treatments, medications, and a cure to eradicate this disease from our Nation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups must increase awareness of what we can do to fight breast cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10086 of September 30, 2020 National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As technology continues to progress and new kinds of threats arise around the world, cybersecurity is playing an increasingly central role in our national security and daily lives. During National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we recommit to ensuring our Nation's cybersecurity, and we raise awareness of the responsibility all Americans have to protect their Internet-connected devices, technology, and networks from cyber threats at work, home, and school. My Administration is proud of the steps we have taken to promote technological innovation and bolster cybersecurity measures. We continue to [[Page 209]] prioritize Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and employment opportunities, and my Pledge to America's Workers has encouraged companies to provide educational opportunities for nearly 15 million American workers, especially in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cybersecurity, and secure 5G. I also signed the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which encourages veterans to study and pursue careers in STEM and computer science when they leave military service. These measures are vital to advancing our defenses and ensuring that the American people have the cyber skills necessary to defend our country. As our Nation continues to innovate, 5G technology will have a major effect on how we live our daily lives in the future. New opportunities, however, also bring new risks, which is why my Administration is leading 5G risk mitigation efforts to ensure that Americans can fully benefit from this new connectivity while keeping their devices safe and secure. In addition, in March, I signed the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, which is strengthening our network defenses against threats from hostile actors. The American people and our allies deserve to know that our 5G networks will be reliable, private, and secure. We must all work together to create a safer, more secure, and more resilient cyber world. As my Administration collaborates with private industry partners to strengthen and enhance the security of our Nation's technological infrastructure, I encourage all Americans to embrace their responsibility to protect their sensitive data and to familiarize themselves with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's STOP. THINK. CONNECT. campaign. All devices are potentially vulnerable. But you can greatly enhance the safety of your personal information and that of your family, friends, and employers by adhering to the advice offered by the campaign and improving your cyber hygiene. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people, companies, and institutions of the United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to observe this month through events, training, and education to further our country's national security and resilience. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10087 of September 30, 2020 National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we recognize the immeasurable contributions that Americans with disabilities make to [[Page 210]] our workforce. Their achievements not only strengthen our economy and communities but also exemplify the power of every American to help shape the future of our country. This month, we recommit to advancing an American workforce where everyone can fully pursue their God-given potential. Three decades ago, our Nation took a substantial step toward enabling Americans with disabilities to realize their full economic potential. With passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, these citizens obtained expanded access to employment opportunities, including government and community services. Since then, our Nation has made great strides to create a more inclusive workforce and secure a future of purpose for every American. My Administration has built on these successes by delivering unprecedented opportunities for more than 61 million Americans who have a disability. Due to these efforts, Americans with disabilities had the lowest annual unemployment rate on record last year. As we continue to restore our economy following the coronavirus pandemic, we will once again ensure historic employment opportunities for this incredible group of people. Now, more than ever, technology is at the forefront of our evolving national workforce. Accordingly, my Administration is harnessing emerging technologies that enable Americans with disabilities to work in new ways and in new environments. The Department of Labor's Partnership on Employment and Accessible Technology developed the Emerging Technology Playbook, which provides step-by-step guidance to ensure accessibility is being built into new technology from the start. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services has convened the Interagency Accessibility Forum to foster best practices in accessibility across the Federal Government. My Administration is also working with State and local policymakers through the State Exchange on Employment and Disability initiative to build a more disability- inclusive employment landscape. While there is still progress to be made, I am committed to expanding rewarding, family-sustaining careers to Americans with disabilities in each and every State. This month, we recognize the talent and skill of Americans with disabilities. Their resolve and determination strengthen our country and inspire us all. Together, we will continue to advance and promote an inclusive workforce in which everyone can provide for themselves and their families, achieve the American Dream, and enjoy the prosperity of our great Nation. The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36 U.S.C. 121), has designated October of each year as ``National Disability Employment Awareness Month.'' Most appropriately, this year's theme is ``Increasing Access and Opportunity.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government, employers, labor organizations, and the great people of the United States to recognize the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities across our land. [[Page 211]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10088 of September 30, 2020 National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation All Americans deserve a life free from the threat of physical and psychological harm. Tragically, far too many Americans are deprived of this right by perpetrators of domestic violence. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we offer our support to the victims and survivors of this unacceptable atrocity and reaffirm our commitment to bringing justice to their abusers and offering hope to those who currently reside in volatile and unsafe living conditions. Domestic violence is an evil that threatens the social fabric of our Nation. It is a widespread attack on the most sacred and intimate of institutions--the American family. Domestic violence tears families apart, with devastating consequences that can last for generations. Tragically, more than 10 million Americans suffer at the hands of loved ones each year, and women are twice as likely to be targets of this heinous crime as men. My Administration will always stand with and protect victims of domestic violence. My Fiscal Year 2020 budget allocated nearly $500 million for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to support respectful, nonviolent relationships and reduce domestic violence. In fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, we also provided the DOJ Office for Victims of Crime with $10 billion in funding so it can provide comprehensive and effective services, including to victims of domestic violence. Thousands of domestic violence survivors have received critical assistance because of this funding. My Administration has also provided funding for domestic violence shelters throughout the country so that people affected by this crime have a safe place to go to escape from their abuser. While our work will not be done until we end domestic violence, these initiatives are helping victims hold their abusers accountable and recover from the trauma inflicted upon them. As our Nation continues to combat the coronavirus pandemic, we are forced to face the consequences of increased domestic abuse. We must protect and support those who have found themselves locked down with an abuser. Now more than ever, we must do our part to provide domestic violence survivors with the tools and resources they need to escape their abuse and secure justice for the harm inflicted upon them. The pandemic has also underscored the need for well-trained law enforcement professionals, who often respond to domestic violence calls and provide assistance in situations that very often involve physical injury, psychological trauma, or even death. As we recommit to ending this unconscionable cycle of abuse, we also commend the heroes who courageously answer the call for help time and time again. [[Page 212]] There is no room for violence of any kind in our country. This month, we recognize that the victims and survivors of the unspeakable ordeal of domestic violence deserve our compassion, respect, and support. Let us marshal every tool at our disposal to continue the national, sustained, and coordinated campaign to end domestic violence forever. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10089 of September 30, 2020 National Energy Awareness Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation From coast to coast, our country is blessed with an abundance of natural resources that help power our homes, light our cities, and provide us transport to school and work. However, for too long, we failed to reap their full benefits, nor did we properly steward these God-given gifts. My Administration reversed that trend, and today, I am proud to proclaim that the United States is finally energy independent. During National Energy Awareness Month, we recognize the newly restored, preeminent importance of our Nation's energy industry to the comfort of our daily lives and to our national security. Since the beginning of my Administration, I have taken action to reduce the regulatory burden on the American energy sector. The last administration had stifled this industry with one costly job-killing regulation after another. For decades, special interest groups, bureaucrats, and radical environmental activists stymied the maintenance, repair, growth, and expansion of our Nation's energy infrastructure, preventing us from achieving energy independence. My Administration has ended all that and is promoting stronger production of crude oil and other liquids and empowering the private sector to explore and drill for oil and gas. We are also eliminating regulatory obstacles to building the major energy infrastructure needed to transport our Nation's energy from the source of production to end users and exporters. We have issued timely approvals for the Keystone XL, Dakota Access and Mountain Valley Pipelines, and addressed the obstacles to exporting coal through West Coast ports. As a result of these policies, our country is a net energy exporter for the first time since 1952 and is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Under my Administration, we are no longer beholden to foreign powers or domestic radicals. We are powering our Nation on our own terms. [[Page 213]] My Administration's commitment to promoting robust energy development has proven that energy production can go hand in hand with responsible stewardship of our natural environment. America's energy independence is critical to environmental stewardship. While boosting energy production, the United States still continues to be a world leader in clean air, including in the reduction of energy-related CO2 emissions. Emissions of common air pollutants have dropped by 77 percent over the last 50 years, including a 7 percent reduction under my Administration. By empowering our domestic energy industry and its workers, my Administration has made American innovation--rather than foreign influence--the cornerstone of our clean energy policy. Due to these efforts, we remain the world's top producer of nuclear power and recently became the second largest generator of solar power. Allowing American companies to chart their own paths to dependable renewable energy sources, rather than forcing them to adhere to top-down government programs, has enabled us to lead the world in emissions reductions. To continue our progress, I proudly signed the Great American Outdoors Act, which will direct royalties from energy production on Federal lands and waters toward conserving and repairing our national parks, forests, refuges, public lands, and tribal schools. As a result, the energy industry will play a crucial role in our sustainability and conservation efforts going forward. This month, we recommit to supporting our Nation's workers who produce, transport, and refine our energy. We recognize the vital role they play in creating opportunities, developing technologies, and advancing our country toward an even more prosperous future. My Administration will always support these hardworking men and women, and together, we will sustain our energy dominance and independence for years to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Energy Awareness Month. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10090 of September 30, 2020 National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Addiction to alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescription medications fuels havoc, heartache, and hopelessness in the lives of far too many Americans, as well as their friends and family members. During National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our unyielding commitment to breaking the grip of alcohol and drug addiction. Through our continued national [[Page 214]] effort, we will save lives and work to ensure a stronger and healthier country. It has been my priority and promise to win the critical battle against opioid misuse, which has ravaged our Nation for too long. In total, close to 400,000 Americans have lost their lives to opioid overdoses since the turn of the century. While one life lost to drug addiction is too many, nearly half a million is unconscionable. In response, I declared a Public Health Emergency and initiated a whole-of-government approach dedicated to ending this tragedy. To bolster this effort, I signed the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, a law that reduces access to opioids while expanding access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The SUPPORT Act is the single largest commitment to combatting the drug crisis in our Nation's history, and it is making a difference. In addition to the opioids public health emergency, my Administration is also advancing several initiatives to address substance abuse more broadly. We have strengthened the Drug-Free Communities program, which provides grants that mobilize communities to prevent youth substance use at the local level. We created the Rural Community Toolbox, which is an online resource that connects small town leaders with funding, data, and information to combat drug addiction in rural America. And the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Program is collaborating with community-based organizations and coalitions to fund evidence-based and evidence-informed prevention activities within the HIDTA communities. These initiatives, along with actions taken by State, local, tribal, and territorial stakeholders, including faith-based organizations, are helping families and communities save lives by engaging young people most at risk of developing a substance use disorder. As our Nation continues its unprecedented fight against the coronavirus pandemic, we are acutely aware of how isolation affects mental health and can encourage the misuse of legal and illegal substances. Through collaborative, community-based efforts, we are strengthening the support systems that deter our Nation's young people from drug use and improve overall mental health and wellness. This month, we pause to remember the lives lost to addiction, and recommit to protecting all Americans--particularly our Nation's young people--from the devastating effects drugs can have on them and their loved ones. We also commend the healthcare professionals, law enforcement officials, educators, family members, and community volunteers who raise awareness about the risks and dangers of alcohol and drug use, treat the afflicted, and support prevention. Together, we will build healthy families, safe neighborhoods, and thriving communities by preventing substance misuse. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. [[Page 215]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10091 of October 1, 2020 National Manufacturing Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since the founding of our Nation, Americans have been renowned for their craftsmanship and productivity. On National Manufacturing Day, we celebrate our dedicated American workers who carry on this legacy, recognizing that manufacturing is a cornerstone of our economic prosperity and national security. The workmanship and ingenuity of American manufacturers make ``Made in the U.S.A.'' an enduring stamp of patriotism and excellence, and we will always support the men and women whose work ensures that American manufacturing is second to none. Since my first day in office, I have put America first, ushering in an unprecedented manufacturing revival. In 2017, I signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, supercharging our economic resurgence after more than a decade of stagnation. My Administration also embarked on a long- overdue effort to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulations, unleashing the full potential of our manufacturers. Under my leadership, we also renegotiated one-sided and unfair trade deals, finally putting American workers and their interests first to ensure they can compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts. These policies and achievements have delivered historic results for the American worker and American families. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, our Nation had added more than 483,000 manufacturing jobs since my inauguration. In addition, more than 430 organizations have signed my Administration's Pledge to America's workers, committing to providing education and training opportunities for 16 million American students and workers over the next 5 years, with manufacturing workers as a primary beneficiary. Thanks to the renegotiated United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which I signed in September of 2018, American manufacturers are being treated more fairly on the global stage, and we ended a bilateral trade deficit of more than 170 percent caused by previous administrations' disastrous policies. In January of this year, I also delivered on my promise to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement by signing into law the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which will create nearly 600,000 new jobs--including 76,000 in the auto industry alone--and spur up to $235 billion in new economic activity for our country. In recent months, the vital importance of our Nation's manufacturing sector to the strength, security, and resilience of our country has become abundantly clear. Since the arrival of the coronavirus from China, the health [[Page 216]] and safety of the American people has depended more than ever on American manufacturing for essential goods and medical supplies. To help facilitate the delivery of essential supplies and goods, I invoked the Defense Production Act and related authorities more than 100 times since March to launch the greatest manufacturing mobilization since the Second World War, quickly focusing the might of American industry toward defeating the virus. Our manufacturers have delivered when they were needed most, working with Federal, State, and local government partners to produce more than 240 million N95 respirators, one billion surgical masks, 45 million face shields, 430 million gowns, and 28 billion gloves--in addition to continuing to keep grocery store shelves stocked and deliver other essential goods to the American people. The men and women who occupy manufacturing sector jobs have been and continue to be heroes in this effort, ensuring the strength of our supply chain and fueling our nationwide response to the virus. As our Nation continues to reopen, we know that our manufacturing sector is vital to our economic recovery. Already, we are seeing signs that a historic resurgence is well underway; we added 29,000 manufacturing jobs in August alone, the same month in which manufacturing activity reached a 19-month high. American workers have pioneered the greatest advancements in history, and they will overcome this latest challenge as well and continue to transform lives around the world. Today, as we celebrate National Manufacturing Day and our Nation's exceptional manufacturing heritage, let us resolve to expand American excellence in manufacturing into the future, securing our national prosperity for generations to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2, 2020, as National Manufacturing Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day to celebrate today's manufacturing and the U.S. manufacturers that make our communities strong. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10092 of October 3, 2020 Fire Prevention Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During Fire Prevention Week, we are reminded to keep doing our part to prevent fires before they tragically claim lives and destroy homes, businesses, and natural resources. Every American can play a role in raising awareness about preventing fires and taking simple precautions to help prevent fire-related deaths and injuries. We also commend our Nation's brave firefighters and emergency workers who risk their health and safety each day, and we solemnly remember those who gave their lives in service to [[Page 217]] protect Americans and our communities. This week, I encourage all Americans to take steps to prepare their family, property, and community on what to do before, during, and after a fire. This year, courageous firefighters and other brave Americans have confronted one of the worst fire seasons in our history. We have seen more than 43,500 wildfires, lost more than 10,000 buildings, and 35 people have tragically died. In the Western States, more than 30,000 firefighters--the largest deployment in history--have battled these fires, risking their lives for their fellow Americans' safety. My Administration is thankful for the assistance from our National Guard, Navy, Marine Corps, and international partners from Canada and Mexico to help end this devastation. This tragic fire season is another reminder of the importance of effective forest management, which can play a big role in helping prevent forest fires. Proactive steps such as cleaning forest floors to remove flammable limbs and leaves can help reduce the risk of large fires and improve the health of our Nation's forests. In 2020, I have approved more than 30 Stafford Act Declarations, including Fire Management Assistance Grants, to help multiple States stop fires, and we continue to encourage active forest management efforts throughout the country. This year, we also give special recognition to the many American firefighters who joined the valiant efforts of our Australian allies in fighting bushfires that killed hundreds of people and countless animals and destroyed thousands of homes. Tragically, three Americans perished in this courageous effort. These heroes, all veterans of the United States Armed Forces, embodied the very best of the American spirit in their desire to help others, and we will always honor their memory. Home fires are also a cause for significant concern. Cooking fires are one of the most common types of residential fires, and fires in the home can start easily if the right precautions are not taken. I recommend that Americans take active steps to protect themselves and their families at home, including by testing smoke alarms once a month and replacing them after 10 years, as recommended by the United States Fire Administration. Additionally, it is important to have a fire escape route in place so all are prepared for how to leave the home if a fire does occur. We can all do our part to prevent fires in and around our homes to protect the lives of our families and neighbors. Throughout this Fire Prevention Week, we come together to recognize the threat posed by fire, honor the lives it claims each year, and recommit to preventing fires in our homes, businesses, and across this great Nation's wildlands. I encourage all Americans to reduce fire deaths, injuries, and property loss through prudent preparation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 4 through October 10, 2020, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 4, 2020, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences. [[Page 218]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10093 of October 3, 2020 Made in America Day and Made in America Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The ``Made in America'' stamp stands for excellence in craftsmanship. It is a testament to the expertise of our millions of inventors, craftsmen, tradesmen, and laborers who make up the most skilled, innovative, and dedicated workforce in the world. On Made in America Day, and throughout Made in America Week, we commend these hardworking men and women and recommit ourselves to strengthening American manufacturing as we rebuild the greatest economy in our Nation's history for a second time. For too long, politicians failed to recognize the critical importance of using American labor to make American goods, so that the profits and jobs stay here at home. They enabled American companies to ship their jobs overseas and sat by while foreign companies ripped off our products. They fostered in our country a dangerous reliance on foreign countries while neglecting American workers and American families. These days are over. Under my Administration, these forgotten men and women are forgotten no longer. I pledged to always put American workers first, and as President, I have delivered on that promise, vigorously implementing trade and manufacturing policies that encourage the building, creating, and growing of more products right here at home. As a result, we are creating jobs, improving lives, and strengthening our families, our neighbors, and our Nation. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed the profound failures of past trade and manufacturing policies. It has never been clearer that foreign dependence is not only the antithesis of the American spirit, but it also endangers our national security in times of crisis. To ensure domestic resilience moving forward, my Administration has renegotiated international trade agreements and enacted manufacturing policies that encourage buying American and hiring American like never before. Earlier this year, the landmark United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement took effect--reopening factories, bringing home hundreds of thousands of jobs, and reasserting America's manufacturing might. I have also signed Executive Orders that strengthen production standards under the Buy American Act and ensure the Federal Government maximizes its use of American-made products. As our Nation continues to reopen our economy, I call on businesses to sign our Pledge to America's Workers. The programs involved will be essential to getting Americans back to work by educating, training, and reskilling workers of all ages. More businesses taking the Pledge will further our economic comeback and ensure we regain the strides we had made under my Administration. [[Page 219]] ``Made in America'' is not a slogan. It is a solemn pledge. It is the foundation of our renewed success. On every front, my Administration will continue to fight for American workers, American jobs, and American businesses to ensure prosperity today and for America's future generations. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 5, 2020, as Made in America Day and this week, October 4 through October 10, 2020, as Made in America Week. I call upon all Americans to pay special tribute to builders, ranchers, crafters, entrepreneurs, and all those who work with their hands every day to make America great. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10094 of October 3, 2020 Child Health Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Children are one of life's greatest blessings. They bring boundless joy to families and enrich our communities. On Child Health Day, we are reminded of our solemn obligation to love and protect these precious lives, and we recommit to helping America's youth reach their full potential. Our Nation is home to the greatest doctors and medical professionals in the world, and yet, the health of too many American children is compromised at the earliest stages of life. To end this tragedy, my Administration is taking action to empower doctors and families so that children thrive at every stage of development. To reduce the rate of infant death, we have invested more than $100 million in the Healthy Start initiative, which particularly targets minority communities. We have also updated and improved clinical guidelines that healthcare professionals use for prenatal checkups, leading to safer births and healthier babies. As President, and as a father and grandfather, I will continue to work to ensure that every American family has the ability to raise healthy children, regardless of their income, education, or racial or ethnic background. It is also vitally important to safeguard the mental, spiritual, and physical health of our children as they grow up. To this end, the First Lady launched her BE BEST initiative in 2018, an effort that has promoted whole-of-person wellness for children since its inception. BE BEST encourages character development and respect for others and provides education, awareness, and coping skills to help youth navigate issues they may face, including online safety and opioid and drug misuse. The positive habits encouraged by the BE BEST program have and will continue to develop future leaders, strengthening our Nation and affecting positive change in communities throughout the United States. [[Page 220]] This year, we also celebrate 10 years of success in the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program, which helps prevent child neglect and provides families with the tools they need to raise children who are physically, socially, and emotionally healthy. The First Lady and I recognize the importance of creating a healthy environment in which to raise a child, and my Administration will always support children in need. In recent months, we have also seen the effects of the coronavirus on the health of our Nation's children. While children are at a very low risk from the coronavirus itself, lockdowns and school closures pose significant risks to the health and wellbeing of our young people. My Administration recognizes that extended school closures cause students to fall behind academically and can have devastating effects on the long-term prospects for school-aged children. Many children, especially those from low-income and minority communities, rely on schools for resources that they do not have access to when schools are closed. Schools provide meals, counseling, physical activity, social interaction, and other experiences that play a crucial role in the development of our young people. For these reasons, lockdowns and school closures can often pose a greater risk to children than the coronavirus, and we must take action to both empower parents and students to take control of their education and equip teachers to best ensure the wellbeing of their students. In recognition of the vital role schools play in the health of our Nation's children, my Administration has taken aggressive action to help our schools open safely. The bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which I signed into law in March, designates $750 million--in addition to the $10.6 billion already appropriated--in funding to the Head Start and Early Head Start programs, which help prepare low-income children for kindergarten. Furthermore, we have provided school districts with $25 billion for personal protective equipment and other resources to lower the risk of the spread of coronavirus, and I have called on the Congress to provide an additional $105 billion toward this effort. We have also provided every State with revolutionary point-of-care tests that deliver results in under 15 minutes. In preparation for the imminent delivery of a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine, last month I also directed the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act which allows State-licensed pharmacy professionals to administer vaccines to individuals ages three and older. This action will greatly expand vaccine access, especially among children, and will expedite our ongoing recovery effort. As one Nation, we will continue our push to safely reopen while also protecting the most vulnerable among us. Our Nation's children are the hope and promise of our future. Parents, educators, clergy members, mentors, and community volunteers all influence and shape the lives of young people. On this Child Health Day, let us renew our commitment to the vital role we all share in raising, nurturing, protecting, empowering, and encouraging America's youth so that they may enjoy healthy, happy, and fulfilled lives. [[Page 221]] The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation in observance of this day. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 5, 2020, as Child Health Day. I call upon families, child health professionals, faith-based and community organizations, and governments to help ensure that America's children stay safe and healthy. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10095 of October 5, 2020 German-American Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Since our founding, German-Americans have been central to our progress as a Nation. Industrious and faithful early German immigrants came to our shores to fulfill dreams of economic opportunity and to live out their faith free from government interference. These men and women established families and built livelihoods, exhibiting virtues that helped form our unique American ethos and passing down traditions that continue to shape our cultural identity. Today, on German-American Day, we commemorate the extraordinary contributions of German-Americans to our country, and we pay tribute to the more than 43 million Americans who, like myself, claim German heritage. The story of German-Americans is embedded in the most sacred chapters of American lore. When members of the first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia to forge a future of freedom on this continent, they walked down streets brimming with German businesses. Their deliberations were diligently reported in German-language broadsides and rigorously debated in German-owned coffeehouses. On July 4, 1776, when the Founding Fathers declared our independence, a German-language newspaper was the first to break the news to the new Nation. The next day, the streets were flooded with German translations of Thomas Jefferson's revolutionary words proclaiming that ``all men are created equal.'' Ever since, Americans of German descent have left their mark on our history. German influence played a large role in establishing our unyielding commitment to universal public education. It was a German- American, Margarethe Meyer Schurz, who opened the first kindergarten in America. German-Americans helped champion physical education and built the first gymnasiums for school buildings, positively affecting the physical health of our schoolchildren. German-Americans also introduced vocational training [[Page 222]] in public schools, providing new avenues for economic empowerment for young people and fueling American prosperity. Over the years, German customs have also become infused into American culture. Our cherished Christmas and Easter traditions are influenced by practices of early German arrivals. At Christmastime, we draw on German culture when we decorate Christmas trees and exchange gifts. During Easter, we have German immigrants to thank for our Easter egg hunts. These traditionally German customs have become staples of American culture and continue to unite Americans of all backgrounds. This month also marks the 30th anniversary of German reunification following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November of 1989. This historic moment marked a triumph for democracy and paved the way for a more free and open Europe. As we celebrate the many contributions of German- Americans to our country, we also celebrate our strong transatlantic ties with Germany and recommit to working together to forge a brighter future for both our nations and the world. Today, we celebrate the societal achievements and cultural contributions of all German-Americans and reflect on the hardworking and efficient spirit that they have imbued in our national character. From engineers and doctors to bakers and inventors, they have strengthened our economy and enriched our communities. Thanks in part to their dedication and hard work, our country remains a shining beacon of freedom and prosperity. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2020, as German-American Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of German Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10096 of October 6, 2020 Birthday of Founding Father Caesar Rodney By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Today is the 292nd birthday of Founding Father Caesar Rodney. Rodney was a soldier, a sheriff, a justice on the Delaware Supreme Court, a delegate from Delaware to the Continental Congress, a Brigadier General in the Continental Army, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He is an American legend. Rodney rode into American history when, despite suffering from cancer and asthma, he traveled 80 miles overnight from Dover to Philadelphia through a raging thunderstorm in time to cast Delaware's deciding vote for [[Page 223]] independence on July 2, 1776. His heroic act helped ensure that the Declaration of Independence would be passed unanimously. Upon entering Independence Hall, Rodney is said to have uttered these words: ``As I believe the voice of my constituents and all sensible and honest men is in favor of independence, and as my own judgment concurs with them, I give my vote for independence.'' Rodney was not just a Founding Father, he was a fighter for American freedom, serving under the command of General George Washington at Trenton during the Revolution. Washington bestowed his ``sincerest thanks'' for Rodney's service, commending his character as deserving of the ``highest honor'' and describing his devotion to the American cause as ``the most distinguished.'' After the Revolution, Rodney continued to fight through cancer and serve the State of Delaware as Speaker of the Upper House of its General Assembly. As the years went by, Rodney's cancer grew worse. Finally, he became so weak that he could not travel to participate in the legislative session. But Rodney's presence was so significant and his statesmanship was so revered by his fellow colleagues that they would not proceed without him and voted to meet at Rodney's own home so that he could still lead them from his bed. For more than two centuries, Delaware honored the patriotism and sacrifice of Caesar Rodney. In 1934, Delaware donated a statue of Caesar Rodney holding the Declaration of Independence to the United States Capitol. In 1976, the State issued a postage stamp commemorating Caesar Rodney to celebrate the bicentennial, and the Delaware Bicentennial Commission published an entire history of Rodney's life, proclaiming him ``Delaware's hero for all times and all seasons,'' ``the patron saint of his native state,'' and ``Delaware's principal hero of the American Revolutionary War.'' The 1999 State Quarter of Delaware bears Caesar Rodney's image. At the University of Delaware, students live in Caesar Rodney Residence Hall. Boy Scouts in Delaware travel the historic Caesar Rodney Trail. Each year, Delaware residents participate in the Caesar Rodney Half Marathon and 5K. In Camden, both the High School and School District are named after Caesar Rodney, and one can drive down Caesar Rodney Avenue. Even the Federal Government has taken action to preserve the memory of Caesar Rodney and honor the history of Rodney's ride for independence. In 2013, President Obama designated the First State National Monument in Delaware, which protected as an object of ``historic interest'' the very assembly room where Caesar Rodney introduced a bill to prohibit the importation of slaves into Delaware and where Rodney presided as Speaker when the Delaware Assembly declared independence from the British Crown in 1776. At the First State National Monument, park officials tell the story of Caesar Rodney's 18-hour ride through severe storms to vote for the Declaration of Independence. But today, the memory and remarkable history of Caesar Rodney's midnight ride is at risk of being erased forever. In the center of downtown Wilmington, Delaware is Rodney Square, named after Caesar Rodney. Until recently, a majestic equestrian statue of Caesar Rodney riding to Philadelphia had stood there for nearly a century. In 2011, Rodney Square and the Caesar Rodney Equestrian Statue were placed on the National Register of Historic Places after the State of Delaware nominated them for the honor. The [[Page 224]] nomination notes that, at the time of its design, the Caesar Rodney Equestrian Statue was ``considered by many sculptors to be one of the most beautiful equestrian statues in the world.'' But, on June 12, 2020, the Caesar Rodney Equestrian Statue was removed as part of an ongoing, radical purge of America's founding generation. The empty pedestal in Rodney Square in Wilmington is the end result of an extreme anti-American historical revisionism propagated by organizations like the New York Times and its 1619 Project, critical race theorists on college campuses, cancel culture adherents in corporate boardrooms, and flag-burning mobs on city streets who seek to reframe our Nation's history around the idea that the United States is not an exceptional country but an evil one. Caesar Rodney is an early casualty of these reckless ``re-education'' attempts that, if allowed to progress, will erase the names of every one of the heroes of 1776 from American memory and blot out their noble legacy from the history books. The students of Howard Zinn and the 1619 Project have already pledged to remove the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument next. If Caesar Rodney cannot be defended, then there is no principle by which the other signers of the Declaration can be shielded from similar eradication. Radicals will continue their efforts to tear down our Founding Fathers until Americans demand that it stop and demand that the truth of American history be once again taught in our schools. That is why, on Constitution Day, I announced the creation of a new national commission to promote patriotic education. The ``1776 Commission'' will champion efforts to teach the truth about America's heroic founding and make plans to honor the 250th anniversary of the American founding. At the White House Conference on American History, I also announced that a statue of Caesar Rodney would be added to the National Garden of American Heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. As I said this past Constitution Day, ``America will give this Founding Father, this very brave man, who was so horribly treated, the place of honor he deserves.'' Today, we celebrate the life and legacy of a patriot who rode as hard and as fast as he could to pledge his life, his fortune, and his sacred honor to the cause of American Independence and American Freedom. On Caesar Rodney's 292nd birthday, I proclaim that his name will never be forgotten or removed from the record of history and his heroic ride for independence will be honored, preserved, and remembered for centuries to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7, 2020, as the 292nd Anniversary of the birth of Caesar Rodney. I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches and customary places of meeting with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the birth of Caesar Rodney. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 225]] Proclamation 10097 of October 8, 2020 Leif Erikson Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation More than 1,000 years ago, the Norse explorer and Viking Leif Erikson made landfall in modern-day Newfoundland, likely becoming the first European to discover the New World. Today, Leif Erikson represents over a millennium of shared history between the Nordic countries and the Americas and symbolizes the many contributions of Nordic Americans to our great Nation. Accomplished in the face of daunting danger and carried out in service of Judeo-Christian values, Leif Erikson's story reflects the fundamental truths about the American character. On a mission to evangelize Greenland, Leif Erikson and his crew were blown off course. They had to brave the cold waters of the northern Atlantic to find safe harbor on the North American coastline. In surviving this ordeal, these hardened Vikings tested the limits of human exploration in a way that continues to inspire us today. In 1825, six Norwegian families repeated this voyage, landing their sloop in New York Harbor in the first organized migration to the United States from Scandinavia. Like the Puritans and pilgrims before them, these people came to our Nation seeking religious freedom and safety from persecution. Now, more than 11 million Americans can trace their roots to Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, and among them stand Nobel Laureates, Academy Award winners, and Legion of Merit recipients. Across our Nation, from the Danish villages of western Iowa to the Norwegian Ridge in Minnesota and the Finns of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Nordic Americans have left their mark on our culture, economy, and society. Nordic countries remain strong economic partners and military allies of our Nation. They each hold important roles in the Arctic Council, facilitating cooperation on economic development, environmental conservation, and indigenous rights. As North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allies and partners, all five Nordic countries greatly contribute to the peace and stability of the transatlantic community and the entire world. The United States greatly values their continued friendship. On Leif Erikson Day, we celebrate Nordic Americans whose firm faith and resolve are woven into the fabric of our Nation, and we commit to continuing our strong diplomatic relationship with Scandinavian nations for years to come. To honor Leif Erikson, son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, and to celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2020, as Leif Erikson Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the contributions of [[Page 226]] Nordic Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10098 of October 9, 2020 National School Lunch Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National School Lunch Week, we celebrate our Nation's commitment to providing nutritious food to millions of students, and we recognize the many dedicated food service professionals and administrators who help carry out this mission. In a typical year, the National School Lunch Program provides meals to nearly 30 million schoolchildren every day across the country. These meals enable students in need to eat nutritious meals, which helps them achieve academic success and reach their full potential. The National School Lunch Program succeeds because of the strong partnerships between the Federal Government and State governments, food service professionals, and local school leaders. Our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and producers are also essential to providing the food our children eat. Since this program was established in 1946, the collaboration between these key players has been vital to its success, and their cooperation has never been more crucial than during this pivotal time in our Nation's history. In recent months, it has become increasingly evident just how many families depend on the meals provided at school. As thousands of schools transitioned to remote learning in response to the coronavirus pandemic, I signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to ensure schools could continue serving children the meals they need. My Administration also launched the innovative public-private partnership ``Meals to You'' which delivered more than 40 million nutritious meals to children in rural areas while schools were closed. In the battle with this invisible enemy, resilience and flexibility have been critical to keeping our children safe and fed, and we are thankful for the extra efforts that have been made to achieve this goal. Throughout the last few months, my Administration has recognized that our children's well-being depends so much on their access to schools. I have encouraged all schools to safely reopen, and we want to ensure that they are as prepared as ever to provide healthy meals to all students. In June, my Administration invested in the health of students by awarding more than $12.1 million--a record amount--in Farm to School Grants. These funds will help bring clean, fresh, and locally-grown foods into schools and communities as they reopen, and will help foster economic opportunity for America's farmers as we continue our economic comeback. [[Page 227]] Additionally, on October 9, my Administration extended flexibilities and waived requirements to continue operating the summer meals program and the seamless summer option at no cost until the end of the school year. This program allows any child under 18 to get a free meal at a meal distribution site, and allows parents and guardians to pick up meals for their children. We are proud of these measures and others that we have taken to help ensure that all students have access to nutritious food. To emphasize the importance of the National School Lunch Program, the Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in October each year as ``National School Lunch Week'' and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11 through October 17, 2020, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join the countless individuals who administer the National School Lunch Program in activities that support and promote awareness of the health and well-being of our Nation's children. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10099 of October 9, 2020 General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The life of the Polish-American hero General Casimir Pulaski is a testament to our Nation's ideals and a paragon of the cause of human freedom. General Pulaski's devotion to country--and the shared values upon which our Nation and Poland were both founded--accentuates our common commitment to liberty. On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we honor and celebrate his courage and expertise in the Revolutionary War, which helped found a Nation conceived in the ideals he held most dearly. General Pulaski was a military leader renowned for his bravery and tactical acumen. In Poland, he fought valiantly in defense of his country's sovereignty and against the scourge of foreign tyranny. In 1777, recognizing our burgeoning Nation's cause, Pulaski eagerly joined General George Washington's Continental Army upon the recommendation of Benjamin Franklin. Pulaski spent the next 2 years in service to America and its battle for self-determination and liberty. Throughout his time in the Continental Army, General Pulaski distinguished himself as a military leader of tactical brilliance and tremendous [[Page 228]] valor. At the Battle of Brandywine, he famously saved General Washington's life, who later promoted him to Brigadier General and gave him command of a cavalry division. Dubbed the ``Pulaski Legion'' his division played a key role in the fight for American Independence. Tragically, though, the ``Father of the American Cavalry'' was mortally wounded while leading his men during the Battle of Savannah in October of 1779. General Pulaski once wrote to General Washington: ``I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it'' General Pulaski's ultimate sacrifice for a young Nation that was not his own illustrates what is still true today--America is the shining city on a hill and a symbol of freedom and opportunity for the entire world. The United States of America is more than a name to rally around; it is the land of a people committed to universal values that inspired a young Polish soldier to fight over 200 years ago, thousands of miles from his place of birth, and it continues to inspire freedom-loving people near and far. As I told the Polish people during a trip to Warsaw in my first year in office, the United States and Poland share a special bond forged by unique histories and national characters, and a fellowship that exists only among people who have fought and bled and died for freedom. As we join together in celebration of General Pulaski's commitment to the cause of liberty, we reaffirm the enduring bond between our Nation and his native Poland. His legacy, carried in the hearts of nearly 10 million Polish Americans, will forever be etched into the great American story. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2020, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate on this occasion those who have contributed to the furthering of our Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10100 of October 9, 2020 Columbus Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation More than 500 years ago, Christopher Columbus's intrepid voyage to the New World ushered in a new era of exploration and discovery. His travels led to European contact with the Americas and, a century later, the first settlements on the shores of the modern day United States. Today, we celebrate Columbus Day to commemorate the great Italian who opened a new chapter in world history and to appreciate his enduring significance to the Western Hemisphere. When Christopher Columbus and his crew sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on the Ni[ntilde]a, Pinta, and Santa Mar[iacute]a it marked the beginning of a new era [[Page 229]] in human history. For Italian Americans, Christopher Columbus represents one of the first of many immeasurable contributions of Italy to American history. As a native of Genoa, Columbus inspired early immigrants to carry forth their rich Italian heritage to the New World. Today, the United States benefits from the warmth and generosity of nearly 17 million Italian Americans, whose love of family and country strengthen the fabric of our Nation. For our beautiful Italian American communities--and Americans of every background--Columbus remains a legendary figure. Sadly, in recent years, radical activists have sought to undermine Christopher Columbus's legacy. These extremists seek to replace discussion of his vast contributions with talk of failings, his discoveries with atrocities, and his achievements with transgressions. Rather than learn from our history, this radical ideology and its adherents seek to revise it, deprive it of any splendor, and mark it as inherently sinister. They seek to squash any dissent from their orthodoxy. We must not give in to these tactics or consent to such a bleak view of our history. We must teach future generations about our storied heritage, starting with the protection of monuments to our intrepid heroes like Columbus. This June, I signed an Executive Order to ensure that any person or group destroying or vandalizing a Federal monument, memorial, or statue is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I have also taken steps to ensure that we preserve our Nation's history and promote patriotic education. In July, I signed another Executive Order to build and rebuild monuments to iconic American figures in a National Garden of American Heroes. In September, I announced the creation of the 1776 Commission, which will encourage our educators to teach our children about the miracle of American history and honor our founding. In addition, last month I signed an Executive Order to root out the teaching of racially divisive concepts from the Federal workplace, many of which are grounded in the same type of revisionist history that is trying to erase Christopher Columbus from our national heritage. Together, we must safeguard our history and stop this new wave of iconoclasm by standing against those who spread hate and division. On this Columbus Day, we embrace the same optimism that led Christopher Columbus to discover the New World. We inherit that optimism, along with the legacy of American heroes who blazed the trails, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, and built the single-greatest nation the world has ever seen. In commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as ``Columbus Day'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 12, 2020, as Columbus Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation. [[Page 230]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10101 of October 10, 2020 To Further Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products) By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2253), I issued Proclamation 9693, which imposed a safeguard measure for a period of 4 years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.6025 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) and an increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding the TRQ and imports of other CSPV products, including modules provided for in subheading 8541.40.6015 of the HTS. I exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard measure. 2. On February 7, 2020, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) issued its report pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)), on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (ITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Monitoring)). In its report, the ITC found that, following imposition of the safeguard measure, prices for CSPV cells and modules declined in a manner consistent with historical trends but were higher than they would have been without the safeguard measure. 3. With respect to CSPV cells, the ITC found that imports increased following imposition of the safeguard measure and that major domestic CSPV cell producers ceased production, leading to declines in domestic CSPV cell production capacity and production. 4. With respect to CSPV modules, imports initially declined but rose in the first half of 2019 compared with the first half of 2018. Additionally, the ITC found that multiple CSPV module producers opened production facilities in the United States, particularly in the first half of 2019, leading to increases in domestic CSPV module production capacity, production, and market share. 5. On March 6, 2020, the ITC issued an additional report pursuant to a request from the United States Trade Representative under section 204(a)(4) [[Page 231]] of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(4)), regarding the probable economic effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of modifying the safeguard measure to increase the level of the TRQ on CSPV cells from the current 2.5 gigawatts (GW) to 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 GW (ITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Advice on the Probable Economic Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No. TA-201-075 (Modification)). In its report, the ITC advised that increasing the TRQ would help to continue growth in solar module production but that expanded access to imported cells not subject to safeguard duties would put downward pressure on prices for United States cells. 6. The ITC also found that the exclusion of bifacial modules from the safeguard measure will likely result in substantial increases in imports of bifacial modules if such exclusion remains in effect, and that such modules will likely compete with domestically produced CSPV products in the United States market. Furthermore, the ITC found that the benefits to domestic CSPV module producers from an increase in the TRQ would likely be limited if the bifacial module exclusion remained in place. According to the ITC, bifacial modules are likely to account for a greater share of the market in the future and can substitute for monofacial products in the various market segments, such that exempting imports of bifacial modules from the safeguard tariff would apply significant downward pressure on prices of domestically produced CSPV modules. 7. Section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, upon petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry, to reduce, modify, or terminate an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act when the President determines that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition. 8. Section 204(c)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)(1)) authorizes the President to request that the ITC investigate whether action under section 203 of the Trade Act continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and whether there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. Section 204(c)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)(3)) establishes the date by which the ITC will transmit the report on its investigation, unless the President specifies a different date. 9. After taking into account the information provided in the ITC's reports, and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to each of the following modifications, I have determined that the domestic industry has begun to make positive adjustment to import competition, shown by the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and market share. In addition, I have made the following further determinations: (a) that the exclusion of bifacial panels from application of the safeguard tariff has impaired and is likely to continue to impair the effectiveness of the action I proclaimed in Proclamation 9693 in light of the increased imports of competing products such exclusion entails, and that it is necessary to revoke that exclusion and to apply the safeguard tariff to bifacial panels; (b) that the exclusion of bifacial panels from application of the safeguard tariffs has impaired the effectiveness of the 4-year action I proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, and that to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged [[Page 232]] for that action, it is necessary to adjust the duty rate of the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the safeguard measure to 18 percent. 10. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: (1) In order to modify the action applicable to imports of CSPV cells under HTS subheading 8541.40.6025 and other CSPV products such as modules under HTS subheading 8541.40.6015, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. (2) The United States Trade Representative is authorized to exercise my authority under section 204(c)(1) and (3) of the Trade Act to request that the ITC investigate whether action under section 203 of the Trade Act continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and whether there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition, and to specify a different date for the ITC to transmit its report. (3) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. (4) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including the Annex hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 15 days after the date of this proclamation, and shall continue in effect as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. One year from the termination of the safeguard measure established in this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in the Annex to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD October 14, 2020 Blind Americans Equality Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On Blind Americans Equality Day, we recognize the valuable contributions of our fellow Americans who are blind or visually impaired. These individuals enrich our national economy and culture through their determination, courage, and strength. Today, we reflect on the progress our Nation has made in removing barriers that have prevented the full participation of blind and visually impaired persons in our society, and we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to defending the inherent dignity of all Americans. This Blind Americans Equality Day is particularly notable as we mark the 100th anniversary of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program, which empowers individuals with disabilities to pursue competitive employment opportunities consistent with their abilities, interests, and strengths. Through the training and skills gained in the VR program, individuals who are blind or visually impaired can more readily enter the American workforce. We are also proud to celebrate this year the 45th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. These landmark pieces of legislation forever changed our society by protecting in law persons with disabilities against discrimination and further promoting their full inclusion in American life. Persons with visual impairments strengthen our communities with their skill and talent across a wide range of professions and industries. My Administration will continue to support programs that combat the stigmas that make it difficult for persons who are blind or visually impaired to find employment. I recently signed an Executive Order on Continuing the National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, which is strengthening powerful programs I established in 2018 and provides even more workers of all abilities with tools to secure sustained employment and economic self-sufficiency. By promoting the recruitment of underutilized populations, blind and visually impaired persons are among the direct beneficiaries from these initiatives. As we continue to reopen our economy, we also celebrate the success of the more than 1,800 small businesses operating under the Randolph-Sheppard Act of 1936, which facilitates the entrepreneurial aspirations of the blind and visually impaired. These efforts have helped individuals with disabilities to reach their full potential and achieve their dreams. By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628), the Congress authorized the President to designate October 15 of each year as ``White Cane Safety Day,'' now known as ``Blind Americans Equality Day,'' to recognize the contributions of Americans who are blind or have impaired vision. Today, and every day, we will continue our efforts to ensure and champion the full and active participation of all Americans, including blind or visually impaired Americans, in every facet of our society. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2020, as [[Page 235]] Blind Americans Equality Day, to celebrate and recognize the accomplishments and contributions of Americans who are blind or visually impaired. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to reaffirm our commitment to achieving equality for all Americans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10103 of October 16, 2020 National Character Counts Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The foundation of any free and virtuous society is the moral character of its people. Personal responsibility, integrity, and the other values which define our unique American spirit underpin our system of self- government and inspire us to continue working toward a more perfect Union. As we observe National Character Counts Week, we think of the special individuals in our lives who exemplify the character qualities to which we all aspire. In looking to these examples of honor and virtue, we recognize that character is a learned attribute acquired through consistent, purposeful action, not an inherent trait. We must resolve to build lives and communities grounded in moral clarity in order to strengthen ourselves, our families, our communities, and our Nation. From small acts of kindness to supreme selfless sacrifice, everyday heroes and larger-than-life American historical figures have deepened the roots of freedom of our Nation. Individuals of integrity and principle lift us all to greater heights, evincing the same core virtues in both the depths of adversity and the heights of success. We see this exemplified every day by the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who risk their lives to defend the cherished blessings of liberty we hold dear. We also see it every day in our communities from law enforcement professionals and first responders who devote their lives to the safety and well-being of others and face down danger. Community volunteers and faith organizations reveal the character of our Nation through their selfless giving of time and assistance to people in need. In places of learning, teachers and mentors build up our character by cultivating social and cultural awareness, intellectual curiosity, and a sense of responsibility in our future leaders. And in our homes, family members and loved ones offer compassion and guidance that also play a vital role in shaping our values. The inherent righteousness of America's moral character has perhaps never been needed more than in recent months as we have battled the coronavirus pandemic. In communities large and small throughout our country, acts of kindness have touched millions of individuals and families, uniting us under one common purpose to defeat the virus. Americans [[Page 236]] have selflessly supported their neighbors in need, delivering food and essential supplies to the most vulnerable and evincing a deep capacity for generosity and caring. Medical professionals have worked long hours at great personal risk to provide care to the sick and injured, and military personnel have mobilized to provide critical medical assistance and help keep us safe. Faith and community leaders have provided vital emotional support for those experiencing social isolation, and countless others have sacrificed to ease the burden on their family, friends, neighbors, and even complete strangers. This week, as we continue to unite as one Nation to both defeat the virus and safely reopen our country, we are reminded of how far decency and compassion can go in helping others during times of great challenge and uncertainty. Every opportunity to show consideration for another person is also an opportunity to build habits of kindness and strengthen our character. Our words and deeds leave imprints in our homes, schools, communities, and places of worship. Throughout this week, we recommit to being more kind, loving, understanding, and virtuous. Together, as one national family, we must serve others with giving and grateful hearts to ensure our Republic remains strong, vibrant, and a beacon of hope for future generations. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 18 through October 24, 2020, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10104 of October 16, 2020 National Forest Products Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation's magnificent forests are a source of commerce, recreation, and pride for all Americans. America's woodlands are capable of producing a myriad of products and materials that bolster our economy, improve our daily lives, supply our environment with clean air, and provide countless Americans an escape to hike and relax in a tranquil and picturesque setting. During National Forest Products Week, we appreciate the essential role forests and forest products play in our livelihood and prosperity, and we renew our commitment to maintaining these treasured woodlands for future generations. [[Page 237]] The forest industry adds nearly $300 billion annually to our Gross Domestic Product and employs almost one million Americans. To ensure this sector of our economy continues to flourish, my Administration is strengthening markets for wood products and incentivizing innovative manufacturing techniques. As a result of these efforts, the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service sold 3.3 billion board feet of timber from National Forests in fiscal year 2019--the highest output since 1997. In addition to bolstering rural economies, our foresters use science- based forest management practices in order to promote forest health and reduce wildfire risk. Over the past several months, our country has been particularly reminded of how devastating wildfires and natural disasters can be to our way of life and our economy. Throughout the western United States, wildfires have scorched and destroyed millions of acres of forest, and as a result of Hurricane Laura, the timber industry suffered an estimated $1.1 billion economic loss. This devastation has placed additional burdens on an essential industry that has been instrumental to our efforts to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, including by working to produce safer product packaging, like the wooden pallets used to deliver critical household items such as paper products, diapers, disinfecting wipes, medications, and mask filters. It is imperative that we safeguard our domestic supply of timber, provide economic security for our forest landowners, and maintain the viability of this critical aspect of our economy for the benefit of all Americans. A sound forest products industry produces positive environmental benefits as well. In order to further promote forest health and protect the environment, on January 21, 2020, I announced that the United States would be joining the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Trees initiative, an ambitious global effort to grow and conserve one trillion trees worldwide by 2030. Following through on my commitment, and given the expansive footprint of our Federal forests and woodlands, I signed an Executive Order to establish the United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council to further the Federal Government's participation in this effort. To complement these efforts, I have called for the passage of the bi-partisan REPLANT Act (S. 4357), which would help address the Forest Service's reforestation backlog and continued annual reforestation needs by removing the current $30 million annual funding cap for the Reforestation Trust Fund. This week, we recommit to bolstering the forest products industry and to continuing to appreciate the natural resources God has bestowed upon our country. Together with our Nation's foresters, we can preserve our beautiful forests for every American in order to secure a future of environmental and economic success now and for posterity. Recognizing the economic importance of the many products generated from our Nation's forests, the Congress, through enactment of Public Law 86- 753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 18 through October 24, 2020, as National Forest Products Week. I call upon all Americans [[Page 238]] to observe this week with appropriate observances and activities and to reaffirm our commitment to our Nation's forests and the products that they provide. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10105 of October 23, 2020 United Nations Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Today, on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations (UN), we celebrate its commitment to peace and security, prosperity, human rights, rule of law, and development. The victorious Allies conceived the UN in the ashes of two devastating world wars, welcoming all nations to join together to ensure peace and promote economic prosperity. As a founding member of the UN, which was chartered in San Francisco and is headquartered in New York, the United States remains dedicated to those noble UN purposes and principles. We also recognize that the successes of the UN and its specialized agencies were built on precepts that ensure its good functioning: independence, impartiality, good governance, accountability, and transparency. Because of our continuing belief in the UN's promise and our desire to see it be effective over the next 75 years, we are determined to make the UN more agile, effective, efficient, transparent, and accountable. These efforts will help the UN improve, adapt to crises, and reach its full potential. If the UN is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world, including terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug cartels, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities. The United States is forging a new path of unprecedented domestic and global prosperity, cooperation, and peace. Last month, I brokered historic peace deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and Bahrain, paving the way for broader peace in the Middle East. Known as the Abraham Accords, these diplomatic breakthroughs reflect the shared commitment of every well-intentioned member state to achieve tranquility in the region once and for all. Just today, the leaders of Sudan and Israel also agreed to the normalization of relations between their two countries. In response to Iran's nefarious actions, the United States withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, and re-imposed sanctions on the Iranian regime. In Europe, my Administration brokered a historic deal on Serbia-Kosovo economic normalization, accelerating economic growth and job creation opportunities. After more than 20 years of limited progress on political negotiations in the Balkans, the commitments made by President Vu[ccaron]i[cacute] and Prime Minister Hoti are the first steps in achieving long-term peace and stability in the region. The United States invites all fellow UN Security [[Page 239]] Council members to join in our country's efforts to promote liberty and freedom across the globe. The United States also encourages the international community to provide complete accountability, responsiveness, and transparency in sharing public health data as we fight the coronavirus pandemic. My Administration maintains that effective relief depends on global public health coordination and widespread access to medical information coupled with personal privacy and security protections. Our recent decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization underscores our firm commitment to hold governmental organizations accountable when they succumb to political influence and fail to uphold their core values. The Chinese Government has misled the international community since the outbreak in Wuhan, and the UN must join with the United States in holding China accountable for its actions. The United States recognizes the integral role the UN has played in the international system for 75 years and honors those who have nobly dedicated their lives to global humanitarian and peacekeeping missions and to setting the conditions for development and prosperity. We also note with great satisfaction the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Whole Food Program, which the United States has supported more generously than any other member state since 1961. The United States proudly remains the largest and most reliable supporter of the UN and its founding principles. It is in that spirit that we call on all nations to join the United States in working to ensure the UN continues to live up to its noble ideals of liberty, prosperity, and the pursuit of world peace. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2020, as United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10106 of October 27, 2020 Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of [[Page 240]] the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Canada on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada. In particular, the United States agreed on a range of measures with Canada that were expected to allow imports of aluminum from Canada to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary's report. These included measures to monitor for and avoid import surges. 4. In light of this agreement, I determined that, under the framework in the agreement established with Canada, imports of aluminum from Canada would no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I decided to exclude Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. I noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, and that I may revisit this determination as appropriate. 5. In Proclamation 10060 of August 6, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada had increased substantially following my decision to exclude, on a long-term basis, Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. I further noted that this surge in imports coincided with a decrease in imports of these articles from other countries and threatened to harm domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization. In light of these circumstances, I determined that it was necessary and appropriate to re-impose the 10 percent ad valorem tariff proclaimed [[Page 241]] in Proclamation 9704, as amended, on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada. 6. The United States has held consultations with Canada regarding exports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada to the United States. On the basis of these consultations, the United States expects that exports of these articles from Canada to the United States will decrease significantly in the remaining months of 2020, from a monthly average of approximately 154,000 metric tons in the first 7 months of this year to a monthly average of approximately 77,000 tons in September through December. This 50 percent decrease in the volume would reduce United States imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada to a level below the average of monthly imports of these articles from Canada in any calendar year in the past decade, thus alleviating the threatened harm to domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization posed by the previous surge in imports of these articles. 7. In light of these changed circumstances, and in view of the measures previously agreed upon with Canada to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada, as described in Proclamation 9893, I have determined that imports of aluminum from Canada will no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I have decided to reinstate Canada's exclusion from the tariff on these articles proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. As specified in this proclamation, I may re-impose the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada in the event that the volume of imports of these articles from Canada in the remaining months of 2020 exceeds the quantities that the United States expects will be exported from Canada to the United States during this period. The United States and Canada expect to hold further consultations in December 2020 to discuss the state of aluminum trade between the two countries in light of trade patterns in the last 4 months of 2020 and expected market conditions in 2021. 8. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, as described in Proclamation 9893, both with respect to imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum and imports of other aluminum articles. 9. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: [[Page 242]] (1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting ``and'' before ``(f)'' and inserting before the period at the end: ``, and (g) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico.''. (2) In order to establish the removal of the additional duty rate on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. (3) The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall continue to monitor imports of aluminum articles, in particular imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada. In the event that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada exceed 105 percent of the volumes set forth below for any month, I will consider re-imposing the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of these articles from Canada, which may include retroactive application to articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020. The volumes are: 83,000,000 kilograms for September 2020; 70,000,000 kilograms for October 2020; 83,000,000 kilograms for November 2020; and 70,000,000 kilograms for December 2020. In the event that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada exceed 105 percent of the volumes above for any month, I may consider whether the volume stipulated for the following month is reduced by the amount of the excess in making my determination whether to re-impose the tariff. I may also consider re-imposing the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of these articles from Canada based on the outcome of consultations between the United States and Canada in December 2020 and expected market conditions in 2021. (4) The modifications made by clause 1 of this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. (5) Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada provided for in subheading 7601.10, except any articles that are eligible for admission under ``domestic status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, that are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, shall continue to be admitted only as ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and shall not be subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date to the duty treatment provided for in heading 9903.85.21, unless and until heading 9903.85.21 becomes applicable to these articles. Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada provided for in subheading 7601.10, admitted into a United States foreign trade zone before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, under ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, shall remain subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amended. [[Page 243]] (6) In the event that I decide, as described in clause 3 of this proclamation, to re-impose the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, including possible retroactive application of the tariff, no drawback shall be available with respect to such duties imposed. (7) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD 30, 2020 To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences and for Other Purposes By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. In Executive Order 11844 of March 24, 1975, the President designated Thailand as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.). 2. Sections 502(d)(1) and 503(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)(1) and 2463(c)(1)) provide that the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP with respect to any beneficiary developing country and any article upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)). 3. Section 502(c)(4) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(4)) provides that, in determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP, the President shall take into account the extent to which such country has assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets and basic commodity resources of such country and the extent to which such country has assured the United States that it will refrain from engaging in unreasonable export practices. 4. Pursuant to sections 502(d)(1) and 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), including in particular section 502(c)(4), I have determined that Thailand has not assured the United States that Thailand will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. Accordingly, it is appropriate to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand, effective on December 30, 2020. 5. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment accorded to specified articles under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. 6. Section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) subjects beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub- Saharan African countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), to competitive need limitations on the duty-free treatment afforded to eligible articles under the GSP. 7. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that in 2019 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations. I hereby terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries. [[Page 246]] 8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have determined to withdraw the application of the duty-free treatment accorded to a certain article. 9. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the President may, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (the ``Commission''), designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP when they are imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. 10. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act, and having received advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate a certain article as an eligible article when it is imported from beneficiary developing countries. 11. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides that the President may disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of any such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed the amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)). 12. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. 13. The short-form name of ``Macedonia'' has changed to ``North Macedonia,'' and I have determined that additional U.S. note 6 to Chapter 20 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) should be modified to reflect this change. 14. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do hereby proclaim that: (1) The duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand is suspended, effective on December 30, 2020. (2) In order to reflect in the HTS this suspension of certain benefits under the GSP with respect to Thailand, general note 4(d) and pertinent subheadings of the HTS are modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation. [[Page 247]] (3) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1- Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings and general note 4(d) to the HTS are modified as set forth in sections A, B, and C of Annex II to this proclamation. (4) In order to withdraw the application of duty-free treatment accorded to one eligible article for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheading is modified as set forth in section D of Annex II to this proclamation. (5) In order to designate a certain article as an eligible article when imported from a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special column for the corresponding HTS subheading is modified as set forth in section E of Annex II to this proclamation. (6) The competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act is disregarded with respect to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex III to this proclamation. (7) In order to reflect the change in the name of Macedonia, U.S. note 6 to chapter 20 of the HTS is modified by deleting ``Macedonia'' and inserting ``North Macedonia'' in alphabetical order. (8) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex II and Annex III of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on November 1, 2020. (9) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD October 30, 2020 Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Critical infrastructure provides the foundation for our national security and prosperity. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we renew our commitment to protecting and securing our Nation's essential systems for food and water, healthcare and public health, electric power supplies, emergency services, telecommunications, transportation, government and banking services, the administration of elections, and beyond. These vital functions and services are powered by a broad ecosystem of critical infrastructure assets, systems, networks, and workers, and underpin our American way of life. While advances in technology have enhanced the safety, security, and comprehensive integration of our Nation's critical infrastructure, vulnerabilities still exist, particularly those that can be exploited by cyber adversaries. Manipulation of our data networks can interfere with healthcare, financial, and government services. Interruption of the electric power grid can disrupt water and food supplies, telecommunications, manufacturing, and transportation. Our Nation relies on these complex and interdependent networks to sustain our economic growth and ensure public health and security. To coordinate our security and resilience efforts and protect our critical infrastructure now and in the future, I signed into law the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Act of 2018. CISA works with businesses, communities, and government to help make the Nation's critical infrastructure more resilient to cyber and physical threats. From the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, CISA has released guidance to promote the health and safety of our Nation's essential workforce and provided critical information to assist owners and operators in categorizing risk, identifying opportunities for remote work, determining the criticality of specific roles, and deciding the allocation of resources, such as personal protective equipment and medical testing. Additionally, my Administration has further advanced and strengthened the security and resilience of our critical infrastructure throughout the pandemic. In February, I signed an Executive Order on Strengthening National Resilience through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services to prevent any efforts to disrupt or manipulate PNT services, such as the Global Positioning System, from being undermined. In March, I signed the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 and issued the National Strategy to Secure 5G to ensure the security, reliability, and trustworthiness of America's communications networks. In May, I signed an Executive Order on Securing the United States Bulk-Power System to prevent foreign actors from creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in bulk-power system electric equipment. In August, I signed an Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made in the United States to reduce our dependence on foreign chemical and medical supply chains and promote American-made production of essential medicines. And in September [[Page 257]] and October, my Administration completed implementation of a Presidential Memorandum on Promoting the Reliable Supply and Delivery of Water in the West, and I signed an Executive Order on Modernizing America's Water Resource Management and Water Infrastructure. Both of these actions ensure that Americans have abundant, safe, and reliable supplies of water and world-class water infrastructure to support our economy. These actions and many more, like restocking personal protective equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile, will ensure our national self-sufficiency and security for our children, grandchildren, and generations to come. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to staying alert and continuously adapting to evolving threats and hazards, promoting the security of all critical infrastructure systems, and boosting resilience to potential disruptions, in partnership with State, local, Tribal, and private organizations. We thank the incredible workers who are on the frontlines night and day to sustain our vital systems, functions, and services, and we recognize that each and every American can help protect and strengthen our country's critical infrastructure. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. I call on the people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's infrastructure and to observe this month with appropriate measures to enhance our national security and resilience. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10109 of October 30, 2020 National Adoption Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation For children, parents, and families, adoption paves the way for new beginnings and provides children with a forever family who can help them reach their full potential. During National Adoption Month, we recognize birth families who make the difficult decision to place their children up for adoption, commend foster parents who care for children from different backgrounds, and celebrate adoptive parents who open their families to those children in need. All children deserve a stable home with parents and families who can ensure their well-being. Sadly, last year, 153,258 children were placed in the foster care system due to neglect, and 86,694 children were removed from their homes due to drug abuse. My Administration is committed to addressing the causes of child abuse and neglect, bringing healing to families [[Page 258]] who are struggling with addiction, and expanding the avenues for adoption. Additionally, we are continuing our efforts to strengthen families and prevent abuse and neglect to help ensure that children are able to remain with birth parents whenever possible. These efforts include unprecedented action to end the opioid crisis in our country, increased funding and oversight of the foster care system, and opening more adoption channels to faith-based adoption and foster care providers. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services is now providing States with guidance regarding the use of Federal funds to support the legal representation of parents and children in family legal proceedings. The good news is that the number of children entering foster care is declining and the number of adoptions last year was the highest on record. Nevertheless, those still in the foster care system often have to wait too long for adoption--sometimes 2 years or more. Even worse, thousands of children age out of foster care without finding a forever family, with profound and unacceptable consequences. Of those young Americans who age out of foster care, 40 percent experience homelessness, 50 percent are unemployed at age 24, and 25 percent experience post- traumatic stress. To help solve this problem, in June, I signed an Executive Order on Strengthening the Child Welfare System for America's Children. This order prioritizes the partnerships between private, public, and faith-based organizations to keep American families together and, when that is not possible, to find children forever families. It also provides resources for trauma training, support for guardianship, and kinship care for those who age out of foster care. Additionally, through her ``Be Best'' initiative, the First Lady continues to advocate for a safe, forever family for every child. Adoption also offers a loving option for women who experience unexpected pregnancies or are unable to provide for their children. Every year, countless families--including many who cannot have children of their own--cherish the priceless gift of an adopted child. My Administration believes that every human life has inherent value, and encourages adoption as an alternative to abortion. All children, born and unborn, deserve a chance to have a better, more prosperous future. I commend the selfless men and women who preserve the majesty of God's creation by providing children with a chance at a better life. This month, we celebrate the blessings of adoption and renew our resolve to promote a culture of respect for every human life. Countless Americans dedicate their time, energy, and resources to the adoption process, and we honor their selfless contributions as community members, faith leaders, caregivers, role models, and families. Our Nation is strengthened by the sacred institution of the family, and devoted parents who love and protect their adopted children. As a Nation, let us commit to ensuring a brighter future for all of our Nation's children. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by helping children and youth in need of a permanent home secure a more promising future with a forever family and enter adulthood with the love and connections we all need. [[Page 259]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10110 of October 30, 2020 National American History and Founders Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In the Black Hills of South Dakota stands an enduring tribute to four of our greatest Presidents--George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt. Mount Rushmore symbolizes the proud history of our Nation, a history that began on July 4, 1776, with the revolutionary words written in the Declaration of Independence. This summer, I spoke before this beautiful monument in celebration of Independence Day to call attention to the brilliant vision of our Founding Fathers and their profound, momentous statement that ``all men are created equal.'' And, earlier this year at the National Archives, the sacred home of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights--our Nation's Charters of Freedom--I pledged that our great American heroes will never be forgotten, our schools will teach the story of our Nation as it happened, and the truth of our history will never be erased or rewritten. Throughout this month, we celebrate the incredible history of the United States and commit to continually work toward the promise of a more perfect Union. The story of our Nation is one of tireless progress toward realizing and defending our founding principles--individual liberty, representative self-government, and equality of opportunity. In the 18th century, the founding generation sacrificed blood and treasure to defend the spark of liberty on this continent, constructing the framework of our new American society. In the 19th century, the mettle of that foundation was tested as Americans took up arms against one another in a struggle that ultimately eradicated the great injustice of slavery from our country, a conflict that, though it left a dark stain on the fabric of our Nation, ultimately strengthened our commitment to freedom and helped us further realize the true promise of the founding. The American 20th century saw great strides in progress for civil rights, as women won the right to vote and timeless voices like Martin Luther King, Jr., illuminated the path toward true equality for Black Americans. Abroad, American service members carried the torch of liberty to those in need, liberating Europe and Asia from fascist oppression and freeing billions of people around the world from the suffocating yoke of communism. This is the inheritance of today's generation of Americans. A history defined by righteous struggle in service to our founding ideals of liberty and justice for all. A history populated by heroes and warriors for freedom. And a history marked by an unyielding commitment to virtue and principle. This history is what distinguishes our Nation as the most free and just society in the world. [[Page 260]] Today, however, a fringe element of radical politicians, media voices, corporate executives, and other activists seek to use their immense power to obscure the ideals of our country, rewrite our Nation's proud history, and desecrate the memory of our Founders. Statues have been torn down and destroyed, violent mobs have masqueraded under the false banner of peaceful protests, and free speech has come under siege in the public square and on online platforms. As one example among many, theoretical frameworks like ``Critical Race Theory'' have corrupted our United States history and civic education courses in public schools, board rooms, the military, and government agencies, promoting racial division and discrimination. Adherents to Critical Race Theory and other associated ideologies believe that America is an inherently racist and sexist country, defined by oppression and hierarchies of victimhood, rather than freedom and equality. Critical Race Theory and those who promote it seek to strip individual agency from all Americans and instead relegate them into pre-determined categories of belief based on their racial or sexual identity. If Americans are distracted by such theories from studying the true history of our great Nation--its mistakes and its triumphs--we risk the dissolution of our common bonds and we will be weakened as a country. That is why I recently signed an Executive Order that bans executive departments and agencies and Federal contractors from teaching Critical Race Theory, in an effort to prevent the indoctrination of the American people by these dangerous ideologies. Now, more than ever, we must continue to forge an even brighter future for our Nation by preserving its past. As President, I will always honor the great legacy of America's history and its Founders. Throughout this month, we recommit to protecting the great American story, one of a Nation that has promoted liberty and ensured freedom for millions. We know that when we collectively recognize and cherish our history, we are made stronger as one people. The divine truth our Founders enshrined in the fabric of our Nation--that all people are created equal--will, if we cherish and protect it, ensure the blessings of unparalleled freedom and prosperity for all posterity. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as National American History and Founders Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 261]] Proclamation 10111 of October 30, 2020 National Entrepreneurship Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The United States is home to the most creative, passionate, and talented minds anywhere in the world. Throughout our history, we have pioneered revolutionary innovations, and we continue to reach new heights in business, science, and technology. During National Entrepreneurship Month, we celebrate the determination of those who strike out on their own to fuel our robust economy. American entrepreneurs employ more than 60 million people nationwide and strengthen our communities with their hard work and ingenuity. Since taking office, I have cut onerous regulations at a historic rate, saving these businesses nearly $50 billion in compliance costs, unleashing the might of the American economy, and empowering proud American business owners. When the Government removes barriers to success, all Americans benefit. For the first time in decades, deregulation is saving small businesses from wasting precious hours on regulatory compliance and creating a dynamic economic landscape. Our policies have empowered entrepreneurs to do what they do best: innovate, create, and succeed. We must continue supporting our Nation's economic success by preparing the next generation of American workers for the jobs of today and tomorrow. That is why I established the President's National Council for the American Worker, which is engaging with companies to invest in and develop programs for workplace education and skills training and retraining. I encourage more entrepreneurs to take the Pledge to America's Workers and join the 450 companies and trade associations that have already committed to providing more than 16 million education and training opportunities for American students and workers. Additionally, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaced the outdated and unfair North American Free Trade Agreement, is now in full effect, fulfilling my promise to level the playing field for American businesses and workers. This landmark agreement will help bring our manufacturing jobs back home while ensuring that more American innovators can run their businesses without shipping jobs overseas. Our Nation's entrepreneurs have also been at the heart of our ongoing efforts to defeat the coronavirus. Working with private-sector companies, my Administration launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II. In addition to helping to rapidly expand our Nation's testing capabilities and to produce unparalleled levels of personal protective equipment, many American innovators have been at the forefront of developing safe vaccines and effective therapeutics as quickly as possible. Entrepreneurs, especially small business owners, are key to our surging economy. That is why I pushed for and signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law. This landmark legislation provided $2.2 trillion to our great American workers, businesses, and entrepreneurs. Under the CARES Act, the Small Business Administration and the Department of the Treasury approved 5.2 million Paycheck Protection [[Page 262]] Program loans to help our entrepreneurs across the country navigate the economic difficulties of this pandemic. This month, we recognize the bold spirit of America's entrepreneurs who continue to prove that the American dream is alive and more obtainable than ever before. As we continue our great American comeback, we know that these innovative men and women will remain at the forefront of our efforts to create a brighter future for our country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as National Entrepreneurship Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities and to celebrate November 17, 2020, as National Entrepreneurs' Day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10112 of October 30, 2020 National Family Caregivers Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Each day in homes throughout our Nation, Americans with chronic or terminal illnesses, functional impairment, or disabilities receive compassionate care and support from family members and loved ones. During National Family Caregivers Month, we salute the more than 40 million people in the United States who serve as unpaid caregivers. With generous hearts and faithful devotion, they honor the sanctity of life and affirm the inherent value of all human beings. Caregivers work long days and spend countless hours to meet and anticipate the needs of their loved ones, often facing challenges that can seem impossible to navigate. Errands, medical appointments, transportation, meal preparation, grooming, and companionship can consume significant time and effort, especially when caregivers must balance these duties with the pressures and responsibilities of their own lives, including employment and raising children. In spite of all of this, these extraordinary moms and dads, sons and daughters, siblings, and friends showcase compassion and selflessness for the ones they love. Their faithfulness and dedication is indicative of the generosity of the American Spirit and reflects the very best of our Nation. Because of the essential role they play in ensuring the health and wellbeing of those most in need, family caregivers deserve our unending support. In 2018, I signed into law two pieces of legislation, the RAISE Family Caregivers Act and the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act, which provide for the development of strategies and support networks for family caregivers. Over the last year, the Advisory Councils created by [[Page 263]] these acts have made significant progress toward raising awareness and giving a voice to family caregivers. The work of these Councils, led by the Administration for Community Living at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will yield a National Caregiving Strategy in 2021 that will include recommended actions that States, communities, health systems, and other private-sector entities and stakeholders can take to improve the lives and conditions of family caregivers. Working alongside existing initiatives like HHS' National Family Caregiver Support Program, we are ensuring that family caregivers have the resources they need to provide essential care and support for their loved ones. Our great veterans living with illness or injury are one of the largest groups who receive care from family members and friends. These caregivers, more than 5 million strong, play a vital role in the lives of these extraordinary men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country. In order to improve services and outcomes for patients and families who are dealing with the stress and uncertainty of caregiving, the Department of Veterans Affairs established the first National Center of Excellence for veteran and caregiver research. The advances made through this initiative, coupled with the resources and capabilities made available through the VA MISSION Act, which I signed into law in 2018, are helping to educate and equip families with the tools they need to provide even better care for our Nation's veterans. America's heroes have earned and deserve our respect and gratitude, and their caregivers deserve the same. Family caregivers provide a vital lifeline of connection and hope to loved ones during challenging and uncertain days. These caregivers, who devote immeasurable time, energy, resources, and heart, need our understanding, support, gratitude, and encouragement. Throughout this month, let us remember these men and women who spend their days caring for others, and let us pray that they are sustained by grace and strength as they carry on this important work. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to reach out to those who provide care for their family members, friends, and neighbors in need, to honor and thank them. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 264]] Proclamation 10113 of October 30, 2020 National Native American Heritage Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Native American Heritage Month, we honor the storied legacy of American Indians and Alaska Natives in our Nation. Their cherished legacy, rich cultures, and heroic history of military service inspire us all. This month, as we recommit to supporting Native American Tribes and people, we resolve to work side-by-side with their leaders to secure stronger, safer communities and preserve their sacred heritage for future generations. In recognition of the importance of Indian Country to the cultural identity of our Nation and the strength of our economy, my Administration has taken unprecedented action to promote the health and wellbeing of Native American communities. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, we secured the largest investment in Indian Country in our Nation's history, providing $8 billion in Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding to ensure Native American communities have the resources they need to combat the virus. In August, I signed into law the Great American Outdoors Act, the largest conservation effort in a generation, which includes up to $475 million in guaranteed funding over the next 5 years to improve American Indian school infrastructure. I recently secured the return from Finland of a number of cultural artifacts and human remains originating from Native American Tribes in the Mesa Verde region, and I will continue to work to identify Native American artifacts wrongfully taken abroad and will work with Tribal partners to bring them home. And we are continuing to work alongside Native American leaders to combat crime and violence through important initiatives like Operation Lady Justice, addressing the long- ignored tragedy of missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives. To further our commitment to Native American communities, my Administration recently released our policy vision for Indian Country entitled ``Putting America's First Peoples First--Forgotten No More!'' This comprehensive plan protects Tribal sovereignty and economic self- determination while also promoting public safety, providing for high- quality education, and delivering lasting solutions to long-unresolved healthcare challenges in Indian Country. Through concrete actions like my Administration's reform of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, we are helping increase access to water, broadband, electric, and other utility infrastructure in Indian Country. Working with Tribal leaders, we are creating investment opportunities in Native American communities, building on their storied traditions while looking toward a shared future of prosperity and cooperation. Native Americans play a critical role in the health and vitality of our great Nation. During National Native American Heritage Month, we honor their vibrant cultures. As business owners, artists, teachers, writers, courageous members of our Armed Forces, and so much more, their contributions to our society are cause for celebration and appreciation by all Americans. [[Page 265]] This month, as we honor the heritage of Native American Tribes and people, we resolve to support their legacy and communities for generations to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities and to celebrate November 27, 2020, as Native American Heritage Day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10114 of October 30, 2020 National Veterans and Military Families Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Our Nation's service members--past and present--and their families represent the very best of America. Motivated by patriotism and love of country, our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and Space Warfighters serve at home and abroad with professionalism, ingenuity, integrity, and devotion. Their families always stand beside them in their missions and as they transition to civilian life. During National Veterans and Military Families Month, we celebrate the loved ones of our country's men and women in uniform and recognize the sacrifices they have made in support of our Nation's heroes. When I first took office, I pledged to our Armed Forces that I would always have their backs; and that means providing for military families as well. The demands and challenges of military life are shared by the loved ones of our heroes. Spouses, parents, siblings, and children often shoulder increased burdens and responsibilities when their servicemen and women are called to duty. Military families, and especially spouses have to endure the stress of frequent relocations and deal with job searches under state licensing regulations that can prevent them from working in their chosen occupations. To address this issue, my Administration eliminated unnecessary and cumbersome red tape that stifled career opportunities for military spouses, and the Department of Defense has implemented programs to enhance childcare opportunities for military families. Too many veterans carry painful memories and bear physical and emotional scars from their service. We will never forget our veterans who are suffering from mental health issues or the military families that are left behind by veteran suicide. As President, I have prioritized changing the culture surrounding mental health and promoting a society that recognizes the infinite value and purpose of every life. Last year, I mobilized every available Federal resource to develop and implement the President's Roadmap [[Page 266]] to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide. I also fought for and secured a record $8.6 billion in funding for mental health services in the most recent Department of Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. In October, I signed the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act, which will bolster these efforts even further. Like never before, we are using a whole-of- government approach to better understand and prevent suicide. No American warrior should ever be forgotten, and no military family should ever be left behind. Since the beginning of my Administration, it has been a top priority and my solemn pledge to honor, equip, and protect our service members, veterans, and their families. My commitment has not wavered. America's military might is essential to our safety, prosperity, and national security. Caring for the brave Americans in our Armed Forces, and their families, and upholding our sacred obligation to those who have served with honor is the least we can do for those who have given so much for so many. This month, we pledge our gratitude to every man and woman currently serving this Nation in uniform, to all our veterans who helped preserve and defend our precious freedom, and to every family member who shares in the service and sacrifice of military life. My Administration will never stop fighting to enhance and improve the quality of life for these exceptional Americans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2020 as National Veterans and Military Families Month. I encourage all communities, all sectors of society, and all Americans to acknowledge and honor the service, sacrifices, and contributions of veterans and military families for what they have done and for what they do every day to support our great Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10115 of October 30, 2020 National Day of Remembrance for Americans Killed by Illegal Aliens, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On this National Day of Remembrance, we pause to honor the memory of every American life so egregiously taken from us by criminal illegal aliens. As sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and as American citizens, these precious lives are an irreplaceable piece of our national community. We solemnly stand with their families--our Angel Families--who have endured what no American family should ever have to suffer. Today, we recommit to ensuring that those responsible for these tragedies face justice, while taking every action to prevent these horrific acts from occurring in our Nation. [[Page 267]] As President, I have no higher duty than to ensure the safety and security of all Americans. Accordingly, I will never rest until our border is fully secure and our communities safe. The laws of our country, including immigration laws, must be respected and followed so that every American citizen may have a bright and prosperous future. I proudly support our dedicated Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Officers, Customs and Border Protection Officers (CBPOs), Border Patrol Agents, and other law enforcement officials who work every day to protect Americans from the senseless crimes that our Angel Families have had to endure. For years, our politicians and leaders met the pain and plight of Angel Families with silence and indifference. Under my watch, the voices of our Angel Families no longer fall on deaf ears. Americans who are killed by illegal aliens are no longer forgotten, and we are ensuring that they will not have died in vain. Our Nation solemnly stands alongside the mothers and fathers who are no longer able to see their children grow up and have families of their own and for the sons and daughters who have lost a parent or loved one at the hands of someone who never should have been inside our country in the first place. It is because of these brave families who have suffered unimaginable loss that my Administration created a new office in the Department of Homeland Security called Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE). This program has already assisted hundreds of families and will continue providing critical services until no American suffers the harm or loss of a loved one due to the violent actions of a criminal alien. My Administration recognizes that a secure border is essential to a safe and prosperous Nation. Accordingly, we have devoted time and resources to constructing a strong border wall and ending the disastrous immigration policies of previous administrations. Four hundred miles of wall have already been built, and we are on pace to complete more than 500 miles by early next year. We have ended the terrible practice of catch-and-release, deployed approximately 4,000 National Guard personnel to the Southern Border in the last 2 years to support Federal border security and wall construction efforts, restored integrity and safety to the asylum process through the Migrant Protection Protocols, and deported more than 20,000 gang members and over 500,000 criminal illegal aliens. During my Administration, our courageous ICE Officers, CBPOs, Border Patrol Agents, and law enforcement personnel have seized thousands of pounds of lethal narcotics at our border--enough to kill every American four times over. Through these efforts, we are saving American lives, curbing crime, and honoring the precious lives tragically taken from us. On this National Day of Remembrance, we pay tribute to the enduring memory of every American killed by an illegal alien. They will never be forgotten, and we will stand by their families and fight for a future where every American is safe. Together, we will pursue the promise of a proud, noble, and secure future while protecting our families and communities from those who seek to do us harm. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1, 2020, as a National Day of Remembrance for Americans Killed by Illegal Aliens. I [[Page 268]] call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10116 of November 6, 2020 National Apprenticeship Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Apprenticeships provide American workers tangible skills and an industry-recognized credential. They strengthen our Nation's economy and help millions of men and women provide for their families without taking on the financial burden of student loans and other related debt. During National Apprenticeship Week, we celebrate the American workers who create a brighter future for themselves and their families through apprenticeships, and we further our commitment to bolstering opportunity as we continue our economic comeback. For decades, politicians and bureaucrats in Washington neglected workers, shipped jobs overseas, and abandoned essential manufacturing industries. When I took office, I reversed these policies and pledged to always put the American economy, labor force, and worker first. Under my leadership, we have cut taxes, removed burdensome regulations on businesses, and renegotiated our trade deals, all of which led to historic job creation and economic growth. Apprenticeships are a pillar of our effort to continue this trend, and my Administration remains committed to supporting initiatives that empower Americans and prepare our workers to compete and thrive in a 21st-century economy. Since taking office, my Administration has worked tirelessly to empower more Americans with the benefits of apprenticeships and the skills they provide. In June of 2017, I signed an Executive Order on Expanding Apprenticeships in America. Under my leadership, the Department of Labor has awarded $80 million across 42 States and territories for occupational skills education for American students and workers, 800,000 Americans have joined apprenticeship programs, and we are well on the way to meeting my goal of 1 million new apprentices by September of next year. In Fiscal Year 2019 alone, we registered more than 250,000 new apprentices in vital industries, including advanced manufacturing, financial services, educational services, transportation, healthcare, and informational technology. My Administration also recently launched the Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program model, which provides opportunities for industry-led, market-driven training that expands workforce development and opens windows to well-paying jobs in high- demand industries. In recognition of our Nation's obligation to our military men and women, my Administration has also expanded the United Services Military Apprenticeship Program across all branches, providing apprenticeship opportunities to our service [[Page 269]] members while they are still on active duty to help them prepare for prosperous and fulfilling lives after their time in uniform. My Administration will also continue to work with industry partners to provide workers with the skills they need to succeed in today's economy through the Pledge to America's Workers. This initiative recently proved essential as our Nation confronted the unprecedented challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. As part of our ongoing response, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II, and thousands of new apprentices answered the call for skilled labor in key sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, cybersecurity, and information technology. These efforts demonstrate that, when government allows the free market to respond, the spirit of the American worker and the strength and resolve of America's economy will overcome any challenge. This week, we recommit to bolstering economic opportunity through apprenticeships. I encourage individuals, business leaders, and government officials to support hardworking Americans and their families through expanding apprenticeship education and training, recognizing the essential role apprenticeships play in sustaining our national economy. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 8 through November 14, 2020, as National Apprenticeship Week. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10117 of November 6, 2020 World Freedom Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On World Freedom Day, we commemorate the historic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which liberated the people of East Germany from the grip of tyranny. This watershed event marked the triumph of freedom and liberty for hundreds of millions of people who rejected the oppression of Soviet communism and its Marxist-Leninist ideology. Today, we celebrate the blessings of freedom in Germany and across the world, and reaffirm our Nation's support for all who wish to be free. Following World War II, the Soviet Union built an Iron Curtain between the East and West, isolating the city of West Berlin and shutting off the free flow of goods and people. Determined to prevent the light of liberty from being extinguished, our Nation stood with the United Kingdom and France against the Soviet demand that the West withdraw from Berlin. To defeat [[Page 270]] this demand for surrender, the United States Air Force and our allies fearlessly airlifted food, fuel, and supplies to the starving people of West Berlin, and together, we were resolved to restore freedom to the German people. For almost 30 years, the Berlin Wall symbolized the divide between the free world and communism. On its eastern side, the rights that democratic societies hold dear--the fundamental freedoms of religion, speech, the press, association, and petition--were replaced by forced secularism, oppressive censorship, monolithic propaganda, and inhumane division. Hundreds of brave Germans died attempting to escape this brutal fate, as the Stasi used landmines, armed watchtowers, and barbed wire to intimidate those who dreamed of freedom and to kill and harm those who braved any attempt to escape. Those whose escapes failed, those who facilitated successful or attempted crossings, and those who crossed the Stasi in some other way were tortured, imprisoned, and executed in horrifying violations of human dignity and rights. The United States always stood resolutely with the victims and survivors of the evil ideology that controlled East Germany and East Berlin. Our valiant response to Soviet oppression in Germany defined the Cold War, from President John F. Kennedy's declaration, ``Ich bin ein Berliner,'' in 1963 to President Ronald Reagan's momentous call, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' in 1987. Our founding principles of individual, God-given unalienable rights, human dignity, and equality of opportunity were embraced by the millions held in Soviet bondage, and ultimately won the ideological battle of the Cold War. As a result, we are able to celebrate Germany's reunification today, reaffirm our alliance, and recognize German contributions to modern day peace and prosperity. This World Freedom Day, we honor all those who fought for freedom, endured injustice, and bravely resisted totalitarianism before the fall of the Berlin Wall. We also reassert our longstanding commitment to combat tyranny, uplift the voices of those held captive by communist regimes, and halt the spread of this brutal ideology at home and around the world. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2020, as World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our dedication to freedom and democracy. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 271]] Proclamation 10118 of November 10, 2020 Veterans Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation America's veterans have fought to defend our country, its values, and its interests since the first days of our founding. They have defeated tyrants, eliminated terrorists, and secured freedom at home and abroad. Their courage and fortitude in the face of adversity serve as an example for all Americans. On Veterans Day, we pause to pay tribute to all who have proudly worn our Nation's uniform. These Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen selflessly placed lives, well-being, and security of others before their own. We enjoy the privileges of peace, prosperity, and freedom because of our veterans, and we are forever indebted to them beyond measure. For their love of country and dedication to duty, America's veterans have endured adversity, loneliness, fatigue, loss, and made other incredible sacrifices. Many sustained life-altering physical injuries and disabilities; others bear the burden of emotional scars for the remainder of their lives. Our Nation's veterans fully understand liberty's high and precious cost, for they have paid it every day since the formation of our Republic. As Commander in Chief, I have relentlessly fought to support America's veterans. For far too long, our Government had not fully met its obligation to provide for ``him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.'' I recognize that this country and its people are duty-bound to care for our exceptional veterans, their families, and their survivors. That is why, throughout my time in office, I have worked tirelessly to improve the health, welfare, and economic prosperity of these treasured people. In just a few short years, my Administration completely overhauled the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), removing employees who were not giving our veterans the care and attention they deserve and making the agency more accountable to the heroes it serves. I also signed into law the VA MISSION Act, which gives eligible veterans the choice to receive timely care from providers in their own communities. In 2018, I also signed the largest funding bill in the history of the VA, and the VA has since benefited from record budgets every year. In addition, I signed a Presidential Memorandum to ensure that veterans who are totally and permanently disabled receive the Federal student loan forgiveness to which they are so justly entitled. We will continue to build on these efforts and work to create an economic environment that fosters growth and prosperity for veterans, ensuring all of our veterans have the opportunity to live productive civilian lives. The mental health and welfare of our veterans is of critical importance, and addressing this issue has been a top priority. Tragically, an average of 20 veterans and service members die by suicide each day. We are striving with all our effort to end this alarming and unacceptable reality. Last year, I launched the largest whole-of-government program in history to end veteran suicide, the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS). I also recently signed the Commander John Scott Hannon Veteran Mental Health Care Improvement Act [[Page 272]] which is strengthening VA mental health, supporting suicide prevention efforts, and developing pilot programs dedicated to ending veteran suicide. I have also bolstered the Veterans Crisis Line, so that its around-the-clock operators can deliver the best possible intervention services to vulnerable veterans. Our veterans represent the best of America, and they deserve the best America can provide them. To recognize and respect the contributions our service men and women have made in defense of America, and to advance the cause of peace, the Congress has provided, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a), that November 11th of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to recognize America's veterans. These heroes served faithfully, humbly, and valiantly in times of war and peace, and they carried these admirable traits into the civilian workforce when their military service was fulfilled. Our precious liberty has survived and thrived because of generations of brave Americans--from every background and walk of life--who have answered the call to support and defend the United States. The gravity of their contribution is immeasurable and so is our debt to every single one of our Nation's veterans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2020, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the fortitude and sacrifice of our veterans through public ceremonies and private thoughts and prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative expressions and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10119 of November 13, 2020 American Education Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Education empowers students of all ages to reach their full potential and plays a fundamental role in developing a strong workforce and informed citizenry. Our Nation is currently enduring an unprecedented academic year, but our commitment to the safe reopening of schools and the expansion of school choice programs nationwide remains steadfast. As we celebrate the 99th anniversary of American Education Week, I encourage States, districts, and school boards across the country to embrace creative, personalized approaches to learning, and to ensure that students are at the center of all of their educational endeavors. This year, students, teachers, and administrators have faced extraordinary challenges. Nevertheless, we must recognize that our children's physical, [[Page 273]] mental, and emotional well-being depend so much on their access to schools. Studies show that children are at very low risk of serious illness from the coronavirus, while the harms of delaying their return to in-person instruction are grave. As President, I have taken unprecedented action to ensure that classrooms are safe so that students can return to school and resume learning amongst their peers. My Administration fought for billions of dollars in funding for local school districts for personal protective equipment, increased cleaning services, and other critical resources and is providing States with millions of revolutionary point-of-care tests that deliver highly accurate results in minutes. Whether in the classroom or at home, I am committed to fighting for whatever is needed to ensure quality education for every American student. As a result of thousands of schools transitioning to some form of remote learning, parents are gaining expanded insight into our Nation's inadequate education system. For too many families, the pandemic has served as a stark reminder that an antiquated, agenda-driven, one-size- fits-all approach to education simply does not work. Instead, parents desire greater control over how their tax dollars are spent, and American families demand more options and more autonomy over their children's education. Whether they choose public, private, magnet, charter, parochial, or home schools, I am fighting to expand every family's choices in our Nation's education system. Last year, I signed the Secure Act to broaden how families could spend the funds in tax-free college savings accounts. And just this July, my Administration awarded new funding to the successful DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, so disadvantaged students in our Nation's capital can attend the school of their choice. These actions are part of our continued efforts to empower parents and encourage educational innovation at the State and local levels, because in the land of the free, a child's zip code should never play any role in determining their educational potential. During this American Education week, we especially celebrate the teachers, community leaders, parents, and advocates that shape the futures of our country's children. They play an essential and powerful role in developing Americans of character who are capable of enhancing our country's culture, society, and economy. As our Nation's teachers and students navigate an unprecedented school year, we must all recommit to providing students with lifelong learning opportunities and supplying them with the tools they need to achieve success. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15 through November 21, 2020, as American Education Week. I commend our Nation's schools, their teachers and leaders, and the parents of students across this land. And I call on States and communities to support high-quality education to meet the needs of all students. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 274]] Proclamation 10120 of November 20, 2020 National Family Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Families strengthen our communities, shape our values, and provide a foundation for future success. Families are--and will always be--the basic building block of our society. During National Family Week, we take time to honor and appreciate the many blessings of strong and healthy families, and we recognize that our policies must empower and enable them to flourish so they can contribute to an even brighter future for our great Nation. Every family is unique and remarkable, and my Administration is committed to providing meaningful solutions to address the issues that matter most to them, especially when facing extraordinary challenges. As our Nation confronted the coronavirus pandemic, I signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to provide over $2 trillion in economic relief to quickly help families, small businesses, and communities, and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which provided timely and critical support for families by expanding paid family, medical, and sick leave. We also increased unemployment benefits, enhanced flexibility within unemployment insurance programs, suspended student loan payments, and removed the threat of foreclosures and evictions for families with Government guaranteed mortgages. My Administration continues to call on the Congress for additional support to sustain families through this pandemic, particularly those most harmed by State and local shutdown orders and other restrictions on economic activity. The pandemic has placed great strain on American families, from those who have mourned the loss of a loved one to those who have struggled to adjust to new and burdensome daily routines. In times like this, mental health becomes even more important. That is why I signed an Executive Order to provide grant funding for easier access to mental health services, including telehealth, peer-to-peer, and safe in-person therapeutic treatments. Despite impediments and adversity, we have made great progress to help bring an end to this terrible pandemic and rebuild our previously booming economy. In addition to identifying many successful therapeutics through Operation Warp Speed, I recently announced tremendous progress in developing and distributing safe and effective vaccines. Moreover, with unprecedented rapid reductions in unemployment and historic third- quarter growth, the United States, in just a few months, has recovered two-thirds of the economic output lost to the pandemic. America will fully recover not only emotionally and physically, but also fiscally, from the devastation of the pandemic--and our families will be the bedrock of our Nation's renewed success. Families are our most cherished and sacred institution. They play a vital role in providing emotional, physical, and communal support and help us endure the inevitable difficulties of life. My Administration stands firm in supporting the success of our families by ensuring that every child--born and unborn--can thrive in a loving home with caregivers who are bolstered [[Page 275]] by access to childcare, paid family leave, school choice, and job training. By enacting tax cuts, lowering prescription drug prices, and working to increase wages and benefits, we have enabled families to keep more of their hard-earned money so they can realize their own American dream. In this season of Thanksgiving, we thank God for the wonderful families across our great Nation who are working to build brighter, better, and more prosperous futures. This week, we acknowledge that we are only as strong as our families and vow to prioritize their well-being and to uphold their fundamental role in our society. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 22 through November 28, 2020, as National Family Week. I invite communities, churches, and individuals to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10121 of November 25, 2020 Thanksgiving Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On Thanksgiving Day, we thank God for the abundant blessings in our lives. As we gather with family and friends to celebrate this season of generosity, hope, and gratitude, we commemorate America's founding traditions of faith, family, and friendship, and give thanks for the principles of freedom, liberty, and democracy that make our country exceptional in the history of the world. This November marks 400 years since the Mayflower and its passengers faced the unknown and set sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Propelled by hope for a brighter future, these intrepid men and women endured two long months at sea, tired and hungry, to arrive in a new world full of potential. In the winter weather that greeted their arrival, they lost nearly half of their fellow travelers to exposure, disease, and starvation. Despite unimaginable hardships, these first Americans nevertheless remained firm in their faith and unwavering in their commitment to their dreams. They forged friendships with the Wampanoag Tribe, fostered a spirit of common purpose among themselves, and trusted in God to provide for them. The following year, they celebrated a successful harvest alongside their Native American neighbors--the first Thanksgiving. This seminal event in the history of our Nation is a continual reminder of the power of faith, love, perseverance, prayer, and fellowship. The Mayflower's arrival to the New World in 1620 also marks the arrival of the first seeds of democracy to our land. Absent the rule of a monarch [[Page 276]] in an uncharted wilderness, these early settlers resolved to create their own government through what is known as the Mayflower Compact. Defined by majority rule through elected leaders responsible for creating ``just and equal laws,'' the Mayflower Compact represents the first chapter in the long tradition of self-determination and rule of law in America. One hundred and fifty-six years later, our Nation's Founding Fathers resolved to break free from England, building upon the Mayflower Compact to establish an enduring government whose authority came solely ``from the consent of the governed.'' This year, as our Nation continues to combat the coronavirus pandemic, we have once again joined together to overcome the challenges facing us. In the midst of suffering and loss, we are witnessing the remarkable courage and boundless generosity of the American people as they come to the aid of those in need, reflecting the spirit of those first settlers who worked together to meet the needs of their community. First responders, medical professionals, essential workers, neighbors, and countless other patriots have served and sacrificed for their fellow Americans, and the prayers of our people have once again lifted up our Nation, providing comfort, healing, and strength during times of uncertainty. Despite unprecedented challenges, we have not faltered in the face of adversity. To the contrary, we have leveraged our strengths to make significant breakthroughs that will end this crisis, rebuilding our stockpiles, revamping our manufacturing capabilities, and developing groundbreaking therapeutics and life-saving vaccines on record- shattering timeframes. During this season of gratitude, we also acknowledge those who cannot be with their families. This includes the brave American patriots of our Armed Forces who selflessly defend our sacred liberty at home and abroad. And we pause to remember the sacrifices of our law enforcement personnel and first responders. We are deeply grateful for all those who remain on watch over the holidays and keep us safe as we celebrate and give thanks for the blessings in our lives. This Thanksgiving, we reaffirm our everlasting gratitude for all that we enjoy, and we commemorate the legacy of generosity bestowed upon us by our forbearers. Although challenges remain, we will never yield in our quest to live up to the promise of our heritage. As we gather with our loved ones, we resolve with abiding faith and patriotism to celebrate the joys of freedom and cherish the hope and peace of a brighter future ahead. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 26, 2020, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to gather, in homes and places of worship, to offer a prayer of thanks to God for our many blessings. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 277]] Proclamation 10122 of November 30, 2020 National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In the United States, one person tragically dies every 50 minutes in a drunk driving incident. Far too many families experience the pain of losing a loved one to impaired driving, and even more must cope with health and financial consequences that result from this illegal and avoidable conduct. During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we remember the lives lost as a result of those driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, we acknowledge the pain and suffering caused by impaired driving, we honor the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives to protect our communities from this irresponsible behavior, and we resolve to never get behind the wheel unless we are sober. Alcohol, drugs, and certain medications can impair judgement, decrease motor coordination, and slow reaction time to the point where operating a motor vehicle is no longer safe. While deaths caused by impaired driving have thankfully fallen by more than 30 percent in the last three decades, too many Americans still make the thoughtless decision to drive impaired, threatening other motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, killing nearly 30 people every day. Since my first day in office, my Administration has fought to address this tragedy head on and reduce impaired-driving deaths. We are constantly working with law enforcement officers and public safety professionals to provide them with the resources and support they need to keep our roads safe. To address the root causes of impaired driving, my Administration is also assisting those with substance use disorder through initiatives like www.FindTreatment.gov, a website dedicated to connecting people with the treatment they need, and the Rural Community Toolbox, which provides funding and resources to help build strong, healthy, and drug-free rural communities. Additionally, our Nation's business owners, skilled workers, and innovative entrepreneurs have joined in this fight. The rapid expansion and improvement of existing technologies like ride-sharing and Advanced Vehicle Technologies continue to provide additional safe alternatives to impaired driving. We must all do our part to stop the tragedies caused by impaired driving. This month, I encourage individuals across America to recommit to working together to reduce the number of crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation's roads. Let us vow to act responsibly, always drive sober, and keep our communities safe. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2020 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving. [[Page 278]] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10123 of November 30, 2020 World AIDS Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Today, our Nation joins millions across the globe in remembrance of the precious lives lost to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illnesses, and we reaffirm our support for those living with these diseases. Thankfully, decades of remarkable advancements and improved understanding have put us within reach of ending its devastating impact. Through increased awareness, revolutionary prevention strategies, and safe and effective treatment regimens, we will soon end the AIDS epidemic once and for all. Over the past 40 years, HIV and AIDS have infected more than 77 million people worldwide and claimed no less than 35 million lives, including those of 700,000 Americans. Currently, there are approximately 1.2 million people living in the United States with HIV, including roughly 170,000 people who have not been diagnosed. Additionally, it is all too clear that this deadly disease disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities. As President, I promised to end the AIDS crisis in America within a decade, and I am proud to report that we are on track to meet that goal. In 2019, I announced Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America, a bold whole-of-society approach to eradicating this disease. Already, we have sent $227 million to cities, counties, States, local health departments, and community health centers to support and bolster their efforts. Under this plan, our Nation's scientists, researchers, and medical professionals have been able to identify where HIV is spreading most rapidly, which informs decisions about where to focus funding and provide support to public health officials who are addressing needs at a local level to eradicate AIDs. This July, as part of these efforts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded $109 million to 32 State and local health departments to support core HIV diagnosis and prevention activities. Additionally, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is continuing to provide those diagnosed with access to high quality, comprehensive primary care. Under HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care health centers have implemented critical early detection initiatives that have produced life-saving diagnoses of Americans living with HIV, saving countless American lives. Across many fronts, our response has been comprehensive--and it is working. Preventative measures such as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and syringe service programs are reducing the number of new HIV transmissions and, if one has already been exposed, Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is helping prevent further spread of infection. In 2019 alone, federally funded [[Page 279]] health centers provided more than 2.7 million HIV tests to over 2.2 million patients. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program has proven remarkably successful at viral suppression, reducing viral loads in 87.1 percent of its clients' cases in 2018. And the National Institutes of Health continues its work to develop a vaccine. Outside of the United States, my Administration's global response is being led by the world's most advanced health experts and diplomats through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the most successful health initiative in American history. When first launched in 2003, there were 26.6 million Africans infected with AIDS and only 50,000 receiving lifesaving antiretroviral treatment. Today, more than 15.7 million men, women, and children in Africa are receiving these vital treatments. PEPFAR has saved over 18 million lives, prevented millions of HIV infections, and accelerated progress toward controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in more than 50 countries. Through these and other initiatives we are bringing to a close a painful chapter in human history. For the past many decades, HIV and AIDS have inflicted untold suffering on millions of people both here at home and abroad. But by the end of this decade, we will have eliminated this scourge from our country and released much of the rest of the world from its deadly grip. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2020, as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other Territories subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and all Americans to join me in appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support and compassion to those living with HIV/ AIDS. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10124 of December 4, 2020 Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Nearly 250 years ago, heroes of our Revolution signed the Declaration of Independence, offering a bold enumeration of inalienable rights endowed to us by our Creator. In time, with independence secured from a tyrannical monarchy, our Nation etched these principles of liberty and equality into the law of our fledgling Nation when we ratified our Constitution. The revolutionary idea they embodied--that certain individual rights are beyond the reach of government--has resonated around the world. Today, and this [[Page 280]] week, we celebrate our sacred rights and the example they have set for the rest of history. James Madison, who drafted the Bill of Rights text, was initially skeptical of the need to secure specific rights explicitly in the Constitution, believing the checks and balances inherent in our system of government would operate to achieve that objective. But he came to recognize the value that the Bill of Rights could provide and worked to ensure that the individual rights and freedoms of Americans were precisely enumerated in the highest law of the land. Madison was acutely aware that, while a government formed to serve its people is just and legitimate, ``power, lodged as it must in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.'' Accordingly, he worked to imprint essential human rights, including the rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, and free exercise of religion in our foundational legal text, empowering generations of Americans by protecting them from government abuses. The revolutionary understanding of human rights reflected in the Declaration of Independence and encoded in our Constitution has provided a blueprint for the world in advancing individual human rights. In 1948, looking to our Bill of Rights as a model, the United Nations General Assembly established the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the ``inherent dignity'' and ``equal and inalienable rights'' of mankind. Earlier this year, we also celebrated the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Accords, in which the Western World acknowledged similar fundamental human freedoms in defiance of the Soviet Union. Despite these milestones, the world is still plagued by tragic human rights abuses, including the oppression of women, forced labor, racism, and ethnic and religious persecution. My Administration continues to fight these injustices on all fronts while calling on other sovereign nations to respect the unalienable rights of their people. Earlier this year, I signed an Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship, which protects and fosters freedom of expression for Americans on social media and other platforms and also seeks to combat human rights abuses abroad like the mass imprisonment of religious minorities in China, which are often obscured by a cloud of false information online. Additionally, I recently signed an Executive Order on Advancing International Religious Freedom, which prioritizes this fundamental freedom in American diplomacy and recognizes that advancing religious freedom abroad is vital to combating rising levels of violence and crimes against humanity around the globe. There is no greater defender of liberty than the United States, and we will remain steadfast in our efforts. During Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we cherish the unique story of our Nation and celebrate the patriots who helped our country secure our fundamental rights, freedoms, and values for ourselves and our posterity. We also take pride in the role that this heritage has played in advancing and protecting human rights around the world. America's commitment to individual liberty and human dignity is at our very core. We acknowledge that the principles set forth in the Bill of Rights are foundational, and we recommit to ensuring their legacy in our country as we continue to lead the way toward stronger human rights protections around the world. [[Page 281]] NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2020, as Human Rights Day; December 15, 2020, as Bill of Rights Day, and the week beginning on December 6, 2020, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10125 of December 4, 2020 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On the morning of December 7, 1941, Imperial Japanese forces ambushed the Naval Station Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Tragically, 2,403 Americans perished during the attack, including 68 civilians. On this National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we solemnly honor and uphold the memory of the patriots who lost their lives that day--``a date which will live in infamy''--and we reflect on the courage of all those who served our Nation with honor in the Second World War. Seventy nine years ago, Imperial Japan launched an unprovoked and devastating attack on our Nation. As torpedo bombers unleashed their deadly cargo on our ships and attack aircraft rained bombs from above, brave members of the United States Navy, Marines, Army, and Army Air Forces mounted a heroic defense, manning their battle stations and returning fire through the smoke and chaos. The profound bravery in the American resistance surprised Japanese aircrews and inspired selfless sacrifice among our service members. In one instance, Machinist's Mate First Class Robert R. Scott, among 15 Sailors awarded the Medal of Honor for acts of valor on that day, refused to leave his flooding battle station within the depths of the USS CALIFORNIA, declaring to the world: ``This is my station and I will stay and give them air as long as the guns are going.'' Forever enshrined in our history, the attack on Pearl Harbor shocked all Americans and galvanized our Nation to fight and defeat the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. As Americans, we promise never to forget our fallen compatriots who fought so valiantly during World War II. As a testament to their memory, more than a million people visit the site of the USS ARIZONA Memorial each year to pay their respects to the Sailors entombed within its wreckage and to all who perished that day. Despite facing tremendous adversity, the Pacific Fleet, whose homeport remains at Pearl Harbor to this day, is stronger than ever before, upholding the legacy of all those who gave their lives nearly 80 years ago. On this National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we recall the phrase ``Remember Pearl Harbor,'' which stirred the fighting spirit within the [[Page 282]] hearts of the more than 16 million Americans who courageously served in World War II. Over 400,000 gave their lives in the global conflict that began, for our Nation, on that fateful Sunday morning. Today, we memorialize all those lost on December 7, 1941, declare once again that our Nation will never forget these valiant heroes, and resolve as firmly as ever that their memory and spirit will survive for as long as our Nation endures. The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2020, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10126 of December 4, 2020 Recognizing the Sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco Over the Western Sahara By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The United States affirms, as stated by previous Administrations, its support for Morocco's autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the dispute over the Western Sahara territory. Therefore, as of today, the United States recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the entire Western Sahara territory and reaffirms its support for Morocco's serious, credible, and realistic autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the dispute over the Western Sahara territory. The United States believes that an independent Sahrawi State is not a realistic option for resolving the conflict and that genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution. We urge the parties to engage in discussions without delay, using Morocco's autonomy plan as the only framework to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution. To facilitate progress toward this aim, the United States will encourage economic and social development with Morocco, including in the Western Sahara territory, and to that end will open a consulate in the Western Sahara territory, in Dakhla, to promote economic and business opportunities for the region. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that, the United States [[Page 283]] recognizes that the entire Western Sahara territory is part of the Kingdom of Morocco. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10127 of December 16, 2020 Wright Brothers Day, 2020 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On this day 117 years ago, for a few short seconds over 120 feet of wind-swept beach in North Carolina, Orville Wright became the first person to achieve sustained, controlled, powered, and manned flight, forever altering the course of human history. The flying machine Orville piloted, which he and his brother Wilbur designed and constructed following years of research and testing, propelled mankind off the ground and into the skies. Today, we honor these tenacious and intrepid pioneers who paved the way for American leadership in aviation. The story of the Wright Brothers reflects the quintessential American values of perseverance, courage, and sheer grit. Neither Wilbur nor Orville graduated high school. Both brothers, however, possessed a fascination with new technology and mechanics. They taught themselves engineering through their work in their bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Using a homemade wind tunnel, they collected data and developed new designs for propellers and wings, oversaw the creation of a new, specially made engine, and invented an innovative system for steering manned aircraft, solving problems that had plagued previous attempts at powered flight. Through trial and error and hundreds of test flights in gliders and prototypes, the Wright Brothers, in true American fashion, pushed beyond the boundaries of human discovery and exploration. Their tireless dedication and unyielding determination testify to the power of human ingenuity and produced a revolution in transportation, national defense, and global economic development. The Wright Brothers' pursuits also established America's role as the world's foremost aviation leader and set the stage for future generations of American flight heroes. Just 24 years after the Wright Brothers' first flight, Charles Lindbergh became the first person to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean, and 5 years later Amelia Earhart became the first woman to accomplish that same feat. Just a few weeks ago, our Nation mourned the loss of another aviation legend, Brigadier General Chuck Yeager. In a rocket plane named ``Glamorous Glennis'' after his beloved wife, Yeager flew at speeds in excess of 700 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier for the first time in human history. This incredible feat occurred a mere 44 years after the Wright Brothers' first flight achieved a top airspeed of just 34 miles per hour. In 1969, 22 years after Yeager's flight, Neil Armstrong, an Ohioan like the Wright Brothers, became the first person to ever [[Page 284]] set foot on the lunar surface, thrusting American leadership in flight beyond the Earth's atmosphere. And, earlier this year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched a commercially built and operated spacecraft to the International Space Station from American soil for the first time. With the same spirit that took the Wright Brothers into the sky, our brave astronauts are once again redefining the limits of human knowledge and discovery. December 17th is forever enshrined as the day the Wright Brothers launched a new era of American greatness. Today, as we reflect on the immeasurable influence the Wright Brothers had upon our society and the world, we resolve to continue breaking barriers, setting new horizons, and building a better and brighter future for all. In the years to come, Americans must continue to press further on the boundaries of sky and space and forge new frontiers for American success, just as Orville and Wilbur Wright courageously did more than a century ago. The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2020, as Wright Brothers Day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10128 of December 22, 2020 To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and for Other Purposes By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. In Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010, the President determined that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act''), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (the ``AGOA'') (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251, 257-58 (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1))). Thus, pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)), the President terminated the designation of the DRC as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act. 2. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' if the President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the [[Page 285]] AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462). 3. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act, based on actions that the Government of the DRC has taken, I have determined that the DRC meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA and the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act, and I have determined to designate the DRC as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. 4. Section 112(c) of the AGOA, as amended in section 6002 of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (division D of title VI of Public Law 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922, 3190-93 (19 U.S.C. 3721(c))), provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported from ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.'' 5. I have also determined that the DRC satisfies the criterion for treatment as a ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' under section 112(c) of the AGOA. 6. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (the ``USIFTA''), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Act'') (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19 U.S.C. 2112 note)). 7. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA. 8. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 Agreement''). 9. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. 10. Each year from 2008 through 2019, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. 11. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010; Proclamation 8770 of December 29, [[Page 286]] 2011; Proclamation 8921 of December 20, 2012; Proclamation 9072 of December 23, 2013; Proclamation 9223 of December 23, 2014; Proclamation 9383 of December 21, 2015; Proclamation 9555 of December 15, 2016; Proclamation 9687 of December 22, 2017; Proclamation 9834 of December 21, 2018; and Proclamation 9974 of December 26, 2019, modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTS'') to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1- year period. 12. On December 3, 2020, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2021, and to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. 13. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2021, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, as provided in Annex I of this proclamation. 14. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 15. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, as amended (the ``CBERA''), (title II of Public Law 98-67, 97 Stat. 384 (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.)), instituted a duty preference program that applies to a product of a Caribbean Basin country that has been designated by the President as a beneficiary country. On October 10, 2020, the President signed into law the Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (Public Law 116-164, 134 Stat. 758), which extends certain preferential tariff treatment accorded under the CBERA to September 30, 2030. I have determined, pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act, that it is necessary to modify the HTS to reflect the extension of the CBERA. 16. On August 21, 2020, in accordance with section 103(a)(2) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (the ``Trade Priorities Act'') (title I of Public Law 114-26, 129 Stat. 319, 333 (19 U.S.C. 4202(a)(2))), I notified the Congress that I intended to enter into an agreement regarding tariff barriers with the European Union under section 103(a) of the Trade Priorities Act. On November 20, 2020, the United States entered into such an agreement with the European Union. 17. Section 103(a)(1) of the Trade Priorities Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modification of any existing duty as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out a trade agreement entered into under section 103(a). The President generally may proclaim such modification provided that the modification does not reduce the rate of duty to a rate that is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applied on June 29, 2015; does not reduce the rate of duty below that applicable under the Uruguay Round Agreements or a successor agreement on any import-sensitive agricultural product; and does not increase the rate of duty above the rate of such duty that applied on June 29, 2015. [[Page 287]] 18. Pursuant to section 103(a) of the Trade Priorities Act, I have determined that it is required and appropriate to modify existing duties with respect to certain goods to carry out the agreement regarding tariff barriers with the European Union for such time as the European Union carries out the agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 506A(a)(1) and section 604 of the Trade Act; sections 111(a) and 112(c) of the AGOA; section 6002 of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006; section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act; and section 103(a) of the Trade Priorities Act, do proclaim that: (1) The DRC is designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act. (2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ``Democratic Republic of the Congo''. (3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, the DRC is a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. (4) In order to provide the tariff treatment intended under section 112(c) of the AGOA, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ``Democratic Republic of the Congo''. (5) The modifications to the HTS set forth in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2021. (6) In order to implement United States tariff commitments under the 2004 Agreement through December 31, 2021, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I of this proclamation. (7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex I of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to eligible agricultural products of Israel that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2021. (8) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as modified by Annex I of this proclamation, shall continue in effect through December 31, 2021. (9) In order to reflect in the HTS the provisions of the extension of the CBERA, general note 17(f)(i) is modified by deleting ``September 30, 2020'' and inserting, in lieu thereof, ``September 30, 2030''. (10) In order to modify duties on certain goods to carry out the agreement regarding tariff barriers with the European Union, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation. (11) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex II to this proclamation shall enter into effect on the dates indicated in Annex II and remain in effect until the date on which the European Union ceases to carry out [[Page 288]] the agreement, as determined by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in a notice published in the Federal Register. The HTS shall be modified to revert to the duty rate in effect on July 31, 2020, for each subheading identified in Annex II, effective on that date as determined by the USTR. The USTR shall publish notice of such a determination in the Federal Register. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD 28, 2020 850th Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Today is the 850th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket on December 29, 1170. Thomas Becket was a statesman, a scholar, a chancellor, a priest, an archbishop, and a lion of religious liberty. Before the Magna Carta was drafted, before the right to free exercise of religion was enshrined as America's first freedom in our glorious Constitution, Thomas gave his life so that, as he said, ``the Church will attain liberty and peace.'' The son of a London sheriff and once described as ``a low-born clerk'' by the King who had him killed, Thomas Becket rose to become the leader of the church in England. When the crown attempted to encroach upon the affairs of the house of God through the Constitutions of Clarendon, Thomas refused to sign the offending document. When the furious King Henry II threatened to hold him in contempt of royal authority and questioned why this ``poor and humble'' priest would dare defy him, Archbishop Becket responded ``God is the supreme ruler, above Kings'' and ``we ought to obey God rather than men.'' Because Thomas would not assent to rendering the church subservient to the state, he was forced to forfeit all his property and flee his own country. Years later, after the intervention of the Pope, Becket was allowed to return--and continued to resist the King's oppressive interferences into the life of the church. Finally, the King had enough of Thomas Becket's stalwart defense of religious faith and reportedly exclaimed in consternation: ``Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?'' The King's knights responded and rode to Canterbury Cathedral to deliver Thomas Becket an ultimatum: give in to the King's demands or die. Thomas's reply echoes around the world and across the ages. His last words on this earth were these: ``For the name of Jesus and the protection of the Church, I am ready to embrace death.'' Dressed in holy robes, Thomas was cut down where he stood inside the walls of his own church. Thomas Becket's martyrdom changed the course of history. It eventually brought about numerous constitutional limitations on the power of the state over the Church across the West. In England, Becket's murder led to the Magna Carta's declaration 45 years later that: ``[T]he English church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.'' When the Archbishop refused to allow the King to interfere in the affairs of the Church, Thomas Becket stood at the intersection of church and state. That stand, after centuries of state-sponsored religious oppression and religious wars throughout Europe, eventually led to the establishment of religious liberty in the New World. It is because of great men like Thomas Becket that the first American President George Washington could proclaim more than 600 years later that, in the United States, ``All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship'' and that ``it is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class [[Page 292]] of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.'' Thomas Becket's death serves as a powerful and timeless reminder to every American that our freedom from religious persecution is not a mere luxury or accident of history, but rather an essential element of our liberty. It is our priceless treasure and inheritance. And it was bought with the blood of martyrs. As Americans, we were first united by our belief that ``rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God'' and that defending liberty is more important than life itself. If we are to continue to be the land of the free, no government official, no governor, no bureaucrat, no judge, and no legislator must be allowed to decree what is orthodox in matters of religion or to require religious believers to violate their consciences. No right is more fundamental to a peaceful, prosperous, and virtuous society than the right to follow one's religious convictions. As I declared in Krasi[nacute]ski Square in Warsaw, Poland on July 6, 2017, the people of America and the people of the world still cry out: ``We want God.'' On this day, we celebrate and revere Thomas Becket's courageous stand for religious liberty and we reaffirm our call to end religious persecution worldwide. In my historic address to the United Nations last year, I made clear that America stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts. I also stated that global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life, reflecting the belief held by the United States and many other countries that every child--born and unborn--is a sacred gift from God. Earlier this year, I signed an Executive Order to prioritize religious freedom as a core dimension of United States foreign policy. We have directed every Ambassador--and the over 13,000 United States Foreign Service officers and specialists--in more than 195 countries to promote, defend, and support religious freedom as a central pillar of American diplomacy. We pray for religious believers everywhere who suffer persecution for their faith. We especially pray for their brave and inspiring shepherds--like Cardinal Joseph Zen of Hong Kong and Pastor Wang Yi of Chengdu--who are tireless witnesses to hope. To honor Thomas Becket's memory, the crimes against people of faith must stop, prisoners of conscience must be released, laws restricting freedom of religion and belief must be repealed, and the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed must be protected. The tyranny and murder that shocked the conscience of the Middle Ages must never be allowed to happen again. As long as America stands, we will always defend religious liberty. A society without religion cannot prosper. A nation without faith cannot endure--because justice, goodness, and peace cannot prevail without the grace of God. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 29, 2020, as the 850th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket. I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches [[Page 293]] and customary places of meeting with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the life and legacy of Thomas Becket. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10130 of December 31, 2020 National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2021 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Human trafficking is a horrific assault on human dignity that affects people in the United States and around the world. It tears apart communities, fuels criminal activity, and threatens the national security of the United States. During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we reaffirm our commitment to eradicate this abhorrent evil, to support victims and survivors, and to hold traffickers accountable for their heinous crimes. Tragically, through force, fraud, and coercion, human traffickers deprive millions of victims of their unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Often referred to as ``modern slavery,'' this intolerable blight on society involves exploitation for labor or sex and affects people of all ages, genders, races, religions, and nationalities. As the United States continues to lead the global fight against human trafficking, we must remain relentless in our resolve to dismantle this illicit and immoral enterprise in our cities, suburbs, rural communities, Tribal lands, and transportation networks. My Administration has prioritized ending human trafficking since its earliest days. As one of my first acts as President, I instructed Federal agencies to do what was necessary to bring human traffickers to justice and assist survivors on their road to recovery. Since then, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with other Federal agencies, has aggressively pursued these criminals, dismantling the financial infrastructure of their networks and arresting over 5,000 human traffickers. In 2019 alone, Federal law enforcement agencies initiated more than 1,600 new investigations into human traffickers and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) human trafficking task forces opened more than 2,500 new cases on the frontlines. At my direction, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched its new Center for Countering Human Trafficking, which utilizes personnel from 16 DHS components, including special agents, victim support specialists, and intelligence research specialists, to focus on disrupting and dismantling trafficking organizations and providing support and protection to victims. A year ago, I was proud to host the White House Summit on Human Trafficking, honoring the 20th anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection [[Page 294]] Act of 2000 (TVPA). During this historic event, I signed an Executive Order on Combating Human Trafficking and Online Child Exploitation in the United States. Through this order, my Administration established the first-ever White House position focused solely on combating human trafficking. Last year, I also released a comprehensive National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking (NAP), built around the ``three pillars'' of the TVPA: prevention, protection, and prosecution. The NAP also includes a fourth pillar which recognizes the invaluable benefit of implementing collaborative and cooperative efforts that crosscut all three pillars and involve a multitude of stakeholders and professionals from various disciplines and sectors. Using this strategy, the United States Government will employ a whole-of-government approach to improve our capabilities and build on existing momentum in our fight against human trafficking. We remain focused on ensuring that survivors of these horrific crimes receive the care and support they need and deserve. My Administration is empowering and funding faith-based and community organizations to provide survivors with vital services, including medical and counseling services, safety planning, educational opportunities, and vocational training. Further, my Administration has doubled the amount of DOJ funding to combat human trafficking compared to the previous administration and funded the largest package of DOJ grants to fight these crimes in American history. I am proud that these grants included the first-ever funding for safe housing opportunities for survivors nationwide. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic this year, my Administration has been unwavering in its efforts to stop this scourge domestically and around the world. The DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services engaged with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments and nongovernmental organizations to understand the impact of coronavirus on human trafficking and published resource guides for those in the fight on how to operate and provide services during the pandemic. The Department of State also launched a year-long competition for proposed projects to address the pandemic's impact on efforts to combat modern slavery. Additionally, the United States Agency for International Development adapted their approach to overseas programmatic work to ensure that survivors are able to access the critical support services they need without delay. No matter the circumstances, we will remain relentless in this work and will spare no resource in offering hope to the victims and survivors of this global atrocity. While we have reached new milestones in this fight for freedom, we must remain steadfast in our pursuit to end the evil practice of human trafficking and slavery. This month, we restore our commitment to bringing human traffickers to justice and to preserving the dignity and worth of every person. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do proclaim January 2021 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in the annual observation of National Freedom Day on February 1, 2021. I call upon industry associations, law enforcement, private businesses, faith- based and other organizations of civil society, survivors and advocates, schools, families, and all Americans to recognize our vital roles in ending all forms of modern [[Page 295]] slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities aimed at ending and preventing all forms of human trafficking. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP Proclamation 10131 of December 31, 2020 Suspension of Entry of Immigrants and Nonimmigrants Who Continue To Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In Proclamation 10014 of April 22, 2020 (Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak), I suspended, for a period of 60 days, the entry of aliens as immigrants, subject to certain exceptions. In Proclamation 10052 of June 22, 2020 (Suspension of Entry of Immigrants and Nonimmigrants Who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak), I determined that the considerations present in Proclamation 10014 remained, and I extended the suspension of entry imposed in Proclamation 10014 through December 31, 2020. I further noted that the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security had reviewed nonimmigrant programs and found that the admission of workers within several nonimmigrant visa categories also posed a risk of displacing and disadvantaging United States workers during the economic recovery following the COVID-19 outbreak. Consequently, I suspended, through December 31, 2020, the entry of any alien seeking entry pursuant to certain nonimmigrants visas, subject to certain exceptions. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to significantly disrupt Americans' livelihoods. While the November overall unemployment rate in the United States of 6.7 percent reflects a marked decline from its April high, there were still 9,834,000 fewer seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs in November than in February of 2020. The effects of COVID-19 on the United States labor market and on the health of American communities is a matter of ongoing national concern, and the considerations present in Proclamations 10014 and 10052 have not been eliminated. The current number of new daily cases worldwide reported by the World Health Organization, for example, is higher than the comparable number present during June, and while therapeutics and vaccines are recently available for an increasing number of Americans, their [[Page 296]] effect on the labor market and community health has not yet been fully realized. Moreover, actions such as States' continued imposition of restrictions on businesses still affect the number of workers that can be hired as compared with February of 2020. Given these factors, an extension of Proclamations 10014 and 10052 is appropriate as the President continues to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and assess whether a further continuation, modification, or termination of Proclamations 10014 and 10052 is warranted. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of Proclamation 10014, except as provided in section 2 of Proclamation 10014, and persons described in section 2 of Proclamation 10052, except as provided for in section 3 of Proclamation 10052 (as amended by Proclamation 10054 of June 29, 2020 (Amendment to Proclamation 10052)), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Continuation of Proclamation 10014. Section 4 of Proclamation 10014 is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 4. Termination. This proclamation shall expire on March 31, 2021, and may be continued as necessary. Within 15 days of December 31, 2020, and every 30 days thereafter while this proclamation is in effect, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Labor, recommend any modifications as may be necessary.'' Sec. 2. Continuation of Proclamation 10052. Section 6 of Proclamation 10052 is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 6. Termination. This proclamation shall expire on March 31, 2021, and may be continued as necessary. Within 15 days of December 31, 2020, and every 30 days thereafter while this proclamation is in effect, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Labor, recommend any modifications as may be necessary.'' Sec. 3. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders. [[Page 297]] Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP [[Page 299]] ________________________________________________________________________ EXECUTIVE ORDERS ________________________________________________________________________ Executive Order 13902 of January 10, 2020 Imposing Sanctions With Respect to Additional Sectors of Iran By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that Iran continues to be the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and that Iran has threatened United States military assets and civilians through the use of military force and support to Iranian-backed militia groups. It remains the policy of the United States to deny Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and to counter the totality of Iran's malign influence in the region. In furtherance of these objectives, it is the policy of the United States to deny the Iranian government revenues, including revenues derived from the export of products from key sectors of Iran's economy, that may be used to fund and support its nuclear program, missile development, terrorism and terrorist proxy networks, and malign regional influence. In light of these findings and in order to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, I hereby order: Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State: (i) to operate in the construction, mining, manufacturing, or textiles sectors of the Iranian economy, or any other sector of the Iranian economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State; [[Page 300]] (ii) to have knowingly engaged, on or after the date of this order, in a significant transaction for the sale, supply, or transfer to or from Iran of significant goods or services used in connection with a sector of the Iranian economy specified in, or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, pursuant to, subsection (a)(i) of this section; (iii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or (iv) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (b) The prohibitions in this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to impose on a foreign financial institution the sanctions described in subsection (b) of this section upon determining that the foreign financial institution has, on or after the date of this order, knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant financial transaction: (i) for the sale, supply, or transfer to or from Iran of significant goods or services used in connection with a sector of the Iranian economy specified in, or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, pursuant to, section 1(a)(i) of this order; or (ii) for or on behalf of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order. (b) With respect to any foreign financial institution determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, in accordance with this section to meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury may prohibit the opening, and prohibit or impose strict conditions on the maintaining, in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account by such foreign financial institution. (c) The prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 3. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this [[Page 301]] responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair the President's ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. Sec. 5. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include: (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 6. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order: (a) The term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; (b) the term ``foreign financial institution'' means any foreign entity that is engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making, granting, transferring, holding, or brokering loans or credits, or purchasing or selling foreign exchange, securities, commodity futures or options, or procuring purchasers and sellers thereof, as principal or agent. The term includes, but is not limited to, depository institutions, banks, savings banks, money service businesses, trust companies, securities brokers and dealers, commodity futures and options brokers and dealers, forward contract and foreign exchange merchants, securities and commodities exchanges, clearing corporations, investment companies, employee benefit plans, dealers in precious metals, stones, or jewels, and holding companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries of any of the foregoing. The term does not include the international financial institutions identified in 22 U.S.C. 262r(c)(2), the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the North American Development Bank, or any other international financial institution so notified by the Secretary of the Treasury; [[Page 302]] (c) the term ``Government of Iran'' includes the Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran; (d) the term ``Iran'' means the Government of Iran and the territory of Iran and any other territory or marine area, including the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran claims sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, provided that the Government of Iran exercises partial or total de facto control over the area or derives a benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant to international arrangements; (e) the term ``knowingly,'' with respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a result, means that a person has actual knowledge, or should have known, of the conduct, the circumstance, or the result; (f) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; and (g) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order. Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 10. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. [[Page 303]] Sec. 11. This order shall not apply with respect to any person for conducting or facilitating a transaction for the provision (including any sale) of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran. Sec. 12. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programmes, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. Sec. 13. The measures taken pursuant to this order are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those later actions. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, January 10, 2020. Executive Order 13903 of January 31, 2020 Combating Human Trafficking and Online Child Exploitation in the United States By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. Human trafficking is a form of modern slavery. Throughout the United States and around the world, human trafficking tears apart communities, fuels criminal activity, and threatens the national security of the United States. It is estimated that millions of individuals are trafficked around the world each year--including into and within the United States. As the United States continues to lead the global fight against human trafficking, we must remain relentless in resolving to eradicate it in our cities, suburbs, rural communities, tribal lands, and on our transportation networks. Human trafficking in the United States takes many forms and can involve exploitation of both adults and children for labor and sex. Twenty-first century technology and the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices have helped facilitate the crime of child sex trafficking and other forms of child exploitation. Consequently, the number of reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of online photos and videos of children being sexually abused is at record levels. The Federal Government is committed to preventing human trafficking and the online sexual exploitation of children. Effectively combating these crimes requires a comprehensive and coordinated response to prosecute human traffickers and individuals who sexually exploit children online, to protect and support victims of human trafficking and child exploitation, and to provide prevention education to raise awareness and help lower the incidence of human trafficking and child exploitation into, from, and within the United States. [[Page 304]] To this end, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to prioritize its resources to vigorously prosecute offenders, to assist victims, and to provide prevention education to combat human trafficking and online sexual exploitation of children. Sec. 2. Strengthening Federal Responsiveness to Human Trafficking. (a) The Domestic Policy Council shall commit one employee position to work on issues related to combating human trafficking occurring into, from, and within the United States and to coordinate with personnel in other components of the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of Economic Initiatives and the National Security Council, on such efforts. This position shall be filled by an employee of the executive branch detailed from the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, or the Department of Homeland Security. (b) The Secretary of State, on behalf of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, shall make available, online, a list of the Federal Government's resources to combat human trafficking, including resources to identify and report instances of human trafficking, to protect and support the victims of trafficking, and to provide public outreach and training. (c) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in coordination and consistent with applicable law: (i) improve methodologies of estimating the prevalence of human trafficking, including in specific sectors or regions, and monitoring the impact of anti-trafficking efforts and publish such methodologies as appropriate; and (ii) establish estimates of the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States. Sec. 3. Prosecuting Human Traffickers and Individuals Who Exploit Children Online. (a) The Attorney General, through the Federal Enforcement Working Group, in collaboration with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall: (i) improve interagency coordination with respect to targeting traffickers, determining threat assessments, and sharing law enforcement intelligence to build on the Administration's commitment to the continued success of ongoing anti-trafficking enforcement initiatives, such as the Anti- Trafficking Coordination Team and the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Human Trafficking Enforcement Initiatives; and (ii) coordinate activities, as appropriate, with the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives as established by Executive Order 13898 of November 26, 2019 (Establishing the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives). (b) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other heads of executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall, within 180 days of the date of this order, propose to the President, through the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, legislative and executive actions that would overcome information-sharing challenges and improve law enforcement's capabilities to detect in real-time the sharing of child sexual abuse material on the internet, including material referred to in Federal law [[Page 305]] as ``child pornography.'' Overcoming these challenges would allow law enforcement officials to more efficiently identify, protect, and rescue victims of online child sexual exploitation; investigate and prosecute alleged offenders; and eliminate the child sexual abuse material online. Sec. 4. Protecting Victims of Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation. (a) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other heads of executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall work together to enhance capabilities to locate children who are missing, including those who have run away from foster care and those previously in Federal custody, and are vulnerable to human trafficking and child exploitation. In doing so, such heads of executive departments and agencies, shall, as appropriate, engage social media companies; the technology industry; State, local, tribal and territorial child welfare agencies; the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; and law enforcement at all levels. (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, shall establish an internal working group to develop and incorporate practical strategies for State, local, and tribal governments, child welfare agencies, and faith-based and other community organizations to expand housing options for victims of human trafficking. Sec. 5. Preventing Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation Through Education Partnerships. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Education, shall partner with State, local, and tribal law enforcement entities to fund human trafficking and child exploitation prevention programs for our Nation's youth in schools, consistent with applicable law and available appropriations. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, January 31, 2020. [[Page 306]] Executive Order 13904 of January 31, 2020 Ensuring Safe and Lawful E-Commerce for United States Consumers, Businesses, Government Supply Chains, and Intellectual Property Rights Holders By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. E-commerce, including transactions involving smaller express-carrier or international mail packages, is being exploited by traffickers to introduce contraband into the United States, and by foreign exporters and United States importers to avoid applicable customs duties, taxes, and fees. It is the policy of the United States Government to protect consumers, intellectual property rights holders, businesses, and workers from counterfeit goods, narcotics (including synthetic opioids such as fentanyl), and other contraband now being introduced into the United States as a result of the recent growth in e-commerce. The United States Government must also protect the revenue of the United States from individuals and entities who evade customs duties, taxes, and fees. It is the policy of the United States Government that any person who knowingly, or with gross negligence, imports, or facilitates the importation of, merchandise into the United States in material violation of Federal law evidences conduct of so serious and compelling a nature that it should be referred to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security for a determination whether such conduct affects that person's present responsibility to participate in transactions with the Federal Government. It is the policy of the United States Government, as reflected in Executive Order 12549 of February 18, 1986 (Debarment and Suspension), and elsewhere, to protect the public interest and ensure the integrity of Federal programs by transacting only with presently responsible persons. In furtherance of this policy, the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system enables executive departments and agencies to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible. CBP implements this system by suspending and debarring persons who flout the customs laws, among other persons who lack present responsibility. To achieve the policy goals stated herein, the United States Government shall consider all appropriate actions that it can take to ensure that persons that CBP suspends or debars are excluded from participating in the importation of merchandise into the United States. It is the policy of the United States Government that express consignment operators, carriers, hub facilities, international posts, customs brokers, and other entities, including e-commerce platform operators, should not facilitate importation involving persons who are suspended or debarred by CBP. It is the policy of the United States Government to ensure that parcels containing contraband be kept outside of the United States to the greatest extent possible and that all parties who participate in the introduction or attempted introduction of such parcels into the United States be held accountable under the laws of the United States. [[Page 307]] Sec. 2. Criteria for the Importer of Record Program, Including Exclusion of Trade Violators. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish criteria importers must meet in order to obtain an importer of record number. (b) Such criteria shall include a criterion providing that any person debarred or suspended by CBP for lack of present responsibility for reasons related to importation or trade shall be ineligible to obtain an importer of record number for the duration of such person's suspension or debarment by CBP. Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Express Consignment Operators, Carriers, Hub Facilities, and Licensed Customs Brokers. (a) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, shall take steps to ensure that, within 60 days of the publication in the System for Award Management by CBP of the name of any debarred or suspended person, express consignment operators, carriers, hub facilities, and licensed customs brokers notify CBP of any attempt, of which they know or have reason to believe, by any persons who may not obtain an importer of record number based on any criteria established by the Secretary under section 2 of this order, to re-establish business activity requiring an importer of record number through a different name or address associated with the debarred or suspended person. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, shall consider appropriate measures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure that express consignment operators, carriers, hub facilities, and licensed customs brokers cease to facilitate business activity that requires an importer of record number by any person who may not obtain an importer of record number, as provided by any criteria established by the Secretary under section 2 of this order. Depending on the criteria established, such consideration shall include whether CBP may take any of the following measures: limiting an express consignment operator's, carrier's, or hub facility's participation in any CBP trusted trader programs; taking appropriate action with regard to an express consignment operator's, carrier's, or hub facility's operating privileges; or suspending or revoking a customs broker's license. Sec. 4. Items Sent to the United States through the International Postal Network. (a) The United States Postal Service (USPS) should collaborate with the Secretary of State to notify the international postal network, via circular or the functional equivalent, of the policy of the United States Government set forth in section 1 of this order and the key provisions of this order. USPS should make all reasonable efforts to include provisions regarding any criteria for participating in the importer of record program established under section 2 of this order in any new contractual instruments it executes with international posts. (b) Within 90 days from the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, and in consultation with USPS, shall submit to the President a report on any appropriate measures the Federal Government could take, including negotiating with international posts, to prevent the importation or attempted importation into the United States through the international postal network of shipments containing goods, when such importation or attempted importation is known to have been facilitated by any person who may not obtain an importer of [[Page 308]] record number under any criteria established by the Secretary under section 2 of this order. Sec. 5. Non-Compliant International Posts. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, and in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall develop an International Mail Non-Compliance metric, based on relevant factors, to formulate an overall compliance score for each international post. This score shall take into account rates of trafficking of counterfeit goods, narcotics (including synthetic opioids such as fentanyl), and other contraband through a particular international post, effectiveness of the international post in reducing such trafficking, including cooperation with CBP, as well as such other factors the Secretary, through the Commissioner, determines advisable. The Secretary shall update overall compliance scores on a quarterly basis. The Secretary shall determine a minimum threshold compliance score for each quarter and shall deem non- compliant any international post that scores below such threshold in that quarter. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall prioritize targeted inspection of imports into the United States from any international post that for two or more consecutive quarters is deemed a non-compliant international post. (c) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with USPS, may require additional information for any shipment from any international post that for six or more consecutive quarters is deemed a non-compliant international post. The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law and international agreements, implement all appropriate measures to prevent importation into the United States of any shipments dispatched from any international post that is deemed a non-compliant international post for six or more consecutive quarters and for which the additional information required consistent with this subsection is not promptly provided. USPS should collaborate with CBP in implementing these measures. (d) The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, and in consultation with USPS, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, take measures to protect the United States from shipments from any international post that for eight or more consecutive quarters is deemed a non-compliant international post. To the extent consistent with applicable law and as appropriate, such measures might include preventing the importation into the United States of shipments dispatched from such posts, regardless of whether additional information required by CBP is provided. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, and in consultation with USPS, shall submit a report to the President analyzing what measures CBP may take consistent with its existing authorities. (e) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish and regularly update appropriate guidance related to CBP's implementation of this section, including the process by which an international post is deemed a non-compliant international post and the process by which an international post is removed from the list of non-compliant international posts. [[Page 309]] Sec. 6. Publication of Violation Information; Enhanced Enforcement Efforts. (a) On a periodic basis, and consistent with Federal law and executive branch policy reflecting non-disclosure of sensitive information, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of CBP and the Director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall publish information about seizures arising in the international mail and express consignment environments that involve intellectual property rights violations, illegal drugs and other contraband, incorrect country of origin, under-valuation, or other violations of law of particular concern. In determining which information to publish, the Secretary shall give greatest consideration to repeat offenses affecting priority trade issues as defined in 19 U.S.C. 4322. (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall assign appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecuting offenses related to import violations as described in this order, including, as appropriate and within existing appropriations, increasing the number of Department of Justice officials who will enforce criminal or civil laws, as appropriate, related to the importation of merchandise. Sec. 7. Report on Sufficiency of Fees. Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the heads of other executive departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall submit a report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget: (a) analyzing whether the fees collected by CBP are currently set at a sufficient level to reimburse the Federal Government's costs associated with processing, inspecting, and collecting duties, taxes, and fees for parcels; and (b) providing recommendations, consistent with applicable law, regarding any fee adjustments that are necessary to reimburse the Federal Government's costs associated with processing, inspecting, and collecting duties, taxes, and fees for parcels. Sec. 8. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) ``Customs broker'' has the meaning given to that term in 19 U.S.C. 1641(a)(1). (b) ``Express consignment operator, carrier, or hub facility'' has the meaning given to those terms in 19 CFR 128.1. (c) ``International post'' means any foreign public or private entity providing various types of postal services, including mailing and delivery services. (d) ``Contraband'' has the meaning given to that term in 49 U.S.C. 80302(a), and also means any goods or merchandise otherwise prohibited from importation or entry under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. (e) ``E-commerce platform'' means any web-based platform that includes features primarily designed for arranging the sale, purchase, payment, or shipping of goods, or that enables sellers not directly affiliated with an operator of a web-based platform to sell physical goods through the web to consumers located in the United States. [[Page 310]] (f) ``Person'' means any individual, corporation, partnership, association, or legal entity, however organized. Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, January 31, 2020. Executive Order 13905 of February 12, 2020 Strengthening National Resilience Through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable and efficient functioning of critical infrastructure. Since the United States made the Global Positioning System available worldwide, positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services provided by space-based systems have become a largely invisible utility for technology and infrastructure, including the electrical power grid, communications infrastructure and mobile devices, all modes of transportation, precision agriculture, weather forecasting, and emergency response. Because of the widespread adoption of PNT services, the disruption or manipulation of these services has the potential to adversely affect the national and economic security of the United States. To strengthen national resilience, the Federal Government must foster the responsible use of PNT services by critical infrastructure owners and operators. Sec. 2. Definitions. As used in this order: (a) ``PNT services'' means any system, network, or capability that provides a reference to calculate or augment the calculation of longitude, latitude, altitude, or transmission of time or frequency data, or any combination thereof. (b) ``Responsible use of PNT services'' means the deliberate, risk- informed use of PNT services, including their acquisition, integration, and [[Page 311]] deployment, such that disruption or manipulation of PNT services minimally affects national security, the economy, public health, and the critical functions of the Federal Government. (c) ``Critical infrastructure'' means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or on any combination of those matters. (d) ``PNT profile'' means a description of the responsible use of PNT services--aligned to standards, guidelines, and sector-specific requirements--selected for a particular system to address the potential disruption or manipulation of PNT services. (e) ``Sector-Specific Agency'' (SSA) is the executive department or agency that is responsible for providing institutional knowledge and specialized expertise as well as leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and resilience programs and associated activities of its designated critical infrastructure sector in the all-hazards environment. The SSAs are those identified in Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience). Sec. 3. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that disruption or manipulation of PNT services does not undermine the reliable and efficient functioning of its critical infrastructure. The Federal Government must increase the Nation's awareness of the extent to which critical infrastructure depends on, or is enhanced by, PNT services, and it must ensure critical infrastructure can withstand disruption or manipulation of PNT services. To this end, the Federal Government shall engage the public and private sectors to identify and promote the responsible use of PNT services. Sec. 4. Implementation. (a) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the heads of SSAs and in consultation, as appropriate, with the private sector, shall develop and make available, to at least the appropriate agencies and private sector users, PNT profiles. The PNT profiles will enable the public and private sectors to identify systems, networks, and assets dependent on PNT services; identify appropriate PNT services; detect the disruption and manipulation of PNT services; and manage the associated risks to the systems, networks, and assets dependent on PNT services. Once made available, the PNT profiles shall be reviewed every 2 years and, as necessary, updated. (b) The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Transportation, and Secretary of Homeland Security shall refer to the PNT profiles created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in updates to the Federal Radionavigation Plan. (c) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the heads of SSAs, shall develop a plan to test the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure systems, networks, and assets in the event of disruption and manipulation of PNT services. The results of the tests carried out under that plan shall be used to inform updates to the PNT profiles identified in subsection (a) of this section. [[Page 312]] (d) Within 90 days of the PNT profiles being made available, the heads of SSAs and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate, through the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop contractual language for inclusion of the relevant information from the PNT profiles in the requirements for Federal contracts for products, systems, and services that integrate or utilize PNT services, with the goal of encouraging the private sector to use additional PNT services and develop new robust and secure PNT services.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, February 28, 2020. Executive Order 13909 of March 18, 2020 Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the ``Act''), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy and Findings. On March 13, 2020, I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our national security. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the spread of COVID-19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare system. To ensure that our healthcare system is able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is critical that all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 are properly distributed to the Nation's healthcare system and others that need them most at this time. Accordingly, I find that health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators, meet the criteria specified in section 101(b) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4511(b)). Under the delegation of authority provided in this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may identify additional specific health and medical resources that meet the criteria of section 101(b). Sec. 2. Priorities and Allocation of Medical Resources. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resource Preparedness), the authority of the President conferred by section 101 of the Act to require performance of contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national defense over performance of any other contracts or orders, to allocate materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense, and to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code, is delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human [[Page 318]] Services with respect to all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services may use the authority under section 101 of the Act to determine, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials (including applicable services) in the civilian market, for responding to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. (c) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue such orders and adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 18, 2020. Executive Order 13910 of March 23, 2020 Preventing Hoarding of Health and Medical Resources To Respond to the Spread of COVID-19 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the ``Act''), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the [[Page 319]] spread of COVID-19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems. To further deal with this threat, on March 18, 2020, I issued Executive Order 13909 (Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19), in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) the prioritization and allocation authority under section 101 of the Act with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19. To ensure that our Nation's healthcare systems are able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is the policy of the United States that health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, such as personal protective equipment and sanitizing and disinfecting products, are not hoarded. Accordingly, I am delegating to the Secretary my authority under section 102 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4512) to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. I am also delegating to the Secretary my authority under the Act to implement any restrictions on hoarding, including my authority under section 705 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4555) to gather information, such as information about how supplies of such resources are distributed throughout the Nation. Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority to Prevent Hoarding. (a) The Secretary is delegated the following: (i) the authority of the President conferred by section 102 of the Act to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States, including the authority to prescribe conditions with respect to the accumulation of such resources, and to designate any material as a scarce material, or as a material the supply of which would be threatened by persons accumulating the material either in excess of reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption, or for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market prices; and (ii) the authority of the President to implement the Act contained in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560). (b) In exercising the authority delegated under this section, the Secretary shall consult the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (c) The Secretary shall adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec. 3. Secretarial Duty Concerning Notices of Withdrawal of Designation. The Secretary shall periodically consider whether the designations made pursuant to section 2 of this order remain necessary. Upon finding that the need for such designation of material is no longer necessary, the Secretary shall promptly publish a notice of withdrawal of the designation in the Federal Register, and in such other manner as the Secretary deems appropriate. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or [[Page 320]] (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 23, 2020. Executive Order 13911 of March 27, 2020 Delegating Additional Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Health and Medical Resources To Respond to the Spread of COVID-19 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the ``Act''), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the spread of COVID-19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems. To deal with this threat, on March 18, 2020, I issued Executive Order 13909 (Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19), in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the prioritization and allocation authority under section 101 of the Act with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19. And on March 23, 2020, I issued Executive Order 13910 (Preventing Hoarding of Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19), in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority under section 102 of the Act to combat hoarding and price gouging with respect to such resources. To ensure that our healthcare systems are able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is the policy of the United [[Page 321]] States to expand domestic production of health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators. Accordingly, I am delegating authority under title III of the Act to guarantee loans by private institutions, make loans, make provision for purchases and commitments to purchase, and take additional actions to create, maintain, protect, expand, and restore domestic industrial base capabilities to produce such resources. To enable greater cooperation among private businesses in expanding production of and distributing such resources, I am also delegating my authority under section 708(c) and (d) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4558(c), (d)) to provide for the making of voluntary agreements and plans of action by the private sector. Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority Under Title III of the Act. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each delegated, with respect to responding to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States, the authority of the President conferred by sections 301, 302, and 303 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4531, 4532, and 4533), and the authority to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560). (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security may each use the authority under sections 301, 302, and 303 of the Act, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as he deems appropriate, to respond to the spread of COVID-19. (c) To provide additional authority to respond to the national emergency I declared in Proclamation 9994, the requirements of section 301(a)(2), section 301(d)(1)(A), and section 303(a)(1) through (a)(6) of the Act are waived during the period of that national emergency. (d) To provide additional authority to respond to the national emergency I declared in Proclamation 9994, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each authorized to submit for my approval under section 302(d)(2)(B) of the Act a proposed determination that any specific loan is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. (e) Before exercising the authority delegated under this section with respect to health or medical resources, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Sec. 3. Delegation of Authority Under Title VII of the Act. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each delegated, with respect to responding to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States, the authority of the President conferred by section 708(c)(1) and (d) of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the Secretary of Homeland Security notice of any use of such delegated authority. (b) The delegation made in this section is made upon the condition that the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Homeland Security consult with the Attorney General and with the Federal Trade Commission, and obtain the prior approval of the Attorney General, after consultation by the Attorney General with the Federal Trade Commission, [[Page 322]] as required by section 708(c)(2) of the Act, except when such consultation is waived under subsection (c) of section 3 of this order and section 708(c)(3) of the Act. (c) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each authorized to submit for my approval under section 708(c)(3) of the Act any proposed determination that any specific voluntary agreement or plan of action is necessary to meet national defense requirements resulting from an event that degrades or destroys critical infrastructure. (d) Before exercising the authority delegated under this section with respect to health or medical resources, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Sec. 4. Additional Delegations.

(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security may use the authority under section 101 of the Act to determine, in consultation with the heads of other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of health and medical resources, including by controlling the distribution of such materials (including applicable services) in the civilian market, for responding to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. (d) Before exercising the authority under section 102 of the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. (e) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall periodically consider whether the designations made by him under section 102 of the Act pursuant to section 4(b) of this order remain necessary. Upon finding that such designation of material is no longer necessary, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly publish a notice of withdrawal of the designation in the Federal Register, and in such other manner as he deems appropriate. Sec. 5. Implementing Rules and Regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec. 6.

Sec. 5. Committee Application Review Process. (a) The Committee shall review and assess applications to determine whether granting a license or the transfer of a license poses a risk to national security or law enforcement interests of the United States. (b) Upon referral by the FCC of an application, the Committee shall conduct an initial review of the application to evaluate whether granting the requested license or transfer of license may pose a risk to national security or law enforcement interests of the United States. (i) During the initial review, the Committee may determine: [[Page 327]] (A) that granting an application for a license or the transfer of a license raises no current risk to national security or law enforcement interests; (B) that any identified risk to national security or law enforcement interests raised by an application may be addressed through standard mitigation measures recommended by the Committee; or (C) that a secondary assessment of an application is warranted because risk to national security or law enforcement interests cannot be mitigated by standard mitigation measures. (ii) If the Committee determines that granting the application does not raise a current risk to national security or law enforcement interests or that standard mitigation measures would mitigate any risk to national security or law enforcement interests, such a determination and any recommendations shall be communicated to the FCC in a manner consistent with sections 9 and 10 of this order. (iii) Except as provided in subsection 5(d) of this order, any initial review shall be completed before the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date the Chair determines that the applicant's responses to any questions and information requests from the Committee are complete. (c) When the Committee has determined that a secondary assessment of an application is warranted, it shall conduct such an assessment to further evaluate the risk posed to national security and law enforcement interests of the United States and to determine whether to make any recommendations pursuant to section 9 of this order. Any secondary assessment of an application shall be completed no more than 90 days after the Committee's determination that a secondary assessment is warranted. The Chair shall notify the FCC of a determination that a secondary assessment is warranted. (d) During an initial review under subsection 5(b) of this order or a secondary assessment under subsection 5(c) of this order, if an applicant fails to respond to any additional requests for information after the Chair determines the responses are complete, the Committee may either extend the initial review or secondary assessment period or make a recommendation to the FCC to dismiss the application without prejudice. The Chair shall notify the FCC of a determination that the applicant's responses are complete, of any extensions of the initial review period, or when the Committee recommends dismissal under this subsection. Sec. 6. Committee License Review Process. (a) The Committee may review existing licenses to identify any additional or new risks to national security or law enforcement interests of the United States. (b) The Committee shall determine whether to review an existing license by majority vote of the Committee Members. (c) If the Committee conducts such a review, it shall promptly notify the Committee Advisors. Sec. 7. Threat Analysis by the Director of National Intelligence. (a) For each license or application reviewed by the Committee, the Director of National Intelligence shall produce a written assessment of any threat to national security interests of the United States posed by granting the application or maintaining the license. The Director of National Intelligence shall solicit and incorporate the views of the Intelligence Community, as appropriate. [[Page 328]] (b) The analysis required under subsection (a) of this section shall be provided to the Committee within the earlier of 30 days from the date on which the Chair determines that an applicant's or licensee's responses to any questions and requests for information from the Committee are complete or 30 days from the date on which the Chair requests such an analysis. Such an analysis may be supplemented or amended as appropriate or upon a request for additional information by the Chair. (c) The Director of National Intelligence shall ensure that the Intelligence Community continues to analyze and disseminate to the Committee any additional relevant information that may become available during the course of a review or assessment conducted with respect to an application or license. Sec. 8. Requests for Information. In furtherance of its reviews and assessments of applications and licenses as described in this section, the Committee may seek information from applicants, licensees, and any other entity as needed. Information submitted to the Committee pursuant to this subsection and analysis concerning such information shall not be disclosed beyond Committee Member entities and Committee Advisor entities, except as appropriate and consistent with procedures governing the handling of classified or otherwise privileged or protected information, under the following circumstances: (a) to the extent required by law or for any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, or for law enforcement purposes; (b) to other governmental entities at the discretion of the Chair, provided that such entities make adequate assurances to the Chair that they will not further disclose the shared information, including to members of the public; or (c) to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States with respect to transactions reviewed by that Committee pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 4565, in which case this information and analysis shall be treated consistent with the disclosure protections of 50 U.S.C. 4565(c). Sec. 9. Recommendations by the Committee Pursuant to the Committee Review Process. (a) With respect to applications that are reviewed or assessed pursuant to section 5 of this order, the Committee shall: (i) advise the FCC that the Committee has no recommendation for the FCC on the application and no objection to the FCC granting the license or transfer of the license; (ii) recommend that the FCC deny the application due to the risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States; or (iii) recommend that the FCC only grant the license or transfer of the license contingent on the applicant's compliance with mitigation measures, consistent with section 10 of this order. (b) With respect to a license reviewed pursuant to section 6 of this order, the Committee may, when appropriate: (i) recommend that the FCC modify the license to include a condition of compliance with mitigation measures negotiated by the Committee; (ii) recommend that the FCC revoke the license due to the risk to national security or law enforcement interests of the United States; or (iii) take no action with respect to the license. [[Page 329]] (c) Any recommendation made by the Committee pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be based on a written risk-based analysis, conducted by the Committee Member entity or entities proposing the denial, mitigation measures, modification, revocation, or no action. (d) The Committee shall make the recommendations described in subsections (a)(ii), (a)(iii), (b)(i), and (b)(ii) of this section if it determines that there is credible evidence that the application or license poses a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States. (e) The Committee shall attempt to reach consensus on any recommendation authorized by this order. If senior executive Committee officials designated pursuant to subsection 3(e) of this order cannot reach consensus on a recommendation, the Chair shall present the issue to the Committee Members, who shall determine the Committee recommendation by majority vote. If the vote results in a tie, the Chair shall determine the recommendation. (f) If the Committee's determination is a recommendation to deny an application, to grant an application contingent on compliance with non- standard mitigation measures, to modify a license to condition it upon compliance with non-standard mitigation measures, or to revoke a license, the Chair shall notify the Committee Advisors and, to the extent consistent with applicable law, provide them all available assessments, evaluations, or other analyses regarding such determination. Within 21 days of the notification, the Committee Advisors shall advise the Chair whether they oppose the recommendation. (i) If one or more of the Committee Advisors opposes the recommendation, the senior executives designated by the Committee Members and Committee Advisors shall promptly confer in an effort to reach consensus on a recommendation. If consensus is reached, the recommendation shall be provided to the FCC consistent with subsection 9(h) of this order. (ii) If the senior executives designated by the Committee Members and Committee Advisors do not reach consensus, the Chair shall present the issue to the Committee Members and the Committee Advisors to seek to resolve any objections within 30 days of the notification by the Chair of a recommendation to deny or to grant an application contingent on compliance with non-standard mitigation, or within 60 days in the case of a recommendation to modify a license to condition it upon compliance with non-standard mitigation measures or to revoke a license. Committee Members and Committee Advisors may consider any submissions by the Committee Advisors (e.g., a countervailing risk assessment), as appropriate. (iii) If the Committee Members and Committee Advisors are unable to reach consensus through the foregoing process, the Committee Members identified in subsection 3(b) of this order shall determine a recommendation by majority vote.

The FCC will receive notice of the recommendation, consistent with subsection 9(h) of this order, not earlier than 15 days after the date on which the President is notified of the intended action. (h) Except as provided in subsection (b)(iii) of this section, the Chair, on behalf of the Committee, shall notify the FCC through the Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of a final recommendation made pursuant to this section. The Administrator of NTIA shall notify the FCC of the recommendation within 7 days of the notification from the Chair. (i) As necessary and in accordance with applicable law and policy, including procedures governing the handling of classified or otherwise privileged or protected information, the Committee may consider classified information and otherwise privileged or protected information in determining what recommendation to make to the FCC through the Administrator of NTIA under this section, and may provide such information to the FCC as necessary on an ex parte basis. Sec. 10. Mitigation of Risk and Monitoring. (a) The Committee may recommend to the FCC, consistent with section 9 of this order, that the FCC condition the granting of a license or transfer of a license on compliance with any mitigation measures in order to mitigate a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States arising from the application. (b) The Committee may recommend to the FCC, consistent with section 9 of this order, that the FCC modify a license to condition it upon compliance with any mitigation measures in order to mitigate a risk to national security or law enforcement interests of the United States arising from the license. (c) Consistent with subsection 4(a)(v) of this order, the Chair or assigned Lead Member shall communicate any mitigation measures proposed by the Committee to the applicant or licensee.

(ii) The Committee, in consultation with the FCC, as appropriate, and in a manner that does not unduly constrain Committee resources, shall develop methods for monitoring compliance with any mitigation measures imposed by the FCC as a condition on a license as a result of the Committee's recommendation under subsections (a) through (d) of this section. [[Page 331]] (f) If the Committee determines that a licensee has not complied with a mitigation measure and has not cured any such noncompliance in a satisfactory manner, the Committee may recommend actions consistent with subsection 9(b) of this order. (g) When requested by the Chair, the Director of National Intelligence shall provide analyses assessing threats related to risk mitigation, compliance monitoring, and enforcement to Committee Member entities and Committee Advisor entities that are monitoring compliance with mitigation measures imposed by the FCC as conditions on licenses as a result of Committee recommendations under subsections (a) through (d) of this section. (h) This order does not constrain the discretion of executive departments or agencies, pursuant to any relevant authority not described in this order, to: (i) conduct inquiries with respect to an application or license; (ii) communicate with any applicant, licensee, or other necessary party; or (iii) negotiate, enter into, impose, or enforce contractual provisions with an applicant or licensee. Sec. 11. Implementation. (a) Executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement the provisions of this order. (b) The Department of Justice shall provide such funding and administrative support for the Committee as the Committee may require.

An Intelligence Community liaison designated by the Director of National Intelligence shall support the Committee, consistent with applicable law. (c) Within 90 days from the date of this order, the Committee Members shall enter into a Memorandum of Understanding among themselves and with the Director of National Intelligence (or the Director's designee) describing their plan to implement and execute this order.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, April 4, 2020. Executive Order 13914 of April 6, 2020 Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including title IV of the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (Public Law 114-90), it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. Space Policy Directive-1 of December 11, 2017 (Reinvigorating America's Human Space Exploration Program), provides that commercial partners will participate in an ``innovative and sustainable program'' headed by the United States to ``lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations.'' Successful long-term exploration and scientific discovery of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies will require partnership with commercial entities to recover and use resources, including water and certain minerals, in outer space. Uncertainty regarding the right to recover and use space resources, including the extension of the right to commercial recovery and use of lunar resources, however, has discouraged some commercial entities from participating in this enterprise. Questions as to whether the 1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the ``Moon Agreement'') establishes the legal framework for nation states concerning the recovery and use of space resources have deepened this uncertainty, particularly because the United States has neither signed nor ratified the Moon Agreement. In fact, only 18 countries have ratified the Moon Agreement, including just 17 of the 95 Member States of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Moreover, differences between the Moon Agreement and the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies--which the United States and 108 other countries have joined--also contribute to uncertainty regarding the right to recover and use space resources. [[Page 333]] Americans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration, recovery, and use of resources in outer space, consistent with applicable law. Outer space is a legally and physically unique domain of human activity, and the United States does not view it as a global commons. Accordingly, it shall be the policy of the United States to encourage international support for the public and private recovery and use of resources in outer space, consistent with applicable law. Sec. 2. The Moon Agreement. The United States is not a party to the Moon Agreement. Further, the United States does not consider the Moon Agreement to be an effective or necessary instrument to guide nation states regarding the promotion of commercial participation in the long- term exploration, scientific discovery, and use of the Moon, Mars, or other celestial bodies. Accordingly, the Secretary of State shall object to any attempt by any other state or international organization to treat the Moon Agreement as reflecting or otherwise expressing customary international law. Sec. 3. Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the head of any other executive department or agency the Secretary of State determines to be appropriate, shall take all appropriate actions to encourage international support for the public and private recovery and use of resources in outer space, consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. In carrying out this section, the Secretary of State shall seek to negotiate joint statements and bilateral and multilateral arrangements with foreign states regarding safe and sustainable operations for the public and private recovery and use of space resources. Sec. 4. Report on Efforts to Encourage International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources. No later than 180 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall report to the President, through the Chair of the National Space Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, regarding activities carried out under section 3 of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, April 14, 2020. Executive Order 13916 of April 18, 2020 National Emergency Authority To Temporarily Extend Deadlines for Certain Estimated Payments By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and in furtherance of Proclamation 9994 of March [[Page 335]] 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), which declared a national emergency by reason of the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems, I hereby order as follows: Section 1. Emergency Authority. (a) To provide additional authority to the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to respond to the national emergency declared by Proclamation 9994, the authority at section 1318(a) of title 19, United States Code, to extend during the continuance of such emergency the time prescribed therein for the performance of any act is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary. (b) The Secretary shall consider taking appropriate action under section 1318(a) of title 19, United States Code, to temporarily extend deadlines, for importers suffering significant financial hardship because of COVID-19, for the estimated payments described therein, other than those assessed pursuant to sections 1671, 1673, 1862, 2251, and 2411 of title 19, United States Code. (c) The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security or his designee before exercising, as invoked and made available under this order, any of the authority set forth in section 1318(a) of title 19, United States Code. Sec. 2. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, April 18, 2020. Executive Order 13917 of April 28, 2020 Delegating Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Food Supply Chain Resources During the National Emergency Caused by the Outbreak of COVID-19 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the ``Act''), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: [[Page 336]] Section 1. Policy. The 2019 novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing outbreaks of the disease COVID-19, has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. Since then, the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies, including social distancing, to flatten the curve of infections and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak and these necessary mitigation measures have taken a dramatic toll on the United States economy and critical infrastructure. It is important that processors of beef, pork, and poultry (``meat and poultry'') in the food supply chain continue operating and fulfilling orders to ensure a continued supply of protein for Americans. However, outbreaks of COVID-19 among workers at some processing facilities have led to the reduction in some of those facilities' production capacity. In addition, recent actions in some States have led to the complete closure of some large processing facilities. Such actions may differ from or be inconsistent with interim guidance recently issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor entitled ``Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers'' providing for the safe operation of such facilities. Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain, undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency. Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities, any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain. For example, closure of a single large beef processing facility can result in the loss of over 10 million individual servings of beef in a single day. Similarly, under established supply chains, closure of a single meat or poultry processing facility can severely disrupt the supply of protein to an entire grocery store chain. Accordingly, I find that meat and poultry in the food supply chain meet the criteria specified in section 101(b) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4511(b)). Under the delegation of authority provided in this order, the Secretary of Agriculture shall take all appropriate action under that section to ensure that meat and poultry processors continue operations consistent with the guidance for their operations jointly issued by the CDC and OSHA. Under the delegation of authority provided in this order, the Secretary of Agriculture may identify additional specific food supply chain resources that meet the criteria of section 101(b). Sec. 2. Ensuring the Continued Supply of Meat and Poultry. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), the authority of the President to require performance of contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national defense over performance of any other contracts or orders, to allocate materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense, and to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, 4559, 4560), is delegated to the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to food supply chain resources, including meat and poultry, during [[Page 337]] the national emergency caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 within the United States. (b) The Secretary of Agriculture shall use the authority under section 101 of the Act, in consultation with the heads of such other executive departments and agencies as he deems appropriate, to determine the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all the materials, services, and facilities necessary to ensure the continued supply of meat and poultry, consistent with the guidance for the operations of meat and poultry processing facilities jointly issued by the CDC and OSHA. (c) The Secretary of Agriculture shall issue such orders and adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, April 28, 2020.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, April 30, 2020. Executive Order 13920 of May 1, 2020 Securing the United States Bulk-Power System By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in the United States bulk-power system, which provides the electricity that supports our national defense, vital emergency services, critical infrastructure, economy, and way of life. The bulk- power system is a target of those seeking to commit malicious acts against the United States and its people, including malicious cyber activities, because a successful attack on our bulk-power system would present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies. I further find that the unrestricted acquisition or use in the United States of bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned [[Page 340]] by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries augments the ability of foreign adversaries to create and exploit vulnerabilities in bulk-power system electric equipment, with potentially catastrophic effects. I therefore determine that the unrestricted foreign supply of bulk-power system electric equipment constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, which has its source in whole or in substantial part outside the United States. This threat exists both in the case of individual acquisitions and when acquisitions are considered as a class. Although maintaining an open investment climate in bulk-power system electric equipment, and in the United States economy more generally, is important for the overall growth and prosperity of the United States, such openness must be balanced with the need to protect our Nation against a critical national security threat. To address this threat, additional steps are required to protect the security, integrity, and reliability of bulk-power system electric equipment used in the United States. In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to the threat to the United States bulk-power system. Accordingly, I hereby order: Section 1. Prohibitions and Implementation. (a) The following actions are prohibited: any acquisition, importation, transfer, or installation of any bulk-power system electric equipment (transaction) by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, where the transaction involves any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest (including through an interest in a contract for the provision of the equipment), where the transaction was initiated after the date of this order, and where the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and, as appropriate, the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), has determined that: (i) the transaction involves bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary; and (ii) the transaction: (A) poses an undue risk of sabotage to or subversion of the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of the bulk-power system in the United States; (B) poses an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of United States critical infrastructure or the economy of the United States; or (C) otherwise poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons. (b) The Secretary, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, may at the Secretary's discretion design or negotiate measures to mitigate concerns identified under section 1(a) of this order. Such measures [[Page 341]] may serve as a precondition to the approval by the Secretary of a transaction or of a class of transactions that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to this order. (c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order. (d) The Secretary, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, may establish and publish criteria for recognizing particular equipment and particular vendors in the bulk-power system electric equipment market as pre-qualified for future transactions; and may apply these criteria to establish and publish a list of pre- qualified equipment and vendors. Nothing in this provision limits the Secretary's authority under this section to prohibit or otherwise regulate any transaction involving pre-qualified equipment or vendors. Sec. 2. Authorities. (a) The Secretary is hereby authorized to take such actions, including directing the timing and manner of the cessation of pending and future transactions prohibited pursuant to section 1 of this order, adopting appropriate rules and regulations, and employing all other powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The heads of all agencies, including the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, shall take all appropriate measures within their authority as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to implement this order. (b) Rules and regulations issued pursuant to this order may, among other things, determine that particular countries or persons are foreign adversaries exclusively for the purposes of this order; identify persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries exclusively for the purposes of this order; identify particular equipment or countries with respect to which transactions involving bulk-power system electric equipment warrant particular scrutiny under the provisions of this order; establish procedures to license transactions otherwise prohibited pursuant to this order; and identify a mechanism and relevant factors for the negotiation of agreements to mitigate concerns raised in connection with subsection 1(a) of this order. Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and, as appropriate, the heads of other agencies, shall publish rules or regulations implementing the authorities delegated to the Secretary by this order. (c) The Secretary may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of the authorities conferred on the Secretary pursuant to this section within the Department of Energy. (d) As soon as practicable, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the heads of such other agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, shall: (i) identify bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary that poses an [[Page 342]] undue risk of sabotage to or subversion of the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of the bulk-power system in the United States, poses an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of United States critical infrastructure or the economy of the United States, or otherwise poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons; and (ii) develop recommendations on ways to identify, isolate, monitor, or replace such items as soon as practicable, taking into consideration overall risk to the bulk-power system. Sec. 3. Task Force on Federal Energy Infrastructure Procurement Policies Related to National Security. (a) There is hereby established a Task Force on Federal Energy Infrastructure Procurement Policies Related to National Security (Task Force), which shall work to protect the Nation from national security threats through the coordination of Federal Government procurement of energy infrastructure and the sharing of risk information and risk management practices to inform such procurement. The Task Force shall be chaired by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. (b) In addition to the Chair of the Task Force (Chair), the Task Force membership shall include the following heads of agencies, or their designees: (i) the Secretary of Defense; (ii) the Secretary of the Interior; (iii) the Secretary of Commerce; (iv) the Secretary of Homeland Security; (v) the Director of National Intelligence; (vi) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and (vii) the head of any other agency that the Chair may designate in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior. (c) The Task Force shall: (i) develop a recommended consistent set of energy infrastructure procurement policies and procedures for agencies, to the extent consistent with law, to ensure that national security considerations are fully integrated across the Federal Government, and submit such recommendations to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council); (ii) evaluate the methods and criteria used to incorporate national security considerations into energy security and cybersecurity policymaking; (iii) consult with the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council and the Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating Council in developing the recommendations and evaluation described in subsections (c)(i) through (ii) of this section; and (iv) conduct any other studies, develop any other recommendations, and submit any such studies and recommendations to the President, as appropriate and as directed by the Secretary. (d) The Department of Energy shall provide administrative support and funding for the Task Force, to the extent consistent with applicable law. [[Page 343]] (e) The Task Force shall meet as required by the Chair and, unless extended by the Chair, shall terminate once it has accomplished the objectives set forth in subsection (c) of this section, as determined by the Chair, and completed the reports described in subsection (f) of this section. (f) The Task Force shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget: (i) a report within 1 year from the date of this order; (ii) a subsequent report at least once annually thereafter while the Task Force remains in existence; and (iii) such other reports as appropriate and as directed by the Chair. (g) In the reports submitted under subsection (f) of this section, the Task Force shall summarize its progress, findings, and recommendations described in subsection (c) of this section. (h) Because attacks on the bulk-power system can originate through the distribution system, the Task Force shall engage with distribution system industry groups, to the extent consistent with law and national security. Within 180 days of receiving the recommendations pursuant to subsection (c)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall consider proposing for notice and public comment an amendment to the applicable provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the recommendations provided pursuant to subsection (c)(i) of this section.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 1, 2020. Executive Order 13921 of May 7, 2020 Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to strengthen the American economy; improve the competitiveness of American industry; ensure food security; provide environmentally safe and sustainable seafood; support American workers; ensure coordinated, predictable, and transparent Federal actions; and remove unnecessary regulatory burdens, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. America needs a vibrant and competitive seafood industry to create and sustain American jobs, put safe and healthy food on [[Page 345]] American tables, and contribute to the American economy. Despite America's bountiful aquatic resources, by weight our Nation imports over 85 percent of the seafood consumed in the United States. At the same time, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing undermines the sustainability of American and global seafood stocks, negatively affects general ecosystem health, and unfairly competes with the products of law-abiding fishermen and seafood industries around the world. More effective permitting related to offshore aquaculture and additional streamlining of fishery regulations have the potential to revolutionize American seafood production, enhance rural prosperity, and improve the quality of American lives. By removing outdated and unnecessarily burdensome regulations; strengthening efforts to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; improving the transparency and efficiency of environmental reviews; and renewing our focus on long-term strategic planning to facilitate aquaculture projects, we can protect our aquatic environments; revitalize our Nation's seafood industry; get more Americans back to work; and put healthy, safe food on our families' tables. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to: (a) identify and remove unnecessary regulatory barriers restricting American fishermen and aquaculture producers; (b) combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; (c) provide good stewardship of public funds and stakeholder time and resources, and avoid duplicative, wasteful, or inconclusive permitting processes; (d) facilitate aquaculture projects through regulatory transparency and long-term strategic planning; (e) safeguard our communities and maintain a healthy aquatic environment; (f) further fair and reciprocal trade in seafood products; and (g) continue to hold imported seafood to the same food-safety requirements as domestically produced products. Sec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this order: (a) ``Aquaculture'' means the propagation, rearing, and harvesting of aquatic species in controlled or selected environments; (b) ``Aquaculture facility'' means any land, structure, or other appurtenance that is used for aquaculture; (c) ``Aquaculture project'' means a project to develop the physical assets designed to provide or support services to activities in the aquaculture sector, including projects for the development or construction of an aquaculture facility; (d) ``Exclusive economic zone of the United States'' means the zone established in Proclamation 5030 of March 10, 1983 (Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States of America); (e) ``Lead agency'' has the meaning given that term in the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, contained in title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, that implement the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); [[Page 346]] (f) ``Maritime domain'' means all areas and things of, on, under, relating to, adjacent to, or bordering on a sea, ocean, or other navigable waterway, including all maritime-related activities, infrastructure, people, cargo, and vessels and other conveyances; (g) ``Maritime domain awareness'' means the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime domain that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States; and (h) ``Project sponsor'' means an entity, including any private, public, or public-private entity, that seeks an authorization for an aquaculture project. Sec. 4. Removing Barriers to American Fishing. (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall request each Regional Fishery Management Council to submit, within 180 days of the date of this order, a prioritized list of recommended actions to reduce burdens on domestic fishing and to increase production within sustainable fisheries, including a proposal for initiating each recommended action within 1 year of the date of this order. (i) Recommended actions may include changes to regulations, orders, guidance documents, or other similar agency actions. (ii) Recommended actions shall be consistent with the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.); the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and other applicable laws. (iii) Consistent with section 302(f) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(f)), and within existing appropriations, the Secretary of Commerce shall provide administrative and technical support to the Regional Fishery Management Councils to carry out this subsection. (b) The Secretary of Commerce shall review and, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, update the Department of Commerce's contribution to the Unified Regulatory Agenda based on an evaluation of the lists received pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. (c) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality a report evaluating the recommendations described in subsection (a) of this section and describing any actions taken to implement those recommendations. This report shall be updated annually for the following 2 years. Sec. 5. Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shall issue, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, a notice of proposed rulemaking further implementing the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing, which entered into force on June 5, 2016 (the Port State Measures Agreement).

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 7, 2020. Executive Order 13922 of May 14, 2020 Delegating Authority Under the Defense Production Act to the Chief Executive Officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation To Respond to the COVID-19 Outbreak By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of [[Page 352]] 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the ``Act''), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be characterized as a pandemic. To ensure that our country has the capacity, capability, and strong and resilient domestic industrial base necessary to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, it is the policy of the United States to further expand domestic production of strategic resources needed to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, including strengthening relevant supply chains within the United States and its territories. It is important to use all resources available to the United States, including executive departments and agencies (agencies) with expertise in loan support for private institutions. Accordingly, I am delegating authority under title III of the Act to make loans, make provision for purchases and commitments to purchase, and take additional actions to create, maintain, protect, expand, and restore the domestic industrial base capabilities, including supply chains within the United States and its territories (``domestic supply chains''), needed to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority Under Title III of the Act. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), and in addition to the delegation of authority in Executive Order 13911 of March 27, 2020 (Delegating Additional Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19), the Chief Executive Officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is delegated the authority of the President conferred by sections 302 and 303 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4532 and 4533), and the authority to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560). (b) The Chief Executive Officer of the DFC may use the authority under sections 302 and 303 of the Act, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of other agencies as he deems appropriate, for the domestic production of strategic resources needed to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, or to strengthen any relevant domestic supply chains. (c) The loan authority delegated by this order is limited to loans that create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic industrial base capabilities supporting: (i) the national response and recovery to the COVID-19 outbreak; or (ii) the resiliency of any relevant domestic supply chains. (d) Loans extended using the authority delegated by this order shall be made in accordance with the principles and guidelines outlined in OMB Circular A-11, OMB Circular A-129, and the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, as amended (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.). [[Page 353]] (e) The Chief Executive Officer of the DFC shall adopt appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec. 3. Termination. The delegation of authority in this order shall expire upon termination of the 2-year period during which the requirements described in section 302(c)(1) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4532(c)(1)) are waived pursuant to title III of division B of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Public Law 116-136). Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 14, 2020. Executive Order 13923 of May 15, 2020 Establishment of the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force Under Section 741 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 741 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Public Law 116-113), it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Establishment of Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force. The Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (Task Force) is hereby established to monitor United States enforcement of the prohibition under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307). Sec. 2. Membership. The Task Force shall be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security and shall be composed of representatives from the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The Chair may invite representatives from other executive departments or agencies, as appropriate, to participate as members or observers. Members of the Task Force may designate an officer of the United States within their respective executive department or agency to serve as [[Page 354]] their representative on the Task Force. Each executive department or agency represented on the Task Force shall ensure that the necessary staff are available to assist their respective representatives in performing the responsibilities of the Task Force. Sec. 3. Task Force Decision-making. The Task Force shall endeavor to make any decision on an action under sections 742 through 744 of the Act by consensus, which shall be deemed to exist where no Task Force member objects to the proposed action. If the Task Force is unable to reach a consensus on a proposed action, and the Chair determines that allotting further time will cause a decision to be unduly delayed, the Task Force shall decide the matter by majority vote of its members. The Chair, in addition to voting, may also break any tie vote. Sec. 4. Funding. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the Task Force's functions described in sections 741 through 744 of the Act. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 15, 2020. Executive Order 13924 of May 19, 2020 Regulatory Relief To Support Economic Recovery In December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (``the virus'') was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, causing an outbreak of the disease COVID-19, which has now spread globally. The Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), in response to COVID-19. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. I have taken sweeping action to control the spread of the virus in the United States, including by suspending entry of certain foreign nationals [[Page 355]] who present a risk of transmitting the virus; implementing policies to accelerate acquisition of personal protective equipment and bring new diagnostic capabilities to laboratories; and pressing forward rapidly in the search for effective treatments and vaccines. Our States, tribes, territories, local communities, health authorities, hospitals, doctors and nurses, manufacturers, and critical infrastructure workers have all performed heroic service on the front lines battling COVID-19. Executive departments and agencies (agencies), under my leadership, have helped them by taking hundreds of administrative actions since March, many of which provided flexibility regarding burdensome requirements that stood in the way of implementing the most effective strategies to stop the virus's spread. The virus has attacked our Nation's economy as well as its health. Many businesses and non-profits have been forced to close or lay off workers, and in the last 8 weeks, the Nation has seen more than 36 million new unemployment insurance claims. I have worked with the Congress to provide vital relief to small businesses to keep workers employed and to bring assistance to those who have lost their jobs. On April 16, 2020, I announced Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, a framework for safely re-opening the country and putting millions of Americans back to work. Just as we continue to battle COVID-19 itself, so too must we now join together to overcome the effects the virus has had on our economy. Success will require the efforts not only of the Federal Government, but also of every State, tribe, territory, and locality; of businesses, non- profits, and houses of worship; and of the American people. To aid those efforts, agencies must continue to remove barriers to the greatest engine of economic prosperity the world has ever known: the innovation, initiative, and drive of the American people. By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to combat the economic consequences of COVID-19 with the same vigor and resourcefulness with which the fight against COVID-19 itself has been waged. Agencies should address this economic emergency by rescinding, modifying, waiving, or providing exemptions from regulations and other requirements that may inhibit economic recovery, consistent with applicable law and with protection of the public health and safety, with national and homeland security, and with budgetary priorities and operational feasibility. They should also give businesses, especially small businesses, the confidence they need to re-open by providing guidance on what the law requires; by recognizing the efforts of businesses to comply with often-complex regulations in complicated and swiftly changing circumstances; and by committing to fairness in administrative enforcement and adjudication. Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) ``Emergency authorities'' means any statutory or regulatory authorities or exceptions that authorize action in an emergency, in exigent circumstances, for good cause, or in similar situations. (b) ``Agency'' has the meaning given in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code. (c) ``Administrative enforcement'' includes investigations, assertions of statutory or regulatory violations, and adjudications by adjudicators as defined herein. [[Page 356]] (d) ``Adjudicator'' means an agency official who makes a determination that has legal consequence, as defined in section 2(d) of Executive Order 13892 of October 9, 2019 (Promoting the Rule of Law Through Transparency and Fairness in Civil Administrative Enforcement and Adjudication), for a person, except that it does not mean the head of an agency, a member of a multi-member board that heads an agency, or a Presidential appointee. (e) ``Pre-enforcement ruling'' has the meaning given it in section 2(f) of Executive Order 13892. (f) ``Regulatory standard'' includes any requirement imposed on the public by a Federal regulation, as defined in section 2(g) of Executive Order 13892, or any recommendation, best practice, standard, or other, similar provision of a Federal guidance document as defined in section 2(c) of Executive Order 13892. (g) ``Unfair surprise'' has the meaning given it in section 2(e) of Executive Order 13892. Sec. 3. Federal Response. The heads of all agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, any emergency authorities that I have previously invoked in response to the COVID-19 outbreak or that are otherwise available to them to support the economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The heads of all agencies are also encouraged to promote economic recovery through non-regulatory actions. Sec. 4. Rescission and waiver of regulatory standards. The heads of all agencies shall identify regulatory standards that may inhibit economic recovery and shall consider taking appropriate action, consistent with applicable law, including by issuing proposed rules as necessary, to temporarily or permanently rescind, modify, waive, or exempt persons or entities from those requirements, and to consider exercising appropriate temporary enforcement discretion or appropriate temporary extensions of time as provided for in enforceable agreements with respect to those requirements, for the purpose of promoting job creation and economic growth, insofar as doing so is consistent with the law and with the policy considerations identified in section 1 of this order. Sec. 5. Compliance assistance for regulated entities. (a) The heads of all agencies, excluding the Department of Justice, shall accelerate procedures by which a regulated person or entity may receive a pre- enforcement ruling under Executive Order 13892 with respect to whether proposed conduct in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including any response to legislative or executive economic stimulus actions, is consistent with statutes and regulations administered by the agency, insofar as doing so is consistent with the law and with the policy considerations identified in section 1 of this order. Pre-enforcement rulings under this subsection may be issued without regard to the requirements of section 6(a) of Executive Order 13892. (b) The heads of all agencies shall consider whether to formulate, and make public, policies of enforcement discretion that, as permitted by law and as appropriate in the context of particular statutory and regulatory programs and the policy considerations identified in section 1 of this order, decline enforcement against persons and entities that have attempted in reasonable good faith to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory [[Page 357]] standards, including those persons and entities acting in conformity with a pre-enforcement ruling. (c) As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services, including through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies have issued, or plan to issue in the future, guidance on action suggested to stem the transmission and spread of that disease. In formulating any policies of enforcement discretion under subsection (b) of this section, an agency head should consider a situation in which a person or entity makes a reasonable attempt to comply with such guidance, which the person or entity reasonably deems applicable to its circumstances, to be a rationale for declining enforcement under subsection (b) of this section. Non- adherence to guidance shall not by itself form the basis for an enforcement action by a Federal agency. Sec. 6. Fairness in Administrative Enforcement and Adjudication. The heads of all agencies shall consider the principles of fairness in administrative enforcement and adjudication listed below, and revise their procedures and practices in light of them, consistent with applicable law and as they deem appropriate in the context of particular statutory and regulatory programs and the policy considerations identified in section 1 of this order. (a) The Government should bear the burden of proving an alleged violation of law; the subject of enforcement should not bear the burden of proving compliance. (b) Administrative enforcement should be prompt and fair. (c) Administrative adjudicators should be independent of enforcement staff. (d) Consistent with any executive branch confidentiality interests, the Government should provide favorable relevant evidence in possession of the agency to the subject of an administrative enforcement action. (e) All rules of evidence and procedure should be public, clear, and effective. (f) Penalties should be proportionate, transparent, and imposed in adherence to consistent standards and only as authorized by law. (g) Administrative enforcement should be free of improper Government coercion. (h) Liability should be imposed only for violations of statutes or duly issued regulations, after notice and an opportunity to respond. (i) Administrative enforcement should be free of unfair surprise. (j) Agencies must be accountable for their administrative enforcement decisions. Sec. 7. Review of Regulatory Response. The heads of all agencies shall review any regulatory standards they have temporarily rescinded, suspended, modified, or waived during the public health emergency, any such actions they take pursuant to section 4 of this order, and other regulatory flexibilities they have implemented in response to COVID-19, whether before or after issuance of this order, and determine which, if any, would promote economic recovery if made permanent, insofar as doing so is consistent with the policy considerations identified in section 1 of this order, and report the results of such review to the Director of the Office of Management [[Page 358]] and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. Sec. 8. Implementation. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall monitor compliance with this order and may also issue memoranda providing guidance for implementing this order, including by setting deadlines for the reviews and reports required under section 7 of this order. Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this order, nothing in this order shall apply to any action that pertains to foreign or military affairs, or to a national security or homeland security function of the United States (other than procurement actions and actions involving the import or export of non-defense articles and services). (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 19, 2020. Executive Order 13925 of May 28, 2020 Preventing Online Censorship By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people. In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators. [[Page 359]] The growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see. As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy. Online platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms ``flagging'' content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse. Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician's tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ``Site Integrity'' has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets. At the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans' speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China. One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for ``human rights,'' hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance. It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military. Other companies have accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China's mass imprisonment of religious minorities, thereby enabling these abuses of human rights. They have also amplified China's propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro- democracy protests in Hong Kong. As a Nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today's digital communications environment where all Americans can and should have a voice. We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom of expression. [[Page 360]] Sec. 2. Protections Against Online Censorship. (a) It is the policy of the United States to foster clear ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet. Prominent among the ground rules governing that debate is the immunity from liability created by section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act (section 230(c)). 47 U.S.C. 230(c). It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified: the immunity should not extend beyond its text and purpose to provide protection for those who purport to provide users a forum for free and open speech, but in reality use their power over a vital means of communication to engage in deceptive or pretextual actions stifling free and open debate by censoring certain viewpoints. Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a ``publisher'' of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation. As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability ``protection'' to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in `` `Good Samaritan' blocking'' of harmful content. In particular, the Congress sought to provide protections for online platforms that attempted to protect minors from harmful content and intended to ensure that such providers would not be discouraged from taking down harmful material. The provision was also intended to further the express vision of the Congress that the internet is a ``forum for a true diversity of political discourse.'' 47 U.S.C. 230(a)(3). The limited protections provided by the statute should be construed with these purposes in mind. In particular, subparagraph (c)(2) expressly addresses protections from ``civil liability'' and specifies that an interactive computer service provider may not be made liable ``on account of'' its decision in ``good faith'' to restrict access to content that it considers to be ``obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.'' It is the policy of the United States to ensure that, to the maximum extent permissible under the law, this provision is not distorted to provide liability protection for online platforms that--far from acting in ``good faith'' to remove objectionable content--instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree. Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike. When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and its actions do not meet the criteria of subparagraph (c)(2)(A), it is engaged in editorial conduct. It is the policy of the United States that such a provider should properly lose the limited liability shield of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) and be exposed to liability like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider. (b) To advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section, all executive departments and agencies should ensure that their application of section 230(c) properly reflects the narrow purpose of the section and take all appropriate actions in this regard. In addition, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation [[Page 361]] with the Attorney General, and acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations to clarify: (i) the interaction between subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of section 230, in particular to clarify and determine the circumstances under which a provider of an interactive computer service that restricts access to content in a manner not specifically protected by subparagraph (c)(2)(A) may also not be able to claim protection under subparagraph (c)(1), which merely states that a provider shall not be treated as a publisher or speaker for making third-party content available and does not address the provider's responsibility for its own editorial decisions; (ii) the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material is not ``taken in good faith'' within the meaning of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) of section 230, particularly whether actions can be ``taken in good faith'' if they are: (A) deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service; or (B) taken after failing to provide adequate notice, reasoned explanation, or a meaningful opportunity to be heard; and (iii) any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 3. Protecting Federal Taxpayer Dollars from Financing Online Platforms That Restrict Free Speech. (a) The head of each executive department and agency (agency) shall review its agency's Federal spending on advertising and marketing paid to online platforms. Such review shall include the amount of money spent, the online platforms that receive Federal dollars, and the statutory authorities available to restrict their receipt of advertising dollars. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall report its findings to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. (c) The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices. Sec. 4. Federal Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices. (a) It is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech. The Supreme Court has noted that social media sites, as the modern public square, ``can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.'' Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017). Communication through these channels has become important for meaningful participation in American democracy, including to petition elected leaders. These sites are providing an important forum to the public for others to engage in free expression and debate. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980). [[Page 362]] (b) In May of 2019, the White House launched a Tech Bias Reporting tool to allow Americans to report incidents of online censorship. In just weeks, the White House received over 16,000 complaints of online platforms censoring or otherwise taking action against users based on their political viewpoints. The White House will submit such complaints received to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). (c) The FTC shall consider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, pursuant to section 45 of title 15, United States Code. Such unfair or deceptive acts or practice may include practices by entities covered by section 230 that restrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities' public representations about those practices. (d) For large online platforms that are vast arenas for public debate, including the social media platform Twitter, the FTC shall also, consistent with its legal authority, consider whether complaints allege violations of law that implicate the policies set forth in section 4(a) of this order. The FTC shall consider developing a report describing such complaints and making the report publicly available, consistent with applicable law. Sec. 5. State Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Anti- Discrimination Laws. (a) The Attorney General shall establish a working group regarding the potential enforcement of State statutes that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The working group shall also develop model legislation for consideration by legislatures in States where existing statutes do not protect Americans from such unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The working group shall invite State Attorneys General for discussion and consultation, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. (b) Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following: (i) increased scrutiny of users based on the other users they choose to follow, or their interactions with other users; (ii) algorithms to suppress content or users based on indications of political alignment or viewpoint; (iii) differential policies allowing for otherwise impermissible behavior, when committed by accounts associated with the Chinese Communist Party or other anti-democratic associations or governments; (iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, media organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content; and (v) acts that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated. Sec. 6. Legislation. The Attorney General shall develop a proposal for Federal legislation that would be useful to promote the policy objectives of this order. Sec. 7. Definition. For purposes of this order, the term ``online platform'' means any website or application that allows users to create and share content or engage in social networking, or any general search engine. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: [[Page 363]] (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 28, 2020. Executive Order 13926 of June 2, 2020 Advancing International Religious Freedom By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. (a) Religious freedom, America's first freedom, is a moral and national security imperative. Religious freedom for all people worldwide is a foreign policy priority of the United States, and the United States will respect and vigorously promote this freedom. As stated in the 2017 National Security Strategy, our Founders understood religious freedom not as a creation of the state, but as a gift of God to every person and a right that is fundamental for the flourishing of our society. (b) Religious communities and organizations, and other institutions of civil society, are vital partners in United States Government efforts to advance religious freedom around the world. It is the policy of the United States to engage robustly and continually with civil society organizations--including those in foreign countries--to inform United States Government policies, programs, and activities related to international religious freedom. Sec. 2. Prioritization of International Religious Freedom. Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State (Secretary) shall, in consultation with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), develop a plan to prioritize international religious freedom in the planning and implementation of United States foreign policy and in the foreign assistance programs of the Department of State and USAID. Sec. 3. Foreign Assistance Funding for International Religious Freedom. (a) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Administrator of USAID, budget at least $50 million per fiscal year for programs that advance international religious freedom, to the extent feasible and permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Such programs shall include [[Page 364]] those intended to anticipate, prevent, and respond to attacks against individuals and groups on the basis of their religion, including programs designed to help ensure that such groups can persevere as distinct communities; to promote accountability for the perpetrators of such attacks; to ensure equal rights and legal protections for individuals and groups regardless of belief; to improve the safety and security of houses of worship and public spaces for all faiths; and to protect and preserve the cultural heritages of religious communities. (b) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) that fund foreign assistance programs shall ensure that faith-based and religious entities, including eligible entities in foreign countries, are not discriminated against on the basis of religious identity or religious belief when competing for Federal funding, to the extent permitted by law. Sec. 4. Integrating International Religious Freedom into United States Diplomacy. (a) The Secretary shall direct Chiefs of Mission in countries of particular concern, countries on the Special Watch List, countries in which there are entities of particular concern, and any other countries that have engaged in or tolerated violations of religious freedom as noted in the Annual Report on International Religious Freedom required by section 102(b) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292), as amended (the ``Act''), to develop comprehensive action plans to inform and support the efforts of the United States to advance international religious freedom and to encourage the host governments to make progress in eliminating violations of religious freedom. (b) In meetings with their counterparts in foreign governments, the heads of agencies shall, when appropriate and in coordination with the Secretary, raise concerns about international religious freedom and cases that involve individuals imprisoned because of their religion. (c) The Secretary shall advocate for United States international religious freedom policy in both bilateral and multilateral fora, when appropriate, and shall direct the Administrator of USAID to do the same. Sec. 5. Training for Federal Officials. (a) The Secretary shall require all Department of State civil service employees in the Foreign Affairs Series to undertake training modeled on the international religious freedom training described in section 708(a) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-465), as amended by section 103(a)(1) of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 114-281). (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the heads of all agencies that assign personnel to positions overseas shall submit plans to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, detailing how their agencies will incorporate the type of training described in subsection (a) of this section into the training required before the start of overseas assignments for all personnel who are to be stationed abroad, or who will deploy and remain abroad, in one location for 30 days or more. (c) All Federal employees subject to these requirements shall be required to complete international religious freedom training not less frequently than once every 3 years. [[Page 365]] Sec. 6. Economic Tools. (a) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury shall, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and through the process described in National Security Presidential Memorandum-4 of April 4, 2017 (Organization of the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Subcommittees), develop recommendations to prioritize the appropriate use of economic tools to advance international religious freedom in countries of particular concern, countries on the Special Watch List, countries in which there are entities of particular concern, and any other countries that have engaged in or tolerated violations of religious freedom as noted in the report required by section 102(b) of the Act. These economic tools may include, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, increasing religious freedom programming, realigning foreign assistance to better reflect country circumstances, or restricting the issuance of visas under section 604(a) of the Act. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may consider imposing sanctions under Executive Order 13818 of December 20, 2017 (Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption), which, among other things, implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Public Law 114-328). Sec. 7. Definitions. For purposes of this order: (a) ``Country of particular concern'' is defined as provided in section 402(b)(1)(A) of the Act; (b) ``Entity of particular concern'' is defined as provided in section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 114-281); (c) ``Special Watch List'' is defined as provided in sections 3(15) and 402(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act; and (d) ``Violations of religious freedom'' is defined as provided in section 3(16) of the Act. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 2, 2020. [[Page 366]] Executive Order 13927 of June 4, 2020 Accelerating the Nation's Economic Recovery From the COVID-19 Emergency by Expediting Infrastructure Investments and Other Activities By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby determine and authorize as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The 2019 novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing outbreaks of the disease COVID-19, has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency that posed a threat to our national security (``the national emergency''). I also determined that same day that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted an emergency of nationwide scope, pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)). Since I declared this national emergency, the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The unavoidable result of the COVID-19 outbreak and these necessary mitigation measures has been a dramatic downturn in our economy. National unemployment claims have reached historic levels. In the days between the national emergency declaration and May 23, 2020, more than 41 million Americans filed for unemployment, and the unemployment rate reached 14.7 percent. In light of this and other developments, I have determined that, without intervention, the United States faces the likelihood of a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistent high unemployment. From the beginning of my Administration, I have focused on reforming and streamlining an outdated regulatory system that has held back our economy with needless paperwork and costly delays. Antiquated regulations and bureaucratic practices have hindered American infrastructure investments, kept America's building trades workers from working, and prevented our citizens from developing and enjoying the benefits of world-class infrastructure. The need for continued progress in this streamlining effort is all the more acute now, due to the ongoing economic crisis. Unnecessary regulatory delays will deny our citizens opportunities for jobs and economic security, keeping millions of Americans out of work and hindering our economic recovery from the national emergency. In tandem with this regulatory reform, I will continue to use existing legal authorities to respond to the full dimensions of the national emergency and its economic consequences. These authorities include statutes and regulations that allow for expedited government decision making in exigent circumstances. Sec. 2. Policy. Agencies, including executive departments, should take all appropriate steps to use their lawful emergency authorities and other authorities to respond to the national emergency and to facilitate the Nation's [[Page 367]] economic recovery. As set forth in this order, agencies should take all reasonable measures to speed infrastructure investments and to speed other actions in addition to such investments that will strengthen the economy and return Americans to work, while providing appropriate protection for public health and safety, natural resources, and the environment, as required by law. For purposes of this order, the term ``agencies'' has the meaning given that term in section 3502(1), of title 44, United States Code, except for the agencies described in section 3502(5) of title 44. Sec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Transportation Infrastructure Projects. (a) To facilitate the Nation's economic recovery, the Secretary of Transportation shall use all relevant emergency and other authorities to expedite work on, and completion of, all authorized and appropriated highway and other infrastructure projects that are within the authority of the Secretary to perform or to advance. (b) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide a summary report, listing all projects that have been expedited pursuant to subsection (a) of this section (``expedited transportation projects''), to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. (c) Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide a status report to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ that shall list any additions or other changes to the list described in subsection (b) of this section. Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency, and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. Sec. 4. Expediting the Delivery of Civil Works Projects Within the Purview of the Army Corps of Engineers. (a) To facilitate the Nation's economic recovery, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall use all relevant emergency and other authorities to expedite work on, and completion of, all authorized and appropriated civil works projects that are within the authority of the Secretary of the Army to perform or to advance. (b) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall provide a summary report, listing all such projects that have been expedited (``expedited Army Corps of Engineers projects''), to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. (c) Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall provide a status report to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list the status of all expedited Army Corps of Engineers projects and shall list any additions or other changes to the list described in subsection (b) of this section. Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials [[Page 368]] at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. Sec. 5. Expediting the Delivery of Infrastructure and Other Projects on Federal Lands. (a) As used in this section, the term ``Federal lands'' means any land or interests in land owned by the United States, including leasehold interests held by the United States, except Indian trust land. (b) To facilitate the Nation's economic recovery, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Agriculture shall use all relevant emergency and other authorities to expedite work on, and completion of, all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects on Federal lands that are within the authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance. (c) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Agriculture shall each provide a summary report, listing all such projects that have been expedited (``expedited Federal lands projects''), to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. (d) Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Agriculture shall each provide a status report to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list the status of all expedited Federal lands projects and shall list any additions or other changes to the list described in subsection (c) of this section. Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. Sec. 6. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Emergency Regulations and Emergency Procedures. The Council on Environmental Quality has provided appropriate flexibility to agencies for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., in emergency situations. Such flexibility is expressly authorized in CEQ's regulations, contained in title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, that implement the procedural provisions of NEPA (the ``NEPA regulations''), which were first issued in 1978. These regulations provide that when emergency circumstances make it necessary to take actions with significant environmental impacts without observing the regulations, agencies may consult with CEQ to make alternative arrangements to take such actions. Using this authority, CEQ has appropriately approved alternative arrangements in a wide variety of pressing emergency situations. These emergencies have included not only natural disasters and threats to the national defense, but also threats to human and animal health, energy security, agriculture and farmers, and employment and economic prosperity. (a) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the heads of all agencies: (i) shall identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery that: [[Page 369]] (A) may be subject to emergency treatment as alternative arrangements pursuant to CEQ's NEPA regulations and agencies' own NEPA procedures; (B) may be subject to statutory exemptions from NEPA; (C) may be subject to the categorical exclusions that agencies have included in their NEPA procedures pursuant to the NEPA regulations; (D) may be covered by already completed NEPA analyses that obviate the need for new analyses; or (E) may otherwise use concise and focused NEPA environmental analyses; and (ii) shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. (b) To facilitate the Nation's economic recovery, the heads of all agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, emergency procedures, statutory exemptions, categorical exclusions, analyses that have already been completed, and concise and focused analyses, consistent with NEPA, CEQ's NEPA regulations, and agencies' NEPA procedures. (c) Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within the categories described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions within these categories. Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. (d) The Chairman of CEQ shall be available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of CEQ's NEPA emergency regulations. Sec. 7. Endangered Species Act (ESA) Emergency Consultation Regulations. (a) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the heads of all agencies: (i) shall identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery that may be subject to the regulation on consultations in emergencies, see 50 C.F.R. 402.05, promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; and (ii) shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. (The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall provide such summary reports, listing such actions on behalf of their respective agencies, to each other and for internal use throughout their respective agencies, as well as to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ.) Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. [[Page 370]] (b) The heads of all agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the ESA regulation on consultations in emergencies, to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery. (c) Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the head of each agency shall provide a status report to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ. (The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall provide such status reports, listing such actions on behalf of their respective agencies, to each other and for internal use throughout their respective agencies, as well as to the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of CEQ.) Each such report shall list actions taken within the categories described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions within these categories. Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the National Marine Fisheries Service, or the Assistant Administrator's authorized representative, shall be available for such consultation and to take such other action. Sec. 8. Emergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers. (a) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, including the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works: (i) shall identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the Army Corps of Engineers, or jointly by the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413 (collectively, the ``emergency Army Corps permitting provisions''); and (ii) shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the OMB Director; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of CEQ. Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order. (b) The heads of all agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions, to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 4, 2020. Executive Order 13928 of June 11, 2020 Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated With the International Criminal Court By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the situation with respect to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its illegitimate assertions of jurisdiction over personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including the ICC Prosecutor's investigation into actions allegedly committed by United States military, intelligence, and other personnel in or relating to Afghanistan, threatens to subject current and former United States Government and allied officials to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. These actions on the part of the ICC, in turn, threaten to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and impede the critical national security and foreign policy work of United States Government and allied officials, and thereby threaten the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The United States is not a party to the Rome Statute, has never accepted ICC jurisdiction over its personnel, and has consistently rejected ICC assertions of jurisdiction over United States personnel. Furthermore, in 2002, the United States Congress enacted the American Service-Members' Protection Act (22 U.S.C. 7421 et seq.) which rejected the ICC's overbroad, non- consensual assertions of jurisdiction. The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC's jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC's transgressions, which may include the suspension of entry into the United [[Page 373]] States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members. The entry of such aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States and denying them entry will further demonstrate the resolve of the United States in opposing the ICC's overreach by seeking to exercise jurisdiction over personnel of the United States and our allies, as well as personnel of countries that are not parties to the Rome Statute or have not otherwise consented to ICC jurisdiction. I therefore determine that any attempt by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any United States personnel without the consent of the United States, or of personnel of countries that are United States allies and who are not parties to the Rome Statute or have not otherwise consented to ICC jurisdiction, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby determine and order: Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: (i) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: (A) to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any United States personnel without the consent of the United States; (B) to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any personnel of a country that is an ally of the United States without the consent of that country's government; (C) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity described in subsection (a)(i)(A) or (a)(i)(B) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or (D) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1(a) of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1(a) of this order. Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include: [[Page 374]] (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1(a) of this order; and (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 4. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 6. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; (b) the term ``entity'' means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization, including an international organization; (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; (d) the term ``United States personnel'' means any current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United States, any current or former elected or appointed official of the United States Government, and any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government; [[Page 375]] (e) the term ``personnel of a country that is an ally of the United States'' means any current or former military personnel, current or former elected or appointed official, or other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of a government of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member country or a ``major non-NATO ally'', as that term is defined by section 2013(7) of the American Service-Members' Protection Act (22 U.S.C. 7432(7)); and (f) the term ``immediate family member'' means spouses and children. Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to me by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.

All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 11, 2020. [[Page 376]] Executive Order 13929 of June 16, 2020 Safe Policing for Safe Communities By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. As Americans, we believe that all persons are created equal and endowed with the inalienable rights to life and liberty. A fundamental purpose of government is to secure these inalienable rights. Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officers place their lives at risk every day to ensure that these rights are preserved. Law enforcement officers provide the essential protection that all Americans require to raise their families and lead productive lives. The relationship between our fellow citizens and law enforcement officers is an important element in their ability to provide that protection. By working directly with their communities, law enforcement officers can help foster a safe environment where we all can prosper. Unfortunately, there have been instances in which some officers have misused their authority, challenging the trust of the American people, with tragic consequences for individual victims, their communities, and our Nation. All Americans are entitled to live with the confidence that the law enforcement officers and agencies in their communities will live up to our Nation's founding ideals and will protect the rights of all persons. Particularly in African-American communities, we must redouble our efforts as a Nation to swiftly address instances of misconduct. The Constitution declares in its preamble that one of its primary purposes was to establish Justice. Generations of Americans have marched, fought, bled, and died to safeguard the promise of our founding document and protect our shared inalienable rights. Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial leaders must act in furtherance of that legacy. Sec. 2. Certification and Credentialing. (a) State and local law enforcement agencies must constantly assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent, safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their communities. Independent credentialing bodies can accelerate these assessments, enhance citizen confidence in law enforcement practices, and allow for the identification and correction of internal deficiencies before those deficiencies result in injury to the public or to law enforcement officers. (b) The Attorney General shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, allocate Department of Justice discretionary grant funding only to those State and local law enforcement agencies that have sought or are in the process of seeking appropriate credentials from a reputable independent credentialing body certified by the Attorney General. (c) The Attorney General shall certify independent credentialing bodies that meet standards to be set by the Attorney General. Reputable, independent credentialing bodies, eligible for certification by the Attorney General, should address certain topics in their reviews, such as policies and training regarding use-of-force and de-escalation techniques; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention; and best practices regarding community [[Page 377]] engagement. The Attorney General's standards for certification shall require independent credentialing bodies to, at a minimum, confirm that: (i) the State or local law enforcement agency's use-of-force policies adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local laws; and (ii) the State or local law enforcement agency's use-of-force policies prohibit the use of chokeholds--a physical maneuver that restricts an individual's ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation--except in those situations where the use of deadly force is allowed by law. (d) The Attorney General shall engage with existing and prospective independent credentialing bodies to encourage them to offer a cost- effective, targeted credentialing process regarding appropriate use-of- force policies that law enforcement agencies of all sizes in urban and rural jurisdictions may access. Sec. 3. Information Sharing. (a) The Attorney General shall create a database to coordinate the sharing of information between and among Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies concerning instances of excessive use of force related to law enforcement matters, accounting for applicable privacy and due process rights. (b) The database described in subsection (a) of this section shall include a mechanism to track, as permissible, terminations or de- certifications of law enforcement officers, criminal convictions of law enforcement officers for on-duty conduct, and civil judgments against law enforcement officers for improper use of force. The database described in subsection (a) of this section shall account for instances where a law enforcement officer resigns or retires while under active investigation related to the use of force. The Attorney General shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the information in the database consists only of instances in which law enforcement officers were afforded fair process. (c) The Attorney General shall regularly and periodically make available to the public aggregated and anonymized data from the database described in subsection (a) of this section, as consistent with applicable law. (d) The Attorney General shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, allocate Department of Justice discretionary grant funding only to those law enforcement agencies that submit the information described in subsection (b) of this section. Sec. 4. Mental Health, Homelessness, and Addiction. (a) Since the mid- twentieth century, America has witnessed a reduction in targeted mental health treatment. Ineffective policies have left more individuals with mental health needs on our Nation's streets, which has expanded the responsibilities of law enforcement officers. As a society, we must take steps to safely and humanely care for those who suffer from mental illness and substance abuse in a manner that addresses such individuals' needs and the needs of their communities. It is the policy of the United States to promote the use of appropriate social services as the primary response to individuals who suffer from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction, recognizing that, because law enforcement officers often encounter such individuals suffering from these conditions in the course of their duties, all officers should be properly trained for such encounters. [[Page 378]] (b) The Attorney General shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services as appropriate, identify and develop opportunities to train law enforcement officers with respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction; to increase the capacity of social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies; and to provide guidance regarding the development and implementation of co-responder programs, which involve social workers or other mental health professionals working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and address situations together. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall prioritize resources, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to support such opportunities. (c) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall survey community-support models addressing mental health, homelessness, and addiction. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall summarize the results of this survey in a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, which shall include specific recommendations regarding how appropriated funds can be reallocated to support widespread adoption of successful models and recommendations for additional funding, if needed. (d) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, prioritize resources, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to implement community-support models as recommended in the report described in subsection (c) of this section. Sec. 5. Legislation and Grant Programs. (a) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall develop and propose new legislation to the Congress that could be enacted to enhance the tools and resources available to improve law enforcement practices and build community engagement. (b) The legislation described in subsection (a) of this section shall include recommendations to enhance current grant programs to improve law enforcement practices and build community engagement, including through: (i) assisting State and local law enforcement agencies with implementing the credentialing process described in section 2 of this order, the reporting described in section 3 of this order, and the co-responder and community-support models described in section 4 of this order; (ii) training and technical assistance required to adopt and implement improved use-of-force policies and procedures, including scenario-driven de-escalation techniques; (iii) retention of high-performing law enforcement officers and recruitment of law enforcement officers who are likely to be high-performing; (iv) confidential access to mental health services for law enforcement officers; and (v) programs aimed at developing or improving relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve, including through community outreach and listening sessions, and supporting non-profit [[Page 379]] organizations that focus on improving stressed relationships between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 16, 2020. Executive Order 13930 of June 24, 2020 Strengthening the Child Welfare System for America's Children By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Every child deserves a family. Our States and communities have both a legal obligation, and the privilege, to care for our Nation's most vulnerable children. The best foster care system is one that is not needed in the first place. My Administration has been focused on prevention strategies that keep children safe while strengthening families so that children do not enter foster care unnecessarily. Last year, and for only the second time since 2011, the number of children in the foster care system declined, and for the third year in a row, the number of children entering foster care has declined. But challenges remain. Too many young people who are in our foster care system wait years before finding the permanency of family. More than 400,000 children are currently in foster care. Of those, more than 124,000 children are waiting for adoption, with nearly 6 out of 10 (58.4 percent) having already become legally eligible for adoption. More than 50 percent of the children waiting for adoption have been in foster care--without the security and constancy of a permanent family-- for 2 years or more. The need for stability and timely permanency is particularly acute for children 9 years and older, children in sibling groups, and those with intellectual or physical disabilities. Even worse, too many young men and women age out of foster care having never found a permanent, stable family. In recent years, approximately [[Page 380]] 20,000 young people have aged out of foster care each year in the United States. Research has shown that young people who age out of the foster care system are likely to experience significant, and significantly increased, life challenges--40 percent of such young people studied experienced homelessness; 50 percent were unemployed at age 24; 25 percent experienced post-traumatic stress disorder; and 71 percent became pregnant by age 21. These are unacceptable outcomes. Several factors have contributed to the number of children who wait in foster care for extended periods. First, State and local child welfare agencies often do not have robust partnerships with private community organizations, including faith-based organizations. Second, those who step up to be resource families for children in foster care--including kin, guardians, foster parents, and adoptive parents--may lack adequate support. Third, too often the processes and systems meant to help children and families in crisis have instead created bureaucratic barriers that make it more difficult for these children and families to get the help they need. It is the goal of the United States to promote a child welfare system that reduces the need to place children into foster care; achieves safe permanency for those children who must come into foster care, and does so more quickly and more effectively; places appropriate focus on children who are waiting for adoption, especially those who are 9 years and older, are in sibling groups, or have disabilities; and decreases the proportion of young adults who age out of the foster care system. Children from all backgrounds have the potential to become successful and thriving adults. Yet without a committed, loving family that can provide encouragement, stability, and a lifelong connection, some children may never receive the support needed to realize that potential. This order will help to empower families who answer the call to open their hearts and homes to children who need them. My Administration is committed to helping give as many children as possible the stability and support that family provides by dramatically improving our child welfare system. Sec. 2. Encouraging Robust Partnerships Between State Agencies and Public, Private, Faith-based, and Community Organizations. (a) In order to facilitate close partnerships between State agencies and nongovernmental organizations, including public, private, faith-based, and community groups, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the ``Secretary'') shall provide increased public access to accurate, up-to- date information relevant to strengthening the child welfare system, including by: (i) Publishing data to aid in the recruitment of community support. Within 1 year of the date of this order and each year thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, a report that provides information about typical patterns of entry, recent available counts of children in foster care, and counts of children waiting for adoption. To the extent appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including all privacy laws, this data will be disaggregated by county or other sub-State level, child age, placement type, and prior time in care. (ii) Collecting needed data to preserve sibling connections. [[Page 381]] (A) Within 2 years of the date of this order, the Secretary shall collect information from appropriate State and local agencies on the number of children in foster care who have siblings in foster care and who are not currently placed with their siblings. (B) Within 3 years of the date of this order, to support the goal of keeping siblings together (42 U.S.C. 671(a)(31)(A)), the Secretary shall develop data analysis methods to report on the experience of children entering care in sibling groups, and the extent to which they are placed together. The Secretary's analysis shall also assess the extent to which siblings who are legally eligible for adoption achieve permanency together. (iii) Expanding the number of homes for children and youth. (A) Within 2 years of the date of this order, the Secretary shall develop a more rigorous and systematic approach to collecting State administrative data as part of the Child and Family Services Review required by section 1123A of the Social Security Act (the ``Act'') (42 U.S.C. 1320a-2a). Data collected shall include: (1) demographic information for children in foster care and waiting for adoption; (2) the number of currently available foster families and their demographic information; (3) the average foster parent retention rate and average length of time foster parents remain certified; (4) a target number of foster homes needed to meet the needs of children in foster care; and (5) the average length of time it takes to complete foster and adoptive home certification. (B) The Secretary shall ensure, to the extent consistent with applicable law, that States report to the Secretary regarding strategies for coordinating with nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based and community organizations, to recruit and support foster and adoptive families. (b) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance to Federal, State, and local agencies on partnering with nongovernmental organizations. This guidance shall include best practices for information sharing, providing needed services to families to support prevention of children entering foster care, family preservation, foster and adoptive home recruitment and retention, respite care, post-placement family support, and support for older youth. This guidance shall also make clear that faith-based organizations are eligible for partnerships under title IV-E of the Act (42 U.S.C. 670 et seq.), on an equal basis, consistent with the First Amendment to the Constitution. Sec. 3. Improving Access to Adequate Resources for Caregivers and Youth. While many public, private, faith-based, and community resources and other sources of support exist, many American caregivers still lack connection with and access to adequate resources. Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary shall equip caregivers and those in care to meet their unique challenges, by: [[Page 382]] (a) Expanding educational options. To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall use all existing technical assistance resources to promote dissemination and State implementation of the National Training and Development Curriculum, including, when appropriate, in non- classroom environments. (b) Increasing the availability of trauma-informed training. The Secretary shall provide an enhanced, web-based, learning-management platform to house the information generated by the National Adoption Competency Mental Health Training Initiative. Access to this web-based training material will be provided free of charge for all child welfare and mental health practitioners. (c) Supporting guardianship. The Secretary shall provide information to States regarding the importance and availability of funds to increase guardianship through the title IV-E Guardianship Assistance Program (42 U.S.C. 673), which provides Federal reimbursement for payments to guardians and for associated administrative costs. This information shall include which States have already opted into the program. (d) Enhancing support for kinship care and youth exiting foster care. The Secretary shall establish a plan to address barriers to accessing existing Federal assistance and benefits for eligible individuals. Sec. 4. Ensuring Equality of Treatment and Access for all Families. The Howard M. Metzenbaum Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 (the ``Multiethnic Placement Act'') (Public Law 103-382), as amended, prohibits agencies from denying to any person the opportunity to become an adoptive or a foster parent on the basis of race, color, or national origin (42 U.S.C. 671(a)(18)(A)); prohibits agencies from delaying or denying the placement of a child for adoption or into foster care on the basis of race, color, or national origin (id. 671(a)(18)(B)); and requires agencies to diligently recruit a diverse base of foster and adoptive parents to better reflect the racial and ethnic makeup of children in out-of-home care (id. 662(b)(7)). To further the goals of the Multiethnic Placement Act, the Secretary shall: (a) within 6 months of the date of this order, initiate a study regarding the implementation of these requirements nationwide; (b) within 1 year of the date of this order, update guidance, as necessary, regarding implementation of the Multiethnic Placement Act; and (c) within 1 year of the date of this order, publish guidance regarding the rights of parents, prospective parents, and children with disabilities (including intellectual, developmental, or physical disabilities). Sec. 5. Improving Processes to Prevent Unnecessary Removal and Secure Permanency for Children. (a) Federal Review of Reasonable Effort Determinations and Timeliness Requirements. (i) Within 2 years of the date of this order, the Secretary shall require that both the title IV-E reviews conducted pursuant to 45 CFR 1356.71 and the Child and Family Services Reviews conducted pursuant to 45 CFR 1355.31- 1355.36 specifically and adequately assess the following requirements: (A) reasonable efforts to prevent removal; [[Page 383]] (B) filing a petition for Termination of Parental Rights within established statutory timelines and court processing of such petition, unless statutory exemptions apply; (C) reasonable efforts to finalize permanency plans; and (D) completion of relevant required family search and notifications and how such efforts are reviewed by courts. (ii) In cases in which it is determined that statutorily required timelines and efforts have not been satisfied, the Secretary shall make use of existing authority in making eligibility determinations and disallowances consistent with section 1123A(b)(3)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a- 2a(b)(3)(4)). (iii) Within 2 years of the date of this order, the Secretary shall develop metrics to track permanency outcomes in each State and measure State performance over time. (iv) Within 6 months of the date of this order, the Secretary shall provide guidance to States regarding flexibility in the use of Federal funds to support and encourage high-quality legal representation for parents and children, including pre-petition representation, in their efforts to prevent the removal of children from their families, safely reunify children and parents, finalize permanency, and ensure that their voices are heard and their rights are protected. The Secretary shall also ensure collection of data regarding State use of Federal funds for this purpose. (b) Risk and Safety Assessments. (i) Within 18 months of the date of this order, the Secretary shall collect States' individual standards for conducting risk and safety assessments required under section 106(b)(2)(B)(iv) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5106(b)(2)(B)(iv)). (ii) Within 2 years of the date of this order, the Secretary shall outline reasonable best practice standards for risk and safety assessments, including how to address domestic violence and substance abuse. Sec. 6. Indian Child Welfare Act. Nothing in this order shall alter the implementation of the Indian Child Welfare Act or replace the tribal consultation process. Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party [[Page 384]] against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 24, 2020. Executive Order 13931 of June 26, 2020 Continuing the President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Continuing the President's National Council for the American Worker. To continue the President's National Council for the American Worker established by Executive Order 13845 of July 19, 2018, as amended, that Executive Order is further amended by revising section 10 to read as follows: ``Termination of Council. The Council shall terminate on September 30, 2021, unless extended by the President.''. Sec. 2. Continuing the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. The American Workforce Policy Advisory Board established by Executive Order 13845, as amended, is continued until September 30, 2021. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 26, 2020. [[Page 385]] Executive Order 13932 of June 26, 2020 Modernizing and Reforming the Assessment and Hiring of Federal Job Candidates By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and sections 1104(a)(1), 3301, and 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The foundation of our professional merit-based civil service is the principle that employment and advancement rest on the ability of individuals to fulfill their responsibilities in service to the American public. Accordingly, Federal Government employment opportunities should be filled based on merit. Policies or practices that undermine public confidence in the hiring process undermine confidence in both the civil service and the Government. America's private employers have modernized their recruitment practices to better identify and secure talent through skills- and competency- based hiring. As the modern workforce evolves, the Federal Government requires a more efficient approach to hiring. Employers adopting skills- and competency-based hiring recognize that an overreliance on college degrees excludes capable candidates and undermines labor-market efficiencies. Degree-based hiring is especially likely to exclude qualified candidates for jobs related to emerging technologies and those with weak connections between educational attainment and the skills or competencies required to perform them. Moreover, unnecessary obstacles to opportunity disproportionately burden low-income Americans and decrease economic mobility. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) oversees most aspects of the civilian Federal workforce, including creating and maintaining the General Schedule classification system and determining the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements for Federal jobs. Executive departments and agencies (agencies), however, are responsible for vetting and selecting specific candidates to fill particular job openings consistent with statutory requirements and OPM rules and guidance, including applicable minimum educational requirements. Currently, for most Federal jobs, traditional education--high school, college, or graduate-level--rather than experiential learning is either an absolute requirement or the only path to consideration for candidates without many years of experience. As a result, Federal hiring practices currently lag behind those of private sector leaders in securing talent based on skills and competency. My Administration is committed to modernizing and reforming civil service hiring through improved identification of skills requirements and effective assessments of the skills job seekers possess. We encourage these same practices in the private sector. Modernizing our country's processes for identifying and hiring talent will provide America a more inclusive and demand-driven labor force. Through the work of the National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, my Administration is fulfilling its commitment to expand employment opportunities for workers. [[Page 386]] The increased adoption of apprenticeship programs by American employers, the creation of Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, and the implementation of Federal hiring reforms, including those in this order, represent important steps toward providing more Americans with pathways to family-sustaining careers. In addition, the Principles on Workforce Freedom and Mobility announced by my Administration in January 2020 detail reforms that will expand opportunities and eliminate unnecessary education costs for job seekers. This order builds on the broader work of my Administration to expand opportunity and create a more inclusive 21st-century economy. This order directs important, merit-based reforms that will replace degree-based hiring with skills- and competency-based hiring and will hold the civil service to a higher standard--ensuring that the individuals most capable of performing the roles and responsibilities required of a specific position are those hired for that position--that is more in line with the principles on which the merit system rests. Sec. 2. Revision of Job Classification and Qualification Standards. (a) The Director of OPM, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the heads of agencies, shall review and revise all job classification and qualification standards for positions within the competitive service, as necessary and consistent with subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) of this section. All changes to job classification and qualification standards shall be made available to the public within 120 days of the date of this order and go into effect within 180 days of the date of this order. (i) An agency may prescribe a minimum educational requirement for employment in the Federal competitive service only when a minimum educational qualification is legally required to perform the duties of the position in the State or locality where those duties are to be performed. (ii) Unless an agency is determining a candidate's satisfaction of a legally required minimum educational requirement, an agency may consider education in determining a candidate's satisfaction of some other minimum qualification only if the candidate's education directly reflects the competencies necessary to satisfy that qualification and perform the duties of the position. (b) Position descriptions and job postings published by agencies for positions within the competitive service should be based on the specific skills and competencies required to perform those jobs. Sec. 3. Improving the Use of Assessments in the Federal Hiring Process. (a) In addition to the other requirements of this order, the Director of OPM shall work with the heads of all agencies to ensure that, within 180 days of the date of this order, for positions within the competitive service, agencies assess candidates in a manner that does not rely solely on educational attainment to determine the extent to which candidates possess relevant knowledge, skills, competencies, and abilities. The heads of all agencies shall develop or identify such assessment practices. (b) In assessing candidates, agencies shall not rely solely on candidates' self-evaluations of their stated abilities. Applicants must clear other assessment hurdles in order to be certified for consideration. [[Page 387]] (c) Agencies shall continually evaluate the effectiveness of different assessment strategies to promote and protect the quality and integrity of their hiring processes. Sec. 4. Definitions. For purposes of this order: (a) the term ``assessment'' refers to any valid and reliable method of collecting information on an individual for the purposes of making a decision about qualification, hiring, placement, promotion, referral, or entry into programs leading to advancement; (b) the term ``competitive service'' has the meaning specified by section 2102 of title 5, United States Code; (c) the term ``education'' refers to Post High-School Education as that term is defined in the OPM General Schedule Qualification Policies; and (d) the term ``qualification'' means the minimum requirements necessary to perform work of a particular position or occupation successfully and safely. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 26, 2020. Executive Order 13933 of June 26, 2020 Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The first duty of government is to ensure domestic tranquility and defend the life, property, and rights of its citizens. Over the last 5 weeks, there has been a sustained assault on the life and property of civilians, law enforcement officers, government property, and revered American monuments such as the Lincoln Memorial. Many of the rioters, arsonists, and left-wing extremists who have carried out and supported these acts have explicitly identified themselves with ideologies--such as [[Page 388]] Marxism--that call for the destruction of the United States system of government. Anarchists and left-wing extremists have sought to advance a fringe ideology that paints the United States of America as fundamentally unjust and have sought to impose that ideology on Americans through violence and mob intimidation. They have led riots in the streets, burned police vehicles, killed and assaulted government officers as well as business owners defending their property, and even seized an area within one city where law and order gave way to anarchy. During the unrest, innocent citizens also have been harmed and killed. These criminal acts are frequently planned and supported by agitators who have traveled across State lines to promote their own violent agenda. These radicals shamelessly attack the legitimacy of our institutions and the very rule of law itself. Key targets in the violent extremists' campaign against our country are public monuments, memorials, and statues. Their selection of targets reveals a deep ignorance of our history, and is indicative of a desire to indiscriminately destroy anything that honors our past and to erase from the public mind any suggestion that our past may be worth honoring, cherishing, remembering, or understanding. In the last week, vandals toppled a statue of President Ulysses S. Grant in San Francisco. To them, it made no difference that President Grant led the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy in the Civil War, enforced Reconstruction, fought the Ku Klux Klan, and advocated for the Fifteenth Amendment, which guaranteed freed slaves the right to vote. In Charlotte, North Carolina, the names of 507 veterans memorialized on a World War II monument were painted over with a symbol of communism. And earlier this month, in Boston, a memorial commemorating an African-American regiment that fought in the Civil War was defaced with graffiti. In Madison, Wisconsin, rioters knocked over the statue of an abolitionist immigrant who fought for the Union during the Civil War. Christian figures are now in the crosshairs, too. Recently, an influential activist for one movement that has been prominent in setting the agenda for demonstrations in recent weeks declared that many existing religious depictions of Jesus and the Holy Family should be purged from our places of worship. Individuals and organizations have the right to peacefully advocate for either the removal or the construction of any monument. But no individual or group has the right to damage, deface, or remove any monument by use of force. In the midst of these attacks, many State and local governments appear to have lost the ability to distinguish between the lawful exercise of rights to free speech and assembly and unvarnished vandalism. They have surrendered to mob rule, imperiling community safety, allowing for the wholesale violation of our laws, and privileging the violent impulses of the mob over the rights of law-abiding citizens. Worse, they apparently have lost the will or the desire to stand up to the radical fringe and defend the fundamental truth that America is good, her people are virtuous, and that justice prevails in this country to a far greater extent than anywhere else in the world. Some particularly misguided public officials even appear to have accepted the idea that violence can be virtuous and have prevented their police from enforcing the law and protecting public monuments, memorials, and statues from the mob's ropes and graffiti. [[Page 389]] My Administration will not allow violent mobs incited by a radical fringe to become the arbiters of the aspects of our history that can be celebrated in public spaces. State and local public officials' abdication of their law enforcement responsibilities in deference to this violent assault must end. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States to prosecute to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as appropriate, any person or any entity that destroys, damages, vandalizes, or desecrates a monument, memorial, or statue within the United States or otherwise vandalizes government property. The desire of the Congress to protect Federal property is clearly reflected in section 1361 of title 18, United States Code, which authorizes a penalty of up to 10 years' imprisonment for the willful injury of Federal property. More recently, under the Veterans' Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003, section 1369 of title 18, United States Code, the Congress punished with the same penalties the destruction of Federal and in some cases State- maintained monuments that honor military veterans. Other criminal statutes, such as the Travel Act, section 1952 of title 18, United States Code, permit prosecutions of arson damaging monuments, memorials, and statues on State grounds in some cases. Civil statutes like the Public System Resource Protection Act, section 100722 of title 54, United States Code, also hold those who destroy certain Federal property accountable for their offenses. The Federal Government will not tolerate violations of these and other laws. (b) It is the policy of the United States to prosecute to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as appropriate, any person or any entity that participates in efforts to incite violence or other illegal activity in connection with the riots and acts of vandalism described in section 1 of this order. Numerous Federal laws, including section 2101 of title 18, United States Code, prohibit the violence that has typified the past few weeks in some cities. Other statutes punish those who participate in or assist the agitators who have coordinated these lawless acts. Such laws include section 371 of title 18, United States Code, which criminalizes certain conspiracies to violate Federal law, section 2 of title 18, United States Code, which punishes those who aid or abet the commission of Federal crimes, and section 2339A of title 18, United States Code, which prohibits as material support to terrorism efforts to support a defined set of Federal crimes. Those who have joined in recent violent acts around the United States will be held accountable. (c) It is the policy of the United States to prosecute to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as appropriate, any person or any entity that damages, defaces, or destroys religious property, including by attacking, removing, or defacing depictions of Jesus or other religious figures or religious art work. Federal laws prohibit, under certain circumstances, damage or defacement of religious property, including the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, section 247 of title 18, United States Code, and section 371 of title 18, United States Code. The Federal Government will not tolerate violations of these laws designed to protect the free exercise of religion. (d) It is the policy of the United States, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to withhold Federal support tied to public spaces from State and local governments that have failed to protect public monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction or vandalism. These jurisdictions' recent abandonment of their law enforcement responsibilities with respect [[Page 390]] to public monuments, memorials, and statues casts doubt on their willingness to protect other public spaces and maintain the peace within them. These jurisdictions are not appropriate candidates for limited Federal funds that support public spaces. (e) It is the policy of the United States, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to withhold Federal support from State and local law enforcement agencies that have failed to protect public monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction or vandalism. Unwillingness to enforce State and local laws in the face of attacks on our history, whether because of sympathy for the extremists behind this violence or some other improper reason, casts doubt on the management of these law enforcement agencies. These law enforcement agencies are not appropriate candidates for limited Federal funds that support State and local police. Sec. 3. Enforcing Laws Prohibiting the Desecration of Public Monuments, the Vandalism of Government Property, and Recent Acts of Violence. (a) The Attorney General shall prioritize within the Department of Justice the investigation and prosecution of matters described in subsections 2(a), (b), and (c) of this order. The Attorney General shall take all appropriate enforcement action against individuals and organizations found to have violated Federal law through these investigations. (b) The Attorney General shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, work with State and local law enforcement authorities and Federal agencies to ensure the Federal Government appropriately provides information and assistance to State and local law enforcement authorities in connection with their investigations or prosecutions for the desecration of monuments, memorials, and statues, regardless of whether such structures are situated on Federal property. Sec. 4. Limiting Federal Grants for Jurisdictions and Law Enforcement Agencies that Permit the Desecration of Monuments, Memorials, or Statues. The heads of all executive departments and agencies shall examine their respective grant programs and apply the policies established by sections 2(d) and (e) of this order to all such programs to the extent that such application is both appropriate and consistent with applicable law. Sec. 5. Providing Assistance for the Protection of Federal Monuments, Memorials, Statues, and Property. Upon the request of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, personnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property. This section shall terminate 6 months from the date of this order unless extended by the President. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. [[Page 391]] (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, affect the prosecutorial discretion of the Department of Justice with respect to individual cases. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 26, 2020. Executive Order 13934 of July 3, 2020 Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. America owes its present greatness to its past sacrifices. Because the past is always at risk of being forgotten, monuments will always be needed to honor those who came before. Since the time of our founding, Americans have raised monuments to our greatest citizens. In 1784, the legislature of Virginia commissioned the earliest statue of George Washington, a ``monument of affection and gratitude'' to a man who ``unit[ed] to the endowment[s] of the Hero the virtues of the Patriot'' and gave to the world ``an Immortal Example of true Glory.'' I Res. H. Del. (June 24, 1784). In our public parks and plazas, we have erected statues of great Americans who, through acts of wisdom and daring, built and preserved for us a republic of ordered liberty. These statues are silent teachers in solid form of stone and metal. They preserve the memory of our American story and stir in us a spirit of responsibility for the chapters yet unwritten. These works of art call forth gratitude for the accomplishments and sacrifices of our exceptional fellow citizens who, despite their flaws, placed their virtues, their talents, and their lives in the service of our Nation. These monuments express our noblest ideals: respect for our ancestors, love of freedom, and striving for a more perfect union. They are works of beauty, created as enduring tributes. In preserving them, we show reverence for our past, we dignify our present, and we inspire those who are to come. To build a monument is to ratify our shared national project. To destroy a monument is to desecrate our common inheritance. In recent weeks, in the midst of protests across America, many monuments have been vandalized or destroyed. Some local governments have responded by taking their monuments down. Among others, monuments to Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Francis Scott Key, Ulysses S. Grant, leaders of the abolitionist movement, the first all-volunteer African-American regiment of the Union Army in the Civil War, and American soldiers killed in the First and Second World Wars have been vandalized, destroyed, or removed. [[Page 392]] These statues are not ours alone, to be discarded at the whim of those inflamed by fashionable political passions; they belong to generations that have come before us and to generations yet unborn. My Administration will not abide an assault on our collective national memory. In the face of such acts of destruction, it is our responsibility as Americans to stand strong against this violence, and to peacefully transmit our great national story to future generations through newly commissioned monuments to American heroes. Sec. 2. Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes. (a) There is hereby established the Interagency Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes (Task Force). The Task Force shall be chaired by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), and shall include the following additional members: (i) the Administrator of General Services (Administrator); (ii) the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA); (iii) the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH); (iv) the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP); and (v) any officers or employees of any executive department or agency (agency) designated by the President or the Secretary. (b) The Department of the Interior shall provide funding and administrative support as may be necessary for the performance and functions of the Task Force. The Secretary shall designate an official of the Department of the Interior to serve as the Executive Director of the Task Force, responsible for coordinating its day-to-day activities. (c) The Chairpersons of the NEA and NEH and the Chairman of the ACHP shall establish cross-department initiatives within the NEA, NEH, and ACHP, respectively, to advance the purposes of the Task Force and this order and to coordinate relevant agency operations with the Task Force. Sec. 3. National Garden of American Heroes. (a) It shall be the policy of the United States to establish a statuary park named the National Garden of American Heroes (National Garden). (b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Task Force shall submit a report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy that proposes options for the creation of the National Garden, including potential locations for the site. In identifying options, the Task Force shall: (i) strive to open the National Garden expeditiously; (ii) evaluate the feasibility of creating the National Garden through a variety of potential avenues, including existing agency authorities and appropriations; and (iii) consider the availability of authority to encourage and accept the donation or loan of statues by States, localities, civic organizations, businesses, religious organizations, and individuals, for display at the National Garden. [[Page 393]] (c) In addition to the requirements of subsection 3(b) of this order, the proposed options for the National Garden should adhere to the criteria described in subsections (c)(i) through (c)(vi) of this section. (i) The National Garden should be composed of statues, including statues of John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Daniel Boone, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Henry Clay, Davy Crockett, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Franklin, Billy Graham, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Douglas MacArthur, Dolley Madison, James Madison, Christa McAuliffe, Audie Murphy, George S. Patton, Jr., Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, Betsy Ross, Antonin Scalia, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, George Washington, and Orville and Wilbur Wright. (ii) The National Garden should be opened for public access prior to the 250th anniversary of the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2026. (iii) Statues should depict historically significant Americans, as that term is defined in section 7 of this order, who have contributed positively to America throughout our history. Examples include: the Founding Fathers, those who fought for the abolition of slavery or participated in the underground railroad, heroes of the United States Armed Forces, recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor or Presidential Medal of Freedom, scientists and inventors, entrepreneurs, civil rights leaders, missionaries and religious leaders, pioneers and explorers, police officers and firefighters killed or injured in the line of duty, labor leaders, advocates for the poor and disadvantaged, opponents of national socialism or international socialism, former Presidents of the United States and other elected officials, judges and justices, astronauts, authors, intellectuals, artists, and teachers. None will have lived perfect lives, but all will be worth honoring, remembering, and studying. (iv) All statues in the National Garden should be lifelike or realistic representations of the persons they depict, not abstract or modernist representations. (v) The National Garden should be located on a site of natural beauty that enables visitors to enjoy nature, walk among the statues, and be inspired to learn about great figures of America's history. The site should be proximate to at least one major population center, and the site should not cause significant disruption to the local community. (vi) As part of its civic education mission, the National Garden should also separately maintain a collection of statues for temporary display at appropriate sites around the United States that are accessible to the general public. Sec. 4. Commissioning of New Statues and Works of Art. (a) The Task Force shall examine the appropriations authority of the agencies represented on it in light of the purpose and policy of this order. Based on its examination of relevant authorities, the Task Force shall make recommendations for the use of these agencies' appropriations. (b) To the extent appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the other provisions of this order, Task Force agencies that are authorized to provide for the commissioning of statues or monuments shall, in expending [[Page 394]] funds, give priority to projects involving the commissioning of publicly accessible statues of persons meeting the criteria described in section 3(b)(iii) of this order, with particular preference for statues of the Founding Fathers, former Presidents of the United States, leading abolitionists, and individuals involved in the discovery of America. (c) To the extent appropriate and consistent with applicable law, these agencies shall prioritize projects that will result in the installation of a statue as described in subsection (b) of this section in a community where a statue depicting a historically significant American was removed or destroyed in conjunction with the events described in section 1 of this order. (d) After consulting with the Task Force, the Administrator of General Services shall promptly revise and thereafter operate the General Service Administration's (GSA's) Art in Architecture (AIA) Policies and Procedures, GSA Acquisition Letter V-10-01, and Part 102-77 of title 41, Code of Federal Regulations, to prioritize the commission of works of art that portray historically significant Americans or events of American historical significance or illustrate the ideals upon which our Nation was founded. Priority should be given to public-facing monuments to former Presidents of the United States and to individuals and events relating to the discovery of America, the founding of the United States, and the abolition of slavery. Such works of art should be designed to be appreciated by the general public and by those who use and interact with Federal buildings. Priority should be given to this policy above other policies contained in Part 102-77 of title 41, Code of Federal Regulations, and revisions made pursuant to this subsection shall be made to supersede any regulatory provisions of AIA that may conflict with or otherwise impede advancing the purposes of this subsection. (e) When a statue or work of art commissioned pursuant to this section is meant to depict a historically significant American, the statue or work of art shall be a lifelike or realistic representation of that person, not an abstract or modernist representation. Sec. 5. Educational Programming. The Chairperson of the NEH shall prioritize the allocation of funding to programs and projects that educate Americans about the founding documents and founding ideals of the United States, as appropriate and to the extent consistent with applicable law, including section 956 of title 20, United States Code. The founding documents include the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers. The founding ideals include equality under the law, respect for inalienable individual rights, and representative self-government. Within 90 days of the conclusion of each Fiscal Year from 2021 through 2026, the Chairperson shall submit a report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy that identifies funding allocated to programs and projects pursuant to this section. Sec. 6. Protection of National Garden and Statues Commissioned Pursuant to this Order. The Attorney General shall apply section 3 of Executive Order 13933 of June 26, 2020 (Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence), with respect to violations of Federal law regarding the National Garden and all statues commissioned pursuant to this order. [[Page 395]] Sec. 7. Definition. The term ``historically significant American'' means an individual who was, or became, an American citizen and was a public figure who made substantive contributions to America's public life or otherwise had a substantive effect on America's history. The phrase also includes public figures such as Christopher Columbus, Junipero Serra, and the Marquis de La Fayette, who lived prior to or during the American Revolution and were not American citizens, but who made substantive historical contributions to the discovery, development, or independence of the future United States. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 3, 2020. Executive Order 13935 of July 9, 2020 White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational and economic opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The success of Hispanic Americans is integral to the economic future of our country. As more than 60 million Hispanics live in the United States today, Hispanics are the largest minority group in the country. Hispanics are also the Nation's youngest major racial or ethnic group. Generations of Hispanics constituting different backgrounds and cultures have contributed to building a strong and prosperous America. Their collective contributions continue a legacy of inspiration that is a cherished part of the American experience. While we celebrate the many ways Hispanic Americans have contributed to our Nation, we also recognize that they face challenges in accessing educational and economic opportunities. In the last 3 years, my Administration has supported school choice, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and new career pathways, including apprenticeships and work-based learning initiatives, because quality education options offering multiple pathways to economic success are critical to developing our Nation's potential for the jobs [[Page 396]] of tomorrow. My Administration has also supported investment in economically distressed communities, including through Opportunity Zones, and economic opportunities for small and minority-owned businesses. The initiative set forth in this order increases emphasis on the connection between educational and economic opportunities, and exploring and promoting opportunities for Hispanic Americans, both through and outside traditional education options, that lead to economic prosperity. Today, Americans have more paths to prosperity than any previous generation, and it is necessary to ensure that Hispanic Americans have every opportunity to access these pathways and to fulfill their educational and economic aspirations. Sec. 2. White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative. There is established the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative (Initiative), housed in the Department of Education (Department). (a) The mission of the Initiative shall be to improve access by Hispanic Americans to educational and economic opportunities. Consistent with its mission, the Initiative shall: (i) identify and promote educational and workforce development practices that have improved educational, professional, and economic outcomes for Hispanic Americans; (ii) encourage private-sector initiatives and foster public-private partnerships that improve access to educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans; (iii) develop a national network of individuals, organizations, and communities, with which to consult and collaborate regarding practices and policies that improve access to educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans; (iv) monitor the development, implementation, and coordination of Federal Government educational, workforce, and business development programs designed to improve outcomes for Hispanic Americans; and (v) advise the President, through the Secretary of Education (Secretary), on issues of importance to Hispanic Americans and policies relating to Hispanic Americans' prosperity. (b) The Initiative shall be led by an Executive Director, designated by the Secretary. The Executive Director shall also serve as Executive Director of the Commission created by section 3 of this order. In addition to leading the work of the Initiative, the Executive Director shall coordinate the work of, and provide administrative support for, the Commission. As appropriate, the Department shall provide the Initiative with staff, resources, and administrative support, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide such information, support, and assistance to the Initiative as the Secretary may request. (d) The Initiative, acting through the Executive Director, shall provide regular reports on its activities to appropriate officials in the Executive Office of the President, including the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Assistant to the President for the Office of American Innovation, the [[Page 397]] Assistant to the President for the Office of Economic Initiatives, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Director of the Office of Public Liaison, and the Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. (e) As part of the Initiative, there is established an Interagency Working Group (Working Group) to collaborate regarding resources and opportunities available across the Federal Government to increase educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans. The Working Group shall also serve as a channel for communication between the Initiative and other agencies. (i) The Working Group shall be chaired by the Executive Director of the Initiative and shall consist of a senior official from the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of American Innovation, the Office of Public Liaison, and each agency that develops or implements policies relating to Hispanic American prosperity, as identified by the Secretary. (ii) The Department shall provide the Working Group with administrative support to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Sec. 3. The President's Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity. There is established in the Department the President's Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity (Commission). (a) The Commission shall be composed of not more than 20 members, who shall be appointed by the President. The Commission may include individuals from outside the Federal Government with relevant experience or subject matter expertise in promoting educational opportunities and economic success in the Hispanic American community. The Commission shall also include the following officers, or their designees: (i) the Secretary of Commerce; (ii) the Secretary of Labor; (iii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (iv) the Secretary of Education; and (v) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. (b) The functions of the Commission shall be to: (i) promote pathways to in-demand jobs for Hispanic American students, including apprenticeships, internships, fellowships, mentorships, and work- based learning initiatives; (ii) strengthen HSIs, as defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and increase the participation of the Hispanic American community, Hispanic-serving school districts, and HSIs in the programs of the Department and other agencies; (iii) promote local-based and national private-public partnerships to promote high-quality education, training, and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans; (iv) promote awareness of educational opportunities for Hispanic American students, including options to enhance school choice, personalized learning, family engagement, and civics education; (v) promote public awareness of the educational and training challenges that Hispanic Americans face and the causes of these challenges; [[Page 398]] (vi) monitor changes in Hispanic Americans' access to educational and economic opportunities; and (vii) advise the President and the Initiative on educational and economic opportunities for the Hispanic American community. (c) The Commission shall periodically report to the President, through the Secretary and after consulting with the Executive Director, on progress in providing Hispanic American students, workers, and communities with increased access to educational and economic opportunities. The reports shall identify efforts of agencies to improve educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans. The reports shall also include, as appropriate, recommendations for improving Federal education, workforce, small business, and other programs. (d) The Commission shall have a Chair and two Vice Chairs, designated by the President from among the members of the Commission. The Chair and Vice Chairs shall work with the Executive Director to convene regular meetings of the Commission, determine its agenda, and direct its work, consistent with this order. (i) The Department shall provide funding and administrative support for the Commission, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (ii) Members of the Commission shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707). (iii) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the Commission, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Administrator of General Services. (e) The Commission shall terminate 2 years after the date of this order unless extended by the President. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order supersedes Executive Order 13555 of October 19, 2010 (White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics), and section 1(u) of Executive Order 13889 of September 27, 2019 (Continuance of Certain Federal Advisory Committees). (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party [[Page 399]] against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 9, 2020. Executive Order 13936 of July 14, 2020 The President's Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-393), the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-76), the Hong Kong Autonomy Act of 2020, signed into law July 14, 2020, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, determine, pursuant to section 202 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, that the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong (Hong Kong) is no longer sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to the People's Republic of China (PRC or China) under the particular United States laws and provisions thereof set out in this order. In late May 2020, the National People's Congress of China announced its intention to unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. This announcement was merely China's latest salvo in a series of actions that have increasingly denied autonomy and freedoms that China promised to the people of Hong Kong under the 1984 Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong (Joint Declaration). As a result, on May 27, 2020, the Secretary of State announced that the PRC had fundamentally undermined Hong Kong's autonomy and certified and reported to the Congress, pursuant to sections 205 and 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, as amended, respectively, that Hong Kong no longer warrants treatment under United States law in the same manner as United States laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1, 1997. On May 29, 2020, I directed the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions under United States law that give Hong Kong differential treatment in relation to China. China has since followed through on its threat to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. Under this law, the people of Hong Kong may face life in prison for what China considers to be acts of secession or subversion of state power--which may include acts like last year's widespread anti-government protests. The right to trial by jury may be suspended. Proceedings may be conducted in secret. China has given itself broad power [[Page 400]] to initiate and control the prosecutions of the people of Hong Kong through the new Office for Safeguarding National Security. At the same time, the law allows foreigners to be expelled if China merely suspects them of violating the law, potentially making it harder for journalists, human rights organizations, and other outside groups to hold the PRC accountable for its treatment of the people of Hong Kong. I therefore determine that the situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken by the PRC to fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to that threat. In light of the foregoing, I hereby determine and order: Section 1. It shall be the policy of the United States to suspend or eliminate different and preferential treatment for Hong Kong to the extent permitted by law and in the national security, foreign policy, and economic interest of the United States. Sec. 2. Pursuant to section 202 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5722), I hereby suspend the application of section 201(a) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, as amended (22 U.S.C. 5721(a)), to the following statutes: (a) section 103 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (8 U.S.C. 1152 note); (b) sections 203(c), 212(l), and 221(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1153(c), 1182(l), and 1201(c), respectively); (c) the Arms Export Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.); (d) section 721(m) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4565(m)); (e) the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4801 et seq.); and (f) section 1304 of title 19, United States Code. Sec. 3. Within 15 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies shall commence all appropriate actions to further the purposes of this order, consistent with applicable law, including, to: (a) amend any regulations implementing those provisions specified in section 2 of this order, and, consistent with applicable law and executive orders, under IEEPA, which provide different treatment for Hong Kong as compared to China; (b) amend the regulation at 8 CFR 212.4(i) to eliminate the preference for Hong Kong passport holders as compared to PRC passport holders; (c) revoke license exceptions for exports to Hong Kong, reexports to Hong Kong, and transfers (in-country) within Hong Kong of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 730-774, that provide differential treatment compared to those license exceptions applicable to exports to China, reexports to China, and transfers (in- country) within China; (d) consistent with section 902(b)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246), terminate the [[Page 401]] export licensing suspensions under section 902(a)(3) of such Act insofar as such suspensions apply to exports of defense articles to Hong Kong persons who are physically located outside of Hong Kong and the PRC and who were authorized to receive defense articles prior to the date of this order; (e) give notice of intent to suspend the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders (TIAS 98-121); (f) give notice of intent to terminate the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong for the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (TIAS 99-418); (g) take steps to end the provision of training to members of the Hong Kong Police Force or other Hong Kong security services at the Department of State's International Law Enforcement Academies; (h) suspend continued cooperation undertaken consistent with the now-expired Protocol Between the U.S. Geological Survey of the Department of the Interior of the United States of America and Institute of Space and Earth Information Science of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Concerning Scientific and Technical Cooperation in Earth Sciences (TIAS 09-1109); (i) take steps to terminate the Fulbright exchange program with regard to China and Hong Kong with respect to future exchanges for participants traveling both from and to China or Hong Kong; (j) give notice of intent to terminate the agreement for the reciprocal exemption with respect to taxes on income from the international operation of ships effected by the Exchange of Notes Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong (TIAS 11892); (k) reallocate admissions within the refugee ceiling set by the annual Presidential Determination to residents of Hong Kong based on humanitarian concerns, to the extent feasible and consistent with applicable law; and (l) propose for my consideration any further actions deemed necessary and prudent to end special conditions and preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Sec. 4. All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: (a) Any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State: (i) to be or have been involved, directly or indirectly, in the coercing, arresting, detaining, or imprisoning of individuals under the authority of, or to be or have been responsible for or involved in developing, adopting, or implementing, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Administrative Region; (ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, any of the following: [[Page 402]] (A) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Hong Kong; (B) actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, or autonomy of Hong Kong; (C) censorship or other activities with respect to Hong Kong that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by citizens of Hong Kong, or that limit access to free and independent print, online or broadcast media; or (D) the extrajudicial rendition, arbitrary detention, or torture of any person in Hong Kong or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights or serious human rights abuse in Hong Kong; (iii) to be or have been a leader or official of: (A) an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, any of the activities described in subsections (a)(i), (a)(ii)(A), (a)(ii)(B), or (a)(ii)(C) of this section; or (B) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section; (v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section; or (vi) to be a member of the board of directors or a senior executive officer of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section. (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 4 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 4 of this order. Sec. 6. The prohibitions in section 4(a) of this order include: (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 4(a) of this order; and (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 7. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 4(a) of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or [[Page 403]] aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, such aliens, would be detrimental to the interest of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility of implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. Sec. 8. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 9. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. Sec. 10. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; (b) the term ``entity'' means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization, including an international organization; (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and (d) The term ``immediate family member'' means spouses and children of any age. Sec. 11. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 4 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 4 of this order. Sec. 12. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to me by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 13. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with [[Page 404]] section 401(c) of the NEA (50 section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 14. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. Sec. 15. If, based on consideration of the terms, obligations, and expectations expressed in the Joint Declaration, I determine that changes in China's actions ensure that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to the PRC under United States law, I will reconsider the determinations made and actions taken and directed under this order. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 14, 2020. Executive Order 13937 of July 24, 2020 Access to Affordable Life-Saving Medications By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Insulin is a critical and life-saving medication that approximately 8 million Americans rely on to manage diabetes. Likewise, injectable epinephrine is a life-saving medication used to stop severe allergic reactions. The price of insulin in the United States has risen dramatically over the past decade. The list price for a single vial of insulin today is often more than $250 and most patients use at least two vials per month. As for injectable epinephrine, recent increased competition is helping to drive prices down. Nevertheless, the price for some types of injectable epinephrine remains more than $600 per kit. While Americans with diabetes and severe allergic reactions may have access to affordable insulin and injectable epinephrine through commercial insurance or Federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, many Americans still struggle to purchase these products. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), as defined in section 1905(l)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. [[Page 405]] 1396d(l)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), receive discounted prices through the 340B Prescription Drug Program on prescription drugs. Due to the sharp increases in list prices for many insulins and some types of injectable epinephrine in recent years, many of these products may be subject to the ``penny pricing'' policy when distributed to FQHCs, meaning FQHCs may purchase the drug at a price of one penny per unit of measure. These steep discounts, however, are not always passed through to low-income Americans at the point of sale. Those with low-incomes can be exposed to high insulin and injectable epinephrine prices, as they often do not benefit from discounts negotiated by insurers or the Federal or State governments. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to enable Americans without access to affordable insulin and injectable epinephrine through commercial insurance or Federal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to purchase these pharmaceuticals from an FQHC at a price that aligns with the cost at which the FQHC acquired the medication. Sec. 3. Improving the Availability of Insulin and Injectable Epinephrine for the Uninsured. To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take action to ensure future grants available under section 330(e) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), are conditioned upon FQHCs' having established practices to make insulin and injectable epinephrine available at the discounted price paid by the FQHC grantee or sub- grantee under the 340B Prescription Drug Program (plus a minimal administration fee) to individuals with low incomes, as determined by the Secretary, who: (a) have a high cost sharing requirement for either insulin or injectable epinephrine; (b) have a high unmet deductible; or (c) have no health care insurance. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 24, 2020. [[Page 406]] Executive Order 13938 of July 24, 2020 Increasing Drug Importation To Lower Prices for American Patients By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Americans spend more per capita on pharmaceutical drugs than residents of any other developed country. Americans often pay more for the exact same drugs, even when they are produced and shipped from the exact same facilities. One way to minimize international disparities in price is to increase the trade of prescription drugs between nations with lower prices and those with persistently higher ones. Over time, reducing trade barriers and increasing the exchange of drugs will likely result in lower prices for the country that is paying more for drugs. For example, in the European Union, a market characterized by price controls and significant barriers to entry, the parallel trade of drugs has existed for decades and has been estimated to reduce the price of certain drugs by up to 20 percent. Accordingly, my Administration supports the goal of safe importation of prescription drugs. Sec. 2. Permitting the Importation of Safe Prescription Drugs from Other Countries. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, take action to expand safe access to lower-cost imported prescription drugs by: (a) facilitating grants to individuals of waivers of the prohibition of importation of prescription drugs, provided such importation poses no additional risk to public safety and results in lower costs to American patients, pursuant to section 804(j)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. 384(j)(2); (b) authorizing the re-importation of insulin products upon a finding by the Secretary that it is required for emergency medical care pursuant to section 801(d) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. 381(d); and (c) completing the rulemaking process regarding the proposed rule to implement section 804(b) through (h) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. 384(b) through (h), to allow importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party [[Page 407]] against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 24, 2020. Executive Order 13939 of July 24, 2020 Lowering Prices for Patients by Eliminating Kickbacks to Middlemen By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. One of the reasons pharmaceutical drug prices in the United States are so high is because of the complex mix of payers and negotiators that often separates the consumer from the manufacturer in the drug-purchasing process. The result is that the prices patients see at the point-of-sale do not reflect the prices that the patient's insurance companies, and middlemen hired by the insurance companies, actually pay for drugs. Instead, these middlemen--health plan sponsors and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)--negotiate significant discounts off of the list prices, sometimes up to 50 percent of the cost of the drug. Medicare patients, whose cost sharing is typically based on list prices, pay more than they should for drugs while the middlemen collect large ``rebate'' checks. These rebates are the functional equivalent of kickbacks, and erode savings that could otherwise go to the Medicare patients taking those drugs. Yet currently, Federal regulations create a safe harbor for such discounts and preclude treating them as kickbacks under the law. Fixing this problem could save Medicare patients billions of dollars. The Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services has found that patients in the catastrophic phase of the Medicare Part D program saw their out-of-pocket costs for high-price drugs increase by 47 percent from 2010 to 2015, from $175 per month to $257 per month. Narrowing the safe harbor for these discounts under the anti-kickback statute will allow tens of billions in dollars of rebates on prescription drugs in the Medicare Part D program to go directly to patients, saving many patients hundreds or thousands of dollars per year at the pharmacy counter. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States that discounts offered on prescription drugs should be passed on to patients. Sec. 3. Directing Drug Rebates to Patients Instead of Middlemen. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall complete the rulemaking process he commenced seeking to: (a) exclude from safe harbor protections under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7b, certain retrospective reductions in price that are not applied at the point-of-sale or other remuneration that drug manufacturers provide to health plan sponsors, pharmacies, or PBMs in operating the Medicare Part D program; and [[Page 408]] (b) establish new safe harbors that would permit health plan sponsors, pharmacies, and PBMs to apply discounts at the patient's point-of-sale in order to lower the patient's out-of-pocket costs, and that would permit the use of certain bona fide PBM service fees. Sec. 4. Protecting Low Premiums. Prior to taking action under section 3 of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall confirm--and make public such confirmation--that the action is not projected to increase Federal spending, Medicare beneficiary premiums, or patients' total out-of-pocket costs. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 24, 2020. Executive Order 13940 of August 3, 2020 Aligning Federal Contracting and Hiring Practices With the Interests of American Workers By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to create opportunities for United States workers to compete for jobs, including jobs created through Federal contracts. These opportunities, particularly in regions where the Federal Government remains the largest employer, are especially critical during the economic dislocation caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. When employers trade American jobs for temporary foreign labor, for example, it reduces opportunities for United States workers in a manner inconsistent with the role guest-worker programs are meant to play in the Nation's economy. Sec. 2. Review of Contracting and Hiring Practices. (a) The head of each executive department and agency (agency) that enters into contracts shall review, to the extent practicable, performance of contracts (including subcontracts) awarded by the agency in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to assess: (i) whether contractors (including subcontractors) used temporary foreign labor for contracts performed in the United States, and, if so, the nature [[Page 409]] of the work performed by temporary foreign labor on such contracts; whether opportunities for United States workers were affected by such hiring; and any potential effects on the national security caused by such hiring; and (ii) whether contractors (including subcontractors) performed in foreign countries services previously performed in the United States, and, if so, whether opportunities for United States workers were affected by such offshoring; whether affected United States workers were eligible for assistance under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program authorized by the Trade Act of 1974; and any potential effects on the national security caused by such offshoring. (b) The head of each agency that enters into contracts shall assess any negative impact of contractors' and subcontractors' temporary foreign labor hiring practices or offshoring practices on the economy and efficiency of Federal procurement and on the national security, and propose action, if necessary and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to improve the economy and efficiency of Federal procurement and protect the national security. (c) The head of each agency shall, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, review the employment policies of the agency to assess the agency's compliance with Executive Order 11935 of September 2, 1976 (Citizenship Requirements for Federal Employment), and section 704 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law 116-93. (d) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget summarizing the results of the reviews required by subsections (a) through (c) of this section; recommending, if necessary, corrective actions that may be taken by the agency and timeframes to implement such actions; and proposing any Presidential actions that may be appropriate. Sec. 3. Measures to Prevent Adverse Effects on United States Workers. Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries of Labor and Homeland Security shall take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to protect United States workers from any adverse effects on wages and working conditions caused by the employment of H-1B visa holders at job sites (including third-party job sites), including measures to ensure that all employers of H-1B visa holders, including secondary employers, adhere to the requirements of section 212(n)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)). Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party [[Page 410]] against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 3, 2020. Executive Order 13941 of August 3, 2020 Improving Rural Health and Telehealth Access By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. My Administration is committed to improving the health of all Americans by improving access to better care, including for the approximately 57 million Americans living in rural communities. Americans living in rural communities face unique challenges when seeking healthcare services, such as limited transportation opportunities, shortages of healthcare workers, and an inability to fully benefit from technological and care-delivery innovations. These factors have contributed to financial insecurity and impaired health outcomes for rural Americans, who are more likely to die from five leading causes, many of which are preventable, than their urban counterparts. That gap widened from 2010 to 2017 for cancer, heart disease, and chronic lower respiratory disease. Since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act was passed, 129 rural hospitals in the United States have closed. Predictably, financial distress is the strongest driver for risk of closure, and many rural hospitals lack sufficient patient volume to be sustainable under traditional healthcare-reimbursement mechanisms. From 2015 to 2017, the average occupancy rate of a hospital that closed was only 22 percent. When hospitals close, the patient population around them carries an increased risk of mortality due to increased travel time and decreased access. During the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), hospitals curtailed elective medical procedures and access to in-person clinical care was limited. To help patients better access healthcare providers, my Administration implemented new flexibility regarding what services may be provided via telehealth, who may provide them, and in what circumstances, and the use of telehealth increased dramatically across the Nation. Internal analysis by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) showed a weekly jump in virtual visits for CMS beneficiaries, from approximately 14,000 pre-PHE to almost 1.7 million in the last week of April. Additionally, a recent report by HHS shows that nearly half (43.5 percent) of Medicare fee-for-service primary care visits were provided through telehealth in April, compared with far less than one percent (0.1 percent) in February before the PHE. Importantly, the report finds that telehealth visits continued to be frequent even after in-person primary care visits resumed in May, indicating that the expansion of telehealth services is likely to be a more permanent feature of the healthcare delivery system. [[Page 411]] Rural healthcare providers, in particular, need these types of flexibilities to provide continuous care to patients in their communities. It is the purpose of this order to increase access to, improve the quality of, and improve the financial economics of rural healthcare, including by increasing access to high-quality care through telehealth. Sec. 2. Launching an Innovative Payment Model to Enable Rural Healthcare Transformation. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of HHS (Secretary) will announce a new model, pursuant to section 1115A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a), to test innovative payment mechanisms in order to ensure that rural healthcare providers are able to provide the necessary level and quality of care. This model should give rural providers flexibilities from existing Medicare rules, establish predictable financial payments, and encourage the movement into high-quality, value-based care. Sec. 3. Investments in Physical and Communications Infrastructure. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture shall, consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission and other executive departments and agencies, as appropriate, develop and implement a strategy to improve rural health by improving the physical and communications healthcare infrastructure available to rural Americans. Sec. 4. Improving the Health of Rural Americans. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, regarding existing and upcoming policy initiatives to: (a) increase rural access to healthcare by eliminating regulatory burdens that limit the availability of clinical professionals; (b) prevent disease and mortality by developing rural-specific efforts to drive improved health outcomes; (c) reduce maternal mortality and morbidity; and (d) improve mental health in rural communities. Sec. 5. Expanding Flexibilities Beyond the Public Health Emergency. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall review the following temporary measures put in place during the PHE, and shall propose a regulation to extend these measures, as appropriate, beyond the duration of the PHE: (a) the additional telehealth services offered to Medicare beneficiaries; and (b) the services, reporting, staffing, and supervision flexibilities offered to Medicare providers in rural areas. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. [[Page 412]] (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 3, 2020. Executive Order 13942 of August 6, 2020 Addressing the Threat Posed by TikTok, and Taking Additional Steps To Address the National Emergency With Respect to the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that additional steps must be taken to deal with the national emergency with respect to the information and communications technology and services supply chain declared in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain). Specifically, the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application in particular, TikTok. TikTok, a video-sharing mobile application owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd., has reportedly been downloaded over 175 million times in the United States and over one billion times globally. TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information--potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage. TikTok also reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive, such as content concerning protests in Hong Kong and China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. This mobile application may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party, such as when TikTok videos spread [[Page 413]] debunked conspiracy theories about the origins of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. These risks are real. The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Armed Forces have already banned the use of TikTok on Federal Government phones. The Government of India recently banned the use of TikTok and other Chinese mobile applications throughout the country; in a statement, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asserted that they were ``stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.'' American companies and organizations have begun banning TikTok on their devices. The United States must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security. Accordingly, I hereby order: Section 1. (a) The following actions shall be prohibited beginning 45 days after the date of this order, to the extent permitted under applicable law: any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd. (a.k.a. Z[igrave]ji[eacute] Ti[agrave]od[ograve]ng), Beijing, China, or its subsidiaries, in which any such company has any interest, as identified by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) under section 1(c) of this order. (b) The prohibition in subsection (a) of this section applies except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. (c) 45 days after the date of this order, the Secretary shall identify the transactions subject to subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate the prohibition set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; (b) the term ``entity'' means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization, including an international organization; and (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. Sec. 4. The Secretary is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to me by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Commerce. All departments and agencies of the United [[Page 414]] States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 6, 2020. Executive Order 13943 of August 6, 2020 Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat, and Taking Additional Steps To Address the National Emergency With Respect to the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that additional steps must be taken to deal with the national emergency with respect to the information and communications technology and services supply chain declared in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain). As I explained in an Executive Order of August 6, 2020 (Addressing the Threat Posed by Tiktok, and Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain), the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To protect our Nation, I took action to address the threat posed by one mobile application, TikTok. Further action is needed to address a similar threat posed by another mobile application, WeChat. WeChat, a messaging, social media, and electronic payment application owned by the Chinese company Tencent Holdings Ltd., reportedly has over [[Page 415]] one billion users worldwide, including users in the United States. Like TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information. In addition, the application captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party a mechanism for keeping tabs on Chinese citizens who may be enjoying the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives. For example, in March 2019, a researcher reportedly discovered a Chinese database containing billions of WeChat messages sent from users in not only China but also the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia. WeChat, like TikTok, also reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive and may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party. These risks have led other countries, including Australia and India, to begin restricting or banning the use of WeChat. The United States must take aggressive action against the owner of WeChat to protect our national security. Accordingly, I hereby order: Section 1. (a) The following actions shall be prohibited beginning 45 days after the date of this order, to the extent permitted under applicable law: any transaction that is related to WeChat by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with Tencent Holdings Ltd. (a.k.a. T[eacute]ngx[ugrave]n K[ograve]ngg[ubreve] Y[obreve]uxi[agrave]n G[omacr]ngs[imacr]), Shenzhen, China, or any subsidiary of that entity, as identified by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) under section 1(c) of this order. (b) The prohibition in subsection (a) of this section applies except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. (c) 45 days after the date of this order, the Secretary shall identify the transactions subject to subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate the prohibition set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 3. For those persons who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873, there need be no prior notice of an identification made pursuant to section 1(c) of this order. Sec. 4. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; (b) the term ``entity'' means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, [[Page 416]] subgroup, or other organization, including an international organization; and (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. Sec. 5. The Secretary is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to me by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Commerce. All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 6, 2020. Executive Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security by Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made in the United States By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. The United States must protect our citizens, critical infrastructure, military forces, and economy against outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. To achieve this, the United States must have a strong Public Health Industrial Base with resilient domestic supply chains for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs deemed necessary for the United States. These domestic supply chains must be capable of meeting national security requirements for responding to threats arising from [[Page 417]] CBRN threats and public health emergencies, including emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. It is critical that we reduce our dependence on foreign manufacturers for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to ensure sufficient and reliable long-term domestic production of these products, to minimize potential shortages, and to mobilize our Nation's Public Health Industrial Base to respond to these threats. It is therefore the policy of the United States to: (a) accelerate the development of cost-effective and efficient domestic production of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures and have adequate redundancy built into the domestic supply chain for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs; (b) ensure long-term demand for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs that are produced in the United States; (c) create, maintain, and maximize domestic production capabilities for Critical Inputs, Finished Drug Products, and Finished Devices that are essential to protect public safety and human health and to provide for the national defense; and (d) combat the trafficking of counterfeit Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs over e-commerce platforms and from third-party online sellers involved in the government procurement process. I am therefore directing each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs (agency) to consider a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, and to identify vulnerabilities in our Nation's supply chains for these products. Under this order, agencies will have the necessary flexibility to increase their domestic procurement in appropriate and responsible ways, while protecting our Nation's service members, veterans, and their families from increases in drug prices and without interfering with our Nation's ability to respond to the spread of COVID-19. Sec. 2. Maximizing Domestic Production in Procurement. (a) Agencies shall, as appropriate, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and in consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA Commissioner) with respect to Critical Inputs, use their respective authorities under section 2304(c) of title 10, United States Code; section 3304(a) of title 41, United States Code; and subpart 6.3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, to conduct the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs by: (i) using procedures to limit competition to only those Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs that are produced in the United States; and (ii) dividing procurement requirements among two or more manufacturers located in the United States, as appropriate. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with appropriate agency heads, shall: (i) review the authority of each agency to limit the online procurement of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures to e-commerce platforms that have: [[Page 418]] (A) adopted, and certified their compliance with, the applicable best practices published by the Department of Homeland Security in its Report to the President on ``Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods,'' dated January 24, 2020; and (B) agreed to permit the Department of Homeland Security's National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center to evaluate and confirm their compliance with such best practices; and (ii) report its findings to the President. (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the FDA Commissioner, develop and implement procurement strategies, including long-term contracts, consistent with law, to strengthen and mobilize the Public Health Industrial Base in order to increase the manufacture of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs in the United States. (d) No later than 30 days after the FDA Commissioner has identified, pursuant to section 3(c) of this order, the initial list of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, the United States Trade Representative shall, to the extent permitted by law, take all appropriate action to modify United States Federal procurement product coverage under all relevant Free Trade Agreements and the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement to exclude coverage of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs. The United States Trade Representative shall further modify United States Federal procurement product coverage, as appropriate, to reflect updates by the FDA Commissioner. After the modifications to United States Federal procurement coverage take effect, the United States Trade Representative shall make any necessary, corresponding modifications of existing waivers under section 301 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. The United States Trade Representative shall notify the President, through the Director of OMB, once it has taken the actions described in this subsection. (e) No later than 60 days after the FDA Commissioner has identified, pursuant to section 3(c) of this order, the initial list of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, and notwithstanding the public interest exception in subsection (f)(i)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Defense shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, use his authority under section 225.872- 1(c) of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to restrict the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to domestic sources and to reject otherwise acceptable offers of such products from sources in Qualifying Countries in instances where considered necessary for national defense reasons. (f) Subsections (a), (d), and (e) of this section shall not apply: (i) where the head of the agency determines in writing, with respect to a specific contract or order, that (1) their application would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) the relevant Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) their application would cause the cost of the procurement to increase by more than 25 percent, unless [[Page 419]] applicable law requires a higher percentage, in which case such higher percentage shall apply; (ii) with respect to the procurement of items that are necessary to respond to any public health emergency declared under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), any major disaster or emergency declared under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), or any national emergency declared under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). (g) To the maximum extent permitted by law, any public interest determination made pursuant to section 2(f)(i)(1) of this order shall be construed to maximize the procurement and use of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures produced in the United States. (h) The head of an agency who makes any determination pursuant to section 2(f)(i) of this order shall submit an annual report to the President, through the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, describing the justification for each such determination. Sec. 3. Identifying Vulnerabilities in Supply Chains. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the FDA Commissioner and in consultation with the Director of OMB, shall take all necessary and appropriate action, consistent with law, to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chain for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs and to mitigate those vulnerabilities, including by: (i) considering proposing regulations or revising guidance on the collection of the following information from manufacturers of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures as part of the application and regulatory approval process: (A) the sources of Finished Drug Products, Finished Devices, and Critical Inputs; (B) the use of any scarce Critical Inputs; and (C) the date of the last FDA inspection of the manufacturer's regulated facilities and the results of such inspection; (ii) entering into written agreements, pursuant to section 20.85 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, with the National Security Council, Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and other interested agencies, as appropriate, to disclose records regarding the security and vulnerabilities of the supply chains for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs; (iii) recommending to the President any changes in applicable law that may be necessary to accomplish the objectives of this subsection; and (iv) reviewing FDA regulations to determine whether any of those regulations may be a barrier to domestic production of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, and by advising the President whether such regulations should be repealed or amended. (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the FDA Commissioner, shall take all appropriate action, consistent with applicable law, to: [[Page 420]] (i) accelerate FDA approval or clearance, as appropriate, for domestic producers of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, including those needed for infectious disease and CBRN threat preparedness and response; (ii) issue guidance with recommendations regarding the development of Advanced Manufacturing techniques; (iii) negotiate with countries to increase site inspections and increase the number of unannounced inspections of regulated facilities manufacturing Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs; and (iv) refuse admission, as appropriate, to imports of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs if the facilities in which they are produced refuse or unreasonably delay an inspection. (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, and periodically updated as appropriate, the FDA Commissioner, in consultation with the Director of OMB, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the Department of Health and Human Services, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, shall identify the list of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and their Critical Inputs that are medically necessary to have available at all times in an amount adequate to serve patient needs and in the appropriate dosage forms. (d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of OMB, shall take all necessary and appropriate action, consistent with law, to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chain for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs necessary to meet the unique needs of the United States Armed Forces and to mitigate the vulnerabilities identified in subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary of Defense shall provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the FDA Commissioner, the Director of OMB, and the Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy a list of defense-specific Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs that are medically necessary to have available for defense use in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms. The Secretary of Defense shall, as appropriate, periodically update this list. Sec. 4. Streamlining Regulatory Requirements. Consistent with law, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall take all appropriate action to identify relevant requirements and guidance documents that can be streamlined to provide for the development of Advanced Manufacturing facilities and the expeditious domestic production of Critical Inputs, including by accelerating siting and permitting approvals. Sec. 5. Priorities and Allocation of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, as appropriate and in accordance with the delegation of authority under Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), use the authority under section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4511), to prioritize the performance of Federal Government contracts or orders for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, or Critical Inputs over performance of any [[Page 421]] other contracts or orders, and to allocate such materials, services, and facilities as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense. Sec. 6. Reporting.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 6, 2020. Executive Order 13945 of August 8, 2020 Fighting the Spread of COVID-19 by Providing Assistance to Renters and Homeowners By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in the People's Republic of China, continues to pose a significant threat to the health of Americans throughout the United States. As we have since January 2020, with the proactive decision to limit travel from China and the passage of three massive economic relief packages, my Administration will take whatever steps are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and maintain economic prosperity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Department of Health and Human Services have concluded that ``growing and disproportionate unemployment rates for some racial and ethnic minority groups during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to greater risk of eviction and homelessness or sharing of housing.'' This trend is concerning for many reasons, including that homeless shelters have proven to be particularly susceptible to outbreaks of COVID-19. CDC has observed that ``[h]omelessness poses multiple challenges that can exacerbate and amplify the spread of COVID-19. Homeless shelters are often crowded, making social distancing difficult. Many persons experiencing homelessness are older or have underlying medical conditions, placing them at higher risk for severe COVID-19- associated illness.'' Increased shared housing is also potentially problematic to the extent it results in increased in-person interactions between older, higher-risk individuals and their younger relatives or friends. My Administration has taken bold steps to help renters and homeowners have safe and secure places to call home during the COVID-19 crisis. Prior to passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (Public Law 116-136), the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development implemented a foreclosure and eviction moratorium for all single-family mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. [[Page 424]] Furthermore, prior to passage of the CARES Act, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced that it had instructed the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (the Enterprises) to suspend foreclosures for at least 60 days. FHFA has since announced that the Enterprises will extend the foreclosure suspension until at least August 31, 2020. The CARES Act imposed a temporary moratorium on evictions of certain renters subject to certain conditions. That moratorium has now expired, and there is a significant risk that this will set off an abnormally large wave of evictions. With the failure of the Congress to act, my Administration must do all that it can to help vulnerable populations stay in their homes in the midst of this pandemic. Those who are dislocated from their homes may be unable to shelter in place and may have more difficulty maintaining a routine of social distancing. They will have to find alternative living arrangements, which may include a homeless shelter or a crowded family home and may also require traveling to other States. In addition, evictions tend to disproportionately affect minorities, particularly African Americans and Latinos. Unlike the Congress, I cannot sit idly and refuse to assist vulnerable Americans in need. Under my Administration, minorities achieved the lowest unemployment rates on record, and we will not let COVID-19 erase these gains by causing short- term dislocations that could well have long-term consequences. Accordingly, my Administration, to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent the further spread of COVID-19, will take all lawful measures to prevent residential evictions and foreclosures resulting from financial hardships caused by COVID-19. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, residential evictions and foreclosures during the ongoing COVID-19 national emergency. Sec. 3. Response to Public Health Risks of Evictions and Foreclosures. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of CDC shall consider whether any measures temporarily halting residential evictions of any tenants for failure to pay rent are reasonably necessary to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 from one State or possession into any other State or possession. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall identify any and all available Federal funds to provide temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners who, as a result of the financial hardships caused by COVID-19, are struggling to meet their monthly rental or mortgage obligations. (c) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to promote the ability of renters and homeowners to avoid eviction or foreclosure resulting from financial hardships caused by COVID-19. Such action may include encouraging and providing assistance to public housing authorities, affordable housing owners, landlords, and recipients of Federal grant funds in minimizing evictions and foreclosures. (d) In consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of FHFA shall review all existing authorities and resources that may be used [[Page 425]] to prevent evictions and foreclosures for renters and homeowners resulting from hardships caused by COVID-19. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 8, 2020.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 24, 2020. [[Page 427]] Executive Order 13947 of July 24, 2020 Lowering Drug Prices by Putting America First By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Americans pay more per capita for prescription drugs than residents of any other developed country in the world. It is unacceptable that Americans pay more for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same places. Other countries' governments regulate drug prices by negotiating with drug manufacturers to secure bargain prices, leaving Americans to make up the difference--effectively subsidizing innovation and lower-cost drugs for the rest of the world. The Council of Economic Advisers has found that Americans finance much of the biopharmaceutical innovation that the world depends on, allowing foreign governments, many of which are the sole healthcare payers in their respective countries, to enjoy bargain prices for such innovations. Americans should not bear extra burdens to compensate for the shortfalls that result from the nationalized public healthcare systems of wealthy countries abroad. In addition to being unfair, high drug prices in the United States also have serious economic and health consequences for patients in need of treatment. High prices cause Americans to divert too much of their scarce resources to pharmaceutical treatments and away from other productive uses. High prices are also a reason many patients skip doses of their medications, take less than the recommended doses, or abandon treatment altogether. The consequences of these behaviors can be severe. For example, patients may develop acute conditions that result in poor clinical outcomes or that require drastic and expensive medical interventions. In most markets, the largest buyers pay the lowest prices, but this has not been true for prescription drugs. The Federal Government is the largest payer for prescription drugs in the world, but it pays more than many smaller buyers, including other developed nations. When the Federal Government purchases a drug covered by Medicare Part B--the cost of which is shared by American seniors who take the drug and American taxpayers--it should insist on, at a minimum, the lowest price at which the manufacturer sells that drug to any other developed nation. The need for affordable Medicare Part B drugs is particularly acute now, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to historic levels of unemployment in the United States, including the loss of 1.2 million jobs among Americans age 65 or older between March and April of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an increase in food prices, straining budgets for many of America's seniors, particularly those who live on fixed incomes. The economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic only increase the burdens placed on America's seniors and other Medicare Part B beneficiaries. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States that the Medicare program should not pay more for costly Part B prescription drugs or biological products than the most-favored-nation price. (b) The ``most-favored-nation price'' shall mean the lowest price, after adjusting for volume and differences in national gross domestic product, [[Page 428]] for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product. Sec. 3. Ensuring the Most-Favored-Nation Price in Medicare Part B. To the extent consistent with law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall immediately take appropriate steps to implement his rulemaking plan to test a payment model pursuant to which Medicare would pay, for certain high-cost prescription drugs and biological products covered by Medicare Part B, no more than the most-favored-nation price. The model would test whether, for patients who require pharmaceutical treatment, paying no more than the most-favored-nation price would mitigate poor clinical outcomes and increased expenditures associated with high drug costs. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 24, 2020.

Sec. 3. Payment Model on the Most-Favored-Nation Price in Medicare Part B.

The model would test whether, for patients who require pharmaceutical treatment, paying no more than the most-favored-nation price would mitigate poor clinical outcomes and increased expenditures associated with high drug costs. Sec. 4. Payment Model on the Most-Favored-Nation Price in Medicare Part D. To the extent consistent with law, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to develop and implement a rulemaking plan, selecting for testing, consistent with section 1315a(b)(2)(A) of title 42, United States Code, a payment model pursuant to which Medicare would pay, for Part D prescription drugs or biological products where insufficient competition exists and seniors are faced with prices above those in OECD member countries that have a comparable per-capita gross domestic product to the United States, after adjusting for volume and differences in national gross domestic product, no more than the most-favored-nation price, to the extent feasible. The model should test whether, for patients who require pharmaceutical treatment, paying no more than the most-favored-nation price would mitigate poor clinical outcomes and increased expenditures associated with high drug costs. Sec. 5. Revocation of Executive Order. The Executive Order of July 24, 2020 (Lowering Drug Prices by Putting America First), is revoked. [[Page 430]] Sec. 6. General Provisions.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 13, 2020. Executive Order 13949 of September 21, 2020 Blocking Property of Certain Persons With Respect to the Conventional Arms Activities of Iran By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Public Law 115-44), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that: It remains the policy of the United States to counter Iran's malign influence in the Middle East, including transfers from Iran of destabilizing conventional weapons and acquisition of arms and related materiel by Iran. Transfers to and from Iran of arms or related materiel or military equipment represent a continuing threat to regional and international security--as evidenced by Iran's continued military support that fuels ongoing conflict in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen. Iran benefits from engaging in the conventional arms trade by strengthening its relationships with other outlier regimes, lessening its international isolation, and deriving revenue that it uses to support terror groups and fund malign activities. In light of these findings and in order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995 (Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources), I hereby order: Section. 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: [[Page 431]] (i) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to engage in any activity that materially contributes to the supply, sale, or transfer, directly or indirectly, to or from Iran, or for the use in or benefit of Iran, of arms or related materiel, including spare parts; (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide to Iran any technical training, financial resources or services, advice, other services, or assistance related to the supply, sale, transfer, manufacture, maintenance, or use of arms and related materiel described in subsection (a)(i) of this section; (iii) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in any activity that materially contributes to, or poses a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of arms or related materiel or items intended for military end-uses or military end-users, including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items, by the Government of Iran (including persons owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of the Government of Iran) or paramilitary organizations financially or militarily supported by the Government of Iran; (iv) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or (v) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. (c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section do not apply to property and interests in property of the Government of Iran that were blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979 (Blocking Iranian Government Property), and thereafter made subject to the transfer directives set forth in Executive Order 12281 of January 19, 1981 (Direction to Transfer Certain Iranian Government Assets), and implementing regulations thereunder. Sec. 2. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include: (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 3. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section [[Page 432]] 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693. Sec. 4. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. Sec. 6. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; (b) the term ``Government of Iran'' includes the Government of Iran; any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Iran; and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran; (c) the term ``Iran'' means the Government of Iran and the territory of Iran; (d) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; and (e) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, there need be no [[Page 433]] prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. Sec. 9. This order shall not apply with respect to any person for conducting or facilitating a transaction for the provision (including any sale) of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran. Sec. 10. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. Sec. 11. The measures taken pursuant to this order are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those later actions. Sec. 12. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 21, 2020. Executive Order 13950 of September 22, 2020 Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting, to promote unity in the Federal workforce, and to combat offensive and anti-American race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating, it is hereby ordered as follows: [[Page 434]] Section 1. Purpose. From the battlefield of Gettysburg to the bus boycott in Montgomery and the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, heroic Americans have valiantly risked their lives to ensure that their children would grow up in a Nation living out its creed, expressed in the Declaration of Independence: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal.'' It was this belief in the inherent equality of every individual that inspired the Founding generation to risk their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to establish a new Nation, unique among the countries of the world. President Abraham Lincoln understood that this belief is ``the electric cord'' that ``links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving'' people, no matter their race or country of origin. It is the belief that inspired the heroic black soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment to defend that same Union at great cost in the Civil War. And it is what inspired Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to dream that his children would one day ``not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' Thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our forebears, America has made significant progress toward realization of our national creed, particularly in the 57 years since Dr. King shared his dream with the country. Today, however, many people are pushing a different vision of America that is grounded in hierarchies based on collective social and political identities rather than in the inherent and equal dignity of every person as an individual. This ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country; that some people, simply on account of their race or sex, are oppressors; and that racial and sexual identities are more important than our common status as human beings and Americans. This destructive ideology is grounded in misrepresentations of our country's history and its role in the world. Although presented as new and revolutionary, they resurrect the discredited notions of the nineteenth century's apologists for slavery who, like President Lincoln's rival Stephen A. Douglas, maintained that our government ``was made on the white basis'' ``by white men, for the benefit of white men.'' Our Founding documents rejected these racialized views of America, which were soundly defeated on the blood-stained battlefields of the Civil War. Yet they are now being repackaged and sold as cutting- edge insights. They are designed to divide us and to prevent us from uniting as one people in pursuit of one common destiny for our great country. Unfortunately, this malign ideology is now migrating from the fringes of American society and threatens to infect core institutions of our country. Instructors and materials teaching that men and members of certain races, as well as our most venerable institutions, are inherently sexist and racist are appearing in workplace diversity trainings across the country, even in components of the Federal Government and among Federal contractors. For example, the Department of the Treasury recently held a seminar that promoted arguments that ``virtually all White people, regardless of how `woke' they are, contribute to racism,'' and that instructed small group leaders to encourage employees to avoid ``narratives'' that Americans should ``be more color-blind'' or ``let people's skills and personalities be what differentiates them.'' [[Page 435]] Training materials from Argonne National Laboratories, a Federal entity, stated that racism ``is interwoven into every fabric of America'' and described statements like ``color blindness'' and the ``meritocracy'' as ``actions of bias.'' Materials from Sandia National Laboratories, also a Federal entity, for non-minority males stated that an emphasis on ``rationality over emotionality'' was a characteristic of ``white male[s],'' and asked those present to ``acknowledge'' their ``privilege'' to each other. A Smithsonian Institution museum graphic recently claimed that concepts like ``[o]bjective, rational linear thinking,'' ``[h]ard work'' being ``the key to success,'' the ``nuclear family,'' and belief in a single god are not values that unite Americans of all races but are instead ``aspects and assumptions of whiteness.'' The museum also stated that ``[f]acing your whiteness is hard and can result in feelings of guilt, sadness, confusion, defensiveness, or fear.'' All of this is contrary to the fundamental premises underpinning our Republic: that all individuals are created equal and should be allowed an equal opportunity under the law to pursue happiness and prosper based on individual merit. Executive departments and agencies (agencies), our Uniformed Services, Federal contractors, and Federal grant recipients should, of course, continue to foster environments devoid of hostility grounded in race, sex, and other federally protected characteristics. Training employees to create an inclusive workplace is appropriate and beneficial. The Federal Government is, and must always be, committed to the fair and equal treatment of all individuals before the law. But training like that discussed above perpetuates racial stereotypes and division and can use subtle coercive pressure to ensure conformity of viewpoint. Such ideas may be fashionable in the academy, but they have no place in programs and activities supported by Federal taxpayer dollars. Research also suggests that blame-focused diversity training reinforces biases and decreases opportunities for minorities. Our Federal civil service system is based on merit principles. These principles, codified at 5 U.S.C. 2301, call for all employees to ``receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to'' race or sex ``and with proper regard for their . . . constitutional rights.'' Instructing Federal employees that treating individuals on the basis of individual merit is racist or sexist directly undermines our Merit System Principles and impairs the efficiency of the Federal service. Similarly, our Uniformed Services should not teach our heroic men and women in uniform the lie that the country for which they are willing to die is fundamentally racist. Such teachings could directly threaten the cohesion and effectiveness of our Uniformed Services. Such activities also promote division and inefficiency when carried out by Federal contractors. The Federal Government has long prohibited Federal contractors from engaging in race or sex discrimination and required contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that such discrimination does not occur. The participation of contractors' employees in training that promotes race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating similarly undermines efficiency in Federal contracting. Such requirements promote divisiveness in [[Page 436]] the workplace and distract from the pursuit of excellence and collaborative achievements in public administration. Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States not to promote race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating in the Federal workforce or in the Uniformed Services, and not to allow grant funds to be used for these purposes. In addition, Federal contractors will not be permitted to inculcate such views in their employees. Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order, the phrase: (a) ``Divisive concepts'' means the concepts that (1) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (2) the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist; (3) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (4) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (5) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (6) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (7) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (8) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (9) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term ``divisive concepts'' also includes any other form of race or sex stereotyping or any other form of race or sex scapegoating. (b) ``Race or sex stereotyping'' means ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex. (c) ``Race or sex scapegoating'' means assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex. It similarly encompasses any claim that, consciously or unconsciously, and by virtue of his or her race or sex, members of any race are inherently racist or are inherently inclined to oppress others, or that members of a sex are inherently sexist or inclined to oppress others. (d) ``Senior political appointee'' means an individual appointed by the President, or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service (or agency-equivalent system). Sec. 3. Requirements for the United States Uniformed Services. The United States Uniformed Services, including the United States Armed Forces, shall not teach, instruct, or train any member of the United States Uniformed Services, whether serving on active duty, serving on reserve duty, attending a military service academy, or attending courses conducted by a military department pursuant to a Reserve Officer Corps Training program, to believe any of the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order. No member of the United States Uniformed Services shall face any penalty or discrimination on account of his or her refusal to support, believe, endorse, embrace, confess, act upon, or otherwise assent to these concepts. Sec. 4. Requirements for Government Contractors. (a) Except in contracts exempted in the manner provided by section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), as amended, all [[Page 437]] Government contracting agencies shall include in every Government contract hereafter entered into the following provisions: ``During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: 1. The contractor shall not use any workplace training that inculcates in its employees any form of race or sex stereotyping or any form of race or sex scapegoating, including the concepts that (a) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (b) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (c) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (d) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (e) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (f) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (g) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (h) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term ``race or sex stereotyping'' means ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex, and the term ``race or sex scapegoating'' means assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex. 2. The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the agency contracting officer, advising the labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under the Executive Order of September 22, 2020, entitled Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. 3. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4), or with any rules, regulations, or orders that may be promulgated in accordance with the Executive Order of September 22, 2020, this contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided by any rules, regulations, or orders the Secretary of Labor has issued or adopted pursuant to Executive Order 11246, including subpart D of that order. 4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, that in the event the contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction, the contractor may request [[Page 438]] the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.'' (b) The Department of Labor is directed, through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), to establish a hotline and investigate complaints received under both this order as well as Executive Order 11246 alleging that a Federal contractor is utilizing such training programs in violation of the contractor's obligations under those orders. The Department shall take appropriate enforcement action and provide remedial relief, as appropriate. (c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OFCCP shall publish in the Federal Register a request for information seeking information from Federal contractors, Federal subcontractors, and employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors regarding the training, workshops, or similar programming provided to employees.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 22, 2020. Executive Order 13951 of September 24, 2020 An America-First Healthcare Plan By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Since January 20, 2017, my Administration has been committed to the goal of bringing great healthcare to the American people and putting patients first. To that end, my Administration has taken monumental steps to improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare in the United States. (a) My Administration has been committed to restoring choice and control to the American patient. On December 22, 2017, I signed into law the repeal of the burdensome individual-mandate penalty, liberating millions of low-income Americans from a tax that penalized them for not purchasing health-insurance coverage they did not want or could not afford. Through Executive Order [[Page 441]] 13813 of October 12, 2017 (Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States), my Administration has expanded coverage options for millions of Americans in several ways. My Administration increased the availability of renewable short-term, limited-duration healthcare plans, providing options that are up to 60 percent cheaper than the least expensive alternatives under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and are projected to cover 500,000 individuals who would otherwise be uninsured. My Administration expanded health reimbursement arrangements, which have been projected by the Department of the Treasury to reach 800,000 businesses and over 11 million employees and to expand coverage to more than 800,000 individuals who would otherwise be uninsured. My Administration also issued a rule to increase the availability of association health plans for small businesses, which, upon implementation of the rule, are projected to cover up to 400,000 previously uninsured individuals for on average 30 percent less cost. As set forth in the Economic Report of the President (February 2020), my Administration's expansion of health savings accounts will further help millions of Americans pay for health expenditures by allowing them to save more of their own money free from Federal taxation, and will especially help Americans with chronic conditions who now have more flexibility to enroll in plans that fit their complicated care needs and can be paired with a tax-advantaged account. At the beginning of the current COVID-19 pandemic, my Administration acted to dramatically increase the accessibility and availability of telehealth services for Medicare beneficiaries, enabling millions of individuals to use these services. Pursuant to Executive Order 13941 of August 3, 2020 (Improving Rural Health and Telehealth Access), the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make permanent many of the new policies that improve the accessibility and availability of telehealth services. In addition, pursuant to that order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture will develop and implement a strategy to improve the physical and communications healthcare infrastructure available to rural Americans. Through our State Relief and Empowerment Waivers, my Administration has given States additional health-insurance flexibility, which has expanded health-insurance coverage options for consumers and lowered costs for patients. These waivers allow States to move away from the ACA's rigid structure and are estimated to have lowered premiums by approximately 11 percent in Wisconsin, 20 percent in Minnesota, and 43 percent in Maryland. Due to actions my Administration took, like the State Relief and Empowerment Waivers, after years of dwindling choices and escalating prices, plan options for consumers increased and for 2019, for the first time ever, benchmark premiums actually decreased on Healthcare.gov. For 2020, the average benchmark premium dropped by nearly 4 percent. After the prior Administration spent tens of billions of dollars creating electronic health records systems unable to accurately or effectively record and communicate patient data, my Administration has paved the way for a new wave of innovation to allow patients to safely send their own medical records to care providers of their choosing. My Patients over Paperwork initiative has cut red tape for doctors and nurses so they can spend [[Page 442]] more time with their patients, which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has estimated to save over 40 million hours of wasted time for providers and suppliers between 2017 and 2021. (b) My Administration has been ceaseless in its efforts to lower costs to make healthcare more affordable for American patients. Under my tenure, prescription drugs saw their largest annual price decrease in nearly half a century. For three consecutive years, we have approved a record number of generic drugs. The Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that these approvals saved patients $26 billion in the first 18 months of my Administration alone. As part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, I signed into law the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, which will pave the way for even more generic drugs and is projected to save taxpayers $3.3 billion from 2019 to 2029. CMS has acted to offer Medicare beneficiaries prescription drug plans with the option of insulin capped at $35 in out-of-pocket expenses for a 30-day supply. We are also reducing Government payments to overcharging hospitals participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program by instead paying rates that more accurately reflect the hospitals' acquisition costs, which CMS estimated would save Medicare beneficiaries $320 million on copayments for drugs alone. As a result of Executive Order 13937 of July 24, 2020 (Access to Affordable Life-Saving Medications), low-income Americans who receive care from a federally qualified health center will have access to insulin and injectable epinephrine at prices lower than ever before. Under Executive Order 13938 of July 24, 2020 (Increasing Drug Importation to Lower Prices for American Patients), my Administration will be the first to complete a rulemaking to authorize the safe importation of certain lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada. Pursuant to Executive Order 13939 of July 24, 2020 (Lowering Prices for Patients by Eliminating Kickbacks to Middlemen), my Administration is taking action to eliminate wasteful payments to middlemen by passing drug discounts through to patients at the pharmacy counter without increasing premiums for beneficiaries or cost to Federal taxpayers. And my Administration is taking action to ensure that Medicare patients receive the lowest price that drug companies offer comparable foreign nations through Executive Order 13948 of September 13, 2020 (Lowering Drug Prices by Putting America First). As part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, I also signed into law the repeal of the medical device tax, the annual fee on health-insurance providers, and the ``Cadillac'' tax on certain employer-sponsored health insurance, which threatened to dramatically increase the cost of healthcare for working families. My Administration is transforming the black-box hospital and insurance pricing systems to be transparent about price and quality. Regardless of health-insurance coverage, two-thirds of adults in America still worry about the threat of unexpected medical bills. This fear is the result of a system under which individuals and employers are unable to see how insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers, insurance brokers, and providers are or will be paid. One major culprit is the practice of ``surprise billing,'' in which a patient receives unexpected bills at highly inflated prices from [[Page 443]] providers who are not part of the patient's insurance network, even if the patient was treated at a hospital that was part of the patient's network. Patients can receive these bills despite having no opportunity to select around an out-of-network provider in advance. On May 9, 2019, I announced four principles to guide congressional efforts to prohibit exorbitant bills resulting from patients' accidentally or unknowingly receiving services from out-of-network physicians. Unfortunately, the Congress has failed to act, and patients remain vulnerable to surprise billing. In the absence of congressional action, my Administration has already taken strong and decisive action to make healthcare prices more transparent. On June 24, 2019, I signed Executive Order 13877 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), directing certain agencies--for the first time ever--to make sure patients have access to meaningful price and quality information prior to the delivery of care. Beginning January 1, 2021, hospitals will be required to publish their real price for every service, and publicly display in a consumer-friendly, easy-to-understand format the prices of at least 300 different common services that are able to be shopped for in advance. We have also taken some concrete steps to eliminate surprise out-of- network bills. For example, on April 10, 2020, my Administration required providers to certify, as a condition of receiving supplemental COVID-19 funding, that they would not seek to collect out-of-pocket expenses from a patient for treatment related to COVID-19 in an amount greater than what the patient would have otherwise been required to pay for care by an in-network provider. These initiatives have made important progress, although additional efforts are necessary. Not all hospitals allow for surprise bills. But many do. Unfortunately, surprise billing has become sufficiently pervasive that the fear of receiving a surprise bill may dissuade patients from seeking appropriate care. And research suggests a correlation between hospitals that frequently allow surprise billing and increases in hospital admissions and imaging procedures, putting patients at risk of receiving unnecessary services, which can lead to physical harm and threatens the long-term financial sustainability of Medicare. Efforts to limit surprise billing and increase the number of providers participating in the same insurance network as the hospital in which they work would correspondingly streamline the ability of patients to receive care and reduce time spent on billing disputes. On May 15, 2020, HHS released the Health Quality Roadmap to empower patients to make fully informed decisions about their healthcare by facilitating the availability of appropriate and meaningful price and quality information. These transformative actions will arm patients with the tools to be active and effective shoppers for healthcare services, enabling them to identify high-value providers and services, and ultimately place downward pressure on prices. My Administration has cracked down on waste, fraud, and abuse that direct valuable taxpayer resources away from those who need them most. My Administration implemented a ``site neutral'' payment system between hospital outpatient departments and physicians' offices, to ensure Medicare [[Page 444]] beneficiaries are charged the same price for the same service regardless of where it takes place, which CMS estimates will save them approximately $160 million in co-payments for 2020. We also changed the rules to enable Government watchdogs to proactively identify and stop perpetrators of fraud before money goes out the door. (c) My Administration has been dedicated to providing better care for all Americans. This includes a steadfast commitment to always protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions and ensuring they have access to the high- quality healthcare they deserve. No American should have to risk going without health insurance based on a health history that he or she cannot change. In an attempt to justify the ACA, the previous Administration claimed that, absent action by the Congress, up to 129 million (later updated to 133 million) non-elderly people with what it described as pre-existing conditions were in danger of being denied health-insurance coverage. According to the previous Administration, however, only 2.7 percent of such individuals actually gained access to health insurance through the ACA, given existing laws and programs already in place to cover them. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 has long protected individuals with pre-existing conditions, including individuals covered by group health plans and individuals who had such coverage but lost it. The ACA produced multiple other failures. The average insurance premium in the individual market more than doubled from 2013 to 2017, and those who have not received generous Federal subsidies have struggled to maintain coverage. For those who have managed to maintain coverage, many have experienced a substantial rise in deductibles, limited choice of insurers, and limited provider networks that exclude their doctors and the facilities best suited to care for them. Additionally, approximately 30 million Americans remain uninsured, notwithstanding the previous Administration's promises that the ACA would address this intractable problem. On top of these disappointing results, Federal taxpayers and, unfortunately, future generations of American workers, have been left with an enormous bill. The ACA's Medicaid expansion and subsidies for the individual market are projected by the Congressional Budget Office to cost more than $1.8 trillion over the next decade. The ACA is neither the best nor the only way to ensure that Americans who suffer from pre-existing conditions have access to health-insurance coverage. I have agreed with the States challenging the ACA, who have won in the Federal district court and court of appeals, that the ACA, as amended, exceeds the power of the Congress. The ACA was flawed from its inception and should be struck down. However, access to health insurance despite underlying health conditions should be maintained, even if the Supreme Court invalidates the unconstitutional, and largely harmful, ACA. My Administration has always been committed to ensuring that patients with pre-existing conditions can obtain affordable healthcare, to lowering healthcare costs, to improving quality of care, and to enabling individuals to choose the healthcare that meets their needs. For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, my Administration implemented a program to [[Page 445]] provide any individual without health-insurance coverage access to necessary COVID-19-related testing and treatment. My commitment to improving care across our country expands vastly beyond the rules governing health insurance. On July 10, 2019, I signed Executive Order 13879 (Advancing American Kidney Health) to improve care for the hundreds of thousands of Americans suffering from end-stage renal disease. Pursuant to that order, my Administration launched a program to encourage home dialysis and promote transplants for patients, and expects to enroll approximately 120,000 Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease in the program. We also have removed financial barriers to living organ donation by adding additional financial support for living donors, such as by reimbursing expenses for lost wages, child care, and elder care. HHS, together with the American Society of Nephrology, issued two phases of awards through KidneyX's Redesign Dialysis Price Competition to work toward the creation of an artificial kidney. My Administration has taken unprecedented action to improve the quality of and access to care for individuals with HIV, as part of our goal of ending the epidemic of HIV in the United States by 2030. HHS has awarded at least $226 million to expand access to HIV care, treatment, medication, and prevention services, focused on 48 counties, Washington, DC, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, where more than 50 percent of new HIV diagnoses occurred in 2016 and 2017, as well as seven States with a substantial rural HIV rate. We secured a historic donation of a groundbreaking HIV preventive medication that is available at no cost to eligible patients. My Administration has started a transformation in healthcare in rural America. This includes a new effort, pursuant to my directive in Executive Order 13941, to support small hospitals and health clinics in rural communities in transitioning from volume-based Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, which has failed rural communities that struggle with a lack of patient volume, and toward value-based payment mechanisms that are tailored to meet the needs of their communities. We updated Medicare payment policies to address a problem in the program's payment calculation that has historically disadvantaged rural hospitals, and released a Rural Action Plan to incorporate recommendations from experts and leaders across the Federal Government. We have also dedicated a special focus on improving care offered through the Indian Health Service (IHS) within HHS, including by creating the Office of Quality, implementing an increase in annual funding for IHS by $243 million from 2019 to 2020, and expanding nationwide IHS's successful Alaska Community Health Aide Program. My Administration has additionally demonstrated an incredible dedication to protecting and improving care for those most in need, including senior citizens, those with substance use disorders, and those to whom our Nation owes the greatest debt: our veterans. I have protected the viability of the Medicare program. For example, on February 9, 2018, I signed into law the repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which would have been a group of unelected bureaucrats created by the ACA, designed to be insulated from the will of America's elected leaders for the purpose of cutting the spending of this important program. On October 3, 2019, I signed Executive Order 13890 (Protecting [[Page 446]] and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors), to modernize the Medicare program and continue its viability. According to CMS estimates, seniors have saved $2.65 billion in lower Medicare premiums under my Administration while benefiting from more choices. For example, the average monthly Medicare Advantage premium has declined an estimated 28 percent since 2017, and Medicare Advantage has included about 1,200 more plan options since 2018. New Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits have helped seniors stay safe in their homes, improved respite care for caregivers, and provided transportation, more in-home support services and assistance, and non-opioid pain management alternatives like therapeutic massages. Medicare Part D premiums are at their lowest level in their history, with the average basic premium declining 13.5 percent since 2016. My Administration has directed unprecedented attention on the substance use disorder epidemic, with a focus on reducing overdose deaths from prescription opioids and the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl. On October 24, 2018, I signed the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, enabling the expenditure of billions of dollars of funding for important programs to support prevention and recovery. My Administration has provided approximately $22.5 billion from 2017 to 2020 to address the opioid crisis and improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services. We saw a 34 percent decrease in total opioids dispensed monthly by pharmacies between 2017 and 2019, an approximate increase of 64 percent in the number of Americans who receive medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder since 2016, and a 484 percent increase in naloxone prescriptions since 2017. Data show that drug overdose deaths fell nationwide for the first time in decades between 2017 and 2018, with many of the hardest-hit States leading the way. Improving care for our Nation's veterans has been a priority since the beginning of my Administration. On June 6, 2018, I signed the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of 2018, which authorized billions of dollars to improve options for veterans to receive care outside of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare providers. Since taking effect, the VA estimates that more than 2.4 million veterans have benefited from more than 6.5 million referrals to the 725,000 private healthcare providers with which the VA is now working. On June 23, 2017, I signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 to hold our civil servants accountable for maintaining the best quality of care possible for our Nation's veterans by giving the Secretary of Veterans Affairs more power to discipline employees and shorten an appeals process that can last years. On March 5, 2019, I signed Executive Order 13861 (National Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End Suicide) to ensure that the Federal Government leads a collective effort to prevent suicide among our veterans. I have used scientific research to focus on areas most pressing for the health of Americans. On September 19, 2019, I signed Executive Order 13887 (Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public Health), recognizing the threat that pandemic influenza continues to represent and putting forward a plan to prepare for future influenza pandemics. To modernize influenza vaccines and promote [[Page 447]] national security and public health, HHS issued a 6-year, $226 million contract to retain and increase capacity to produce recombinant influenza vaccine domestically, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health within HHS, initiated the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers program. Investments my Administration has made in scientific research will help tackle some of our most pressing medical challenges and pay dividends for generations to come. This includes working to increase funding for Alzheimer's disease research by billions of dollars since 2017 and a plan to invest more than $500 million over the next decade to improve pediatric cancer research. On December 18, 2018, I signed the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018 to provide support for research into sickle cell disease, which disproportionately impacts African Americans and Hispanics, and to authorize programs relating to sickle cell disease surveillance, prevention, and treatment. On May 30, 2018, I signed the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, which gives terminally ill patients the right to access certain treatments without being blocked by onerous Federal regulations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, my Administration launched Operation Warp Speed, a groundbreaking effort of the Federal Government to engage with the private sector to quickly develop and deliver safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for COVID-19. On August 6, 2020, I signed Executive Order 13944 (Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security by Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made in the United States), to protect Americans through reduced dependence on foreign manufacturers for essential medicines and other items and to strengthen the Nation's Public Health Industrial Base. Taken together, these extraordinary reforms constitute an ongoing effort to improve American healthcare by putting patients first and delivering continuous innovation. And this effort will continue to succeed because of my Administration's commitment to delivering great healthcare with more choices, better care, and lower costs for all Americans. Sec. 2. Policy. It has been and will continue to be the policy of the United States to give Americans seeking healthcare more choice, lower costs, and better care and to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates. Sec. 3. Giving Americans More Choice in Healthcare. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall maintain and build upon existing actions to expand access to and options for affordable healthcare. Sec. 4. Lowering Healthcare Costs for Americans. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall maintain and build upon existing actions to expand access to affordable medicines, including accelerating the approvals of new generic and biosimilar drugs and facilitating the safe importation of affordable prescription drugs from abroad. [[Page 448]] (b) The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall maintain and build upon existing actions to ensure consumers have access to meaningful price and quality information prior to the delivery of care. (i) Recognizing that both chambers of the Congress have made substantial progress towards a solution to end surprise billing, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall work with the Congress to reach a legislative solution by December 31, 2020. (ii) In the event a legislative solution is not reached by December 31, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take administrative action to prevent a patient from receiving a bill for out-of-pocket expenses that the patient could not have reasonably foreseen. (iii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall update the Medicare.gov Hospital Compare website to inform beneficiaries of hospital billing quality, including: (A) whether the hospital is in compliance with the Hospital Price Transparency Final Rule, as amended (84 Fed. Reg. 65524), effective January 1, 2021; (B) whether, upon discharge, the hospital provides patients with a receipt that includes a list of itemized services received during a hospital stay; and (C) how often the hospital pursues legal action against patients, including to garnish wages, to place a lien on a patient's home, or to withdraw money from a patient's income tax refund. (c) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the Administrator of CMS, shall maintain and build upon existing actions to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the healthcare system. Sec. 5. Providing Better Care to Americans. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall maintain and build upon existing actions to improve quality in the delivery of care for veterans. (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall continue to promote medical innovations to find novel and improved treatments for COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease, sickle cell disease, pediatric cancer, and other conditions threatening the well-being of Americans. Sec. 6. General Provisions.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party [[Page 449]] against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 24, 2020. Executive Order 13952 of September 25, 2020 Protecting Vulnerable Newborn and Infant Children By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Every infant born alive, no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, has the same dignity and the same rights as every other individual and is entitled to the same protections under Federal law. Such laws include the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. 1395dd, which guarantees, in hospitals that have an emergency department, each individual's right to an appropriate medical screening examination and to either stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer. They also include section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Rehab Act), 29 U.S.C. 794, which prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by programs and activities receiving Federal funding. In addition, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, 1 U.S.C. 8, makes clear that all infants born alive are individuals for purposes of these and other Federal laws and are therefore afforded the same legal protections as any other person. Together, these laws help protect infants born alive from discrimination in the provision of medical treatment, including infants who require emergency medical treatment, who are premature, or who are born with disabilities. Such infants are entitled to meaningful and non- discriminatory access to medical examination and services, with the consent of a parent or guardian, when they present at hospitals receiving Federal funds. Despite these laws, some hospitals refuse the required medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment or otherwise do not provide potentially lifesaving medical treatment to extremely premature or disabled infants, even when parents plead for such treatment. Hospitals might refuse to provide treatment to extremely premature infants--born alive before 24 weeks of gestation--because they believe these infants may not survive, may have to live with long-term disabilities, or may have a quality-of-life deemed to be inadequate. Active treatment of extremely premature infants has, however, been shown to improve their survival rates. And the denial of such treatment, or discouragement of parents from seeking such treatment for their children, devalues the lives of these children and may violate Federal law. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to recognize the human dignity and inherent worth of every newborn or other infant child, regardless of prematurity or disability, and to ensure for each child due protection under the law. Sec. 3. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall ensure that individuals responsible for all programs and activities under [[Page 450]] his jurisdiction that receive Federal funding are aware of their obligations toward infants, including premature infants or infants with disabilities, who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment, under EMTALA and section 504 of the Rehab Act, as interpreted consistent with the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act. In particular, the Secretary shall ensure that individuals responsible for such programs and activities are aware that they are not excused from complying with these obligations, including the obligation to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment or transfer, when extremely premature infants are born alive or infants are born with disabilities. The Secretary shall also ensure that individuals responsible for such programs and activities are aware that they may not unlawfully discourage parents from seeking medical treatment for their infant child solely because of their infant child's disability. The Secretary shall further ensure that individuals responsible for such programs and activities are aware of their obligations to provide stabilizing treatment that will allow the infant patients to be transferred to a more suitable facility if appropriate treatment is not possible at the initial location. (b) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, ensure that Federal funding disbursed by the Department of Health and Human Services is expended in full compliance with EMTALA and section 504 of the Rehab Act, as interpreted consistent with the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, as reflected in the policy set forth in section 2 of this order. (i) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and to the fullest extent permitted by law, investigate complaints of violations of applicable Federal laws with respect to infants born alive, including infants who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment or infants with disabilities whose parents seek medical treatment for their infants. The Secretary shall also clarify, in an easily understandable format, the process by which parents and hospital staff may submit such complaints for investigation under applicable Federal laws. (ii) The Secretary shall take all appropriate enforcement action against individuals and organizations found through investigation to have violated applicable Federal laws, up to and including terminating Federal funding for non-compliant programs and activities. (c) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the allocation of Department of Health and Human Services discretionary grant funding and National Institutes of Health research dollars for programs and activities conducting research to develop treatments that may improve survival--especially survival without impairment--of infants born alive, including premature infants or infants with disabilities, who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment. (d) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the allocation of Department of Health and Human Services discretionary grant funding to programs and activities, including hospitals, that provide training to medical personnel regarding the provision of life-saving medical treatment to all infants born alive, including premature infants or infants with disabilities, who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment. [[Page 451]] (e) The Secretary shall, as necessary and consistent with applicable law, issue such regulations or guidance as may be necessary to implement this order. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 25, 2020. Executive Order 13953 of September 30, 2020 Addressing the Threat to the Domestic Supply Chain From Reliance on Critical Minerals From Foreign Adversaries and Supporting the Domestic Mining and Processing Industries By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that a strong America cannot be dependent on imports from foreign adversaries for the critical minerals that are increasingly necessary to maintain our economic and military strength in the 21st century. Because of the national importance of reliable access to critical minerals, I signed Executive Order 13817 of December 20, 2017 (A Federal Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals), which required the Secretary of the Interior to identify critical minerals and made it the policy of the Federal Government ``to reduce the Nation's vulnerability to disruptions in the supply of critical minerals.'' Pursuant to my order, the Secretary of the Interior conducted a review with the assistance of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) that identified 35 minerals that (1) are ``essential to the economic and national security of the United States,'' (2) have supply chains that are ``vulnerable to disruption,'' and (3) serve ``an essential function in the manufacturing of a product, the absence of which would have significant consequences for our economy or our national security.'' [[Page 452]] These critical minerals are necessary inputs for the products our military, national infrastructure, and economy depend on the most. Our country needs critical minerals to make airplanes, computers, cell phones, electricity generation and transmission systems, and advanced electronics. Though these minerals are indispensable to our country, we presently lack the capacity to produce them in processed form in the quantities we need. American producers depend on foreign countries to supply and process them. For 31 of the 35 critical minerals, the United States imports more than half of its annual consumption. The United States has no domestic production for 14 of the critical minerals and is completely dependent on imports to supply its demand. Whereas the United States recognizes the continued importance of cooperation on supply chain issues with international partners and allies, in many cases, the aggressive economic practices of certain non-market foreign producers of critical minerals have destroyed vital mining and manufacturing jobs in the United States. Our dependence on one country, the People's Republic of China (China), for multiple critical minerals is particularly concerning. The United States now imports 80 percent of its rare earth elements directly from China, with portions of the remainder indirectly sourced from China through other countries. In the 1980s, the United States produced more of these elements than any other country in the world, but China used aggressive economic practices to strategically flood the global market for rare earth elements and displace its competitors. Since gaining this advantage, China has exploited its position in the rare earth elements market by coercing industries that rely on these elements to locate their facilities, intellectual property, and technology in China. For instance, multiple companies were forced to add factory capacity in China after it suspended exports of processed rare earth elements to Japan in 2010, threatening that country's industrial and defense sectors and disrupting rare earth elements prices worldwide. The United States also disproportionately depends on foreign sources for barite. The United States imports over 75 percent of the barite it consumes, and over 50 percent of its barite imports come from China. Barite is of critical importance to the hydraulic fracturing (``fracking'') industry, which is vital to the energy independence of the United States. The United States depends on foreign sources for 100 percent of its gallium, with China producing around 95 percent of the global supply. Gallium-based semiconductors are indispensable for cellphones, blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs), diode lasers, and fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications. Like for gallium, the United States is 100 percent reliant on imports for graphite, which is used to make advanced batteries for cellphones, laptops, and hybrid and electric cars. China produces over 60 percent of the world's graphite and almost all of the world's production of high-purity graphite needed for rechargeable batteries. For these and other critical minerals identified by the Secretary of the Interior, we must reduce our vulnerability to adverse foreign government action, natural disaster, or other supply disruptions. Our national security, foreign policy, and economy require a consistent supply of each of these minerals. I therefore determine that our Nation's undue reliance on critical minerals, in processed or unprocessed form, from foreign adversaries constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part [[Page 453]] outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. In addition, I find that the United States must broadly enhance its mining and processing capacity, including for minerals not identified as critical minerals and not included within the national emergency declared in this order. By expanding and strengthening domestic mining and processing capacity today, we guard against the possibility of supply chain disruptions and future attempts by our adversaries or strategic competitors to harm our economy and military readiness. Moreover, additional domestic capacity will reduce United States and global dependence on minerals produced in countries that do not endorse and pursue appropriate minerals supply chain standards, leading to human rights violations, forced and child labor, violent conflict, and health and environmental damage. Finally, a stronger domestic mining and processing industry fosters a healthier and faster-growing economy for the United States. Mining and mineral processing provide jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans whose daily work allows our country and the world to ``Buy American'' for critical technology. I hereby determine and order: Section 1. (a) To address the national emergency declared by this order, and pursuant to subsection 203(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(a)(1)(B)), the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall investigate our Nation's undue reliance on critical minerals, in processed or unprocessed form, from foreign adversaries. The Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, within 60 days of the date of this order. That report shall summarize any conclusions from this investigation and recommend executive action, which may include the imposition of tariffs or quotas, other import restrictions against China and other non-market foreign adversaries whose economic practices threaten to undermine the health, growth, and resiliency of the United States, or other appropriate action, consistent with applicable law. (b) By January 1, 2021, and every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall inform the President of the state of the threat posed by our Nation's reliance on critical minerals, in processed or unprocessed form, from foreign adversaries and recommend any additional actions necessary to address that threat. (c) The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 2. (a) It is the policy of the United States that relevant agencies should, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the expansion and protection of the domestic supply chain for minerals and the establishment of secure critical minerals supply chains, and should direct agency resources to this purpose, such that: [[Page 454]] (i) the United States develops secure critical minerals supply chains that do not depend on resources or processing from foreign adversaries; (ii) the United States establishes, expands, and strengthens commercially viable critical minerals mining and minerals processing capabilities; and (iii) the United States develops globally competitive, substantial, and resilient domestic commercial supply chain capabilities for critical minerals mining and processing. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the heads of all relevant agencies shall each submit a report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, that identifies all legal authorities and appropriations that the agency can use to meet the goals identified in subsection (a) of this section. (c) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of all relevant agencies shall each submit a report as provided in subsection (b) of this section that details the agency's strategy for using the legal authorities and appropriations identified pursuant to that subsection to meet the goals identified in subsection (a) of this section. The report shall explain how the agency's activities will be organized and how it proposes to coordinate relevant activities with other agencies. (d) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall submit a report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, that describes the current state of research and development activities undertaken by the Federal Government that relate to the mapping, extraction, processing, and use of minerals and that identifies future research and development needs and funding opportunities to strengthen domestic supply chains for minerals. (e) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, that details existing and planned efforts and policy options to: (i) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to the disruption of critical mineral supply chains through cooperation and coordination with partners and allies, including the private sector; (ii) build resilient critical mineral supply chains, including through initiatives to help allies build reliable critical mineral supply chains within their own territories; (iii) promote responsible minerals sourcing, labor, and business practices; and (iv) reduce the dependence of the United States on minerals produced using methods that do not adhere to responsible mining standards. Sec. 3. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall consider whether the authority delegated at section 306 of [[Page 455]] Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness) can be used to establish a program to provide grants to procure or install production equipment for the production and processing of critical minerals in the United States. Sec. 4. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy shall develop and publish guidance (and, as appropriate, shall revoke, revise, or replace prior guidance, including loan solicitations) clarifying the extent to which projects that support domestic supply chains for minerals are eligible for loan guarantees pursuant to Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended (42 U.S.C. 16511 et seq.) (``Title XVII''), and for funding awards and loans pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing incentive program established by section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, as amended (42 U.S.C. 17013) (``the ATVM statute''). In developing such guidance, the Secretary: (i) shall consider whether the relevant provisions of Title XVII can be interpreted in a manner that better promotes the expansion and protection of the domestic supply chain for minerals (including the development of new supply chains and the processing, remediation, and reuse of materials already in interstate commerce or otherwise available domestically); (ii) shall examine the meaning of the terms ``avoid, reduce, or sequester'' and other key terms in section 16513(a) of title 42, United States Code, which provides that the Secretary ``may make guarantees under this section only for projects that--(1) avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; and (2) employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued''; (iii) shall consider whether relevant provisions of the ATVM statute may be interpreted in a manner that better promotes the expansion and protection of the domestic supply chain for minerals (including the development of new supply chains and the processing, remediation, and reuse of materials already in interstate commerce or otherwise available domestically), including in such consideration the application of these provisions to minerals determined to be components installed for the purpose of meeting the performance requirements of advanced technology vehicles; and (iv) shall examine the meaning of the terms ``qualifying components'' and other key terms in subsection 17013(a) of title 42, United States Code. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy shall review the Department of Energy's regulations (including any preambles thereto) interpreting Title XVII and the ATVM statute, including the regulations published at 81 Fed. Reg. 90,699 (Dec. 15, 2016) and 73 Fed. Reg. 66,721 (Nov. 12, 2008), and shall identify all such regulations that may warrant revision or reconsideration in order to expand and protect the domestic supply chain for minerals (including the development of new supply chains and the processing, remediation, and reuse of materials already in interstate commerce or otherwise available domestically). Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall propose for notice and comment a rule or rules to revise or reconsider any such regulations for this purpose, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. [[Page 456]] Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of the Army (acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works), and the heads of all other relevant agencies shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits and the completion of projects in connection with expanding and protecting the domestic supply chain for minerals. Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall examine all available authorities of their respective agencies and identify any such authorities that could be used to accelerate and encourage the development and reuse of historic coal waste areas, material on historic mining sites, and abandoned mining sites for the recovery of critical minerals. Sec. 7. Amendment. Executive Order 13817 is hereby amended to add the following sentence to the end of section 2(b): ``This list shall be updated periodically, following the same process, to reflect current data on supply, demand, and concentration of production, as well as current policy priorities.'' Sec. 8. Definitions. As used in this order: (a) the term ``critical minerals'' means the minerals and materials identified by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to section 2(b) of Executive Order 13817, as amended by this order; and (b) the term ``supply chain,'' when used with reference to minerals, includes the exploration, mining, concentration, separation, alloying, recycling, and reprocessing of minerals. Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 30, 2020. [[Page 457]] Executive Order 13954 of October 3, 2020 Saving Lives Through Increased Support for Mental- and Behavioral-Health Needs By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. My Administration is committed to preventing the tragedy of suicide, ending the opioid crisis, and improving mental and behavioral health. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, these urgent issues were prioritized through significant initiatives, including the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS), expanded access to medication-assisted treatment and life-saving naloxone, and budget requests for significant investments in the funding of evidence-based treatment for mental- and behavioral- health needs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government has dedicated billions of dollars and thousands of hours in resources to help Americans, including approximately $425 million in emergency funds to address mental and substance use disorders through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The pandemic has also exacerbated mental- and behavioral-health conditions as a result of stress from prolonged lockdown orders, lost employment, and social isolation. Survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that during the last week of June, 40.9 percent of Americans struggled with mental-health or substance-abuse issues and 10.7 percent reported seriously considering suicide. We must enhance the ability of the Federal Government, as well as its State, local, and Tribal partners, to appropriately address these ongoing mental- and behavioral-health concerns. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to prevent suicides, drug-related deaths, and poor behavioral-health outcomes, particularly those that are induced or made worse by prolonged State and local COVID-19 shutdown orders. I am therefore issuing a national call to action to: (a) Engage the resources of the Federal Government to address the mental- and behavioral-health needs of vulnerable Americans, including by: (i) providing crisis-intervention services to treat those in immediate life-threatening situations; and (ii) increasing the availability of and access to quality continuing care following initial crisis resolution to improve behavioral-health outcomes; (b) Permit and encourage safe in-person mentorship programs; support-group participation; and attendance at communal facilities, including schools, civic centers, and houses of worship; (c) Increase the availability of telehealth and online mental-health and substance-use tools and services; and (d) Marshal public and private resources to address deteriorating mental health, such as factors that contribute to prolonged unemployment and social isolation. [[Page 458]] Sec. 3. Establishment of a Coronavirus Mental Health Working Group. The Coronavirus Mental Health Working Group (Working Group) is hereby established to facilitate an ``all-of-government'' response to the mental-health conditions induced or exacerbated by the pandemic, including issues related to suicide prevention. The Working Group will be co-chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or his designee, and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, or her designee. The Working Group shall be composed of representatives from the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and such representatives of other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Co-Chairs may, from time to time, designate with the concurrence of the head of the department, agency, or office concerned. All members of the Working Group shall be full-time, or permanent part- time, officers or employees of the Federal Government. Sec. 4. Responsibilities of the Coronavirus Mental Health Working Group. (a) As part of the Working Group's efforts, it shall consider the mental- and behavioral-health conditions of those vulnerable populations affected by the pandemic, including: minorities, seniors, veterans, small business owners, children, and individuals potentially affected by domestic violence or physical abuse; those living with disabilities; and those with a substance use disorder. The Working Group shall examine existing protocols and evidence-based programs that may serve as models to better support these at-risk groups, including implementation and broader application of the PREVENTS, and the Department of Labor's Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion's Mental Health Toolkit and Centralized Accommodation Programs. (b) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Working Group shall develop and submit to the President a report that outlines a plan for improved service coordination between all relevant public and private stakeholders and executive departments and agencies (agencies) to assist individuals in crisis so that they receive effective treatment and recovery services. Sec. 5. Grant Funding for States and Organizations that Permit In-Person Treatment and Recovery Support Activities for Mental and Behavioral Health. The heads of agencies, in consultation with the Director of OMB, shall: (a) Examine their existing grant programs that fund mental-health, medical, or related services and, consistent with applicable law, take steps to encourage grantees to consider adopting policies, where appropriate, that have been shown to improve mental health and reduce suicide risk, including the following: (i) Safe in-person and telehealth participation in support groups for people in recovery from substance use disorders, mental-health issues, or other ailments that benefit from communal support; and peer-to-peer services that support underserved communities; (ii) Safe face-to-face therapeutic services, including group therapy, to remediate poor behavioral health; and [[Page 459]] (iii) Safe participation in communal support--both faith-based and secular--including educational programs, civic activities, and in-person religious services. (b) Maximize use of existing agency authorities to award contracts or grants to community organizations or other local entities to enhance mental-health and suicide-prevention services, such as outreach, education, and case management, to vulnerable Americans. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 3, 2020. Executive Order 13955 of October 13, 2020 Establishing the One Trillion Trees Interagency Council By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. As I declared in Executive Order 13855 of December 21, 2018 (Promoting Active Management of America's Forests, Rangelands, and Other Federal Lands To Improve Conditions and Reduce Wildfire Risk), it is the policy of the United States to promote healthy and resilient forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands by actively managing them through partnerships with States, tribes, communities, non-profit organizations, and the private sector. Our Nation is home to hundreds of millions of acres of Federal, State, tribal, and private forests and woodlands, which produce tremendous positive economic and environmental effects throughout our country. Recreational and educational visits to National Forests make substantial contributions to our Nation's physical and emotional health as well as to our gross domestic product, all while supporting thousands of full- and part-time jobs. Our Nation's forests and woodlands provide valuable environmental benefits as well, including by serving as wildlife habitats and supporting air and water quality for all Americans. Forests and woodlands sequester atmospheric carbon, and according to the Forest Service, 180 million people in over 68,000 communities rely on our Nation's forested watersheds to capture and filter their drinking water. [[Page 460]] These facts demonstrate how our Nation has taken advantage of the tremendous economic and environmental benefits associated with tree growth and forestation. By advancing Federal policies conducive to these practices, under my leadership, the United States has promoted greater use of nature-based solutions to address global challenges. On January 21, 2020, I announced that to further protect the environment, the United States would be joining the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Trees initiative (Initiative), an ambitious global effort to grow and conserve one trillion trees worldwide by 2030. Following through on my commitment, and given the expansive footprint of our Federal forests and woodlands, this order initiates the formation of the United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council to further the Federal Government's contribution to the global effort. Sec. 2. United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council. There is hereby established a United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council (Council). The Council shall be charged with developing, coordinating, and promoting Federal Government interactions with the Initiative with respect to tree growing, restoration, and conservation, and with coordinating with key stakeholders to help advance the Initiative. The Council shall remain independent from the Initiative. The Council shall be co-chaired by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, or by their designees (Co-Chairs). The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Coordination, or their designees, shall serve as Vice Chairs. (a) Membership. In addition to the Co-Chairs and Vice Chairs, the Council shall consist of the following officials or their designees: (i) the Secretary of State; (ii) the Secretary of the Treasury; (iii) the Secretary of Defense; (iv) the Secretary of Commerce; (v) the Secretary of Labor; (vi) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (vii) the Secretary of Transportation; (viii) the Secretary of Energy; (ix) the Secretary of Education; (x) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; (xi) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (xii) the Senior Advisor to the President; (xiii) the Advisor to the President and Director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship; (xiv) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy; (xv) the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality; (xvi) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; [[Page 461]] (xvii) the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development; (xviii) the Assistant to the President and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs; (xix) the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works); and (xx) the heads of such other executive departments and Federal land management agencies (agencies) and offices as the President, Co-Chairs, or Vice Chairs may, from time to time, designate or invite, as appropriate. (b) Administration. The Co-Chairs, in consultation with the Vice Chairs, shall convene meetings of the Council and direct its work. The Co-Chairs shall keep the Council apprised of all Federal efforts related to the subject of this order. The Co-Chairs and members of the Council shall also coordinate with the Vice Chairs on communications with the Initiative and related parties regarding any Federal Government interactions with the Initiative. Sec. 3. Agency Roles and Responsibilities. All members of the Council who are heads of agencies shall: (a) include Council-related activities within their respective strategic planning processes; and (b) provide to the Co-Chairs, Vice Chairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to the Council protocol established under section 4(e) of this order, regular progress reports on their respective agencies' activities, if any, relating to the growth, restoration, and conservation of trees. Sec. 4. Council Mission and Functions. The mission of the Council shall be to promote an increase in Federal Government activities and other national efforts that further the Initiative by growing, restoring, and conserving trees. The Council shall: (a) develop and implement a strategy that includes a methodology that the Federal Government will use to track and measure any Federal activities related to the Initiative, specifically with respect to trees grown, restored, and conserved; (b) identify statutory, regulatory, and other limitations that inhibit the Federal Government from taking additional actions in furtherance of the Initiative, and recommend potential administrative and legislative actions to remedy such limitations; (c) identify opportunities to use existing authorities and existing or future authorized and appropriated funds to promote efforts to protect and restore trees, and to promote the active management of existing Federal lands to facilitate growth, restoration, and conservation of trees; (d) inform State, local, and tribal officials of Federal efforts to protect, grow, and actively manage forests and woodlands on Federal lands; and (e) establish a protocol for the submission by members of the Council who are heads of agencies of regular progress reports to the Co- Chairs, Vice Chairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget on the activities, if any, of these members' respective agencies relating to the growth, restoration, and conservation of trees. [[Page 462]] Sec. 5. Termination. The Council shall terminate on December 31, 2030. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 13, 2020. Executive Order 13956 of October 13, 2020 Modernizing America's Water Resource Management and Water Infrastructure By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Abundant, safe, and reliable supplies of water are critical to quality of life for all Americans, fueling our economy, providing food for our citizens and the world, generating energy, protecting public health, supporting rich and diverse wildlife and plant species, and affording recreational opportunities. While America is blessed with abundant natural resources, those resources must be effectively managed, and our water infrastructure must be modernized to meet the needs of current and future generations. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) that engage in water- related matters, including water storage and supply, water quality and restoration activities, water infrastructure, transportation on our rivers and inland waterways, and water forecasting, must work together where they have joint or overlapping responsibilities. This order will ensure that agencies do that more efficiently and effectively to improve our country's water resource management, modernize our water infrastructure, and prioritize the availability of clean, safe, and reliable water supplies. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to: (a) Improve coordination among agencies on water resource management and water infrastructure issues; (b) Reduce unnecessary duplication across the Federal Government by coordinating and consolidating existing water-related task forces, working groups, and other formal cross-agency initiatives, as appropriate; [[Page 463]] (c) Efficiently and effectively manage America's water resources and promote resilience of America's water-related infrastructure; (d) Promote integrated planning among agencies for Federal investments in water-related infrastructure; and (e) Support workforce development and efforts to recruit, train, and retain professionals to operate and maintain America's essential drinking water, wastewater, flood control, hydropower, and delivery and storage facilities. Sec. 3. Interagency Water Subcabinet. To promote efficient and effective coordination across agencies engaged in water-related matters, and to prioritize actions to modernize and safeguard our water resources and infrastructure, an interagency Water Policy Committee (to be known as the Water Subcabinet) is hereby established. The Water Subcabinet shall be co-chaired by the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Co-Chairs), and shall include the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Army, and the heads of such other agencies as the Co-Chairs deem appropriate. The Department of the Interior or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide administrative support as needed for the Water Subcabinet to implement this order. Sec. 4. Reducing Inefficiencies and Duplication. Currently, hundreds of Federal water-related task forces, working groups, and other formal cross-agency initiatives (Federal interagency working groups) exist to address water resource management. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Water Subcabinet shall, to the extent practicable, identify all such Federal interagency working groups and provide recommendations to the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on coordinating and consolidating these Federal interagency working groups, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. Sec. 5. Improving Water Resource Management. Federal agencies engage in a wide range of activities relating to water resource management. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Water Subcabinet shall submit to the Chairman of CEQ, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OSTP a report that recommends actions to address the issues described below, and for each recommendation identifies a lead agency, other relevant agencies, and agency milestones for fiscal years 2021 through 2025: (a) Actions to increase water storage, water supply reliability, and drought resiliency, including through: (i) developing additional storage capacity, including an examination of operational changes and opportunities to update dam water control manuals for existing facilities during routine operations, maintenance, and safety assessments; (ii) coordinating agency reviews when there are multi-agency permitting and other regulatory requirements; (iii) increasing engagement with State, local, and tribal partners regarding the ongoing drought along the Colorado River and regarding irrigated agriculture in the Colorado Basin; [[Page 464]] (iv) implementing the ``Priority Actions Supporting Long-Term Drought Resilience'' document issued on July 31, 2019, by the National Drought Resilience Partnership; and (v) improving coordination among State, local, tribal, and territorial governments and rural communities, including farmers, ranchers, and landowners, to develop voluntary, market-based water and land management practices and programs that improve conservation efforts, economic viability, and water supply, sustainability, and security; (b) Actions to improve water quality, source water protection, and nutrient management; to promote restoration activities; and to examine water quality challenges facing our Nation's minority and low-income communities, including through: (i) implementing the ``Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Action Plan III'' issued on October 22, 2019, by the EPA for the GLRI Interagency Task Force and Regional Working Group, established pursuant to the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (Public Law 114-322); (ii) enhancing coordination among the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force partners to support State implementation of nutrient reduction strategies; (iii) increasing coordination between agencies and members of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, established pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-303), and implementing and completing the activities included in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, established pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-541); and (iv) continuing implementation of the EPA's memorandum entitled ``Updating the Environmental Protection Agency's Water Quality Trading Policy to Promote Market-Based Mechanisms for Improving Water Quality'' issued on February 6, 2019; (c) Actions to improve water systems, including for drinking water, desalination, water reuse, wastewater, and flood control, including through: (i) finalizing and implementing, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the proposed rule entitled ``National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Proposed Lead and Copper Rule Revisions,'' 84 Fed. Reg. 61684 (Nov. 13, 2019); (ii) implementing the ``National Water Reuse Action Plan'' issued on February 27, 2020, by the EPA; (iii) coordinating with the Federal Interagency Floodplain Management Task Force, established pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-448), on Federal flood risk management policies and programs to better support community needs; and (iv) continuing coordination among agencies concerning the Department of Energy's Water Security Grand Challenge to advance transformational technology and innovation to provide safe, secure, and affordable water; and (d) Actions to improve water data management, research, modeling, and forecasting, including through: [[Page 465]] (i) aligning efforts and developing research plans among the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Secretary of the Army, through the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), to ensure that America remains a global leader for water-related science and technology capabilities; (ii) implementing common methods of water forecasting, including the use of snow monitoring tools, on a national and basin scale, supported by weather forecasting on all scales; (iii) developing state-of-the-art geospatial data tools, including maps, through Federal, State, tribal, and territorial partnerships to depict the scope of waters regulated under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500); and (iv) implementing actions identified in the ``Federal Action Plan for Improving Forecasts of Water Availability'' issued on October 18, 2019, by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce pursuant to section 3 of the Presidential Memorandum of October 19, 2018 (Promoting the Reliable Supply and Delivery of Water in the West). Sec. 6. Report. Within 1 year of submitting the report required by section 5 of this order, and annually thereafter, the Water Subcabinet shall update the Chairman of CEQ, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OSTP on the status of the actions identified in the report. Sec. 7. Integrated Infrastructure Planning. Agencies oversee a number of programs to enhance coordination of cross-agency water infrastructure planning and to protect taxpayer investments. Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Water Subcabinet shall identify and recommend actions and priorities to the Director of OMB, the Chairman of CEQ, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy to support integrated planning and coordination among agencies to maintain and modernize our Nation's water infrastructure, including for drinking water, desalination, water reuse, wastewater, irrigation, flood control, transportation on our rivers and inland waterways, and water storage and conveyance. The recommendations shall consider water infrastructure programs that are funded by the Department of Defense through the Army Corps of Engineers, and by the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the EPA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Economic Development Administration, and other agencies, as appropriate. Such programs include the EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, established pursuant to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-121) and amended by the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-270), which modernizes the aging water infrastructure of the United States, improves public health protections, and creates jobs; the Department of Agriculture's rural development programs, which make and support investments in water infrastructure; and the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service programs, which promote source water protection, improve water quality, and assist with developing new water infrastructure projects. Sec. 8. Water Sector Workforce. Trained water-sector professionals are vital to protecting public health and the environment through strategic planning, operation and maintenance of treatment facilities, and implementation of [[Page 466]] water management programs. Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Water Subcabinet, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall identify actions and develop recommendations to improve interagency coordination and provide assistance and technical support to State, local, tribal, and territorial governments in order to enhance the recruitment, training, and retention of water professionals within drinking water, desalination, water reuse, wastewater, flood control, hydropower, and delivery and storage sectors. Such recommendations shall be submitted to the Chairman of CEQ, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 13, 2020. Executive Order 13957 of October 21, 2020 Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. To effectively carry out the broad array of activities assigned to the executive branch under law, the President and his appointees must rely on men and women in the Federal service employed in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy- making, or policy-advocating character. Faithful execution of the law requires that the President have appropriate management oversight regarding this select cadre of professionals. The Federal Government benefits from career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs under the laws of the United States. The heads of executive departments [[Page 467]] and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non-public information that must be kept confidential. With the exception of attorneys in the Federal service who are appointed pursuant to Schedule A of the excepted service and members of the Senior Executive Service, appointments to these positions are generally made through the competitive service. Given the importance of the functions they discharge, employees in such positions must display appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. Due to these requirements, agencies should have a greater degree of appointment flexibility with respect to these employees than is afforded by the existing competitive service process. Further, effective performance management of employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, the Government's current performance management is inadequate, as recognized by Federal workers themselves. For instance, the 2016 Merit Principles Survey reveals that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe their agency addresses poor performers effectively. Separating employees who cannot or will not meet required performance standards is important, and it is particularly important with regard to employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating positions. High performance by such employees can meaningfully enhance agency operations, while poor performance can significantly hinder them. Senior agency officials report that poor performance by career employees in policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays and substandard-quality work for important agency projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations. Pursuant to my authority under section 3302(1) of title 5, United States Code, I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. These conditions include the need to provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures. Placing these positions in the excepted service will mitigate undue limitations on their selection. This action will also give agencies greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency. These are all qualities individuals should have before wielding the authority inherent in their prospective positions, and agencies should be able to assess candidates without proceeding through complicated and elaborate competitive service processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect their particular needs. Conditions of good administration similarly make necessary excepting such positions from the adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. Chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, requires agencies to comply with extensive procedures before taking adverse action [[Page 468]] against an employee. These requirements can make removing poorly performing employees difficult. Only a quarter of Federal supervisors are confident that they could remove a poor performer. Career employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, and policy- advocating positions wield significant influence over Government operations and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation. Sec. 2. Definition. The phrase ``normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition'' refers to positions whose occupants are, as a matter of practice, expected to resign upon a Presidential transition and includes all positions whose appointment requires the assent of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. Sec. 3. Excepted Service. Appointments of individuals to positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be made under Schedule F of the excepted service, as established by section 4 of this order. Sec. 4. Schedule F of the Excepted Service. (a) Civil Service Rule VI is amended as follows: (i) 5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read: ``OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, C, D, E, and F, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows: Schedule A. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy- determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A. Schedule B. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy- determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B. Appointments to these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as may be prescribed by OPM. Schedule C. Positions of a confidential or policy-determining character normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be listed in Schedule C. Schedule D. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy- determining character for which the competitive service requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient numbers of students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs. These positions, which are temporarily placed in the excepted service to enable more effective recruitment from all segments of society by using means of recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the rules generally applicable to the competitive service, shall be listed in Schedule D. Schedule E. Position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105. Conditions of good administration warrant that the position of administrative law judge be placed in the excepted service and that appointment to this position not be subject to the requirements of 5 CFR, part 302, including examination and rating requirements, though each [[Page 469]] agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible. Schedule F. Positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy- making, or policy-advocating character not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be listed in Schedule F. In appointing an individual to a position in Schedule F, each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.'' (ii) 5 CFR 6.4 is amended to read: ``Except as required by statute, the Civil Service Rules and Regulations shall not apply to removals from positions listed in Schedules A, C, D, E, or F, or from positions excepted from the competitive service by statute. The Civil Service Rules and Regulations shall apply to removals from positions listed in Schedule B of persons who have competitive status.'' (b) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall: (i) adopt such regulations as the Director determines may be necessary to implement this order, including, as appropriate, amendments to or rescissions of regulations that are inconsistent with, or that would impede the implementation of, this order, giving particular attention to 5 CFR, part 212, subpart D; 5 CFR, part 213, subparts A and C; and 5 CFR 302.101; and (ii) provide guidance on conducting a swift, orderly transition from existing appointment processes to the Schedule F process established by this order. Sec. 5. Agency Actions. (a) Each head of an executive agency (as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excluding the Government Accountability Office) shall conduct, within 90 days of the date of this order, a preliminary review of agency positions covered by subchapter II of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, and shall conduct a complete review of such positions within 210 days of the date of this order. Thereafter, each agency head shall conduct a review of agency positions covered by subchapter II of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, on at least an annual basis. Following such reviews each agency head shall: (i) for positions not excepted from the competitive service by statute, petition the Director to place in Schedule F any such competitive service, Schedule A, Schedule B, or Schedule D positions within the agency that the agency head determines to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy- making, or policy-advocating character and that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition. Any such petition shall include a written explanation documenting the basis for the agency head's determination that such position should be placed in Schedule F; and (ii) for positions excepted from the competitive service by statute, determine which such positions are of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character and are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition. The agency head shall publish this determination in the Federal Register. Such positions shall be considered Schedule F positions for the purposes of agency actions under sections 5(d) and 6 of this order. [[Page 470]] (b) The requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall apply to currently existing positions and newly created positions. (c) When conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, each agency head should give particular consideration to the appropriateness of either petitioning the Director to place in Schedule F or including in the determination published in the Federal Register, as applicable, positions whose duties include the following: (i) substantive participation in the advocacy for or development or formulation of policy, especially: (A) substantive participation in the development or drafting of regulations and guidance; or (B) substantive policy-related work in an agency or agency component that primarily focuses on policy; (ii) the supervision of attorneys; (iii) substantial discretion to determine the manner in which the agency exercises functions committed to the agency by law; (iv) viewing, circulating, or otherwise working with proposed regulations, guidance, executive orders, or other non-public policy proposals or deliberations generally covered by deliberative process privilege and either: (A) directly reporting to or regularly working with an individual appointed by either the President or an agency head who is paid at a rate not less than that earned by employees at Grade 13 of the General Schedule; or (B) working in the agency or agency component executive secretariat (or equivalent); or (v) conducting, on the agency's behalf, collective bargaining negotiations under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code. (d) The Director shall promptly determine whether to grant any petition under subsection (a) of this section. Not later than December 31 of each year, the Director shall report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, concerning the number of petitions granted and denied for that year for each agency. (e) Each agency head shall, as necessary and appropriate, expeditiously petition the Federal Labor Relations Authority to determine whether any Schedule F position must be excluded from a collective bargaining unit under section 7112(b) of title 5, United States Code, paying particular attention to the question of whether incumbents in such positions are required or authorized to formulate, determine, or influence the policies of the agency. Sec. 6. Prohibited Personnel Practices Prohibited. Agencies shall establish rules to prohibit the same personnel practices prohibited by section 2302(b) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to any employee or applicant for employment in Schedule F of the excepted service. Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: [[Page 471]] (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of any of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. (e) Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit or narrow the positions that are or may be listed in Schedule C. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 21, 2020. Executive Order 13958 of November 2, 2020 Establishing the President's Advisory 1776 Commission By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to better enable a rising generation to understand the history and principles of the founding of the United States in 1776, and, through this, form a more perfect Union, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The American founding envisioned a political order in harmony with the design of ``the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,'' seeing the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as embodied in and sanctioned by natural law and its traditions. The formation of a republic around these principles marked a clear departure from previous forms of government, securing rights through a form of government that derives its legitimate power from the consent of the governed. Throughout its national life, our Republic's exploration of the full meaning of these principles has led it through the ratification of a Constitution, civil war, the abolition of slavery, Reconstruction, and a series of domestic crises and world conflicts. Those events establish a clear historical record of an exceptional Nation dedicated to the ideas and ideals of its founding. Against this history, in recent years, a series of polemics grounded in poor scholarship has vilified our Founders and our founding. Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains. This radicalized view of [[Page 472]] American history lacks perspective, obscures virtues, twists motives, ignores or distorts facts, and magnifies flaws, resulting in the truth being concealed and history disfigured. Failing to identify, challenge, and correct this distorted perspective could fray and ultimately erase the bonds that knit our country and culture together. The recent attacks on our founding have highlighted America's history related to race. These one-sided and divisive accounts too often ignore or fail to properly honor and recollect the great legacy of the American national experience--our country's valiant and successful effort to shake off the curse of slavery and to use the lessons of that struggle to guide our work toward equal rights for all citizens in the present. Viewing America as an irredeemably and systemically racist country cannot account for the extraordinary role of the great heroes of the American movement against slavery and for civil rights--a great moral endeavor that, from Abraham Lincoln to Martin Luther King, Jr., was marked by religious fellowship, good will, generosity of heart, an emphasis on our shared principles, and an inclusive vision for the future. As these heroes demonstrated, the path to a renewed and confident national unity is through a rediscovery of a shared identity rooted in our founding principles. A loss of national confidence in these principles would place rising generations in jeopardy of a crippling self-doubt that could cause them to abandon faith in the common story that binds us to one another across our differences. Without our common faith in the equal right of every individual American to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, authoritarian visions of government and society could become increasingly alluring alternatives to self- government based on the consent of the people. Thus it is necessary to provide America's young people access to what is genuinely inspiring and unifying in our history, as well as to the lessons imparted by the American experience of overcoming great national challenges. This is what makes possible the informed and honest patriotism that is essential for a successful republic. A restoration of American education grounded in the principles of our founding that is accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling must ultimately succeed at the local level. Parents and local school boards must be empowered to achieve greater choice and variety in curriculum at the State and local levels. The role of the Federal Government is to protect and preserve State and local control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, and personnel of educational institutions, schools, and school systems. Indeed, that is why my Administration rejects the Common Core curriculum and all efforts to have the Federal Government impose a national curriculum or national standards in education. Vigorous participation in local government has always been America's laboratory of liberty and a key to what makes us exceptional. The best way to preserve the story of America's founding principles is to live it in action by local communities reasserting control of how children receive patriotic education in their schools. Sec. 2. The President's Advisory 1776 Commission. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall establish in the Department of Education the President's Advisory 1776 Commission (``the 1776 Commission'') to better enable a rising generation to understand the [[Page 473]] history and principles of the founding of the United States in 1776 and to strive to form a more perfect Union. (b) The 1776 Commission shall be composed of not more than 20 members, who shall be appointed by the President. Members shall serve for a term of 2 years and shall not be removed except for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. The 1776 Commission may include individuals from outside the Federal Government with relevant experience or subject-matter expertise. The 1776 Commission shall also include the following ex-officio members or such senior officials as those members may designate: (i) the Secretary of State; (ii) the Secretary of Defense; (iii) the Secretary of the Interior; (iv) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (v) the Secretary of Education; (vi) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy; and (vii) the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs. (c) The 1776 Commission shall: (i) produce a report for the President, within 1 year of the date of this order, which shall be publicly disseminated, regarding the core principles of the American founding and how these principles may be understood to further enjoyment of ``the blessings of liberty'' and to promote our striving ``to form a more perfect Union.'' The Commission may solicit statements and contributions from intellectual and cultural figures in addition to the views of the Commission members; (ii) advise and offer recommendations to the President and the United States Semiquincentennial Commission regarding the Federal Government's plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of American Independence and coordinate with relevant external stakeholders on their plans; (iii) facilitate the development and implementation of a ``Presidential 1776 Award'' to recognize student knowledge of the American founding, including knowledge about the Founders, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Convention, and the great soldiers and battles of the American Revolutionary War; (iv) advise executive departments and agencies (agencies) with regard to their efforts to ensure patriotic education--meaning the presentation of the history of the American founding and foundational principles, the examination of how the United States has grown closer to those principles throughout its history, and the explanation of why commitment to America's aspirations is beneficial and justified--is provided to the public at national parks, battlefields, monuments, museums, installations, landmarks, cemeteries, and other places important to the American Revolution and the American founding, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; (v) advise agencies on prioritizing the American founding in Federal grants and initiatives, including those described in section 4 of this order, and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; and [[Page 474]] (vi) facilitate, advise upon, and promote other activities to support public knowledge and patriotic education on the American Revolution and the American founding, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. (d) The 1776 Commission shall have a Chair and Vice Chair, designated by the President from among its members. An Executive Director, designated by the Secretary of Education in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall coordinate the work of the 1776 Commission. The Chair and Vice Chair shall work with the Executive Director to convene regular meetings of the 1776 Commission, determine its agenda, and direct its work, consistent with this order. (e) The Department of Education shall provide funding and administrative support for the 1776 Commission, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (f) Members of the 1776 Commission shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707). (g) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the 1776 Commission, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Education, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Administrator of General Services. (h) The 1776 Commission shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order, unless extended by the President. Sec. 3. Celebration of Constitution Day. All relevant agencies shall monitor compliance with Title I of Division J of Public Law 108-447, which provides that ``each educational institution that receives Federal funds for a fiscal year shall hold an educational program on the United States Constitution on September 17 of such year for the students served by the educational institution,'' including by verifying compliance with each educational institution that receives Federal funds. All relevant agencies shall take action, as appropriate, to enhance compliance with that law. Sec. 4. Prioritize the American Founding in Available Federal Resources. The following agencies shall prioritize Federal resources, consistent with applicable law, to promote patriotic education: (a) the Department of Education, through the American History and Civics Academies and American History and Civics Education-National Activities; (b) the Department of Defense, through the Pilot Program on Enhanced Civics Education; and (c) the Department of State, through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and through opportunities in the Fulbright, U.S. Speakers, and International Visitors Leadership programs, as well as in American Spaces. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or [[Page 475]] (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, November 2, 2020. Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the People's Republic of China (PRC) is increasingly exploiting United States capital to resource and to enable the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which continues to allow the PRC to directly threaten the United States homeland and United States forces overseas, including by developing and deploying weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious cyber-enabled actions against the United States and its people. Key to the development of the PRC's military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses is the country's large, ostensibly private economy. Through the national strategy of Military-Civil Fusion, the PRC increases the size of the country's military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies to support its military and intelligence activities. Those companies, though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly support the PRC's military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernization. At the same time, those companies raise capital by selling securities to United States investors that trade on public exchanges both here and abroad, lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings, and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital. In that way, the PRC exploits United States investors to finance the development and modernization of its military. I therefore further find that the PRC's military-industrial complex, by directly supporting the efforts of the PRC's military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, [[Page 476]] which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To protect the United States homeland and the American people, I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this threat. Accordingly, I hereby order: Section 1. (a) The following actions are prohibited: (i) beginning 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time on January 11, 2021, any transaction in publicly traded securities, or any securities that are derivative of, or are designed to provide investment exposure to such securities, of any Communist Chinese military company as defined in section 4(a)(i) of this order, by any United States person; and (ii) beginning 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time on the date that is 60 days after a person is determined to be a Communist Chinese military company pursuant to section (4)(a)(ii) or (iii) of this order, any transaction in publicly traded securities, or any securities that are derivative of, or are designed to provide investment exposure to such securities, of that person, by any United States person. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(i) of this section, purchases for value or sales made on or before 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on November 11, 2021, solely to divest, in whole or in part, from securities that any United States person held as of 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time on January 11, 2021, in a Communist Chinese military company as defined in section 4(a)(i) of this order, are permitted. (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(ii) of this section, for a person determined to be a Communist Chinese military company pursuant to section 4(a)(ii) or (iii) of this order, purchases for value or sales made on or before 365 days from the date of such determination, solely to divest, in whole or in part, from securities that any United States person held in such person, as of the date 60 days from the date of such determination, are permitted. (d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 3. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the [[Page 477]] Department of the Treasury. All agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. (b) Rules and regulations issued pursuant to this order may, among other things, establish procedures to license transactions otherwise prohibited pursuant to this order. But prior to issuing any license under this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence. Sec. 4. Definitions. For purposes of this order: (a) the term ``Communist Chinese military company'' means (i) any person that the Secretary of Defense has listed as a Communist Chinese military company operating directly or indirectly in the United States or in any of its territories or possessions pursuant to section 1237 of Public Law 105-261, as amended by section 1233 of Public Law 106-398 and section 1222 of Public Law 108-375, as of the date of this order, and as set forth in the Annex to this order, until such time as the Secretary of Defense removes such person from such list; (ii) any person that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines is a Communist Chinese military company operating directly or indirectly in the United States or in any of its territories or possessions and therefore lists as such pursuant to section 1237 of Public Law 105-261, as amended by section 1233 of Public Law 106-398 and section 1222 of Public Law 108-375, until such time as the Secretary of Defense removes such person from such list; or (iii) any person that the Secretary of the Treasury publicly lists as meeting the criteria in section 1237(b)(4)(B) of Public Law 105-261, or publicly lists as a subsidiary of a person already determined to be a Communist Chinese military company, until the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such person no longer meets that criteria and removes such person from such list.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, November 12, 2020. [[Page of December 3, 2020 Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to drive the growth of the United States economy and improve the quality of life of all Americans. In alignment with Executive Order 13859 of February 11, 2019 (Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence), executive departments and agencies (agencies) have recognized the power of AI to improve their operations, processes, and procedures; meet strategic goals; reduce costs; enhance oversight of the use of taxpayer funds; increase efficiency and mission effectiveness; improve quality of services; improve safety; train workforces; and support decision making by the Federal workforce, among other positive developments. Given the broad applicability of AI, nearly every agency and those served by those agencies can benefit from the appropriate use of AI. Agencies are already leading the way in the use of AI by applying it to accelerate regulatory reform; review Federal solicitations for regulatory compliance; combat fraud, waste, and abuse committed against taxpayers; identify information security threats and assess trends in related illicit activities; enhance the security and interoperability of Federal Government information systems; facilitate review of large datasets; streamline processes for grant applications; model weather patterns; facilitate predictive maintenance; and much more. Agencies are encouraged to continue to use AI, when appropriate, to benefit the American people. The ongoing adoption and acceptance of AI will depend significantly on public trust. Agencies must therefore design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that fosters public trust and confidence while protecting privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and American values, consistent with applicable law and the goals of Executive Order 13859. Certain agencies have already adopted guidelines and principles for the use of AI for national security or defense purposes, such as the Department of Defense's Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence (February 24, 2020), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's Principles of Artificial Intelligence Ethics for the Intelligence Community (July 23, 2020) and its Artificial Intelligence Ethics Framework for the Intelligence Community (July 23, 2020). Such guidelines and principles ensure that the use of AI in those contexts will benefit the American people and be worthy of their trust. Section 3 of this order establishes additional principles (Principles) for the use of AI in the Federal Government for purposes other than national security and defense, to similarly ensure that such uses are consistent with our Nation's values and are beneficial to the public. This order further establishes a process for implementing these Principles through common policy guidance across agencies. [[Page 481]] Sec. 2. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States to promote the innovation and use of AI, where appropriate, to improve Government operations and services in a manner that fosters public trust, builds confidence in AI, protects our Nation's values, and remains consistent with all applicable laws, including those related to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. (b) It is the policy of the United States that responsible agencies, as defined in section 8 of this order, shall, when considering the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI in Government, be guided by the common set of Principles set forth in section 3 of this order, which are designed to foster public trust and confidence in the use of AI, protect our Nation's values, and ensure that the use of AI remains consistent with all applicable laws, including those related to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. (c) It is the policy of the United States that the Principles for the use of AI in Government shall be governed by common policy guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as outlined in section 4 of this order, consistent with applicable law. Sec. 3. Principles for Use of AI in Government. When designing, developing, acquiring, and using AI in the Federal Government, agencies shall adhere to the following Principles: (a) Lawful and respectful of our Nation's values. Agencies shall design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that exhibits due respect for our Nation's values and is consistent with the Constitution and all other applicable laws and policies, including those addressing privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. (b) Purposeful and performance-driven. Agencies shall seek opportunities for designing, developing, acquiring, and using AI, where the benefits of doing so significantly outweigh the risks, and the risks can be assessed and managed. (c) Accurate, reliable, and effective. Agencies shall ensure that their application of AI is consistent with the use cases for which that AI was trained, and such use is accurate, reliable, and effective. (d) Safe, secure, and resilient. Agencies shall ensure the safety, security, and resiliency of their AI applications, including resilience when confronted with systematic vulnerabilities, adversarial manipulation, and other malicious exploitation. (e) Understandable. Agencies shall ensure that the operations and outcomes of their AI applications are sufficiently understandable by subject matter experts, users, and others, as appropriate. (f) Responsible and traceable. Agencies shall ensure that human roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, understood, and appropriately assigned for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI. Agencies shall ensure that AI is used in a manner consistent with these Principles and the purposes for which each use of AI is intended. The design, development, acquisition, and use of AI, as well as relevant inputs and outputs of particular AI applications, should be well documented and traceable, as appropriate and to the extent practicable. [[Page 482]] (g) Regularly monitored. Agencies shall ensure that their AI applications are regularly tested against these Principles. Mechanisms should be maintained to supersede, disengage, or deactivate existing applications of AI that demonstrate performance or outcomes that are inconsistent with their intended use or this order. (h) Transparent. Agencies shall be transparent in disclosing relevant information regarding their use of AI to appropriate stakeholders, including the Congress and the public, to the extent practicable and in accordance with applicable laws and policies, including with respect to the protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information. (i) Accountable. Agencies shall be accountable for implementing and enforcing appropriate safeguards for the proper use and functioning of their applications of AI, and shall monitor, audit, and document compliance with those safeguards. Agencies shall provide appropriate training to all agency personnel responsible for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI. Sec. 4. Implementation of Principles. (a) Existing OMB policies currently address many aspects of information and information technology design, development, acquisition, and use that apply, but are not unique, to AI. To the extent they are consistent with the Principles set forth in this order and applicable law, these existing policies shall continue to apply to relevant aspects of AI use in Government. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB (Director), in coordination with key stakeholders identified by the Director, shall publicly post a roadmap for the policy guidance that OMB intends to create or revise to better support the use of AI, consistent with this order. This roadmap shall include, where appropriate, a schedule for engaging with the public and timelines for finalizing relevant policy guidance. In addressing novel aspects of the use of AI in Government, OMB shall consider updates to the breadth of its policy guidance, including OMB Circulars and Management Memoranda. (c) Agencies shall continue to use voluntary consensus standards developed with industry participation, where available, when such use would not be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impracticable. Such standards shall also be taken into consideration by OMB when revising or developing AI guidance. Sec. 5. Agency Inventory of AI Use Cases. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Federal Chief Information Officers Council (CIO Council), in coordination with other interagency bodies as it deems appropriate, shall identify, provide guidance on, and make publicly available the criteria, format, and mechanisms for agency inventories of non-classified and non-sensitive use cases of AI by agencies. (b) Within 180 days of the CIO Council's completion of the directive in section 5(a) of this order, and annually thereafter, each agency shall prepare an inventory of its non-classified and non-sensitive use cases of AI, within the scope defined by section 9 of this order, including current and planned uses, consistent with the agency's mission. [[Page 483]] (c) As part of their respective inventories of AI use cases, agencies shall identify, review, and assess existing AI deployed and operating in support of agency missions for any inconsistencies with this order. (i) Within 120 days of completing their respective inventories, agencies shall develop plans either to achieve consistency with this order for each AI application or to retire AI applications found to be developed or used in a manner that is not consistent with this order. These plans must be approved by the agency-designated responsible official(s), as described in section 8 of this order, within this same 120-day time period. (ii) In coordination with the Agency Data Governance Body and relevant officials from agencies not represented within that body, agencies shall strive to implement the approved plans within 180 days of plan approval, subject to existing resource levels. (d) Within 60 days of the completion of their respective inventories of use cases of AI, agencies shall share their inventories with other agencies, to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable law and policy, including those concerning protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information. This sharing shall be coordinated through the CIO and Chief Data Officer Councils, as well as other interagency bodies, as appropriate, to improve interagency coordination and information sharing for common use cases. (e) Within 120 days of the completion of their inventories, agencies shall make their inventories available to the public, to the extent practicable and in accordance with applicable law and policy, including those concerning the protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information. Sec. 6. Interagency Coordination. Agencies are expected to participate in interagency bodies for the purpose of advancing the implementation of the Principles and the use of AI consistent with this order. Within 45 days of this order, the CIO Council shall publish a list of recommended interagency bodies and forums in which agencies may elect to participate, as appropriate and consistent with their respective authorities and missions. Sec. 7. AI Implementation Expertise. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program, administered by the General Services Administration (GSA) in collaboration with other agencies, shall identify priority areas of expertise and establish an AI track to attract experts from industry and academia to undertake a period of work at an agency. These PIF experts will work within agencies to further the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI in Government, consistent with this order. (b) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with GSA and relevant agencies, shall create an inventory of Federal Government rotational programs and determine how these programs can be used to expand the number of employees with AI expertise at the agencies. (c) Within 180 days of the creation of the inventory of Government rotational programs described in section 7(b) of this order, OPM shall issue a report with recommendations for how the programs in the inventory can be best used to expand the number of employees with AI expertise at the agencies. This report shall be shared with the interagency coordination [[Page 484]] bodies identified pursuant to section 6 of this order, enabling agencies to better use these programs for the use of AI, consistent with this order. Sec. 8. Responsible Agencies and Officials. (a) For purposes of this order, the term ``agency'' refers to all agencies described in section 3502, subsection (1), of title 44, United States Code, except for the agencies described in section 3502, subsection (5), of title 44. (b) This order applies to agencies that have use cases for AI that fall within the scope defined in section 9 of this order, and excludes the Department of Defense and those agencies and agency components with functions that lie wholly within the Intelligence Community. The term ``Intelligence Community'' has the meaning given the term in section 3003 of title 50, United States Code. (c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall specify the responsible official(s) at that agency who will coordinate implementation of the Principles set forth in section 3 of this order with the Agency Data Governance Body and other relevant officials and will collaborate with the interagency coordination bodies identified pursuant to section 6 of this order. Sec. 9. Scope of Application. (a) This order uses the definition of AI set forth in section 238(g) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 as a reference point. As Federal Government use of AI matures and evolves, OMB guidance developed or revised pursuant to section 4 of this order shall include such definitions as are necessary to ensure the application of the Principles in this order to appropriate use cases. (b) Except for the exclusions set forth in section 9(d) of this order, or provided for by applicable law, the Principles and implementation guidance in this order shall apply to AI designed, developed, acquired, or used specifically to advance the execution of agencies' missions, enhance decision making, or provide the public with a specified benefit. (c) This order applies to both existing and new uses of AI; both stand-alone AI and AI embedded within other systems or applications; AI developed both by the agency or by third parties on behalf of agencies for the fulfilment of specific agency missions, including relevant data inputs used to train AI and outputs used in support of decision making; and agencies' procurement of AI applications. (d) This order does not apply to: (i) AI used in defense or national security systems (as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6) or as determined by the agency), in whole or in part, although agencies shall adhere to other applicable guidelines and principles for defense and national security purposes, such as those adopted by the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; (ii) AI embedded within common commercial products, such as word processors or map navigation systems, while noting that Government use of such products must nevertheless comply with applicable law and policy to assure the protection of safety, security, privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and American values; and (iii) AI research and development (R&D) activities, although the Principles and OMB implementation guidance should inform any R&D directed at potential future applications of AI in the Federal Government. [[Page 485]] Sec. 10. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, December 10, 2020. Executive Order 13964 of December 10, 2020 Rebranding United States Foreign Assistance To Advance American Influence By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) (FAA), as amended, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. To foster goodwill between the recipients of United States foreign assistance and the American people, and to encourage the governments of nations that are receiving foreign assistance to support the [[Page 491]] United States, it is essential that recipients of United States foreign assistance be aware of the manifold efforts of American taxpayers to aid them and improve their lives. To further this awareness and to ensure United States foreign assistance supports the foreign policy objectives of the United States and maintains American influence and leadership, such assistance must appropriately and conspicuously be identified as American aid. Sec. 2. Establishment of Standard Federal Marking Regulations. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State (Secretary), in coordination with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (Administrator) and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate, shall initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking to brand and mark all United States foreign assistance provided under the FAA or any other law, including all assistance provided under humanitarian assistance or disaster relief programs, appropriately as ``American aid,'' consistent with section 641 of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2401). Such rulemaking to establish Federal marking regulations shall include proposing any amendments necessary to any existing regulations that may be appropriate to implement the directives set forth in this order. The agencies subject to these regulations shall implement them as soon as possible after they are finalized. (b) For the purposes of the standard Federal marking regulations described in section 2(a) of this order: (i) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the President will select a logo that embodies the values and generosity of the American people (``single logo''); and (ii) The single logo shall be prominently displayed on all materials related to United States foreign assistance programs, projects, and activities; on all communications and public affairs materials; on all foreign assistance goods and materials, and all packaging of such goods and materials; and on all rebranding of export packaging. The requirement to display the single logo shall not apply to purely administrative, non- deliverable items of contractors and recipients of United States foreign assistance or to the corporate or non-project materials of agencies that are not tied to projects funded under the FAA, and shall not require the rebranding of completed projects or products overseas. (c) Within 120 days of the date of this order, agencies that are not otherwise subject to existing regulations related to the branding and marking of United States foreign assistance shall identify, to the extent permitted by law, United States foreign assistance goods, materials, and packaging solely with the single logo, and shall amend or rescind any agency procedures or guidance inconsistent with this directive. This identification requirement applies to goods, materials, and packaging provided through non-governmental organizations and implementing partners contracted directly by or receiving funds from the United States Government consistent with subsection (b)(ii) of this section. This requirement applies, to the maximum extent practicable, to the obligation of any funds for such items after the date of this order. In instances of joint funding agreements with other donor governments, international organizations, or other parties, the single logo may be co-marked. [[Page 492]] (d) Within 120 days of the date of this order, agencies not otherwise governed subject to regulations related to the branding and marking of United States foreign assistance shall not, unless required by law, display their logos on United States foreign assistance goods and materials or the export packaging of foreign assistance goods and materials when the single logo is used as required under subsection (b)(ii) of this section, and shall amend or rescind as necessary any agency procedures or guidance inconsistent with this directive. (e) For purposes of subsection (b)(ii) of this section, absent the application of a specific statutory or regulatory exemption, the single logo shall be used unless the Secretary, in coordination with the Administrator and the heads of any other relevant agencies, determines that its use in connection with a certain type of aid or in a particular geographic area would raise compelling political, safety, or security concerns; or that its use would undermine the objectives of the United States in providing such aid. Any such determination to waive the single logo requirement must be made in writing. The Secretary may delegate this waiver authority, but such waiver authority shall not be delegated below the Under Secretary level within the Department of State. The Secretary may delegate this waiver authority to the Administrator, who may redelegate it to the Deputy Administrator, provided that the Secretary authorizes such redelegation. Sec. 3. Report. Within 180 days of the date of this order, and annually thereafter, the Secretary, in coordination with the Administrator and the heads of other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, a report on the implementation of this order. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, December 11, 2020. Executive Order 13966 of December 14, 2020 Increasing Economic and Geographic Mobility By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 305 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy and Principles. As expressed in Executive Order 13777 of February 24, 2017 (Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda), it is the [[Page 494]] policy of the United States to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. Overly burdensome occupational licensing requirements can impede job creation and slow economic growth, which undermines our Nation's prosperity and the economic well-being of the American people. Such regulations can prevent American workers and job seekers from earning a living, maximizing their personal and economic potential, and achieving the American Dream. The purpose of this order is to reduce the burden of occupational regulations in order to promote the free practice of commerce, lower consumer costs, and increase economic and geographic mobility, including for military spouses. My Administration is committed to continuing this important work by partnering with State, local, territorial, and tribal leaders throughout the country to eliminate harmful occupational regulations, which are frequently designed to protect politically connected interest groups. To this end, in October 2019, my Administration announced the establishment of the Governors' Initiative on Regulatory Innovation, which works with State, local, and tribal leaders to advance occupational licensing reforms, better align State and Federal regulations, and eliminate unnecessary regulations that drive up consumer costs. Occupational regulations can protect practitioners from competition rather than protect the public from malpractice. Unfortunately, the number of occupational regulations has substantially increased over the last few decades. Since the 1950s, the percentage of jobs requiring a government-mandated occupational license has increased from less than 5 percent to between 25 and 30 percent. By requiring workers to acquire new licenses when they move to a new jurisdiction, occupational regulations reduce worker mobility, disproportionately harm low-income Americans, and are particularly burdensome to military spouses who must relocate to support the service members committed to keeping our country safe. Additionally, blanket prohibitions that prevent individuals with criminal records from obtaining occupational licenses may exacerbate disparities in employment opportunity and increase the likelihood of recidivism, particularly as regulatory barriers to enter lower- and middle-income occupations are associated with higher recidivism rates. Licensing requirements unnecessary to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm also frequently impose expensive educational requirements on potential job seekers, even for occupations with limited future earnings potential. According to recent research, licensing requirements have cost our country an estimated 2.85 million jobs and over $200 billion annually in increased consumer costs. Therefore, it is the policy of the United States Government to support occupational regulation reform throughout the Nation, building on occupational licensing reforms enacted most recently in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota, guided by six principles: Principle 1. All recognized occupational licensure boards should be subject to active supervision of a designated governmental agency or office. Principle 2. All occupational licensure boards recognized by a State, territorial, or tribal government that oversee personal qualifications related to the practice of an occupation should adopt and maintain the criteria and methods of occupational regulation that are least restrictive to competition sufficient to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm to their health and safety. The policies and procedures of such boards should [[Page 495]] be designed to protect consumer and worker safety and to encourage competition. Principle 3. State, territorial, and tribal governments should review existing occupational regulations, including associated scope-of- practice provisions, to ensure that their requirements are the least restrictive to competition sufficient to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm. State, territorial, and tribal governments should also regularly review and analyze all occupational regulations, including associated personal qualifications required to obtain an occupational license, to ensure the adoption of the least restrictive requirements necessary to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm. Principle 4. Individuals with criminal records should be encouraged to submit to the appropriate licensure board a preliminary application for an occupational license for a determination as to whether the criminal record would preclude their attainment of the appropriate occupational license. Principle 5. A State, territorial, or tribal government should issue an occupational license to a person in the discipline applied for and at the same level of practice if the individual satisfies four requirements: (a) the individual holds an occupational license for that discipline from another jurisdiction in the United States and is in good standing; (b) the individual verifies having met, as applicable, the minimum examination, education, work, or clinical-supervision requirements imposed by the State, territory, or tribe; (c) the individual: (i) has not had the license previously revoked or suspended; (ii) has not been disciplined related to the license by any other regulating entity; and (iii) is not subject to any pending complaint, allegation, or investigation related to the license; and (d) the individual pays all applicable fees required to obtain the new license. Principle 6. Accommodations should be made for any applicant for an occupational license who is the spouse of an active duty member of the uniformed services and who is relocating with the member due to the member's official permanent change of station orders. Sec. 2. Review of and Report on Authorities, Regulations, Guidance, and Policies. The head of each executive department and agency (agency) shall, within 90 days of the date of this order and every 2 years thereafter: (a) review the agency's authorities, regulations, guidance, and polices to identify changes necessary to ensure alignment with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; and (b) submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director of OMB), the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs (Director of IGA) identifying all necessary changes identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 3. Identification and Report of Opportunities to Encourage Occupational Regulation Reform. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, and [[Page 496]] every 2 years thereafter, the head of each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Director of IGA identifying a list of recommended actions available to any and all agencies to recognize and reward State, territorial, and tribal governments that have in place policies and procedures regarding occupational regulation that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; and (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, and every 2 years thereafter, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Director of OMB, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Director of IGA, and the heads of other agencies and offices as appropriate, shall submit a report to the President identifying: (i) recommended changes to Federal law, regulations, guidance, and other policies to ensure alignment with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; (ii) recommended actions to be taken by agencies to recognize and reward State, territorial, and tribal governments that have in place policies and procedures regarding occupational regulation that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; and (iii) a list of criteria that may be used to evaluate whether a State, territorial, or tribal government has in place policies and procedures that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order. Sec. 4. Implementation of Recommendations to Recognize and Reward State, Territorial, and Tribal Regulatory Reform. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and every 2 years thereafter, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall seek and report on information from State, territorial, and tribal governments regarding whether they have in place policies and procedures consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order and shall make the report publicly available, including on agencies' websites. The information sought shall be consistent with the criteria identified as required by section 3(b)(iii) of this order. (b) Consistent with applicable law, and to the extent that the President approves any of the actions recommended pursuant to section 3(b)(ii) of this order, agencies shall implement such actions for the purpose of recognizing and rewarding a State, territorial, or tribal government that has in place policies and procedures regarding occupational regulation that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order. Sec. 5. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) ``Active supervision'' means: (i) reviewing proposed occupational licensure board rules, policies, or other regulatory actions that may restrict market competition prior to issuance; (ii) ensuring that any entity seeking to impose occupational licensing criteria adopts the criteria that are least restrictive to competition sufficient to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm to their health or safety; and [[Page 497]] (iii) analyzing, where information is readily available, the effects of proposed rules, policies, and other regulatory actions on employment opportunities, consumer costs, market competition, and administrative costs. (b) ``Agency'' has the meaning given that term in section 3502(1) of title 44, United States Code, except that the term does not include the agencies described in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code, other than the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. (c) ``Occupational license'' means a license, registration, or certification without which an individual lacks the legal permission of a State, local, territorial, or tribal government to perform certain defined services for compensation. (d) ``Occupational regulation'' includes: (i) licensing or government certification, by which a government body requires personal qualifications in order to be permitted to practice an occupation; and (ii) registration, bonding, or inspections, by which a government body does not require personal qualifications in order to be permitted to practice an occupation. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, December 14, 2020. Executive Order 13967 of December 18, 2020 Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Societies have long recognized the importance of beautiful public architecture. Ancient Greek and Roman public buildings were designed to be sturdy and useful, and also to beautify public spaces and inspire civic pride. Throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, public architecture continued to serve these purposes. The 1309 constitution of the City of Siena required that ``[w]hoever rules the City must have the [[Page 498]] beauty of the City as his foremost preoccupation . . . because it must provide pride, honor, wealth, and growth to the Sienese citizens, as well as pleasure and happiness to visitors from abroad.'' Three centuries later, the great British Architect Sir Christopher Wren declared that ``public buildings [are] the ornament of a country. [Architecture] establishes a Nation, draws people and commerce, makes the people love their native country . . . Architecture aims at eternity[.]'' Notable Founding Fathers agreed with these assessments and attached great importance to Federal civic architecture. They wanted America's public buildings to inspire the American people and encourage civic virtue. President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the most important buildings in Washington, DC, on the classical architecture of ancient Athens and Rome. They sought to use classical architecture to visually connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions. Washington and Jefferson personally oversaw the competitions to design the Capitol Building and the White House. Under the direction and following the vision of these two founders, Pierre Charles L'Enfant designed the Nation's capital as a classical city. The promise of his design for the city was fulfilled by the 1902 McMillan Plan, which created the National Mall and the Monumental Core as we know them. For approximately a century and a half following America's founding, America's Federal architecture continued to be characterized by beautiful and beloved buildings of largely, though not exclusively, classical design. Examples include the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Pioneer Courthouse in Portland, Oregon, and the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in New York City, New York. In Washington, DC, classical buildings such as the White House, the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, the Department of the Treasury, and the Lincoln Memorial have become iconic symbols of our system of government. These cherished landmarks, built to endure for centuries, have become an important part of our civic life. In the 1950s, the Federal Government largely replaced traditional designs for new construction with modernist ones. This practice became official policy after the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space proposed what became known as the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture (Guiding Principles) in 1962. The Guiding Principles implicitly discouraged classical and other traditional designs known for their beauty, declaring instead that the Government should use ``contemporary'' designs. The Federal architecture that ensued, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA), was often unpopular with Americans. The new buildings ranged from the undistinguished to designs even GSA now admits many in the public found unappealing. In Washington, DC, new Federal buildings visibly clashed with the existing classical architecture. Some of these structures, such as the Hubert H. Humphrey Department of Health and Human Services Building and the Robert C. Weaver Department of Housing and Urban Development Building, were controversial, attracting widespread criticism for their Brutalist designs. [[Page 499]] In 1994, GSA responded to this widespread criticism that the buildings it had been commissioning lacked distinction by establishing the Design Excellence Program. The GSA intended that program to advance the Guiding Principles' mandate that Federal architecture ``provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.'' Unfortunately, the program has not met this goal. Under the Design Excellence Program, GSA has often selected designs by prominent architects with little regard for local input or regional aesthetic preferences. The resulting Federal architecture sometimes impresses the architectural elite, but not the American people who the buildings are meant to serve. Many of these new Federal buildings are not even visibly identifiable as civic buildings. For example, GSA selected an architect to design the San Francisco Federal Building who describes his designs as ``art-for-art's-sake'' architecture, intended primarily for architects to appreciate. While elite architects praised the resulting building, many San Franciscans consider it one of the ugliest structures in their city. Similarly, GSA selected a modernist architect to design Salt Lake City's new Federal courthouse. The architectural establishment and its professional organizations praised his unique creation, but many local residents considered it ugly and inconsistent with its surroundings. In Orlando, Florida, a coalition of judges, court employees, and civic leaders opposed GSA's preferred modernist design for the George C. Young Federal Courthouse. They believed it lacked the dignity a Federal courthouse should embody. The GSA nonetheless imposed this design over their objections. With a limited number of exceptions, such as the Tuscaloosa Federal Building and Courthouse and the Corpus Christi Federal Courthouse, the Federal Government has largely stopped building beautiful buildings. In Washington, DC, Federal architecture has become a discordant mixture of classical and modernist designs. It is time to update the policies guiding Federal architecture to address these problems and ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their clients, the American people. New Federal building designs should, like America's beloved landmark buildings, uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, command respect from the general public, and, as appropriate, respect the architectural heritage of a region. They should also be visibly identifiable as civic buildings and should be selected with input from the local community. Classical and other traditional architecture, as practiced both historically and by today's architects, have proven their ability to meet these design criteria and to more than satisfy today's functional, technical, and sustainable needs. Their use should be encouraged instead of discouraged. Encouraging classical and traditional architecture does not exclude using most other styles of architecture, where appropriate. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that all Federal building designs command respect of the general public for their beauty and visual embodiment of America's ideals. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) Applicable Federal public buildings should uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, [[Page 500]] and command respect from the general public. They should also be visually identifiable as civic buildings and, as appropriate, respect regional architectural heritage. Architecture--with particular regard for traditional and classical architecture--that meets the criteria set forth in this subsection is the preferred architecture for applicable Federal public buildings. In the District of Columbia, classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture. (b) Where the architecture of applicable Federal public buildings diverges from the preferred architecture set forth in subsection (a) of this section, great care and consideration must be taken to choose a design that commands respect from the general public and clearly conveys to the general public the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of America's system of self-government. (c) When renovating, reducing, or expanding applicable Federal public buildings that do not meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the feasibility and potential expense of building redesign to meet those criteria should be examined. Where feasible and economical, such redesign should be given substantial consideration, especially with regard to the building's exterior. (d) GSA should seek input from the future users of applicable public buildings and the general public in the community where such buildings will be located before selecting an architectural firm or design style. Sec. 3. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) ``Applicable Federal public building'' means: (i) all Federal courthouses and agency headquarters; (ii) all Federal public buildings in the District of Columbia; and (iii) all other Federal public buildings that cost or are expected to cost more than $50 million in 2020 dollars to design, build, and finish, but does not include infrastructure projects or land ports of entry. (b) ``Brutalist'' means the style of architecture that grew out of the early 20th-century modernist movement that is characterized by a massive and block-like appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of exposed poured concrete. (c) ``Classical architecture'' means the architectural tradition derived from the forms, principles, and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman antiquity, and as later developed and expanded upon by such Renaissance architects as Alberti, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, and Palladio; such Enlightenment masters as Robert Adam, John Soane, and Christopher Wren; such 19th-century architects as Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Robert Mills, and Thomas U. Walter; and such 20th-century practitioners as Julian Abele, Daniel Burnham, Charles F. McKim, John Russell Pope, Julia Morgan, and the firm of Delano and Aldrich. Classical architecture encompasses such styles as Neoclassical, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Beaux-Arts, and Art Deco. (d) ``Deconstructivist'' means the style of architecture generally known as ``deconstructivism'' that emerged during the late 1980s that subverts the traditional values of architecture through such features as fragmentation, [[Page 501]] disorder, discontinuity, distortion, skewed geometry, and the appearance of instability. (e) ``General public'' means members of the public who are not: (i) artists, architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, instructors or professors of art or architecture, or members of the building industry; or (ii) affiliated with any interest group, trade association, or any other organization whose membership is financially affected by decisions involving the design, construction, or remodeling of public buildings. (f) ``Officer'' has the meaning given that term in section 2104 of title 5, United States Code. (g) ``Public building'' has the meaning given that term in section 3301(a)(5) of title 40, United States Code. (h) ``Traditional architecture'' includes classical architecture, as defined herein, and also includes the historic humanistic architecture such as Gothic, Romanesque, Pueblo Revival, Spanish Colonial, and other Mediterranean styles of architecture historically rooted in various regions of America. (i) ``2020 dollars'' means dollars adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Economic Analysis's Gross Domestic Product price deflator and using 2020 as the base year. Sec. 4. President's Council on Improving Federal Civic Architecture. (a) There is hereby established the President's Council on Improving Federal Civic Architecture (Council). (b) The Council shall be composed of: (i) all of the members of the Commission of Fine Arts; (ii) the Secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts; (iii) the Architect of the Capitol; (iv) the Commissioner of the GSA Public Building Service; (v) the Chief Architect of GSA; (vi) other officers or employees of the Federal Government as the President may, from time to time, designate; and (vii) up to 20 additional members appointed by the President from among citizens from outside the Federal Government to provide diverse perspectives on the matters falling under the Council's jurisdiction. (c) The Council shall be chaired by a member of the Commission of Fine Arts designated by the President. The Chair may designate a vice- chair and may establish subcommittees. (d) The members of the Council shall serve without compensation for their work on the Council. However, members of the Council, while engaged in the work of the Council, may receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service, pursuant to sections 5701 through 5707 of title 5, United States Code. (e) To the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations, the Administrator of General Services (Administrator) shall provide such [[Page 502]] funding and administrative and technical support as the Council may require. The Administrator shall, to the extent permitted by law, direct GSA staff to provide any relevant information the Council requests and may detail such staff to aid the work of the Council, at the request of the Council. (f) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the Council, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress under section 6 of that Act, shall be performed by the Administrator in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator. (g) The Council shall terminate on September 30, 2021, unless extended by the President. Members appointed under subsections (b)(vi) and (b)(vii) of this section shall serve until the Council terminates and shall not be removed except for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Sec. 5. Responsibilities of the Council. The Council shall: (a) submit a report to the Administrator, recommending updates to GSA's policies and procedures to incorporate the policies of section 2 of this order and advance the purposes of this order. The report shall explain how the recommended changes accomplish these purposes. The report shall be submitted prior to September 30, 2021.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, December 18, 2020. Executive Order 13968 of December 18, 2020 Promoting Redemption of Savings Bonds By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. Since 1935, the Department of the Treasury (Department) has issued savings bonds to the American public. Backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, these bonds are extremely safe investments that were designed to be accessible even to inexperienced investors. Indeed, over the years, savings bonds have proved to be a popular birthday or graduation gift, helping introduce younger Americans to the rewards of investing in our country's future. Among other things, savings bonds provided the United States with a critical source of financing during World War II. By law, savings bonds never expire, and there is no deadline for owners to redeem them. It is currently estimated that more than 75 million matured savings bonds, issued as far back as 1935, remain unredeemed. The total value of these unredeemed savings bonds is approximately $27 billion. Above and beyond any legal requirements applicable to savings bonds, the Department should take all appropriate action to make sure that those Americans who invested in the future success of their country have the opportunity to receive the remuneration to which they are lawfully entitled. Under my Administration, the Department has already undertaken significant measures to reunite matured savings bonds with their rightful owners. For example, the Department in 2019 released an online tool known as ``Treasury Hunt'' to help individuals determine if they are the owners of matured unredeemed savings bonds. This order is the next step in ensuring that owners of matured savings bonds have a full opportunity to redeem their bonds. Sec. 2. Updating Records. The Department shall work to digitize and make electronically searchable sufficient information to identify the registered [[Page 504]] owner of any matured unredeemed savings bond, including the name and registered address of such owner and of any registered beneficiaries. In particular, the Department shall complete its ongoing pilot project to assess the feasibility and cost of digitizing and making these records searchable and accessible, which is being carried out in conjunction with multiple vendors, before the end of calendar year 2020. If the pilot project is successful, a vendor shall be selected to begin digitizing savings bond records. When digitizing records, the Department shall, to the extent feasible, focus first on the bond-issuance years that represent the highest percentage of matured unredeemed debt. Sec. 3. Information Accessibility. Within 30 days of beginning to receive data from the digitization of records described in section 2 of this order, the Department shall incorporate into the data accessible through Treasury Hunt information collected from the digitized records, in a secure manner and consistent with applicable law, including the Privacy Act. The Department shall work to ensure that this information can be used through Treasury Hunt to help individuals determine if they are the owners of matured unredeemed savings bonds. Sec. 4. Customer Research. The Department shall conduct customer research to determine why individuals do not redeem savings bonds upon maturity, any barriers individuals encounter when they do attempt to redeem their bonds, and the feasibility of modifying redemption methods or developing alternative redemption methods in order to mitigate, overcome, or avoid any such barriers. Sec. 5. Collaboration with States. The Department shall engage with States and State associations to obtain additional data and information to help the Department identify owners of unredeemed bonds, to learn best practices employed by the States regarding the redemption of mature bonds, and to encourage the States to add direct links to Treasury Hunt to States' unclaimed property websites or other appropriate State publications or information portals. Sec. 6. Public Reporting. Within 6 months of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish a report on actions and initiatives undertaken by the Department to implement this order. Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, December 18, 2020. [[Page 505]] Executive Order 13969 of December 28, 2020 Expanding Educational Opportunity Through School Choice By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure the education, health, safety, and well-being of America's children, our most essential resource upon which the future of our great Nation depends, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. As part of their efforts to address the public health challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, State and local officials shut down in-person learning for the vast majority of our more than 56 million elementary and secondary school students beginning in late February and early March of this year. Since then, however, our Nation has identified effective measures to facilitate the safe resumption of in-person learning, and the Federal Government has provided more than $13 billion to States and school districts to implement those measures. The prolonged deprivation of in-person learning opportunities has produced undeniably dire consequences for the children of this country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that school attendance is negatively correlated with a child's risk of depression and various types of abuse. States have seen substantial declines in reports of child maltreatment while school buildings have been closed, indicating that allegations are going unreported. These reductions are driven in part by social isolation from the schoolteachers and support staff with whom students typically interact and who have an obligation to report suspected child maltreatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has also found that school closures have a ``substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and families.'' Additionally, a recent survey of educators found student absences from school, including virtual learning, have nearly doubled during the pandemic, and as AAP has noted, chronic absenteeism is associated with alcohol and drug use, teenage pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and suicide attempts. School closures are especially difficult for families with children with special needs. Schools provide not only academic supports for students with special needs, but they also provide much-needed in-person therapies and services, including physical and occupational therapies. A recent survey found that 80 percent of children with special needs are not receiving the services and supports to which they are entitled and that approximately 40 percent of children with special needs are receiving no services or supports. Moreover, the survey found that virtual learning may not be fully accessible to these students, as children with special needs are twice as likely to receive little or no remote learning and to be dissatisfied with the remote learning received. Low-income and minority children are also disproportionately affected by school closures. In low-income zip codes, students' math progress decreased by nearly 50 percent while school buildings were closed in the spring, and the math progress of students in middle-income zip codes fell by almost a third during the same period. A recent analysis projected that, if in-person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, Hispanic, [[Page 506]] Black, and low-income students will lose 9.2, 10.3, and 12.4 months of learning, respectively. A failure to quickly resume in-person learning options is likely to have long-term economic effects on children and their families. According to a recent study, if in-person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, the average student could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings, or the equivalent of a year of full-time work. Additionally, in 2019, more than 90 percent of children under the age of 18 had at least one employed parent. Many employed parents do not have the option of engaging in remote work that allows them the flexibility to supervise their children during the day when in-person learning options are not available. Without the resumption of in-person learning opportunities, the economic and social harms resulting from such lost employment opportunities will continue to compound. To help mitigate these harms, the Department of Health and Human Services recently announced additional relief for low-income parents by allowing States to use funds available through the Child Care and Development Fund to subsidize child care services and services that supplement academic instruction for children under the age of 13 who are participating in virtual instruction. Nevertheless, virtual instruction is an inadequate substitute for in-person learning opportunities and this aid is insufficient to meet current needs. While some families, especially those with financial means, have been able to mitigate school disruptions through in-person options such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, and innovative models like microschools and ``learning pods,'' for many families, their children's residentially assigned public school remains their only financially available option. Unfortunately, more than 50 percent of all public-school students in the United States began school remotely this fall. These children, including those with special needs, are being underserved due to the public education system's failure to provide in- person learning options. Students whose families pay tuition for their education are also facing significant hardships due to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Scores of private schools, including approximately 100 Catholic schools, have permanently closed since the onset of COVID-19, and more than half of our Nation's private schools are believed to have lost enrollment due to the pandemic. These closures and declining enrollments are harmful to students, bad for communities, and likely to impose increased strain on public school systems. I am committed to ensuring that all children of our great Nation have access to the educational resources they need to obtain a high-quality education and to improving students' safety and well-being, including by empowering families with emergency learning scholarships. Sec. 2. Providing Emergency Learning Scholarships for Students. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps, consistent with law, to allow funds available through the Community Services Block Grant program to be used by grantees and eligible entities to provide emergency learning scholarships to disadvantaged families for use by any child without access to in-person learning. These scholarships may be used for: (i) tuition and fees for a private or parochial school; [[Page 507]] (ii) homeschool, microschool, or learning-pod costs; (iii) special education and related services, including therapies; or (iv) tutoring or remedial education. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, January 6, 2020. [[Page 522]] Memorandum of January 29, 2020 Delegation of Certain Authority Under the Federal Service Labor- Management Relations Statute Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. The national security interests of the United States require expedient and efficient decisionmaking. When new missions emerge or existing ones evolve, the Department of Defense requires maximum flexibility to respond to threats to carry out its mission of protecting the American people. This flexibility requires that military and civilian leadership manage their organizations to cultivate a lethal, agile force adaptive to new technologies and posture changes. Where collective bargaining is incompatible with these organizations' missions, the Department of Defense should not be forced to sacrifice its national security mission and, instead, seek relief through third parties and administrative fora. Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority to the Secretary of Defense. (a) The Secretary of Defense (Secretary) is delegated authority under 5 U.S.C. 7103(b)(1) and 7103(b)(2) to issue orders excluding Department of Defense agencies or subdivisions thereof from Federal Service Labor- Management Relations Statute coverage. The Secretary is authorized to further delegate this authority to any official of the Department of Defense appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. (b) When making the determination required by 5 U.S.C. 7103(b)(1) or 7103(b)(2), the Secretary or other official delegated this authority pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall publish this determination in the Federal Register. (c) Any official to whom the Secretary of Defense delegates the authority pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may not further delegate this authority. (d) For purposes of this memorandum, the term ``Department of Defense agencies or subdivisions'' includes without limitation the military departments. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. [[Page 523]] You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, January 29, 2020. Order of February 10, 2020 Sequestration Order for Fiscal Year 2021 Pursuant to Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as Amended By the authority vested in me as President by the laws of the United States of America, and in accordance with section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (the ``Act''), as amended, 2 U.S.C. 901a, I hereby order that, on October 1, 2020, direct spending budgetary resources for fiscal year 2021 in each non-exempt budget account be reduced by the amount calculated by the Office of Management and Budget in its report to the Congress of February 10, 2020. All sequestrations shall be made in strict accordance with the requirements of section 251A of the Act and the specifications of the Office of Management and Budget's report of February 10, 2020, prepared pursuant to section 251A(9) of the Act. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, February 10, 2020. Notice of February 13, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Southern Border of the United States On February 15, 2019, by Proclamation 9844, I declared a national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States to deal with the border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests. The ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border of the United States continues to threaten our national security, including the security of the American people. The executive branch has taken steps to address the crisis, but further action is needed to address the humanitarian crisis and to control unlawful migration and the flow of narcotics and criminals across the southern border of the United States. [[Page 524]] For these reasons, the national emergency declared on February 15, 2019, and the measures adopted on that date to respond to that emergency, must continue in effect beyond February 15, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Proclamation 9844 concerning the southern border of the United States. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, February 13, 2020. Memorandum of February 19, 2020 Developing and Delivering More Water Supplies to California Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of Commerce[, and] the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following: Section 1. Policy. For decades, many of our Federal western water infrastructure investments have been undermined by fragmented and outdated regulatory actions. In a memorandum dated October 19, 2018 (Promoting the Reliable Supply and Delivery of Water in the West), I directed the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to work together, to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable law, to complete the review of the long-term coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), and subsequently to issue an updated Plan of Operations (Plan) and Record of Decision (ROD). It is the policy of the United States to modernize our Federal western water infrastructure to deliver water and power in an efficient, cost-effective way. Sec. 2. Enhancing Water Supplies While Appropriately Protecting Species and Habitats. In response to my memorandum, a Plan and ROD were issued today. The new framework set forth in these documents is expected to deliver more water to communities while using science and investments appropriately to protect affected species and their habitats. This is a good first step, but I believe more can be done. Therefore, I direct the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to build upon the success of the Plan and ROD by supplementing the resulting operations, consistent with applicable law, to make deliveries of water more reliable and bountiful. To help develop and deliver water supplies in the Central Valley of California, I direct those Secretaries to coordinate efforts to: (a) implement the relevant authorities of subtitle J of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (Public Law 114-322), which include provisions focused on (1) developing water storage, (2) capturing more water during storm events, and (3) giving agricultural and municipal water users more regulatory certainty; [[Page 525]] (b) fully implement, with respect to future agency actions, recent Administration improvements to management of programs established pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-205); and (c) provide quarterly updates to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and, at the request of other components of the Executive Office of the President, to each such component, regarding progress in carrying out sections 2(a) and (b) of this memorandum. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, February 19, 2020. Notice of February 20, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, which took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close associates if those assets were not protected. The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks against civilians, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability. [[Page 526]] The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and measures are needed to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuses by members of Qadhafi's family, their associates, and other persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation. For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011, must continue in effect beyond February 25, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, February 20, 2020. Memorandum of February 21, 2020 Delegation of Certain Functions and Authorities Under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[, and] the Director of National Intelligence By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby order as follows: Section 1. (a) I hereby delegate to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the functions and authorities vested in the President by the following provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116- 92) (the ``Act''): (i) section 7503(d); (ii) section 7503(f); (iii) section 7503(h); (iv) section 7124, with respect to section 73 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286 et seq.), as amended by the Act; (v) section 7131; and (vi) section 7143, with respect to section 208 of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-122) (NKSPEA), as amended by the Act. (b) I hereby delegate to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the functions and authorities vested in the President by the following provisions of the Act: (i) section 7503(c); (ii) section 7503(g); [[Page 527]] (iii) section 7121, with respect to section 201B of NKSPEA, as amended by the Act; and (iv) section 7122, with respect to section 104(g) of NKSPEA, as amended by the Act. (c) I hereby delegate to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce the functions and authorities vested in the President by section 7132 of the Act. (d) I hereby delegate to the Secretary of the Treasury the functions and authorities vested in the President by section 7141 of the Act. (e) I hereby delegate to the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, the functions and authorities vested in the President by section 7133 of the Act. (f) I hereby delegate to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the functions and authorities vested in the President by section 1227 of the Act. Sec. 2. The delegations in this memorandum shall apply to any provisions of any future public laws that are the same or substantially the same as those provisions referenced in this memorandum. Sec. 3. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, February 21, 2020. Notice of February 25, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Cuba and of the Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Cuban government of two unarmed United States-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. On February 24, 2016, by Proclamation 9398, and on February 22, 2018, by Proclamation 9699, the national emergency was further modified based on continued disturbances or threatened disturbances of the international relations of the United States related to Cuba. The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the use of excessive force against United States vessels or aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. [[Page 528]] In addition, the unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States because such entry could facilitate a mass migration from Cuba. It continues to be United States policy that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security of the United States by posing a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclamation 9699. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, February 25, 2020. Notice of February 25, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Ukraine On March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. On March 16, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13661, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. On March 20, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13662, which further expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, as expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. [[Page 529]] On December 19, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13685, to take additional steps to address the Russian occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. On September 20, 2018, the President issued Executive Order 13849, to take additional steps to implement certain statutory sanctions with respect to the Russian Federation. The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2014, and the measures adopted on that date, on March 16, 2014, on March 20, 2014, on December 19, 2014, and on September 20, 2018, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, February 25, 2020. Memorandum of March 3, 2020 Delegation of Authority to Re-establish the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Delegation of Re-establishment Authority. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is delegated the authority under section 9(a)(1) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), to re-establish the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (Council). In exercising this authority, the Secretary may direct the Council to perform duties consistent with those assigned to the Council in section 505(b) of Public Law 116-22, and may, at the Secretary's discretion, specify the membership of the Council, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.

(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. [[Page 530]] (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Notice of March 4, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain persons, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. These actions and policies had contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability in the southern African region. On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe. On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 and authorized the blocking of the property of additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe. The actions and policies by certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288. [[Page 531]] This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 4, 2020. Notice of March 5, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Venezuela On March 8, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13692, declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela based on the Government of Venezuela's erosion of human rights guarantees; persecution of political opponents; curtailment of press freedoms; use of violence and human rights violations and abuses in response to antigovernment protests; and arbitrary arrest and detention of antigovernment protestors, as well as the exacerbating presence of significant government corruption. On August 24, 2017, I issued Executive Order 13808 to take additional steps, with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, to address serious abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms; the deepening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; the establishment of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly, which usurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly and other branches of the Government of Venezuela; rampant public corruption; and ongoing repression and persecution of, and violence toward, the political opposition. On March 19, 2018, I issued Executive Order 13827 to take additional steps, with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, to address actions taken by the Maduro regime to attempt to circumvent United States sanctions by issuing a digital currency in a process that Venezuela's democratically-elected National Assembly denounced as unlawful. On May 21, 2018, I issued Executive Order 13835 to take additional steps, with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, to address actions of the Maduro regime, including endemic economic mismanagement and public corruption at the expense of the Venezuelan people and their prosperity, and repression of the political opposition; attempts to undermine democratic order by holding snap elections that were neither free nor fair; and the deepening humanitarian and public health crisis in Venezuela. On November 1, 2018, I issued Executive Order 13850 to take additional steps, with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, to address actions by the Maduro regime and associated persons to plunder Venezuela's wealth for their own corrupt purposes; degrade Venezuela's infrastructure and natural environment through economic mismanagement and confiscatory mining and industrial practices; and catalyze [[Page 532]] a regional migration crisis by neglecting the basic needs of the Venezuelan people. On January 25, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13857 to take additional steps, with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, to address actions by persons affiliated with the illegitimate Maduro regime, including human rights violations and abuses in response to anti-Maduro protests; arbitrary arrest and detention of anti-Maduro protestors; curtailment of press freedom; harassment of political opponents; and continued attempts to undermine the Interim President of Venezuela and undermine the National Assembly, the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people, and to prevent the Interim President and the National Assembly from exercising legitimate authority in Venezuela. On August 5, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13884 that imposed a full economic block on the Government of Venezuela, with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, for its continued human rights abuses, including the arbitrary or unlawful arrest and detention of Venezuelan citizens, interference with freedom of expression, including for members of the media, and ongoing attempts to undermine the Interim President of Venezuela and Venezuelan National Assembly's exercise of legitimate authority in Venezuela. The circumstances described in Executive Order 13692, and subsequent Executive Orders issued with respect to Venezuela, have not improved, and these circumstances in Venezuela continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 5, 2020. Order of March 6, 2020 Regarding the Acquisition of StayNTouch, Inc. by Beijing Shiji Information Technology Co., Ltd. By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C. 4565, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Findings. (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that (1) Beijing Shiji Information Technology Co., Ltd., a public company organized under the laws of China, and (2) its wholly owned direct subsidiary Shiji (Hong Kong) Ltd., a Hong Kong limited company (together, the ``Purchaser''), through acquiring an interest in StayNTouch, Inc. [[Page 533]] (``StayNTouch''), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Sec. 2. Actions Ordered and Authorized. On the basis of the findings set forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors described in subsection 721(f) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that: (a) The transaction resulting in the acquisition of StayNTouch by the Purchaser is hereby prohibited, and ownership by the Purchaser of any interest in StayNTouch and its assets, whether effected directly or indirectly through the Purchaser, or through the Purchaser's shareholders, partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, is also prohibited. (b) In order to effectuate this order, not later than 120 days after the date of this order, unless such date is extended for a period not to exceed 90 days, on such written conditions as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) may impose, the Purchaser shall divest all interests in: (i) StayNTouch; (ii) StayNTouch's assets, intellectual property, technology, data (including customer data managed and stored by StayNTouch), personnel, and customer contracts; and (iii) any operations developed, held, or controlled, whether directly or indirectly, by StayNTouch at the time of, or since, its acquisition. Immediately upon divestment, the Purchaser shall certify in writing to CFIUS that such divestment has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the transaction resulting in the acquisition of StayNTouch have been completed. (c) Immediately from the date of this order until such time as the divestment has been completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, the Purchaser shall refrain from accessing, and shall ensure that any of its subsidiaries or affiliates refrain from accessing, hotel guest data through StayNTouch. Not later than 7 days after the date of this order, the Purchaser shall ensure that controls are in place to prevent any such data access until such time as the divestment has been completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS. (d) The Purchaser shall not complete a sale or transfer under subsection 2(b) of this section to any third party: (i) until the Purchaser notifies CFIUS in writing of the intended recipient or buyer; and (ii) unless 10 business days have passed from the notification in subsection (d)(i) of this section and CFIUS has not issued an objection to the Purchaser. Among the factors CFIUS may consider in reviewing the proposed sale or transfer are whether the buyer or transferee: is a United States citizen or [[Page 534]] is owned by United States citizens; has or has had a direct or indirect contractual, financial, familial, employment, or other close and continuous relationship with the Purchaser, or its officers, employees, or shareholders; and can demonstrate a willingness and ability to support compliance with this order. In addition, CFIUS may consider whether the proposed sale or transfer would threaten to impair the national security of the United States or undermine the purposes of this order. (e) From the date of this order until the Purchaser provides a certification of divestment to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Purchaser and StayNTouch shall certify to CFIUS on a weekly basis that they are in compliance with this order and include a description of efforts to divest StayNTouch and a timeline for projected completion of remaining actions. (f) Any transaction or other device entered into or employed for the purpose of, or with the effect of, evading or circumventing this order is prohibited. (g) Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, and until such time as the divestment is completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, CFIUS is authorized to implement measures it deems necessary and appropriate to verify compliance with this order and to ensure that StayNTouch's operations are carried out in such a manner as to ensure protection of the national security interests of the United States. Such measures may include the following: on reasonable notice to the Purchaser and StayNTouch, employees of the United States Government, as designated by CFIUS, shall be permitted access, for purposes of verifying compliance with this order, to all premises and facilities of StayNTouch located in the United States: (i) to inspect and copy any books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of the Purchaser or StayNTouch that concern any matter relating to this order; (ii) to inspect or audit any information systems, networks, hardware, software, data, communications, or property in the possession or under the control of the Purchaser or StayNTouch; and (iii) to interview officers, employees, or agents of the Purchaser or StayNTouch concerning any matter relating to this order. CFIUS shall conclude its verification procedures within 90 days after the certification of divestment is provided to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. (h) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person of circumstances, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements. (i) The Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order. [[Page 535]] Sec. 3. Reservation. I hereby reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to the Purchaser and StayNTouch as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security of the United States. Sec. 4. Publication and Transmittal. (a) This order shall be published in the Federal Register. (b) I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit a copy of this order to the appropriate parties named in section 1 of this order. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 6, 2020. Memorandum of March 11, 2020 Making General Use Respirators Available Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services [and] the Secretary of Labor By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: It is the policy of the United States to take proactive measures to prepare for and respond to public health threats, including the public health emergency involving Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, pursuant to section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3). We must ensure that our healthcare providers have full access to the products they need. On March 10, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services took action by issuing a declaration pursuant to section 319F-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6d), which will help bring products necessary for addressing the epidemic to healthcare providers across the Nation. Unfortunately, at present, public health experts anticipate shortages in the supply of personal respiratory devices (respirators) available for use by healthcare workers in mitigating further transmission of COVID- 19. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take all appropriate and necessary steps with respect to general use respirators to facilitate their emergency use by healthcare personnel in healthcare facilities and elsewhere, including under the authorities granted by section 319F-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6d) and section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3). Additionally, the Secretary of Labor shall consider all appropriate and necessary steps to increase the availability of respirators. [[Page 536]] The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, March 11, 2020. Notice of March 12, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959, imposing more comprehensive sanctions on Iran to further respond to this threat. On August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059, consolidating and clarifying those previous orders. The President took additional steps pursuant to this national emergency in Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010; Executive Order 13574 of May 23, 2011; Executive Order 13590 of November 20, 2011; Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012; Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012; Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012; Executive Order 13622 of July 30, 2012; Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012; Executive Order 13645 of June 3, 2013; Executive Order 13716 of January 16, 2016; Executive Order 13846 of August 6, 2018; Executive Order 13871 of May 8, 2019; Executive Order 13876 of June 24, 2019; and Executive Order 13902 of January 10, 2020. As outlined in National Security Presidential Memorandum-11 of May 8, 2018 (Ceasing United States Participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and Taking Additional Action to Counter Iran's Malign Influence and Deny Iran All Paths to a Nuclear Weapon), the actions and policies of the Government of Iran--including its proliferation and development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, its network and campaign of regional aggression, its support for terrorist groups, and the malign activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its surrogates--continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12957. The emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, in connection with the hostage crisis. This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2019. [[Page 537]] This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 12, 2020. Memorandum of March 13, 2020 Expanding State-Approved Diagnostic Tests Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: It is the policy of the United States to take proactive measures to prepare for and respond to public health threats, including the public health emergency involving Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the ``Secretary'') on January 31, 2020, pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d). Our response must include heightened coordination among Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies, and we must offer States the flexibility they need to care for their citizens. In accordance with this principle, the Food and Drug Administration, in coordination with the State of New York, allowed the State flexibility in expediting State-approved COVID-19 testing. Should additional States request flexibility to authorize laboratories within the State to develop and perform tests used to detect COVID-19, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with law, to facilitate the request. You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, March 13, 2020. Memorandum of March 20, 2020 Delegation of Functions Under 31 U.S.C. 5302 Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: [[Page 538]] Section 1. Delegation of Authority over the Exchange Stabilization Fund. (a) I hereby delegate the functions and authorities conferred upon the President by section 5302 of title 31, United States Code, to the Secretary of the Treasury for use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund in an aggregate amount of up to $50 billion. (b) The functions and authorities delegated by this section may not be redelegated. Sec. 2. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, March 20, 2020. Memorandum of March 22, 2020 Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard To Respond to COVID-19 Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207 (the ``Stafford Act''), and section 502 of title 32, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to take measures to assist State Governors in their responses to all threats and hazards to the American people in their respective States. Considering the profound and unique public health risks posed by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (the virus), the need for close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States is greater than at any time in recent history. In recognizing this serious public health risk, I noted that on March [[Page 539]] 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic. On March 13, 2020, I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that SARS-CoV-2 poses to the Nation's healthcare systems. I also determined that same day that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted an emergency, of nationwide scope, pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)). To date, 50 States, the District of Columbia, 3 territories, 4 tribes, and 1 tribal nation have also declared emergencies as a result of the outbreak. All States have activated their Emergency Operations Centers and are working to fight the spread of the virus and attend to those who have symptoms or who are already infected with COVID-19. To provide maximum support to the Governors of the States of California, New York, and Washington as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in each of their respective States and as they request Federal support under the Stafford Act, I am taking the actions set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this memorandum: Sec. 2. One Hundred Percent Federal Cost Share. To maximize assistance to the Governors of the States of California, New York, and Washington to facilitate Federal support with respect to the use of National Guard units under State control, I am directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security to fund 100 percent of the emergency assistance activities associated with preventing, mitigating, and responding to the threat to public health and safety posed by the virus that these States undertake using their National Guard forces, as authorized by sections 403 (42 U.S.C. 5170b) and 503 (42 U.S.C. 5193) of the Stafford Act. Sec. 3. Support of Operations or Missions to Prevent and Respond to the Spread of COVID-19. I am directing the Secretary of Defense, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with mission requirements (including geographic proximity), to request pursuant to 32 U.S.C. 502(f) that the Governors of the States of California, New York, and Washington order National Guard forces to perform duty to fulfill mission assignments, on a fully reimbursable basis, that FEMA issues to the Department of Defense for the purpose of supporting their respective State and local emergency assistance efforts under the Stafford Act. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. [[Page 540]] (d) The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, March 22, 2020. Memorandum of March 28, 2020 Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard To Respond to COVID-19 Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207 (the ``Stafford Act''), and section 502 of title 32, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to take measures to assist State Governors in their responses to all threats and hazards to the American people in their respective States and territories. Considering the profound and unique public health risks posed by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (``the virus''), the need for close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States is greater than at any time in recent history.

All States have activated their Emergency Operations Centers and are working to fight the spread of the virus and attend to those who have symptoms or who are already infected with COVID-19. To provide maximum support to the Governors of the States of Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in each of their respective States and as they request Federal support under the Stafford Act, I am taking the actions set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this memorandum: Sec. 2. One Hundred Percent Federal Cost Share. To maximize assistance to the Governors of the States of Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico to facilitate Federal support with respect to the use of National Guard units under State control, I am directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security to fund 100 percent of the [[Page 541]] emergency assistance activities associated with preventing, mitigating, and responding to the threat to public health and safety posed by the virus that these States and territories undertake using their National Guard forces, as authorized by sections 403 (42 U.S.C. 5170b) and 503 (42 U.S.C. 5193) of the Stafford Act.

Sec. 4. Termination. The 100 percent Federal cost share provided for in this memorandum and in my memorandum dated March 22, 2020 (Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19), shall terminate 30 days from the date of this memorandum. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

[[Page 542]] Notice of March 30, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities On April 1, 2015, by Executive Order 13694, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States. On December 28, 2016, the President issued Executive Order 13757 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694. These significant malicious cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on April 1, 2015, must continue in effect beyond April 1, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, March 30, 2020. Memorandum of March 30, 2020 Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard To Respond to COVID-19 Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207 (the ``Stafford Act''), and section 502 of title 32, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. It is the policy of the United States to take measures to assist State Governors under the Stafford Act in their responses to all threats and hazards to the American people in their respective States and territories. Considering the profound and unique public health risks posed by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (``the virus''), the need for close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States is greater than at any time in recent history. In recognizing this serious public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World [[Page 543]] Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic. On March 13, 2020, I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that SARS-CoV-2 poses to the Nation's healthcare systems. I also determined that same day that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted an emergency, of nationwide scope, pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)). All States have activated their Emergency Operations Centers and are working to fight the spread of the virus and attend to those who have symptoms or who are already infected with COVID-19. To provide maximum support to the Governors of the States of Connecticut, Illinois, and Michigan as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in each of their respective States and as they request Federal support under the Stafford Act, I am taking the actions set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this memorandum: Sec. 2. One Hundred Percent Federal Cost Share. To maximize assistance to the Governors of the States of Connecticut, Illinois, and Michigan to facilitate Federal support with respect to the use of National Guard units under State control, I am directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security to fund 100 percent of the emergency assistance activities associated with preventing, mitigating, and responding to the threat to public health and safety posed by the virus that these States undertake using their National Guard forces, as authorized by sections 403 (42 U.S.C. 5170b) and 503 (42 U.S.C. 5193) of the Stafford Act. Sec. 3. Support of Operations or Missions to Prevent and Respond to the Spread of COVID-19. I am directing the Secretary of Defense, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with mission requirements (including geographic proximity), to request pursuant to 32 U.S.C. 502(f) that the Governors of the States of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Michigan order National Guard forces to perform duty to fulfill mission assignments, on a fully reimbursable basis, that FEMA issues to the Department of Defense for the purpose of supporting their respective State and local emergency assistance efforts under the Stafford Act. Sec. 4. Termination. The 100 percent Federal cost share provided for in this memorandum shall terminate 30 days from the date of this memorandum. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Memorandum of March 30, 2020 Extending the Wind-Down Period for Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security Since March 1991, certain Liberian nationals and persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia (collectively, ``Liberians'') have been eligible for either Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), allowing them to remain in the United States when they would otherwise be removable. In a memorandum dated March 27, 2018, I determined that although conditions in Liberia had improved and no longer warranted a further extension of DED, the foreign policy interests of the United States warranted affording an orderly transition (``wind-down'') period to Liberian DED beneficiaries. In a memorandum dated March 28, 2019, I determined that an additional 12-month wind-down period was appropriate. By the terms of my memorandum, the wind-down period expires on March 30, 2020. In making my determination, I noted that there were efforts underway by Members of Congress to provide legislative relief for Liberian DED beneficiaries, and that extending the wind-down period would give the Congress time to consider the propriety of enacting such legislation. On December 20, 2019, I signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92) (NDAA), which included as section 7611, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision. The LRIF provision provides certain Liberians, including those who have been continuously present in the United States since November 20, 2014, as well as their spouses and children who meet the criteria of the provision, the ability to apply to adjust their status to that of United States lawful permanent resident (LPR). Eligible Liberian nationals have until December 20, 2020, to apply for adjustment of status under the LRIF provision. The LRIF provision, however, did not provide for continued employment authorization past the expiration of the existing DED wind-down period. Once the DED wind-down period expires, most covered Liberians will have no basis upon which to renew or maintain employment authorization before applying to adjust their status. I have, therefore, determined that it is in the foreign policy interests of the United States to extend the DED wind-down period for current Liberian DED beneficiaries through January 10, 2021, to facilitate uninterrupted [[Page 545]] work authorization for those currently in the United States under DED who are eligible to apply for LPR status under the LRIF provision. The relationship between the United States and Liberia is unique. Former African-American slaves were among those who founded the modern state of Liberia in 1847. Since that date, the United States has sought to honor, through bilateral diplomatic partnership, the sacrifices of individuals who suffered grievous wrongs in the United States, but who were determined to build a modern African democracy mirroring America's representative political institutions. As President, I am conscious of this special bond. Providing those Liberians for whom we have long authorized temporary status or deferred enforced departure in the United States, and for whom the Congress has now provided the ability to adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident, with the ability to continue to work to support themselves while they complete the process to adjust their status, honors the historic, close relationship between our two countries and is in the foreign policy interests of the United States. Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to accomplish the following: (1) A continuation of the DED wind-down period through January 10, 2021, during which current Liberian DED beneficiaries who satisfy the description below may remain in the United States; and (2) As part of that wind-down, continued authorization for employment through January 10, 2021, for current Liberian DED beneficiaries who satisfy the description below. This further extension of the wind-down of DED and continued authorization for employment through January 10, 2021, shall apply to any current Liberian DED beneficiary, but shall not apply to Liberians in the following categories: (1) Individuals who would be ineligible for TPS for reasons set forth in section 244(c)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B)); (2) Individuals who sought or seek LPR status under the LRIF provision but whose applications have been or are denied by the Secretary of Homeland Security; (3) Individuals whose removal the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be in the interest of the United States, subject to the LRIF provision; (4) Individuals whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States; (5) Individuals who have voluntarily returned to Liberia or their country of last habitual residence outside the United States beyond the timeframe specified in subsection (c) of the LRIF provision; (6) Individuals who were deported, excluded, or removed before the date of this memorandum; or (7) Individuals who are subject to extradition.

Sec. 3. Support of Operations or Missions to Prevent and Respond to the Spread of COVID-19. I am directing the Secretary of Defense, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with mission requirements (including geographic proximity), to request pursuant to 32 U.S.C. 502(f) that the Governors of the States of Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Vermont order National Guard forces to perform duty to fulfill mission assignments, on a fully reimbursable basis, that FEMA issues to the Department of Defense for the purpose of supporting their respective State and local emergency assistance efforts under the Stafford Act. Sec. 4. Termination. The 100 percent Federal cost share for National Guard forces pursuant to this memorandum is effective for orders of duty of a duration of 31 days or fewer. These orders of duty must be effective no later than 2 weeks from the date of this memorandum. Sec. 5. General Provisions.

Notice of May 7, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of the Government of Syria On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012. The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then- existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have been calling for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including with respect to chemical weapons, supporting terrorist organizations, and obstructing the Lebanese government's ability to function effectively, continue to foster the rise of extremism and sectarianism and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures to deal with that emergency adopted on that date in Executive Order 13338; on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399; on February 13, 2008, in Executive Order 13460; on April 29, 2011, in Executive Order 13572; on May 18, 2011, in Executive Order 13573; on August 17, 2011, in Executive Order 13582; on April 22, 2012, in Executive Order 13606; [[Page 561]] and on May 1, 2012, in Executive Order 13608, must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. In addition, the United States condemns the Assad regime's, and its Russian and Iranian enablers', brutal violence and human rights abuses. The United States calls on the Assad regime and its backers to stop its violent war, enact a nationwide ceasefire, enable the unobstructed delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Syrians in need, and negotiate a political transition in Syria that will forge a credible path along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254. The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 7, 2020. Notice of May 7, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Central African Republic On May 12, 2014, by Executive Order 13667, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic, which has been marked by a breakdown of law and order, intersectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the pervasive, often forced recruitment and use of child soldiers, threatens the peace, security, or stability of the Central African Republic and neighboring states. The situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on May 12, 2014, to deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond May 12, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, May 7, 2020. [[Page 562]] Notice of May 7, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Yemen On May 16, 2012, by Executive Order 13611, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of Yemen and others that threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the political process in Yemen and blocking implementation of the agreement of November 23, 2011, between the Government of Yemen and those in opposition to it, which provided for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people. The actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of Yemen and others in threatening Yemen's peace, security, and stability continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on May 16, 2012, to deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond May 16, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207 (the ``Stafford Act''), and section 502 of title 32, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It continues to be the policy of the United States to foster close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States and territories in the battle against the threat posed by the spread of COVID-19, especially as the United States transitions to a period of increased economic activity and recovery in those areas of the Nation where the threat posed by COVID-19 has been sufficiently mitigated. To date, activated National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to Governors as the Governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective States and territories especially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19, including those in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care or congregate settings. This need to focus efforts to protect especially vulnerable populations from the threat posed by COVID-19 will persist. Therefore, to continue to provide maximum support to the States and territories as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in their respective jurisdictions with respect to combatting the threat posed by COVID-19 and, where appropriate, facilitating their economic recovery, I am taking the actions set forth in section 2 of this memorandum: Sec. 2. Termination and Extension. The 100 percent Federal cost share for the States' and territories' use of National Guard forces authorized pursuant to my prior memoranda dated March 22, 28, and 30, 2020, and April 2, 7, and 13, 2020, each titled ``Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19,'' and my prior memoranda dated April 20 and 28, 2020, and May 8 and 20, 2020, each titled ``Providing Continued Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19 and to Facilitate Economic Recovery,'' shall extend to, and shall be available for orders of any length authorizing duty through August 21, 2020. Such orders include duty necessary to comply with health protection protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the Department of Health and Human Services or other health protection measures agreed to by the Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the Department of Homeland Security. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or [[Page 569]] (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, June 2, 2020. Memorandum of June 4, 2020 Protecting United States Investors From Significant Risks From Chinese Companies Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy[, and] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to ensure the integrity of United States financial markets, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. United States capital markets have long been the driving engine of the global economy. The combination of robust disclosure requirements, clear and effective regulation, fair enforcement, and a free market system have made the United States the premier jurisdiction in the world for raising capital. Investors trust the financial information provided by United States public companies and know that fraudulent activities will promptly be addressed by United States financial regulators. As a result, companies from around the world want to list on United States stock exchanges and raise money in the United States. Chinese companies are no exception. For decades, Chinese companies have availed themselves of the benefits of United States financial markets, and capital raised in the United States has helped fuel China's rapid economic growth. While China reaps advantages from American markets, however, the Chinese government has consistently prevented Chinese companies and companies with significant operations in China from abiding by the investor protections that apply to all companies listing on United States stock exchanges. It is both wrong and dangerous for China to benefit from our capital markets without complying with critical protections that investors in those markets rightfully expect and deserve. China's actions to thwart our transparency laws raise significant risks for investors. The time has [[Page 570]] come to take firm action in an orderly fashion to put an end to the practice that has tacitly permitted companies with significant Chinese operations to flout protections United States law requires for investors in United States markets. For example, the Chinese government refuses to allow audit firms registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to provide audit working papers to the PCAOB so that it can fulfill its statutory obligation to inspect audit work and enforce audit standards. Recently, the Chinese government enacted a statute that expressly prevents audit firms from providing this information without the prior consent of Chinese financial regulators. Preventing the PCAOB from complying with its statutory mandate means that investors cannot have confidence in the financial reports of audited companies and creates significant risks to investors in the securities listed on United States stock exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and PCAOB have pressed China for years to allow companies to provide greater transparency in financial information, to no avail. Concerns about China's efforts to thwart transparency requirements suggest significant risks even for investors in Chinese companies listed on United States stock exchanges. Such companies may not provide appropriate and safe investments for investors, including pension funds, which owe fiduciary duties to their beneficiaries. For these reasons, we must take firm, orderly action to end the Chinese practice of flouting American transparency requirements without negatively affecting American investors and financial markets. We must ensure that laws providing protections for investors in American financial markets are fully enforced for companies listed on United States stock exchanges. Sec. 2. President's Working Group on Financial Markets. Executive Order 12631 of March 18, 1988 (Working Group on Financial Markets), established the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG), which is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, or his designee, and includes the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairman of the SEC, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or their designees. The Secretary of the Treasury shall convene the PWG to discuss the risks to investors described in section 1 of this memorandum and other risks to American investors and financial markets posed by the Chinese government's failure to uphold its international commitments to transparency and accountability and its refusal to permit companies to comply with United States law. Sec. 3. Report. Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the PWG shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, a report that includes: (a) Recommendations for actions the executive branch may take to protect investors in United States financial markets from the failure of the Chinese government to allow PCAOB-registered audit firms to comply with United States securities laws and investor protections; (b) Recommendations for actions the SEC or PCAOB should take, including inspection or enforcement actions, with respect to PCAOB- registered audit firms that fail to provide requested audit working papers or otherwise fail to comply with United States securities laws; and [[Page 571]] (c) Recommendations for additional actions the SEC or any other Federal agency or department should take as a means to protect investors in Chinese companies, or companies from other countries that do not comply with United States securities laws and investor protections, including initiating a notice of proposed rulemaking that would set new listing rules or governance safeguards. Any such actions should take into account the impact on investors and ensure the continued fair and orderly operation of United States financial markets. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, June 4, 2020. Presidential Determination No. 2020-06 of June 5, 2020 Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[, and] the Secretary of Energy By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, after carefully considering the reports submitted to the Congress by the Energy Information Administration, including the report submitted in April 2020, and other relevant factors, including global economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, the global level of spare petroleum production capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, I determine, pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Public Law 112-81, and consistent with prior determinations, that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to [[Page 572]] permit a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions. I will continue to monitor this situation closely. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, June 5, 2020. Notice of June 11, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and Other Persons To Undermine Democratic Processes or Institutions of Belarus On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus's democratic processes or institutions, manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 elections; to commit human rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and disappearances; and to engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority. The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 16, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 11, 2020. [[Page 573]] Notice of June 17, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a national emergency with respect to North Korea pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea. On August 30, 2010, the President signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil United States Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region. On April 18, 2011, the President signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in Executive Order 13551 that would ensure the implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.). On January 2, 2015, the President signed Executive Order 13687 to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as expanded in Executive Order 13551, and addressed further in Executive Order 13570, to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses. On March 15, 2016, the President signed Executive Order 13722 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in [[Page 574]] subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced by its February 7, 2016 launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016 nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. On September 20, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13810 to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missile launches of July 3 and July 28, 2017, and its nuclear test of September 2, 2017; its commission of serious human rights abuses; and its use of funds generated through international trade to support its nuclear and missile programs and weapons proliferation. The existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, addressed further in Executive Order 13570, further expanded in scope in Executive Order 13687, and under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13722, and Executive Order 13810, and the measures taken to deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to North Korea declared in Executive Order 13466. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 17, 2020. Notice of June 24, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western Balkans On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting, (i) extremist violence in [[Page 575]] the former Republic of Macedonia (what is now the Republic of North Macedonia) and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. The President subsequently amended that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with respect to acts obstructing implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 relating to Macedonia. The actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans, including acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans declared in Executive Order 13219. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 24, 2020. Presidential Determination No. 2020-07 of June 24, 2020 Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as Amended Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 4533), I hereby determine, pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act, that the industrial base production capability for ultra-high and high temperature composites for hypersonic, strategic missile, and space launch systems is essential to the national defense. Without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the production capability for ultra-high and high temperature composites for hypersonic, strategic missile, and space launch systems adequately and in a timely manner. Further, purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need for this critical capability. [[Page 576]] You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, June 24, 2020. Memorandum of July 7, 2020 Delegation of Authority Under the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 Memorandum for the Secretary of State By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of State the authority vested in the President by section 1412(c)(2)(A) of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (title I of division F of Public Law 115-254) (the ``Act'') to certify to the appropriate congressional committees that the provision of support under title II of the Act in a less developed country with an upper-middle- income economy furthers the national economic or foreign policy interests of the United States. The delegation in this memorandum shall apply to any provision of any future public law that is the same or substantially the same as the provision referenced in this memorandum. You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, July 7, 2020. Presidential Determination No. 2020-09 of July 17, 2020 Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of Colombia Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, [[Page 577]] that: (1) interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary, because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the national security of that country; and (2) Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which includes effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before the use of force is directed against the aircraft. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and to notify the Congress of this determination. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, July 17, 2020. Memorandum of July 21, 2020 Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Background. In order to apportion Representatives among the States, the Constitution requires the enumeration of the population of the United States every 10 years and grants the Congress the power and discretion to direct the manner in which this decennial census is conducted (U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 2, cl. 3). The Congress has charged the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) with directing the conduct of the decennial census in such form and content as the Secretary may determine (13 U.S.C. 141(a)). By the direction of the Congress, the Secretary then transmits to the President the report of his tabulation of total population for the apportionment of Representatives in the Congress (13 U.S.C. 141(b)). The President, by law, makes the final determination regarding the ``whole number of persons in each State,'' which determines the number of Representatives to be apportioned to each State, and transmits these determinations and accompanying census data to the Congress (2 U.S.C. 2a(a)). The Congress has provided that it is ``the President's personal transmittal of the report to Congress'' that ``settles the apportionment'' of Representatives among the States, and the President's discretion to settle the apportionment is more than ``ceremonial or ministerial'' and is essential ``to the integrity of the process'' (Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 799, and 800 (1992)). The Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base. Although the Constitution requires the ``persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,'' to be enumerated in the census, that requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State's boundaries at the time of the census. Instead, the term ``persons in each [[Page 578]] State'' has been interpreted to mean that only the ``inhabitants'' of each State should be included. Determining which persons should be considered ``inhabitants'' for the purpose of apportionment requires the exercise of judgment. For example, aliens who are only temporarily in the United States, such as for business or tourism, and certain foreign diplomatic personnel are ``persons'' who have been excluded from the apportionment base in past censuses. Conversely, the Constitution also has never been understood to exclude every person who is not physically ``in'' a State at the time of the census. For example, overseas Federal personnel have, at various times, been included in and excluded from the populations of the States in which they maintained their homes of record. The discretion delegated to the executive branch to determine who qualifies as an ``inhabitant'' includes authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status. In Executive Order 13880 of July 11, 2019 (Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection With the Decennial Census), I instructed executive departments and agencies to share information with the Department of Commerce, to the extent permissible and consistent with law, to allow the Secretary to obtain accurate data on the number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the country. As the Attorney General and I explained at the time that order was signed, data on illegal aliens could be relevant for the purpose of conducting the apportionment, and we intended to examine that issue. Sec. 2. Policy. For the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the discretion delegated to the executive branch. Excluding these illegal aliens from the apportionment base is more consonant with the principles of representative democracy underpinning our system of Government. Affording congressional representation, and therefore formal political influence, to States on account of the presence within their borders of aliens who have not followed the steps to secure a lawful immigration status under our laws undermines those principles. Many of these aliens entered the country illegally in the first place. Increasing congressional representation based on the presence of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status would also create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law. States adopting policies that encourage illegal aliens to enter this country and that hobble Federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws passed by the Congress should not be rewarded with greater representation in the House of Representatives. Current estimates suggest that one State is home to more than 2.2 million illegal aliens, constituting more than 6 percent of the State's entire population. Including these illegal aliens in the population of the State for the purpose of apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated. I have accordingly determined that respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base, to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the President's discretion under the law. [[Page 579]] Sec. 3. Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base. In preparing his report to the President under section 141(b) of title 13, United States Code, the Secretary shall take all appropriate action, consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law, to provide information permitting the President, to the extent practicable, to exercise the President's discretion to carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum. The Secretary shall also include in that report information tabulated according to the methodology set forth in Final 2020 Census Residence Criteria and Residence Situations, 83 FR 5525 (Feb. 8, 2018). Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, July 21, 2020. Notice of July 22, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons. [[Page 580]] On March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, I took additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations in view of the evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing sophistication of their activities, which threaten international political and economic systems and pose a direct threat to the safety and welfare of the United States and its citizens, and given the ability of these organizations to derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life as well as many other crimes enriching and empowering these organizations. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond July 24, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 22, 2020. Notice of July 23, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Mali On July 26, 2019, by Executive Order 13882, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in Mali. The situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali; the expansion of terrorist activities into southern and central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and trafficking in persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; and the intensification of attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and security forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and international security presences, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on July 26, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 26, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), [[Page 581]] I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13882 with respect to the situation in Mali. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 23, 2020. Notice of July 29, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Lebanon On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Lebanon pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of certain persons to undermine Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon; or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese sovereignty. Such actions contribute to political and economic instability in that country and the region. Certain ongoing activities, such as Iran's continuing arms transfers to Hizballah--which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems-- serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic instability in the region, and continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Lebanon declared in Executive Order 13441. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, July 29, 2020.

The United States shall also have the right thereafter to restore possession and control to the permittee. In the event that the United States exercises the rights described in this article, it shall pay to the permittee just and fair compensation for the use of such Border facilities, upon the basis of a reasonable profit in normal conditions, and shall bear the cost of restoring the Border facilities to their previous condition, less the reasonable value of any improvements that may have been made by the United States. Article 5.

Memorandum of August 3, 2020 Extension of the Use of the National Guard To Respond to COVID-19 and To Facilitate Economic Recovery Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207 (the ``Stafford Act''), and section 502 of title 32, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It continues to be the policy of the United States to foster close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States and territories in the battle against the threat posed by the spread of COVID-19, especially as the United States transitions to a period of increased economic activity and recovery in those areas of the Nation where the threat posed by COVID-19 has been sufficiently mitigated. To date, activated National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to Governors as the Governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective States and territories especially [[Page 594]] vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19, including those in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care or congregate settings. Additionally, States and territories will need assistance in fighting COVID-19 hot spots as they emerge. Therefore, to continue to provide maximum support to States and territories as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in their respective jurisdictions with respect to combatting the threat posed by COVID-19 and, where appropriate, facilitating their economic recovery, I am taking the actions set forth in sections 2, 3, and 4 of this memorandum: Sec. 2. One Hundred Percent Federal Cost Share Termination.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207 (the ``Stafford Act''), and section 502 of title 32, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It continues to be the policy of the United States to foster close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States and territories in the battle against the threat posed by the spread of COVID-19, especially as the United States transitions to a period of increased economic activity and recovery in those areas of the Nation where the threat posed by COVID-19 has been sufficiently mitigated. To date, activated National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to Governors as the Governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective States and territories especially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19, including those in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care or congregate settings. Additionally, States and territories will need assistance in fighting COVID-19 hot spots as they emerge. Therefore, to continue to provide maximum support to States and territories as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in their respective jurisdictions with respect to combatting the threat posed by COVID-19 and, where appropriate, facilitating their economic recovery, I am taking the actions set forth in section 2 of this memorandum: Sec. 2.

Memorandum of August 8, 2020 Continued Student Loan Payment Relief During the COVID-19 Pandemic Memorandum for the Secretary of Education By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. The 2019 novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing outbreaks of the disease COVID-19, has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency (the ``national emergency''). The same day, I also determined that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted an emergency of nationwide scope, pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)). On March 20, 2020, my Administration took action to provide immediate relief to tens of millions of student loan borrowers during the pandemic caused by COVID-19 by both suspending loan payments and temporarily setting interest rates to 0 percent. This relief has helped many students and parents retain financial stability. And many other Americans have continued to routinely pay down their student loan balances, to more quickly [[Page 603]] eliminate their loans in the long run. During this time, borrowers have been able to determine the best path forward for themselves. The original announcement of this policy specified that it would continue for at least 60 days. In the interim, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act provided this same student loan payment relief, but that program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures. It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. Sec. 2. Extension of Student Loan Payment Relief. (a) In light of the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, the Secretary of Education shall take action pursuant to applicable law to effectuate appropriate waivers of and modifications to the requirements and conditions of economic hardship deferments described in section 455(f)(2)(D) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1087e(f)(2)(D), and provide such deferments to borrowers as necessary to continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education until December 31, 2020. (b) All persons who wish to continue making student loan payments shall be allowed to do so, notwithstanding the deferments provided pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, August 8, 2020. [[Page 604]] Memorandum of August 8, 2020 Deferring Payroll Tax Obligations in Light of the Ongoing COVID-19 Disaster Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated in the People's Republic of China has caused significant, sudden, and unexpected disruptions to the American economy. On March 13, 2020, I determined that the COVID-19 pandemic is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant an emergency declaration under section 501(b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207, and that is still the case today. American workers have been particularly hard hit by this ongoing disaster. While the Department of the Treasury has already undertaken historic efforts to alleviate the hardships of our citizens, it is clear that further temporary relief is necessary to support working Americans during these challenging times. To that end, today I am directing the Secretary of the Treasury to use his authority to defer certain payroll tax obligations with respect to the American workers most in need. This modest, targeted action will put money directly in the pockets of American workers and generate additional incentives for work and employment, right when the money is needed most. Sec. 2. Deferring Certain Payroll Tax Obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed to use his authority pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7508A to defer the withholding, deposit, and payment of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3101(a), and so much of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3201 as is attributable to the rate in effect under 26 U.S.C. 3101(a), on wages or compensation, as applicable, paid during the period of September 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, subject to the following conditions: (a) The deferral shall be made available with respect to any employee the amount of whose wages or compensation, as applicable, payable during any bi-weekly pay period generally is less than $4,000, calculated on a pre-tax basis, or the equivalent amount with respect to other pay periods. (b) Amounts deferred pursuant to the implementation of this memorandum shall be deferred without any penalties, interest, additional amount, or addition to the tax. Sec. 3. Authorizing Guidance. The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue guidance to implement this memorandum. Sec. 4. Tax Forgiveness. The Secretary of the Treasury shall explore avenues, including legislation, to eliminate the obligation to pay the taxes deferred pursuant to the implementation of this memorandum. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. [[Page 605]] (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, August 8, 2020. Notice of August 13, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Export Control Regulations On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222 pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). In that order, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States related to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.). Because the implementation of certain sanctions authorities, including sections 11A, 11B, and 11C of such Export Administration Act of 1979, consistent with section 1766(b) of Public Law 115-232 (50 U.S.C. 4601 note), is to be carried out under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, August 13, 2020. [[Page 606]] Order of August 14, 2020 Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd. By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C. 4565, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Findings. (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance Ltd., an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (``ByteDance''), through acquiring all interests in musical.ly, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (``Musical.ly''), might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States. As a result of the acquisition, ByteDance merged its TikTok application with Musical.ly's social media application and created a single integrated social media application; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Sec. 2. Actions Ordered and Authorized. On the basis of the findings set forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors described in subsection (f) of section 721, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that: (a) The transaction resulting in the acquisition by ByteDance of Musical.ly, to the extent that Musical.ly or any of its assets is used in furtherance or support of, or relating to, Musical.ly's activities in interstate commerce in the United States (``Musical.ly in the United States''), is hereby prohibited, and ownership by ByteDance of any interest in Musical.ly in the United States, whether effected directly or indirectly through ByteDance, or through ByteDance's subsidiaries, affiliates, or Chinese shareholders, is also prohibited. (b) In order to effectuate this order, not later than 90 days after the date of this order, unless such date is extended for a period not to exceed 30 days, on such written conditions as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) may impose, ByteDance, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders, shall divest all interests and rights in: (i) any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States, as determined by the Committee; and (ii) any data obtained or derived from TikTok application or Musical.ly application users in the United States. Immediately upon divestment, ByteDance shall certify in writing to CFIUS that all steps necessary to fully and permanently effectuate the actions required under sections 2(a) and 2(b) have been completed. (c) Immediately upon divestment, ByteDance shall certify in writing to CFIUS that it has destroyed all data that it is required to divest pursuant to section 2(b)(ii), as well as all copies of such data wherever located, and [[Page 607]] CFIUS is authorized to require auditing of ByteDance on terms it deems appropriate in order to ensure that such destruction of data is complete. (d) ByteDance shall not complete a sale or transfer under section 2(b) to any third party: (i) until ByteDance notifies CFIUS in writing of the intended recipient or buyer; and (ii) unless 10 business days have passed from the notification in section 2(d)(i) and CFIUS has not issued an objection to ByteDance. Among the factors CFIUS may consider in reviewing the proposed sale or transfer are whether the buyer or transferee: is a U.S. citizen or is owned by U.S. citizens; has or has had a direct or indirect contractual, financial, familial, employment, or other close and continuous relationship with ByteDance, or its officers, employees, or shareholders; and can demonstrate a willingness and ability to support compliance with this order. In addition, CFIUS may consider whether the proposed sale or transfer would threaten to impair the national security of the United States or undermine the purpose of this order, and whether the sale effectuates, to CFIUS's satisfaction and in its discretion, a complete divestment of all tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support the operation of the TikTok application in the United States. (e) From the date of this order until ByteDance provides a certification of divestment to CFIUS pursuant to section 2(b), ByteDance and TikTok Inc., a Delaware corporation, shall certify to CFIUS on a weekly basis that they are in compliance with this order and include a description of efforts to divest the interests and rights described in section 2(b) and a timeline for projected completion of remaining actions. (f) Any transaction or other device entered into or employed for the purpose of, or with the effect of, evading or circumventing this order is prohibited. (g) Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, and until such time as the divestment is completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, CFIUS is authorized to implement measures it deems necessary and appropriate to verify compliance with this order and to ensure that the operations of the TikTok application are carried out in such a manner as to ensure protection of the national security interests of the United States. Such measures may include the following: on reasonable notice to ByteDance and TikTok Inc., employees of the United States Government, as designated by CFIUS, shall be permitted access, for purposes of verifying compliance with this order, to all premises and facilities of ByteDance and TikTok Inc., and any of their respective subsidiaries, operated in furtherance of the TikTok application located in the United States: (i) to inspect and copy any books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of ByteDance or TikTok Inc., or any of their respective subsidiaries, that concern any matter relating to this order; (ii) to inspect or audit any information systems, networks, hardware, software, data, communications, or property in the possession or under [[Page 608]] the control of ByteDance or TikTok Inc., or any of their respective subsidiaries; and (iii) to interview officers, employees, or agents of ByteDance or TikTok Inc., or any of their respective subsidiaries, concerning any matter relating to this order. CFIUS shall conclude its verification procedures within 90 days after the certification of divestment is provided to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. (h) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person of circumstances, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements. (i) The Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order. Sec. 3. Reservation. I hereby reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to ByteDance, Musical.ly, Musical.ly in the United States, and TikTok Inc. as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security.

You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, September 2, 2020. [[Page 612]] Space Policy Directive-5 of September 4, 2020 Cybersecurity Principles for Space Systems Memorandum for the Vice President[,] the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Attorney General[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[,] the Director of the National Security Agency[,] the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[,] the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff[, and] the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Section 1. Background. The United States considers unfettered freedom to operate in space vital to advancing the security, economic prosperity, and scientific knowledge of the Nation. Space systems enable key functions such as global communications; positioning, navigation, and timing; scientific observation; exploration; weather monitoring; and multiple vital national security applications. Therefore, it is essential to protect space systems from cyber incidents in order to prevent disruptions to their ability to provide reliable and efficient contributions to the operations of the Nation's critical infrastructure. Space systems are reliant on information systems and networks from design conceptualization through launch and flight operations. Further, the transmission of command and control and mission information between space vehicles and ground networks relies on the use of radio-frequency- dependent wireless communication channels. These systems, networks, and channels can be vulnerable to malicious activities that can deny, degrade, or disrupt space operations, or even destroy satellites. Examples of malicious cyber activities harmful to space operations include spoofing sensor data; corrupting sensor systems; jamming or sending unauthorized commands for guidance and control; injecting malicious code; and conducting denial-of-service attacks. Consequences of such activities could include loss of mission data; decreased lifespan or capability of space systems or constellations; or the loss of positive control of space vehicles, potentially resulting in collisions that can impair systems or generate harmful orbital debris. The National Security Strategy of December 2017 states that ``[t]he United States must maintain our leadership and freedom of action in space.'' As the space domain is contested, it is necessary for developers, manufacturers, owners, and operators of space systems to design, build, operate, and manage them so that they are resilient to cyber incidents and radio-frequency spectrum interference. Space Policy Directive-3 (SPD-3) of June 18, 2018 (National Space Traffic Management Policy), states that ``[s]atellite and constellation owners should participate in a pre-launch certification process'' that should consider a number of factors, including encryption of satellite command and control links and data protection measures for ground site operations. [[Page 613]] The National Cyber Strategy of September 2018 states that my Administration will enhance efforts to protect our space assets and supporting infrastructure from evolving cyber threats, and will work with industry and international partners to strengthen the cyber resilience of existing and future space systems. Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this memorandum, the following definitions shall apply: (a) ``Space System'' means a combination of systems, to include ground systems, sensor networks, and one or more space vehicles, that provides a space-based service. A space system typically has three segments: a ground control network, a space vehicle, and a user or mission network. These systems include Government national security space systems, Government civil space systems, and private space systems. (b) ``Space Vehicle'' means the portion of a space system that operates in space. Examples include satellites, space stations, launch vehicles, launch vehicle upper stage components, and spacecraft. (c) ``Positive Control'' means the assurance that a space vehicle will only execute commands transmitted by an authorized source and that those commands are executed in the proper order and at the intended time. (d) ``Critical space vehicle functions (critical functions)'' means the functions of the vehicle that the operator must maintain to ensure intended operations, positive control, and retention of custody. The failure or compromise of critical space vehicle functions could result in the space vehicle not responding to authorized commands, loss of critical capability, or responding to unauthorized commands. Sec. 3. Policy. Cybersecurity principles and practices that apply to terrestrial systems also apply to space systems. Certain principles and practices, however, are particularly important to space systems. For example, it is critical that cybersecurity measures, including the ability to perform updates and respond to incidents remotely, are integrated into the design of the space vehicle before launch, as most space vehicles in orbit cannot currently be physically accessed. For this reason, integrating cybersecurity into all phases of development and ensuring full life-cycle cybersecurity are critical for space systems. Effective cybersecurity practices arise out of cultures of prevention, active defense, risk management, and sharing best practices. The United States must manage risks to the growth and prosperity of our commercial space economy. To do so and to strengthen national resilience, it is the policy of the United States that executive departments and agencies (agencies) will foster practices within Government space operations and across the commercial space industry that protect space assets and their supporting infrastructure from cyber threats and ensure continuity of operations. The cybersecurity principles for space systems set forth in section 4 of this memorandum are established to guide and serve as the foundation for the United States Government approach to the cyber protection of space systems. Agencies are directed to work with the commercial space industry and other non-government space operators, consistent with these principles [[Page 614]] and with applicable law, to further define best practices, establish cybersecurity-informed norms, and promote improved cybersecurity behaviors throughout the Nation's industrial base for space systems. Sec. 4. Principles. (a) Space systems and their supporting infrastructure, including software, should be developed and operated using risk-based, cybersecurity-informed engineering. Space systems should be developed to continuously monitor, anticipate, and adapt to mitigate evolving malicious cyber activities that could manipulate, deny, degrade, disrupt, destroy, surveil, or eavesdrop on space system operations. Space system configurations should be resourced and actively managed to achieve and maintain an effective and resilient cyber survivability posture throughout the space system lifecycle. (b) Space system owners and operators should develop and implement cybersecurity plans for their space systems that incorporate capabilities to ensure operators or automated control center systems can retain or recover positive control of space vehicles. These plans should also ensure the ability to verify the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of critical functions and the missions, services, and data they enable and provide. At a minimum, space system owners and operators should consider, based on risk assessment and tolerance, incorporating in their plans: (i) Protection against unauthorized access to critical space vehicle functions. This should include safeguarding command, control, and telemetry links using effective and validated authentication or encryption measures designed to remain secure against existing and anticipated threats during the entire mission lifetime; (ii) Physical protection measures designed to reduce the vulnerabilities of a space vehicle's command, control, and telemetry receiver systems; (iii) Protection against communications jamming and spoofing, such as signal strength monitoring programs, secured transmitters and receivers, authentication, or effective, validated, and tested encryption measures designed to provide security against existing and anticipated threats during the entire mission lifetime; (iv) Protection of ground systems, operational technology, and information processing systems through the adoption of deliberate cybersecurity best practices. This adoption should include practices aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework to reduce the risk of malware infection and malicious access to systems, including from insider threats. Such practices include logical or physical segregation; regular patching; physical security; restrictions on the utilization of portable media; the use of antivirus software; and promoting staff awareness and training inclusive of insider threat mitigation precautions; (v) Adoption of appropriate cybersecurity hygiene practices, physical security for automated information systems, and intrusion detection methodologies for system elements such as information systems, antennas, terminals, receivers, routers, associated local and wide area networks, and power supplies; and (vi) Management of supply chain risks that affect cybersecurity of space systems through tracking manufactured products; requiring sourcing [[Page 615]] from trusted suppliers; identifying counterfeit, fraudulent, and malicious equipment; and assessing other available risk mitigation measures. (c) Implementation of these principles, through rules, regulations, and guidance, should enhance space system cybersecurity, including through the consideration and adoption, where appropriate, of cybersecurity best practices and norms of behavior. (d) Space system owners and operators should collaborate to promote the development of best practices, to the extent permitted by applicable law. They should also share threat, warning, and incident information within the space industry, using venues such as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to the greatest extent possible, consistent with applicable law. (e) Security measures should be designed to be effective while permitting space system owners and operators to manage appropriate risk tolerances and minimize undue burden, consistent with specific mission requirements, United States national security and national critical functions, space vehicle size, mission duration, maneuverability, and any applicable orbital regimes. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, September 4, 2020. [[Page 616]] Memorandum of September 4, 2020 Delegation of Certain Functions and Authorities Under the Global Fragility Act of 2019 Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Energy[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Director of National Intelligence[, and] the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Commerce, the Director of National Intelligence, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the functions and authorities vested in the President by sections 504(a) and (c) of the Global Fragility Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-94). The delegation in this memorandum shall apply to any provisions of any future public laws that are the same or substantially the same as those provisions referenced in this memorandum. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, September 4, 2020. Presidential Determination No. 2020-10 of September 9, 2020 Continuation of the Exercise of Certain Authorities Under the Trading With the Enemy Act Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of the Treasury Under section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. 4305 note), and a previous determination on September 13, 2019 (84 FR 49189, September 18, 2019), the exercise of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act is scheduled to expire on September 14, 2020. I hereby determine that the continuation of the exercise of those authorities with respect to Cuba for 1 year is in the national interest of the United States. Therefore, consistent with the authority vested in me by section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223, I continue for 1 year, until September 14, 2021, the exercise of those authorities with respect to Cuba, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 515. [[Page 617]] The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, September 9, 2020. Notice of September 10, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States. Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2020. Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, in response to certain terrorist attacks. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 10, 2020. Notice of September 10, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Foreign Interference in or Undermining Public Confidence in the United States Elections On September 12, 2018, by Executive Order 13848, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the threat of foreign interference in or undermining public confidence in United States elections. Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the outcomes or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America's free and open political system. In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope [[Page 618]] and intensity of the threat of foreign interference. The ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections, including through the unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on September 12, 2018, must continue in effect beyond September 12, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13848 with respect to the threat of foreign interference in or undermining public confidence in United States elections. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 10, 2020. Presidential Determination No. 2020-11 of September 16, 2020 Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2021 Memorandum for the Secretary of State By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. A country's presence on the foregoing list is not necessarily a reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or major illicit drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (Public Law 87-195) (FAA), the reason countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control measures. Illicit drugs inflict enormous harm on the health and safety of the American people and threaten the national security of the United States. While my Administration has achieved steady progress in stemming the tide of our country's drug epidemic, transnational criminal organizations continually challenge our success by violating our borders and flooding our homeland with these deadly substances. [[Page 619]] The United States is taking the fight to these criminal organizations and their enablers on an unprecedented scale. This April, I initiated the most significant counternarcotic operations in decades targeting the illicit drug trade in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific by deploying U.S. military assets to U.S. Southern Command in cooperation with 22 international allies. These operations led to the seizure of more than 80 metric tons of cocaine and other dangerous drugs, depriving transnational criminal organizations of more than $1.8 billion in profits and putting drug kingpins on notice that they are squarely in the crosshairs of the United States. The most complicit kingpin in this Hemisphere is the Venezuelan dictator, Nicolas Maduro. This March, a U.S. court indicted Maduro for narcoterrorism and conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United States. In response, the U.S. Department of State announced a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction. He joined a multitude of other regime cronies who are either under U.S. indictment or were sanctioned for drug crimes by the Department of the Treasury. The United States will continue to support the Venezuelan people, Interim President Juan Guaido, and the democratically elected National Assembly, and will work together with the legitimate Interim Government of Venezuela to stop drug trafficking and root out the criminal elements that have exploited that country. Maduro's illegitimate narco-regime should face justice for its crimes. While bringing criminals like Maduro to justice remains an urgent priority, the United States also needs other governments in the Western Hemisphere to assume greater responsibility for reducing illegal drug supplies. In Colombia, President Ivan Duque and his government remain strong partners of the United States, and Colombian police and military forces have shown great bravery and commitment by targeting high-level drug traffickers, interdicting drug shipments, and manually eradicating coca. Nevertheless, coca cultivation and cocaine production remain at unacceptably high levels. To reach our shared 5-year goal to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production by half by the end of 2023, Colombia must move forward with resuming aerial eradication, which remains an irreplaceable tool in the government's arsenal alongside manual eradication and alternative economic development. It is also of great concern that coca cultivation and cocaine production remain near historical highs in Peru, another longstanding U.S. ally. Peru is a valued law enforcement partner of the United States and has demonstrated continuing commitment to fighting all aspects of the drug trade. I call on the Peruvian government to resume eradication operations in the country's high yield coca producing regions, including the Valley of the Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers. Since the resignation of former President Evo Morales in November 2019, U.S.-Bolivian cooperation against drug trafficking networks has increased under Bolivia's transitional government. The transitional government made important strides in drug interdiction and resumed processing extradition requests of drug traffickers by the United States. Nevertheless, coca cultivation continues to exceed legal limits under Bolivia's own domestic laws for medicinal and traditional use, and the Bolivian state has taken insufficient measures to safeguard the country's licit coca markets from criminal exploitation. If the Bolivian government, including its Legislative Assembly, takes [[Page 620]] sufficient steps in the year ahead to remedy these shortcomings and continues the progress made over the past 10 months under the transitional government, I will consider removing Bolivia from next year's list of countries that have failed demonstrably to uphold their drug control responsibilities. Last year, I warned that I would consider determining Mexico had failed demonstrably to uphold its international drug control commitments if it did not intensify its efforts to increase poppy eradication, interdict illicit drugs before they cross the border into the United States, increase its prosecutions of drug traffickers and seize their assets, and develop a comprehensive drug control strategy. This year, Mexico successfully passed asset forfeiture reforms, increased extraditions of dangerous drug traffickers to the United States, made substantial progress in completing its first poppy yield study in 17 years, and produced a counterdrug strategy. While these are signs of progress, more must be done. Mexico remains the source of nearly all heroin and methamphetamine seized in the United States, and a transit route for most of the cocaine available in our country. Moreover, Mexican cartels take advantage of uneven precursor chemical controls in Mexico to manufacture deadly drugs, such as fentanyl, inside Mexico and smuggle them into the United States. Mexican drug interdictions remain far too low in the face of these critical drug threats. These cartels present a clear threat to Mexico and the Mexican government's ability to exert effective control over parts of its country. Mexico must clearly demonstrate its commitment to dismantling the cartels and their criminal enterprises and do more to protect the lives of Mexican and American citizens threatened by these groups. Mexico needs to continue to extradite key criminal actors, step up comprehensive investigations and drug and asset seizures, and implement a robust data-based poppy eradication program tied to sustainable alternative development. The Mexican government should acknowledge the alarming trend of fentanyl production inside its territory. It must prioritize law enforcement action targeting cartel production and trafficking of fentanyl--the leading substance involved in drug overdose deaths in the United States--and strengthen efforts targeting fentanyl precursor chemicals overwhelmingly trafficked from China, as well as fentanyl smuggling and production. More must also be done to target the cartels' increasing production of methamphetamine. The United States remains ready to deepen its partnership with Mexico to address these shared challenges and welcomes the opportunity to develop joint drug control goals with Mexico and bilateral investigations built on transparent and open sharing of investigative information and evidence leading to successful prosecutions. Many Mexican military and law enforcement professionals, in cooperation with their U.S. counterparts, are bravely confronting the transnational criminal organizations that threaten both of our countries. Unless the Mexican government demonstrates substantial progress in the coming year backed by verifiable data, Mexico will be at serious risk of being found to have failed demonstrably to uphold its international drug control commitments. Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela as having failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations [[Page 621]] under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the measures required by section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included with this determination are justifications for the designations of Bolivia and the Maduro regime, as required by section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA. I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that United States programs that support the legitimate interim government in Venezuela and the Bolivian government are vital to the national interests of the United States.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, September 16, 2020. Notice of September 18, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, the President declared a national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks against United States nationals or the United States. On September 9, 2019, I signed Executive Order 13886 to strengthen and consolidate sanctions to combat the continuing threat posed by international terrorism and to take additional steps to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224. The actions of persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, as amended, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism declared in Executive Order 13224, as amended. [[Page 622]] This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, September 18, 2020.

The permittee is a private corporation organized under the laws of the Government of Alberta, Canada, and registered in the State of Alaska. Permission is hereby granted to the permittee to construct, connect, operate, and maintain certain railway Border facilities, as described herein, at the international border of the United States and Canada at Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska, in the Ladue River Valley at 63[deg]15'N and 141[deg]W, approximately 45 miles due north over land from the Alcan Border Crossing on Alaska Route 2 (also known as the Alaska Highway) and approximately 60 miles due east over land from the town of Tok, Alaska. This permit does not affect the applicability of any otherwise relevant laws and regulations. As confirmed in Article 2 below, the Border facilities shall remain subject to all such laws and regulations. The term ``Facilities,'' as used in this permit, means the portion in the United States of the ``Alaska to Alberta Railway'' project associated with the permittee's application for a Presidential permit filed on September 6, 2019, and any land, structures, installations, or equipment appurtenant thereto.

The Border facilities herein described, and all aspects of their operation, shall be subject to all the conditions, provisions, and requirements of this permit and any subsequent Presidential amendment to it. This permit may be terminated, revoked, or amended at any time at the sole discretion of the President of the United States (the ``President''), with or without [[Page 623]] advice provided by any executive department or agency (agency). The permittee shall make no substantial change in the Border facilities, in the location of the Border facilities, or in the operation authorized by this permit unless the President has approved the change in an amendment to this permit or in a new permit. Article 2. The standards for, and the manner of, construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Border facilities shall be subject to inspection by the representatives of appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies. Officers and employees of such agencies who are duly authorized and performing their official duties shall be granted free and unrestricted access to said Border facilities by the permittee. The Border facilities, including the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Border facilities, shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing railway safety or issued or administered by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Article 3. Upon the termination, revocation, or surrender of this permit, unless otherwise decided by the President, the permittee, at its own expense, shall remove the Border facilities within such time as the President may specify. If the permittee fails to comply with an order to remove, or to take such other appropriate action with respect to, the Border facilities, the President may direct an appropriate official or agency to take possession of the Border facilities--or to remove the Border facilities or take other action--at the expense of the permittee. The permittee shall have no claim for damages caused by any such possession, removal, or other action. Article 4. When, in the judgment of the President, ensuring the national security of the United States requires entering upon and taking possession of any of the Border facilities or parts thereof, and retaining possession, management, or control thereof for such a length of time as the President may deem necessary, the United States shall have the right to do so, provided that the President or his designee has given due notice to the permittee. The United States shall also have the right thereafter to restore possession and control to the permittee. In the event that the United States exercises the rights described in this article, it shall pay to the permittee just and fair compensation for the use of such Border facilities, upon the basis of a reasonable profit in normal conditions, and shall bear the cost of restoring the Border facilities to their previous condition, less the reasonable value of any improvements that may have been made by the United States. Article 5. Any transfer of ownership or control of the Border facilities, or any part thereof, or any changes to the name of the permittee, shall be immediately communicated in writing to the President or his designee, and shall include information identifying any transferee. Notwithstanding any such transfers or changes, this permit shall remain in force subject to all of its conditions, permissions, and requirements, and any amendments thereto, unless subsequently terminated, revoked, or amended by the President.

[[Page 624]] (2) The permittee shall hold harmless and indemnify the United States from any claimed or adjudged liability arising out of construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities, including environmental contamination from the release, threatened release, or discharge of hazardous substances or hazardous waste. (3) To ensure the safe operation of the Border facilities, the permittee shall maintain them and every part of them in a condition of good repair and in compliance with applicable law. Article 7.

The provision of such facilities shall include, to the extent deemed necessary by such agencies, the transfer of title to any such facilities (including the site) to the United States. The inspection facilities shall meet the latest agency design standards and any operational requirements, including facilities for the Rail-Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems, inspection and office space, personnel parking and restrooms, utilities, and an access road. To the extent authorized by law, the permittee shall be responsible for any ongoing maintenance or necessary improvements to the inspection facilities, including to comply with updated agency design standards, and for the full cost of providing services at such facilities. Article 8. The permittee shall file with the President or his designee, and with appropriate agencies, such sworn statements or reports with respect to the Border facilities, or the permittee's activities and operations in connection therewith, as are now, or may hereafter, be required under any law or regulation of the United States Government or its agencies. These reporting obligations do not alter the intent that this permit be operative as a directive issued by the President alone. Article 9. Upon request, the permittee shall provide appropriate information to the President or his designee with regard to the Border facilities. Such requests could include, for example, information concerning current conditions or anticipated changes in ownership or control, construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities. Article 10. The permittee shall provide written notice to the President or his designee at the time that the construction authorized by this permit begins, at such time as such construction is completed, interrupted, or discontinued, and at other times as may be requested by the President. Article 11. The permittee shall provide written notice to the President or his designee describing any material investment in the Facilities, direct or indirect, by non-Canadian foreign investors of any kind, including individuals, corporations or other non-governmental entities, and governmental entities. Such written notice shall be provided at such time as an agreement for any such investment is entered into, or 30 days before any such investment is made, whichever is earlier, and at other times as may be requested by the President. Article 12. This permit shall expire 10 years from the date of its issuance if the permittee has not commenced construction of the Border facilities by that date. [[Page 625]] Article 13. This permit is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees or agents, or any other person.

If the permittee fails to comply with an order to remove, or to take such other appropriate action with respect to, the Border facilities, the President may direct an appropriate official or agency to take possession of the Border facilities--or to remove the Border facilities or take other action--at the expense of the permittee. The permittee shall have no claim for damages caused by any such possession, removal, or other action. [[Page 634]] Article 4. When, in the judgment of the President, ensuring the national security of the United States requires entering upon and taking possession of any of the Border facilities or parts thereof, and retaining possession, management, or control thereof for such a length of time as the President may deem necessary, the United States shall have the right to do so, provided that the President or his designee has given due notice to the permittee. The United States shall also have the right thereafter to restore possession and control to the permittee. In the event that the United States exercises the rights described in this article, it shall pay to the permittee just and fair compensation for the use of such Border facilities, upon the basis of a reasonable profit in normal conditions, and shall bear the cost of restoring the Border facilities to their previous condition, less the reasonable value of any improvements that may have been made by the United States. Article 5. Any transfer of ownership or control of the Border facilities, or any part thereof, or any changes to the name of the permittee, shall be immediately communicated in writing to the President or his designee, and shall include information identifying any transferee. Notwithstanding any such transfers or changes, this permit shall remain in force subject to all of its conditions, permissions, and requirements, and any amendments thereto, unless subsequently terminated, revoked, or amended by the President. Article 6. (1) The permittee is responsible for acquiring any right-of- way grants or easements, permits, and other authorizations as may become necessary or appropriate. (2) The permittee shall hold harmless and indemnify the United States from any claimed or adjudged liability arising out of construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities, including environmental contamination from the release, threatened release, or discharge of hazardous substances or hazardous waste. (3) To ensure the safe operation of the Border facilities, the permittee shall maintain them and every part of them in a condition of good repair and in compliance with applicable law. Article 7. The permittee shall file with the President or his designee, and with appropriate agencies, such sworn statements or reports with respect to the Border facilities, or the permittee's activities and operations in connection therewith, as are now, or may hereafter, be required under any law or regulation of the United States Government or its agencies. These reporting obligations do not alter the intent that this permit be operative as a directive issued by the President alone. Article 8. Upon request, the permittee shall provide appropriate information to the President or his designee with regard to the Border facilities. Such requests could include, for example, information concerning current conditions or anticipated changes in ownership or control, construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities. Article 9. This permit is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, [[Page 635]] in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 3, 2020. Notice of October 8, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in and in Relation to Syria On October 14, 2019, by Executive Order 13894, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to Syria. The situation in and in relation to Syria, and in particular the actions by the Government of Turkey to conduct a military offensive into northeast Syria, undermines the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers civilians, and further threatens to undermine the peace, security, and stability in the region, and continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on October 14, 2019, must continue in effect beyond October 14, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 with respect to the situation in and in relation to Syria. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 8, 2020.

TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, October 14, 2020. Notice of October 19, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States and abroad. The actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and cause an extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 21, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia declared in Executive Order 12978. [[Page 638]] This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 19, 2020. Notice of October 23, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Democratic Republic of the Congo On October 27, 2006, by Executive Order 13413, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), ordered related measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict in that country. The President took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities and continues to threaten regional stability. The President took additional steps to address this national emergency in Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014. The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, as amended by Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 27, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared in Executive Order 13413, as amended by Executive Order 13671. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 23, 2020. [[Page 639]] Memorandum of October 26, 2020 Certification Pursuant to Section 6(E) of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-497), as Amended by the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344) Pursuant to section 6(e) of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-497), as amended by the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344), I hereby certify that the Government of Sudan has taken demonstrable steps to: (A) ensure that the armed forces of Sudan and any associated militias are not committing atrocities or obstructing human rights monitors or the provision of humanitarian assistance; (B) demobilize and disarm militias supported or created by the Government of Sudan; (C) allow full and unfettered humanitarian assistance to all regions of Sudan, including the Darfur region; (D) allow an international commission of inquiry to conduct an investigation of atrocities in the Darfur region, in a manner consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 (September 18, 2004), to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in the Darfur region by all parties, to determine also whether or not acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with a view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable; (E) cooperate fully with the African Union, the United Nations, and all other observer, monitoring, and protection missions mandated to operate in Sudan; (F) permit the safe and voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes and rebuild the communities destroyed in the violence; and (G) implement the final agreements reached in the Naivasha peace process and install a new coalition government based on the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this Certification in the Federal Register, along with the accompanying Memorandum of Justification. [[Page 640]] MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S CERTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 6(E) OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN SUDAN ACT OF 2004 (Pub.L. 108-497), AS AMENDED BY THE DARFUR PEACE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2006 (Pub.L. 109-344) Pursuant to section 6(e) of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 (Pub.L. 108-497), as amended by the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Pub.L. 109-344), the President has certified that the Government of Sudan has taken demonstrable steps in accordance with section 12(a)(2) of the Sudan Peace Act of 2002, as amended, (Pub.L. 107-245). While the Administration will continue to press for further progress, including with regard to human rights-related concerns involving the security services, the justification for this certification, set forth below, represents a series of demonstrable steps meeting the requirements of that provision. The Government of Sudan, most recently under the leadership of the Civilian-Led Transitional Government (CLTG) has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to ensure that the armed forces of Sudan and any associated militias are not committing atrocities or obstructing human rights monitors or the provision of humanitarian assistance: The CLTG, through the adoption of a Constitutional Declaration on August 17, 2019, has committed to respect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms; address the root causes of conflict; establish accountability mechanisms for the security forces; and conduct security sector reform. The CLTG signed an agreement on September 25, 2019, with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to allow the opening of a UN Human Rights Office in Khartoum and field offices in Darfur, Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan, and East Sudan. The Khartoum office was subsequently opened. In September 2019, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs instructed all Sudanese government entities to remove all restrictions on humanitarian access, including any pre-approval requirements for travel. The Government of Sudan has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to demobilize and disarm militias supported or created by the Government of Sudan: On July 14, 2011, the Government of Sudan signed a protocol agreement committing itself to the terms of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which included a commitment on the part of the government to disarm and disband all militia groups in Darfur. In accordance with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, the Government of Sudan worked with the United Nations--African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur to demobilize over 10,000 former combatants from across Darfur. The Government of Sudan collaborated with the United Nations-- African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur in a region-wide arms collection campaign in 2018 in line with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur. The Government of Sudan created the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)--a Government of Sudan security force--into which elements of former militias supported or created by the Government of Sudan were incorporated. In 2017, the Rapid Support Forces Act integrated the RSF into [[Page 641]] the Sudan Armed Forces. The Constitutional Declaration, signed in August 2019, declares the Sovereignty Council the Supreme Commander of the RSF and describes it and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) as ``national military institutions.'' The Government of Sudan has ceased support to certain private militias, and we have no evidence of ongoing support. The Government of Sudan has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to allow full and unfettered humanitarian assistance to all regions of Sudan, including the Darfur region: In September 2019, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok agreed with the United Nations that his government would ensure unfettered humanitarian access. The CLTG has issued directives to provide unfettered humanitarian access to all parts of Sudan. In October 2019, the Humanitarian Aid Commission informed the humanitarian community that all restrictions on humanitarian access had been lifted. The Humanitarian Aid Commission issued instructions to this effect to relevant local and provincial entities. Humanitarian groups report that these directives have had the net effect of easing significantly their access to many parts of Sudan, including in Darfur, and have allowed them to access areas of the country that were previously inaccessible to them. Prime Minister Hamdok worked with humanitarian agencies to obtain permission for the first cross-border deliveries of humanitarian assistance into armed opposition-held areas of South Kordofan. The CLTG has prioritized negotiation of humanitarian access in its ongoing discussions with armed opposition groups. The Government of Sudan has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to allow an international commission of inquiry to conduct an investigation of atrocities in the Darfur region, in a manner consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 (September 18, 2004), to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in the Darfur region by all parties, to determine also whether or not acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with a view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable: The Government of Sudan facilitated the work of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur between November 2004 and January 2005, including through regular meetings with the Commission, permitting the Commission to travel and hold meetings in Khartoum and Darfur, and permitting the work of the Commission's investigative team in Darfur from November 2004 to January 2005. The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur presented its final report to the UN Secretary General on January 25, 2005. The CLTG, through the adoption of a Constitutional Declaration on August 17, 2019, has committed to holding accountable under the law those responsible for all crimes committed against the Sudanese people since 1989, and beginning the implementation of measures of transitional justice and accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including bringing perpetrators before national and international courts under the principle of no impunity. [[Page 642]] The Government of Sudan has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to cooperate fully with the African Union, the United Nations, and all other observer, monitoring, and protection missions mandated to operate in Sudan: The Government of Sudan engages regularly with the United Nations--African Union Hybrid Assistance Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and is working to facilitate its operations. The CLTG is cooperating with the United Nations, the African Union, and the other stakeholders in the deployment of the UN Integrated Assistance Mission in Sudan, (UNITAMS), the follow-on UN Special Political Mission that will likely replace UNAMID. The Government of Sudan has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to permit the safe and voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes and rebuild the communities destroyed in the violence: On July 14, 2011, the Government of Sudan signed a protocol agreement committing itself to the terms of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which included a commitment on the part of the government to facilitate voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes, to restore their property, and to compensate them for any losses. The CLTG, through the adoption of a Constitutional Declaration on August 17, 2019, has committed to work to address the root causes of conflict and marginalization; to include as fundamental issues in peace negotiations with the armed opposition groups the compensation and return of property to victims, the reconstruction of areas affected by war, and the voluntary return and sustainable solutions for issues of IDPs and refugees; and to work to achieve comprehensive agreements with armed opposition groups. The Government of Sudan, the Government of Chad, and UNHCR signed two Tripartite Agreements in April 2018, the first of which establishes the modalities for the voluntary return of Chadian refugees in Sudan, and the second for the voluntary return of Sudanese refugees in Chad. The CLTG launched negotiations with armed opposition groups of the Sudan Revolutionary Front in October 2019 and has finalized seven of eight protocols of a final peace agreement and continues to work towards a comprehensive peace agreement with other armed opposition groups. According to a 2020 OCHA report, nearly 300,000 Sudanese refugees have returned to Sudan. The Government of Sudan has taken the following demonstrable steps, among others, to implement the final agreements reached in the Naivasha peace process and install a new coalition government based on the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004: The Government of Sudan signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) on January 9, 2005. [[Page 643]] The Government of Sudan formed the Government of National Unity in September 2005, followed by a January 2011 referendum, leading to the creation of the independent nation of South Sudan on July 9, 2011. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, October 26, 2020. Presidential Determination No. 2021-02 of October 27, 2020 Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021 Memorandum for the Secretary of State By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the ``Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), after appropriate consultations with the Congress, and consistent with the Report on Proposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 submitted to the Congress on September 30, 2020, I hereby determine and authorize as follows: The admission of up to 15,000 refugees to the United States during FY 2021 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest. This refugee admissions ceiling incorporates more than 6,000 unused places from the FY 2020 refugee admissions ceiling that might have been used if not for the COVID-19 pandemic. Refugee admissions during FY 2021 shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the following allocations: 1. Refugees who: have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of religion; or are within a category of aliens established under subsections (b) and (c) of section 599D of Title V, Public Law 101-167, as amended (the Lautenberg and Refugees who are within a category of aliens listed in section 1243(a) of the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, Title XII, Div. A, Public Refugees who are nationals or habitual residents of El Salvador, Guatemala, or refugees in the following groups: those referred to the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) by a United States Embassy in any location; [[Page 644]] those who will be admitted through a Form I-730 following-to-join petition or who gain access to the USRAP for family reunification through the P-3 process; those currently located in Australia, Nauru, or Papua New Guinea who gain access to the USRAP pursuant to an arrangement between the United States and Australia; those who are nationals or habitual residents of Hong Kong, Venezuela, or Cuba; and those in the USRAP who were in ``Ready for Departure'' status as after consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Attorney General, and upon notification to the appropriate committees of the Congress, you are further authorized to transfer unused admissions from a particular allocation above to one or more other allocations, if there is a need for greater admissions for the allocation to which the admissions will be transferred. Additionally, I specify that persons from certain high-risk areas of terrorist presence or control, including Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, shall not be admitted as refugees, except those refugees of special humanitarian concern: (1) who have been persecuted or have a well- founded fear of persecution on account of religion; (2) were referred to the USRAP by a United States Embassy in any location; or (3) who will be admitted through a Form I-730 following-to-join petition or who gain access to the USRAP for family reunification through the P-3 process. The threat to United States national security and public safety posed by the admission of refugees from high-risk areas of terrorist presence or control is significant and cannot be fully mitigated at this time. Consistent with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)), and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify that, for FY 2021, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States within their countries of nationality or habitual residence: a. persons in Cuba; b. persons in Eurasia and the Baltics; c. persons in Iraq; d. persons in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador; and e. in exceptional circumstances, persons identified by a United States Embassy in any location. Consistent with section 412(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2)), I also specify that, for FY 2021, newly admitted refugees should be placed, to the maximum extent possible, in States and localities that have clearly expressed their willingness to receive refugees under the Department of State's Reception and Placement Program. Such cooperation ensures that refugees are resettled in communities that are eager and equipped to support their successful integration into American society and the labor force. [[Page 645]] Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601(b)), I hereby determine that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States, and I accordingly designate such persons for this purpose. You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, October 27, 2020. Notice of October 30, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, by Executive Order 13400, the President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, and ordered the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the Darfur region. On October 13, 2006, by Executive Order 13412, the President took additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 and expanded in Executive Order 13400. In Executive Order 13412, the President also took steps to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344). On January 13, 2017, by Executive Order 13761, the President found that positive efforts by the Government of Sudan between July 2016 and January 2017 improved certain conditions that Executive Orders 13067 and 13412 were intended to address. Given these developments, and in order to encourage the Government of Sudan to sustain and enhance these efforts, section 1 of Executive Order 13761 provided that sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 would be revoked as of July 12, 2017, provided that the criteria in section 12(b) of Executive Order 13761 had been met. On July 11, 2017, by Executive Order 13804, I amended Executive Order 13761, extending until October 12, 2017, the effective date in section 1 of Executive Order 13761. On October 12, 2017, pursuant to Executive Order 13761, as amended by Executive Order 13804, sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 were revoked. [[Page 646]] Despite recent positive developments, the crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997; the expansion of that emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006; and, with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July 11, 2017, has not been resolved. These actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as expanded by Executive Order 13400, with respect to Sudan. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, October 30, 2020. Memorandum of October 31, 2020 Protecting Jobs, Economic Opportunities, and National Security for All Americans by Ensuring Appropriate Support of Innovative Technologies for Using Our Domestic Natural Resources Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Attorney General[,] the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of Agriculture[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Energy[,] the United States Trade Representative[,] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs[,] the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy[,] the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[,] the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality[, and] the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following: Section 1. Purpose. This memorandum sets forth policies related to protecting American jobs, economic opportunities, and national security by ensuring appropriate support of hydraulic fracturing and other innovative technologies for the use of domestic natural resources, including energy resources. In support of these policies, this memorandum directs certain officials to assess the potential effects of efforts to ban or restrict the use of such technologies. [[Page 647]] Sec. 2. Background. Our country has been favored with abundant land, wildlife, and natural resources. Americans have rightly seen this abundance as both an opportunity and a responsibility. Our blessings have rightly been a great source of national pride and gratitude. As we enjoy these bounties, we are also bound by a responsibility of stewardship to use, protect, and preserve them for future generations. Among the greatest of our blessings are our energy resources, which all too often we take for granted. Our Nation has untold potential to deliver energy to provide us with the necessities--light, heat, cold, food, and water, to say nothing of modern telecommunications--for our daily lives at home and at work, and our travel from place to place. Reliable, affordable energy is essential for running our homes, businesses, farms, factories, health care facilities, and schools, and is critical to every sector of our economy, including our energy- intensive and trade-exposed industries. Access to dependable, inexpensive sources of energy is a cornerstone of our well-being, of our economic strength and global competitiveness, and of our national security. One of the great success stories of our time has been the development of hydraulic fracturing (often known as ``fracking'') and other technologies to facilitate the extraction of natural resources from the earth. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that provides access to reservoirs of natural gas and petroleum by opening rocks deep underground. When coupled with horizontal drilling and other new technologies, fracking has opened up new sources of inexpensive, reliable, abundant energy for our country. It has also produced jobs and economic opportunities for many Americans. In a report issued in October 2019, the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated that by lowering energy prices, the use of fracking and other innovations had saved United States consumers $203 billion per year, or $2,500 in annual savings for a family of four. These savings disproportionately benefit low-income households, which spend a larger share of their income on energy bills, representing 6.8 percent of income for the poorest fifth of households compared to 1.3 percent for the richest fifth of households. The CEA estimated that greater productivity had reduced the domestic price of natural gas by 63 percent as of 2018; had led to a 45 percent decrease in the wholesale price of electricity; and had reduced the global price of oil by 10 percent as of 2019. The transformation wrought by technologies such as fracking is not only the result of America's natural abundance and Americans' capacity for scientific discovery and practical invention. It is also a testament to our Nation's greatest resource: our hardworking men and women. Energy workers have dedicated their lives to an industry that is essential to the modern world, and their labors have demonstrated their talent, perseverance, and courage. Even in the midst of this unprecedented pandemic, essential energy workers have continued to ensure that our Nation has the energy that it needs to survive and to flourish. We owe these workers our gratitude. We also owe them appropriate respect and support for their careers, their livelihoods, and their families. It should be emphasized that technologies such as fracking--when used lawfully and responsibly, with appropriate attention to environmental, health, and safety protections--are vital not just to our domestic prosperity [[Page 648]] but also to our national security. Shortly after I entered office, I issued Executive Order 13783 of March 28, 2017 (Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth), which directed an immediate review of all agency actions that potentially burdened the development or use of domestic energy resources. That order also rescinded certain actions of the previous Administration that, in my judgment, were not consistent with the national interest and the Nation's geopolitical security. As a result of new technologies and my Administration's continued push for energy independence, our country recently became a net energy exporter for the first time since 1952, as well as the leading producer of oil and natural gas in the world. We are no longer beholden to foreign countries upon which we had depended for decades for the survival of our way of life. This achievement is a great accomplishment for our country, which should not be taken for granted. Now that we have achieved a dominant position in energy production, powerful voices in the United States, echoed by countries such as China and Russia, are clamoring for policies that would undermine that position, forgetting the very real costs and risks of energy dependence. Some of these voices call for using legislative or regulatory mechanisms to ban, or sharply restrict, the use of fracking and other technologies. In my view, such proposals are not responsible and would be harmful to the economic and national security of the United States. Sec. 3. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively protect and enhance American jobs, economic opportunities, and national security for all Americans by ensuring appropriate support of innovative technologies for using our domestic natural resources more efficiently and responsibly, including environmental protection and restoration technologies. Before taking actions that may jeopardize such innovation, responsible officials should carefully consider the impacts on American citizens. Sec. 4. Assessing the Domestic and Economic Impacts of Undermining Hydraulic Fracturing and Other Technologies. (a) Within 70 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (who shall act in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs), assessing: (i) the economic impacts of prohibiting, or sharply restricting, the use of hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, including the following: (A) any loss of jobs, wages, benefits, and other economic opportunities by Americans who work in or are indirectly benefited by the energy industry and other industries (including mining for sand and other minerals); (B) any increases in energy prices (including the prices of gasoline, electricity, heating, and air conditioning) for Americans (including senior citizens and other persons on fixed incomes) and businesses; (C) any decreases in property values and in the royalties and other revenues that are currently available to private property owners; and (D) any decreases in tax revenues, impact fees, royalties, and other revenues currently available to the Federal Government, to State and local [[Page 649]] governments, and to civic institutions (including public schools, trade and vocational schools, community colleges, and other educational and training institutions; hospitals; and medical clinics); (ii) the trade impacts of prohibiting, or sharply restricting, the use of hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, including impacts on United States exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other energy products, as well as exports of other commodities that may be affected by increases in transportation costs; and (iii) such other domestic or economic impacts as the Secretary of Energy deems appropriate. (b) In preparing the report described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Energy and the United States Trade Representative shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chairman of CEA, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and such other officials as the Secretary of Energy and the United States Trade Representative deem appropriate. Sec. 5. Assessing the National Security Impacts of Undermining Hydraulic Fracturing and Other Technologies. Within 70 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Energy shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (who shall act in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy), assessing the national security impacts of prohibiting, or sharply restricting, the use of hydraulic fracturing and other technologies. This report shall include an assessment of potential impacts on Russian and Chinese energy production, consumption, and trade activities, and on the energy security of United States allies, that may be attributable to changes in United States exports of LNG and other energy products. In preparing this report, the Secretary of Energy shall consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative, and such other officials as the Secretary of Energy deems appropriate. This report may be combined, as appropriate, with the report required by section 4 of this memorandum, in which case the combined report shall be submitted to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. Sec. 6. Reinforcing Executive Order 13211. (a) Executive Order 13211 of May 18, 2001 (Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use) provides that agencies ``shall prepare'' detailed Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain agency actions that are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. Such Statements ``shall describe'' ``any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use (including a shortfall in supply, price increases, and increased use of foreign supplies) should the proposal be implemented'' and ``reasonable alternatives to the action with adverse energy effects and the expected effects of such alternatives on energy supply, distribution, and use.'' In order to enhance compliance with Executive Order 13211, I direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), to review the record of compliance with that [[Page 650]] order by agencies (as defined in that order) and to provide new guidance, as appropriate, concerning the implementation of and compliance with that order. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of OMB shall, as appropriate, identify for the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (who shall act in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs), agencies on which the Administrator of OIRA intends to focus attention to ensure robust compliance with Executive Order 13211. Sec. 7. Definition. For purposes of this memorandum, the terms ``hydraulic fracturing'' and ``fracking'' shall have the meaning assigned to ``hydraulic fracturing'' in 40 C.F.R. 60.5430. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) The Secretary of Energy is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, October 31, 2020.

[[Page 652]] Notice of November 12, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burundi On November 22, 2015, by Executive Order 13712, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in Burundi, which has been marked by the killing of and violence against civilians, unrest, the incitement of imminent violence, and significant political repression, and which threatens the peace, security, and stability of Burundi and the region. I commend the new government and the people of Burundi for the recent historic peaceful transfer of power and encourage the new government to continue to engage with the United States and other countries to address the underlying actions and policies of the Government of Burundi that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13712. At this time, however, I have not seen sufficient evidence that the situation is resolved. As such, the situation in Burundi continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 22, 2015, to deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond November 22, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burundi declared in Executive Order 13712. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, November 12, 2020. Notice of November 12, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. Our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is ongoing. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am [[Page 653]] continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12170. The emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 is distinct from the emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 on March 15, 1995. This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of March 12, 2020. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, November 12, 2020. Notice of November 12, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, by Executive Order 13094, the President amended Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the worldwide threat of proliferation activities related to weapons of mass destruction. On June 28, 2005, by Executive Order 13382, the President, among other things, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability to combat proliferation activities related to weapons of mass destruction. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons must continue beyond November 14, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, November 12, 2020. [[Page 654]] Notice of November 24, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in Nicaragua On November 27, 2018, by Executive Order 13851, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in Nicaragua. The situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega regime's systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, as well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua's economy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 27, 2018, must continue in effect beyond November 27, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 with respect to the situation in Nicaragua. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, November 24, 2020.

References. This directive supersedes Presidential Policy Directive-4 (June 29, 2010) and references, promotes, and reemphasizes the following policy directives and memoranda: a) Presidential Policy Directive 26--National Space Transportation Policy (November 21, 2013) b) Executive Order 13803--Reviving the National Space Council (June 30, 2017) c) Space Policy Directive 1--Reinvigorating America's Human Space Exploration Program (December 11, 2017) d) The National Space Strategy (March 23, 2018) e) Space Policy Directive 2--Streamlining Regulations on Commercial Use of Space (May 24, 2018) f) Space Policy Directive 3--National Space Traffic Management Policy (June 18, 2018) g) Space Policy Directive 4--Establishment of the United States Space Force (February 19, 2019) h) National Security Presidential Memorandum 20--Launch of Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems (August 20, 2019) i) Executive Order 13906--Amending Executive Order 13803--Reviving the National Space Council (February 13, 2020) j) Executive Order 13905--Strengthening National Resilience Through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services (February 12, 2020) k) Executive Order 13914--Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources (April 6, 2020) l) Space Policy Directive 5--Cybersecurity Principles for Space Systems (September 4, 2020) Sec. 2. Principles. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that space operations are consistent with the following principles. 1. It is the shared interest of all nations to act responsibly in space to ensure the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of space activities. Responsible space actors operate with openness, transparency, and predictability to maintain the benefits of space for all humanity. [[Page 659]] 2. A robust, innovative, and competitive commercial space sector is the source of continued progress and sustained United States leadership in space. The United States remains committed to encouraging and facilitating the continued growth of a domestic commercial space sector that is globally competitive, supports national interests, and advances United States leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven entrepreneurship. 3. In this resurgent era of space exploration, the United States will expand its leadership alongside nations that share its democratic values, respect for human rights, and economic freedom. Those values will extend with us to all space destinations as the United States once again steps beyond Earth, starting with the Moon and continuing to Mars. 4. As established in international law, outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means. The United States will pursue the extraction and utilization of space resources in compliance with applicable law, recognizing those resources as critical for sustainable exploration, scientific discovery, and commercial operations. 5. All nations have the right to explore and to use space for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humanity, in accordance with applicable law. Consistent with that principle, the United States will continue to use space for national security activities, including for the exercise of the inherent right of self-defense. Unfettered access and freedom to operate in space is a vital national interest. 6. The United States considers the space systems of all nations to have the right to pass through and conduct operations in space without interference. Purposeful interference with space systems, including supporting infrastructure, will be considered an infringement of a nation's rights. Consistent with the defense of those rights, the United States will seek to deter, counter, and defeat threats in the space domain that are hostile to the national interests of the United States and its allies. Any purposeful interference with or an attack upon the space systems of the United States or its allies that directly affects national rights will be met with a deliberate response at a time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing. Sec. 3. Goals. The United States shall: 1. Promote and incentivize private industry to facilitate the creation of new global and domestic markets for United States space goods and services, and strengthen and preserve the position of the United States as the global partner of choice for international space commerce. 2. Encourage and uphold the rights of nations to use space responsibly and peacefully by developing and implementing diplomatic, economic, and security capabilities and strategies to identify and respond to behaviors that threaten those rights. 3. Lead, encourage, and expand international cooperation on mutually beneficial space activities that broaden and extend the benefits of space for all humanity; further the exploration and use of space for peaceful purposes; protect the interests of the United States, its allies, and partners; advance United States interests and values; and enhance access to space-derived information and services. [[Page 660]] 4. Create a safe, stable, secure, and sustainable environment for space activities, in collaboration with industry and international partners, through the development and promotion of responsible behaviors; improved practices for the collection and sharing of information on space objects; protection of critical space systems and supporting infrastructures, with special attention to cybersecurity and supply chains; and measures to mitigate orbital debris. 5. Increase the assurance of national critical functions enabled by commercial, civil, scientific, and national security spacecraft and supporting infrastructure against disruption, degradation, and destruction through the development and fielding of materiel and non- materiel capabilities and rehearsal of continuity of operations practices. 6. Extend human economic activity into deep space by establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon, and, in cooperation with private industry and international partners, develop infrastructure and services that will enable science-driven exploration, space resource utilization, and human missions to Mars. 7. Increase the quality of life for all humanity through the cultivation, maturation, and development of space-enabled scientific and economic capabilities, including space and Earth resource discovery, management, and utilization; space and Earth weather and environmental monitoring and prediction; disaster monitoring, prediction, response, and recovery; and planetary defense. 8. Preserve and expand United States leadership in the development of innovative space technologies, services, and operations. Work with likeminded international and private partners, to prevent the transfer of sensitive space capabilities to those who threaten the interests of the United States, its allies, and its supporting industrial base. Sec. 4. Cross-sector Space Policy Guidelines. The heads of all executive departments and agencies (agencies), consistent with their respective missions and authorities, shall execute the guidance provided in this section consistent with applicable law.

Notice of December 16, 2020 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Serious Human Rights Abuse and Corruption On December 20, 2017, by Executive Order 13818, the President declared a national emergency with respect to serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world and, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on December 20, 2017, must continue in effect beyond December 20, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 with respect to serious human rights abuse and corruption. [[Page 681]] This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, December 16, 2020. Space Policy Directive-6 of December 16, 2020 National Strategy for Space Nuclear Power and Propulsion Memorandum for the Vice President[,] the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Energy[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission[, and] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy Section 1. Policy. The ability to use space nuclear power and propulsion (SNPP) systems safely, securely, and sustainably is vital to maintaining and advancing United States dominance and strategic leadership in space. SNPP systems include radioisotope power systems (RPSs) and fission reactors used for power or propulsion in spacecraft, rovers, and other surface elements. SNPP systems can allow operation of such elements in environments in which solar and chemical power are inadequate. They can produce more power at lower mass and volume compared to other energy sources, thereby enabling persistent presence and operations. SNPP systems also can shorten transit times for crewed and robotic spacecraft, thereby reducing radiation exposure in harsh space environments. National Security Presidential Memorandum-20 (NSPM-20) of August 20, 2019 (Launch of Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems), updated the process for launches of spacecraft containing space nuclear systems. It established it as the policy of the United States to ``develop and use space nuclear systems when such systems safely enable or enhance space exploration or operational capabilities.'' Cooperation with commercial and international partners is critical to achieving America's objectives for space exploration. Presidential Policy Directive 4 of June 28, 2010 (National Space Policy), as amended by the Presidential Memorandum of December 11, 2017 (Reinvigorating America's Human Space Exploration Program), established it as the policy of the United States to ``[l]ead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system and to bring back to Earth new knowledge and opportunities.'' This memorandum establishes a national strategy to ensure the development and use of SNPP systems when appropriate to enable and achieve the scientific, exploration, national security, and commercial objectives of the United States. In the context of this strategy only, the term ``development'' includes the full development process from design through testing and production, and the term ``use'' includes launch, operation, and disposition. [[Page 682]] This memorandum outlines high-level policy goals and a supporting roadmap that will advance the ability of the United States to use SNPP systems safely, securely, and sustainably. The execution of this strategy will be subject to relevant budgetary and regulatory processes and to the availability of appropriations. Sec. 2. Goals. The United States will pursue goals for SNPP development and use that are both mission-enabling and ambitious in their substance and their timeline. These goals will enable a range of existing and future space missions, with the aim of accelerating achievement of key milestones, including in-space demonstration and use of new SNPP capabilities. This memorandum establishes the following such goals for the Nation: (a) Develop uranium fuel processing capabilities that enable production of fuel that is suitable to lunar and planetary surface and in-space power, nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) applications, as needed. These capabilities should support the ability to produce different uranium fuel forms to meet the nearest-term mission needs and, to the extent feasible, should maximize commonality--meaning use of the same or similar materials, processes, designs, or infrastructure--across these fuel forms. To maximize private-sector engagement and cost savings, these capabilities should be developed to enable a range of terrestrial as well as space applications, including future commercial applications; (b) Demonstrate a fission power system on the surface of the Moon that is scalable to a power range of 40 kilowatt-electric (kWe) and higher to support a sustained lunar presence and exploration of Mars. To the extent feasible, this power system should align with mission needs for, and potential future government and commercial applications of, in- space power, NEP, and terrestrial nuclear power; (c) Establish the technical foundations and capabilities--including through identification and resolution of the key technical challenges-- that will enable options for NTP to meet future Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) mission requirements; and (d) Develop advanced RPS capabilities that provide higher fuel efficiency, higher specific energy, and longer operational lifetime than existing RPS capabilities, thus enabling survivable surface elements to support robotic and human exploration of the Moon and Mars and extending robotic exploration of the solar system. Sec. 3. Principles. The United States will adhere to principles of safety, security, and sustainability in its development and use of SNPP systems, in accordance with all applicable Federal laws and consistent with international obligations and commitments. (a) Safety. All executive departments and agencies (agencies) involved in the development and use of SNPP systems shall take appropriate measures to ensure, within their respective roles and responsibilities, the safe development, testing, launch, operation, and disposition of SNPP systems. For United States Government SNPP programs, the sponsoring agency holds primary responsibility for safety. For programs involving multiple agencies, the terms of cooperation shall designate a lead agency with primary responsibility for safety in each stage of development and use. [[Page 683]] (i) Ground development. Activities associated with ground development, including ground testing, of SNPP systems shall be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and existing authorities of regulatory agencies. (ii) Launch. NSPM-20 established safety guidelines and safety analysis and review processes for Federal Government launches of spacecraft containing space nuclear systems, including SNPP systems, and for launches for which the Department of Transportation has statutory authority to license as commercial space launch activities (commercial launches). These guidelines and processes address launch and any subsequent stages during which accidents may result in radiological effects on the public or the environment--for instance, in an unplanned reentry from Earth orbit or during an Earth flyby. Launch activities shall be conducted in accordance with these guidelines and processes. (iii) Operation and disposition. The operation and disposition of SNPP systems shall be planned and conducted in a manner that protect human and environmental safety and national security assets. Fission reactor SNPP systems may be operated on interplanetary missions, in sufficiently high orbits, and in low-Earth orbits if they are stored in sufficiently high orbits after the operational part of their mission. In this context, a sufficiently high orbit is one in which the orbital lifetime of the spacecraft is long enough for the fission products to decay to a level of radioactivity comparable to that of uranium-235 by the time it reenters the Earth's atmosphere, and the risks to existing and future space missions and of collision with objects in space are minimized. Spacecraft operating fission reactors in low-Earth orbits shall incorporate a highly reliable operational system to ensure effective and controlled disposition of the reactor. (b) Security. All agencies involved in the development and use of SNPP systems shall take appropriate measures to protect nuclear and radiological materials and sensitive information, consistent with sound nuclear nonproliferation principles. For United States Government SNPP programs, the sponsoring agency holds primary responsibility for security. For programs involving multiple agencies, the terms of cooperation shall designate a lead agency with primary responsibility for security in each stage of development and use. The use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in SNPP systems should be limited to applications for which the mission would not be viable with other nuclear fuels or non-nuclear power sources. Before selecting HEU or, for fission reactor systems, any nuclear fuel other than low-enriched uranium (LEU), for any given SNPP design or mission, the sponsoring agency shall conduct a thorough technical review to assess the viability of alternative nuclear fuels. The sponsoring agency shall provide to the respective staffs of the National Security Council, the National Space Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Office of Management and Budget a briefing that provides justification for why the use of HEU or other non-LEU fuel is required, and any steps the agency has taken to address nuclear safety, security, and proliferation-related risks. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall ensure, through the National Science and Technology Council, that other relevant agencies are invited to participate in these briefings. (c) Sustainability. All agencies involved in the development and use of SNPP systems shall take appropriate measures to conduct these activities [[Page 684]] in a manner that is suitable for the long-term sustainment of United States space capabilities and leadership in SNPP. (i) Coordination and Collaboration. To maximize efficiency and return on taxpayer investment, the heads of relevant agencies shall seek and pursue opportunities to coordinate among existing and future SNPP development and use programs. Connecting current efforts with likely future applications will help ensure that such programs can contribute to long-term United States SNPP capabilities and leadership. Agencies also shall seek opportunities to partner with the private sector, including academic institutions, in order to facilitate contributions to United States SNPP capabilities and leadership. To help identify opportunities for collaboration, the heads of relevant agencies should conduct regular technical exchanges among SNPP programs, to the extent that such exchanges are consistent with the principle of security and comply with applicable Federal, State, and local laws. Agencies shall coordinate with the Department of State when seeking opportunities for international partnerships. (ii) Commonality. The heads of relevant agencies shall seek to identify and use opportunities for commonality among SNPP systems, and between SNPP and terrestrial nuclear systems, whenever doing so could advance program and policy objectives without unduly inhibiting innovation or market development, or hampering system suitability to specific mission applications. For example, opportunities for commonality may exist in goals (e.g., demonstration timeline), reactor design, nuclear fuels (e.g., fuel type and form, and enrichment level), supplementary systems (e.g., power conversion, moderator, reflector, shielding, and system vessel), methods (e.g., additive manufacturing of fuel or reactor elements), and infrastructure (e.g., fuel supply, testing facilities, launch facilities, and workforce). (iii) Cost-effectiveness. The heads of relevant agencies should pursue SNPP development and use solutions that are cost-effective while also consistent with the principles of safety and security. For any program or system, the heads of such agencies should seek to identify the combination of in-space and ground-based testing and certification that will best qualify the system for a given mission while ensuring public safety. Sec. 4. Roles and Responsibilities. (a) The Vice President, on behalf of the President and acting through the National Space Council, shall coordinate United States policy related to use of SNPP systems. (b) The Secretary of State shall, under the direction of the President, coordinate United States activities related to international obligations and commitments and international cooperation involving SNPP. (c) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct and support activities associated with development and use of SNPP systems to enable and achieve United States national security objectives. When appropriate, the Secretary of Defense shall facilitate private-sector engagement in DoD SNPP activities. (d) The Secretary of Commerce shall promote responsible United States commercial SNPP investment, innovation, and use, and shall, when consistent with the authorities of the Secretary, ensure the publication of clear, flexible, performance-based rules that are applicable to use of SNPP and are easily navigated. Under the direction of the Secretary of Commerce, the Department of Commerce (DOC) shall ascertain and communicate the views [[Page 685]] of private-sector partners and potential private-sector partners to relevant agency partners in order to facilitate public-private collaboration in SNPP development and use. (e) The Secretary of Transportation's statutory authority includes licensing commercial launches and reentries, including vehicles containing SNPP systems. Within this capacity, the Secretary of Transportation shall, when appropriate, facilitate private-sector engagement in the launch or reentry aspect of SNPP development and use activities, in support of United States science, exploration, national security, and commercial objectives. To help ensure the launch safety of an SNPP payload, and consistent with 51 U.S.C. 50904, a payload review may be conducted as part of a license application review or may be requested by a payload owner or operator in advance of or apart from a license application. (f) The Secretary of Energy shall, in coordination with sponsoring agencies and other agencies, as appropriate, support development and use of SNPP systems to enable and achieve United States scientific, exploration, and national security objectives. When appropriate, the Secretary of Energy shall work with sponsoring agencies and DOC to facilitate United States private-sector engagement in Department of Energy (DOE) SNPP activities. Under the direction of the Secretary of Energy and consistent with the authorities granted to DOE, including authorities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011, et seq., DOE may authorize ground-based SNPP development activities, including DOE activities conducted in coordination with sponsoring agencies and private-sector entities. As directed in NSPM-20, the Secretary of Energy shall maintain, on a full-cost recovery basis, the capability and infrastructure to develop, furnish, and conduct safety analyses for space nuclear systems for use in United States Government space systems. (g) The Administrator of NASA shall conduct and support activities associated with development and use of SNPP systems to enable and achieve United States space science and exploration objectives. The Administrator of NASA shall establish the performance requirements for SNPP capabilities necessary to achieve those objectives. When appropriate, the Administrator of NASA shall facilitate private-sector engagement in NASA SNPP activities, and shall coordinate with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, to help facilitate private-sector SNPP activities. (h) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has statutory authority under the AEA for licensing and regulatory safety and security oversight of commercial nuclear activities taking place within the United States. The NRC should, as appropriate and particularly in circumstances within NRC authority where DOE regulatory authorities cannot be applied, enable private-sector engagement in SNPP development and use activities in support of United States science, exploration, national security, and commercial objectives. (i) The Director of the Office and Science and Technology Policy shall coordinate United States policy related to research and development of SNPP systems. Sec. 5. Roadmap. The United States will pursue a coordinated roadmap for federally-supported SNPP activities to achieve the goals and uphold the principles established in this memorandum. This roadmap comprises the [[Page 686]] following elements, which the relevant agencies should pursue consistent with the following objective timeline, subject to relevant budgetary and regulatory processes and to the availability of appropriations: (a) By the mid-2020s, develop uranium fuel processing capabilities that enable production of fuel that is suitable for lunar and planetary surface and in-space power, NEP, and NTP applications, as needed.

DoD and NASA should provide to DOE any mission needs (e.g., power density, environment, and timelines) relevant to the identification of fuels suitable for planetary surface and in-space power, NEP, and NTP applications. (ii) Identify candidate fuel or fuels. DoD and NASA, in cooperation with DOE and private-sector partners, as appropriate, should identify candidate fuel or fuels to meet the identified mission requirements. This review and assessment should account for current and expected United States capabilities to produce and qualify for use candidate fuels, and for potential commonality of fuels or fuel variants across multiple planetary surface and in-space power, in-space propulsion, and terrestrial applications. (iii) Qualify at least one candidate fuel. DoD and NASA, in cooperation with DOE and private-sector partners, as appropriate, should qualify a fuel or fuels for demonstrations of a planetary surface power reactor and an in- space propulsion system. While seeking opportunities to use private-sector- partner capabilities, agencies should ensure that the Federal Government retains an ability for screening and qualification of candidate fuels. (iv) Supply fuel for demonstrations. DOE, in cooperation with NASA and DoD, and with private-sector partners, as appropriate, should identify feedstock and uranium that can be made available for planetary surface power and in- space propulsion demonstrations. DOE shall ensure that any provision of nuclear material for SNPP will not disrupt enriched uranium supplies for the United States nuclear weapons program and the naval propulsion program, and that SNPP needs are included among broader considerations of nuclear fuel supply provisioning and management. (b) By the mid- to late-2020s, demonstrate a fission power system on the surface of the Moon that is scalable to a power range of 40 kWe and higher to support sustained lunar presence and exploration of Mars. (i) Initiate a surface power project. NASA should initiate a fission surface power project for lunar surface demonstration by 2027, with scalability to Mars exploration. NASA should consult with DoD and other agencies, and with the private sector, as appropriate, when developing project requirements. (ii) Conduct technology and requirements assessment. NASA, in coordination with DoD and other agencies, and with private-sector partners, as appropriate, should evaluate technology options for a surface power system including reactor designs, power conversion, shielding, and thermal management. NASA should work with other agencies, and private-sector partners, as appropriate, to evaluate opportunities for commonality among other SNPP needs, including in-space power and terrestrial power [[Page 687]] needs, possible NEP technology needs, and reactor demonstrations planned by NASA, other agencies, or the private sector. (iii) Engage the private sector. DOE and NASA should determine a mechanism or mechanisms for engaging with the private sector to meet NASA's SNPP surface power needs in an effective manner consistent with the guiding principles set forth in this memorandum. In evaluating mechanisms, DOE and NASA should consider the possibility of NASA issuing a request for proposal for the development and construction of the surface power reactor system or demonstration. (iv) System development. NASA should work with DOE, and with other agencies and private-sector partners, as appropriate, to develop the lunar surface power demonstration project. (v) Conduct demonstration mission. NASA, in coordination with other agencies and with private-sector partners, as appropriate, should launch and conduct the lunar surface power demonstration project.

Article 3. Upon the termination, revocation, or surrender of this permit, unless otherwise decided by the President, the permittee, at its own expense, shall remove the Border facilities within such time as the President may specify. If the permittee fails to comply with an order to remove, or to take such other appropriate action with respect to, the Border facilities, the President may direct an appropriate official or agency to take possession of the Border facilities--or to remove the Border facilities or take other action--at the expense of the permittee. The permittee shall have no claim for damages caused by any such possession, removal, or other action. Article 4. When, in the judgment of the President, ensuring the national security of the United States requires entering upon and taking possession of any of the Border facilities or parts thereof, and retaining possession, management, or control thereof for such a length of time as the President [[Page 690]] may deem necessary, the United States shall have the right to do so, provided that the President or his designee has given due notice to the permittee. The United States shall also have the right thereafter to restore possession and control to the permittee. In the event that the United States exercises the rights described in this article, it shall pay to the permittee just and fair compensation for the use of such Border facilities, upon the basis of a reasonable profit in normal conditions, and shall bear the cost of restoring the Border facilities to their previous condition, less the reasonable value of any improvements that may have been made by the United States. Article 5. Any transfer of ownership or control of the Border facilities, or any part thereof, or any changes to the name of the permittee, shall be immediately communicated in writing to the President or his designee, and shall include information identifying any transferee. Notwithstanding any such transfers or changes, this permit shall remain in force subject to all of its conditions, permissions, and requirements, and any amendments thereto, unless subsequently terminated, revoked, or amended by the President. Article 6. (1) The permittee is responsible for acquiring any right-of- way grants or easements, permits, and other authorizations as may become necessary or appropriate. (2) The permittee shall hold harmless and indemnify the United States from any claimed or adjudged liability arising out of construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities, including environmental contamination from the release, threatened release, or discharge of hazardous substances or hazardous waste. (3) To ensure the safe operation of the Border facilities, the permittee shall maintain them and every part of them in a condition of good repair and in compliance with applicable law. Article 7. To the extent authorized by law, and consistent with Donation Acceptance Agreements (DAAs) already executed with the permittee under the Donation Acceptance Authority found in 6 U.S.C. 301a and section 559 of title V of division F of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Public Law 113-76), as amended, as continued by 6 U.S.C. 301b, the permittee shall provide to U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security and any other relevant United States Government agencies, at no cost to the United States, suitable inspection facilities, infrastructure improvements, equipment, and maintenance, as set forth in the DAAs. Nothing in this permit obligates such agencies to provide a particular level of services or staffing for such inspection facilities or for any other aspect of the port of entry associated with the Border facilities. Article 8. The permittee shall file with the President or his designee, and with appropriate agencies, such sworn statements or reports with respect to the Border facilities, or the permittee's activities and operations in connection therewith, as are now, or may hereafter, be required under any law or regulation of the United States Government or its agencies. These reporting obligations do not alter the intent that this permit be operative as a directive issued by the President alone. Article 9. Upon request, the permittee shall provide appropriate information to the President or his designee with regard to the Border facilities. Such requests could include, for example, information concerning current [[Page 691]] conditions or anticipated changes in ownership or control, construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the Border facilities. Article 10. The permittee shall provide written notice to the President or his designee at the time that the construction authorized by this permit begins, at such time as such construction is completed, interrupted, or discontinued, and at other times as may be requested by the President. Article 11. This permit shall expire 15 years from the date of its issuance if the permittee has not commenced construction of the Border facilities by that date. Article 12. This permit is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I, DONALD J.

(3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would-- (i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap; or (ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps. (4) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would-- (i) Exclude individuals with handicaps from, deny them the benefits of, [[Page 698]] or otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency; or (ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps. (5) The agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap. (6) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this regulation. (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by this regulation. (d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps. Sec. Sec. 102.131-102.139 [Reserved] Sec. 102.140 Employment. No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities. Sec. Sec. 102.141-102.148 [Reserved] Sec. 102.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency. Sec. 102.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities. (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not-- (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result [[Page 699]] in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity. (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate. (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include-- (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible; (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or (iii) Adopting other innovative methods. (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible. (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum-- (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps; (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible; (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan. Sec. 102.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations. Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section. [[Page 700]] Sec. Sec. 102.152-102.159 [Reserved] Sec. 102.160 Communications. (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public. (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency. (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps. (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature. (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing. (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities. (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility. (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity. Sec. Sec. 102.161-102.169 [Reserved] Sec. 102.170 Compliance procedures. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.

Complaints may be sent to the Director at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500. (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may extend this time period for good cause. (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity. (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers [[Page 701]] Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing-- (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law; (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and (3) A notice of the right to appeal. (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from the agency of the letter required by Sec. 102.170(g). The agency may extend this time for good cause. (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of the agency. (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request.
