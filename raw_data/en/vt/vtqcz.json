At Cat Care Clinic, we aim to minimize the number of vaccinations given to our patients, but do believe in the importance of core vaccines for all cats. We advise first time cat parents on litter box, mealtime and sleep habits. We'll physically exam your kitten and administer the most important vaccinations. Schedule your new cat or kitten's first physical exam. Make sure everything checks out and treat any hidden troubles before symptoms start. We can accommodate more than one cat in an exam room. If your cat has a buddy, bring them along for comfort, or schedule both cats in one exam. Not all clinics are equipped to diagnose or complications specific to cats. Get a second opinion if you're not sure what to do next for your sick kitty. From my earliest practice days in Madison (1988), Cat Care Clinic has always been a leader in feline medicine.
