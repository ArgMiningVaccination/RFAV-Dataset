THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE It's been another busy few months for the Society, with so many incredible highlights in this issue of Immunology News ! As always, our team have been working hard to support our immunology community in driving scientific discovery and making a positive impact on health. A particular highlight for me has been our first ever BSI Immunology Awards Ceremony. What can I say ... what a day full of immunology expertise, dedication and talent we had there! This inspiring event celebrating excellence in all strands of immunology took place in London in April and saw us welcome leaders from across the discipline to discuss the current opportunities and challenges facing the UK's life sciences sector. We then moved on to the long-awaited awards ceremony. Our huge congratulations go to all the award winners whose efforts across the breadth of immunology activities - be that research, teaching, engagement - have made a hugely positive impact on our discipline. If the commitment, skill and knowledge that was in the room that night was anything to go by, the future of UK immunology is truly in safe hands. Thank you so much to those of you who attended and we hope you enjoyed the event as much as we did! You can find out more about the award winners on page 8. I also want to encourage you to turn to pages 16-20 to discover a bit more about our award winners for Outstanding Contribution to the BSI, Professor Gary Entrican, and for Outstanding Contribution to Immunology, Professor Danny Altmann and Dr Victoria Male. They have all gone above and beyond to deliver for the BSI and for immunology, and you will be able to find out more about their work and incredible contributions. Lastly, I'd like to thank to our event sponsors, The Kennedy Trust, Miltenyi Biotec and Mabtech, whose kind support allowed us to host this event. As I'm sure you all know, the BSI has been running committee elections over the past few months. I'm extremely pleased to welcome Professor Jessica Strid onto the Board of Trustees, alongside Dr Diyva Shah, who rejoins after a short hiatus and Professor Deborah Dunn-Walters who starts a second term of office. Our Board of Trustees is crucial to the successful running of the BSI and our ability to deliver for you all, and we're delighted to have individuals with such diverse expertise joining the committee. Thanks, from the whole BSI team, also go to those who are finishing their term of office across all committees, with a particular mention to our Trustees who are standing down, Professor Matthias Eberl (who stays involved with us as our Public Engagement Secretary), Paul Harding and Professor Allan Mowat. You can read more about the elections, including the new people starting on our Member Representative Forum and Congress Committee on pages 5-6. Another big highlight of the last three months has been the launch of the BSI Clinical Immunology Professional Network (BSI-CIPN), our dedicated network for those working in clinical immunology. It has been a long time in the making and is a result of our recent merger with the UK Primary Immunodeficiency Network. Through this new BSI group, our aim is to step up our activities championing clinical immunology to strengthen its voice in policy and public arenas while also fostering closer links between clinical practitioners and basic scientists. We're incredibly excited about the opportunities in this new area of work for us, which you can read more about on page 11. You'll also find information on this page about how to join BSI-CIPN and get involved in their activities. Finally, I know you all, like me, will be looking forward with anticipation to this year's BSI Congress! We're so excited to welcome you all to Belfast for the first time for this event. You still have plenty of time over the summer to plan your abstracts, with a submission deadline of 4 September, so get writing!

In this article, we explore the study of these rare conditions and their implications for understanding and manipulating immunological systems. Defining primary immunodeficiency Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs or PIDs), also known as inborn errors of immunity (IEI), are caused by mutations in single genes that affect the development and/or function of immune cells. As a result, patients with PIDs have increased susceptibility to life-threatening infections, which often require life-long or invasive therapeutic interventions. These include stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement and administration of steroids. Around 10 million people worldwide are thought to live with primary immunodeficiencies, with 70-90% of these cases still undiagnosed. Many of the infections associated with PIDs are common and easily treatable with antibiotics, so doctors may not always consider an underlying immune deficiency disorder as the cause. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, allowing infections to persist and recur, and increasing the risk of serious complications. The advent of next-generation sequencing has enabled a surge in the identification of gene defects that cause PIDs and has massively expanded this research area, uncovering tremendous diversity in phenotypes caused by these defects. A total of 485 distinct defects are now included in the 2022 update on the classification of human inborn errors of immunity from the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) expert committee,1 a steep increase from the 430 reported in the 2019 update.Uncovering immune insights The study of primary immunodeficiencies has introduced a revolutionary approach to connecting specific genetic abnormalities to immune system malfunctions in clinical contexts. This is significant because it demonstrates that a single gene defect can result in severe clinical outcomes, underscoring the critical roles of individual genes in human immunology. Consequently, PIDs have contributed to a greater understanding of the functions of genes, molecules, signalling pathways and cell types in immune defence and regulation, leading to improved treatments for immune- related diseases. \"IEI represent an unprecedented model to link defined single gene defects to immune dysregulation in clinical settings\" Dr Cindy Ma, Immunodeficiency Section Editor at Clinical & Experimental ImmunologyPerhaps most significantly, advances in molecular medicine as a result of PID research have implications beyond the relatively small number of people with rare primary immunodeficiencies. As PID research reveals more insights into the immune system, this knowledge may be leveraged to improve immunity and immune regulation in the general population. Overall, the study of primary immunodeficiencies and the impact of genetic variants on immune function represents an exciting and rapidly evolving field, with the potential to improve our understanding of immunological systems and to develop new therapies for patients with immune disorders. \u00a9Shutterstock/Novikov AlekseyImmunology News | June 2023 SOCIETY NEWS 13 Despite both resulting from defects in the STAT3 gene, STAT3 Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IGE Syndrome (caused by a loss-of-function variant) and STAT3 Gain-of-function Syndrome define two distinct clinical phenotypes. Figure from Mackie et al. 2023 Clinical & Experimental Immunology 212 107-116 https://doi.org/10.1093/cei/uxad007 SOCIETY NEWS The BSI's official journal, Clinical & Experimental Immunology (CEI), has a dedicated Immunodeficiency section led by Dr Cindy Ma, who heads the Human Immune Disorders Laboratory at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia. In time for World Primary Immunodeficiency Week at the end of April, CEI published a new Review Series entitled 'Inborn errors of immunity: The Goldilocks effect - susceptibility to diseases due to a little too much or a little too little'. The series is edited by Dr Ma alongside Professor Stuart Tangye (also based at the Garvan Institute) and highlights new insights into primary immunodeficiency due to variants in genes that result in loss of function or gain of function of the encoded protein, and the arising disease outcomes. This collection of reviews covers a diverse range of PIDs, including those caused by loss-of-function and gain-of-function gene defects in the complement pathway, JAK-STAT signalling, NF-kB pathway, DNA-binding protein Ikaros and actin cytoskeleton. Comparing loss-of-function and gain-of-function variants in the same genes has provided important insights into the function of specific proteins. For example, the study of PID has been instrumental in elucidating the role of the transcription factor STAT3 as a critical signalling module in immune responses, metabolism and cancer.2 The discovery of loss-of-function variants in STAT3 as a cause of recurrent skin and pulmonary infection established that STAT3 plays a critical non-redundant role in immunity against some pathogens. Conversely, gain-of- function STAT3 variants were found to cause cases of early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity, thereby supporting the idea that STAT3 function needs to be regulated to maintain immune homeostasis.

Discovery IMMUNOLOGY New Senior Editor of Discovery Immunology Immunology News | June 2023 #BSI wedding Big congratulations to BSI members Dr Alexander Stewart and Dr Federica Orsenigo from University of Surrey who got engaged during BSI Congress 2021 in Edinburgh and got married on 6 May 2023. Immunology News | June 202316 FEATURE ARTICLE Outstanding Contribution to the BSI: interview with Professor Gary Entrican Many congratulations on winning the Outstanding Contribution to the BSI Award! How did it feel to get this good news? It feels amazing. It was totally unexpected - I didn't even know I'd been nominated. The BSI means so much to me and I've been involved with their work for so many years, and to be recognised in this way is above and beyond anything I expected. For me, it's an affirmation that I've done something positive for the BSI and for my colleagues. It always means a lot to get this kind of acknowledgement from your peers. In your role as BSI Congress Secretary, you oversaw two BSI Congress events and had to adapt in 2020 to running an online event. How did you cope with the challenges the pandemic posed? The first set of challenges were the shifting goal posts. We had a planning meeting in early March 2020, and it was already noticeable travelling into London that things were quieter. We suspected there might be some sort of lockdown, but we didn't know for how long, so we continued getting everything lined up for an in-person meeting in December. Of course, by June or July, it became clear that an in-person event was no longer an option. But we still wanted to do something really worthwhile for the BSI membership. Online meetings were by then becoming quite commonplace so we had to work hard to offer something unique that included COVID-19 and had an interactive element. 'The BSI means so much to me and I've been involved with their work for so many years, and to be recognised in this way is above and beyond anything I expected. For me, it's an affirmation that I've done something positive for the BSI and for my colleagues. It always means a lot to get this kind of acknowledgement from your peers.' Professor Gary Entrican has won our inaugural Outstanding Contribution to the BSI Award. Gary is Honorary Professor at The Roslin Institute at The University of Edinburgh. He was a Trustee of the BSI from 2004 to 2007 and held the post of BSI Congress Secretary from 2017 to 2021. We caught up with Gary to find out what it means to him to win this award.Immunology News | June 202317 FEATURE ARTICLE The uncertainty was the biggest challenge, and this remained right through to the end. Travel restrictions for speakers and delegates could change from one day to the next. It is easy with hindsight to forget how difficult that was at the time. Throughout my career, the BSI Congress has always been such a big event in the calendar - there are very few I've not been to. It was important to me to play a role in continuing that tradition as Congress Secretary. What role has the BSI played in your own career and how has this role evolved in recent years? The BSI has been a huge part of my career. I went to my first BSI meeting in the first year of my PhD, in Kensington Town Hall. Those meetings, where you got to hear about everything that was going on in the field, were the chance to meet people for career progression and keep your finger on the pulse. It was at one of these meetings that I gave my first talk as a postdoc, which was quite daunting at the time! To be able to meet people from around the UK and globally working in all different areas of immunology was so valuable, and those opportunities simply wouldn't have been there without the BSI. Of course, the BSI's activities have developed over the years to adapt to the changing demands of research careers in immunology. It's been great to see the increased focus on opportunities for Early Career Researchers, for example. I've enjoyed being a part of that evolution. For me, what speaks volumes is that many immunologists remain members of the BSI even when their research and teaching activities are behind them. They feel part of a community, and that is something the BSI has done really well to create. You are a big champion of equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI). Why do you think this is so important for a field like immunology? I actually think it's important in every aspect of life. I became interested in equality, diversity and inclusion in a previous role - I don't like discrimination and I don't like unfairness, so that was the hook for me. As I got more involved, I began to understand that the principles of equality go far beyond the protected characteristics set out by the Equality Act. It's actually all about culture and behaviours and values. If the values of an organisation are not reflective of an environment that is accepting and supportive, then people end up having to watch their backs rather than looking forward. In science, you constantly need to be moving forward, so if you can't thrive in your place of work, then there is no progress. The BSI has been doing some great work on this, including their new Diversity & Inclusion Framework, which is a fantastic approach, and is something I've used in a number of contexts. The BSI has a large and strong membership, so can be a beacon for these values. Leadership by example is so important - you need to take people with you. You can't dictate to them. You took a new direction in your career several years ago when you stopped active research, but you are still very much involved in immunology - how important was it to you to keep that connection? That's right - though I was taking a new direction in my career, I wasn't ready to walk away from immunology, or to 'park' my scientific brain. I no longer do research but I have an Honorary Professorship at the University of Edinburgh and am now even more involved in teaching and other roles, such as on funding panels, which play an important role in supporting competitive research. They are time- consuming but very rewarding so I'm pleased that I have the time to do them. What I have realised is that the skills I've gained in my research career are transferable to just about everything I do. Simple things like presentation skills and communicating information clearly and convincingly. These skills are particularly important for good leadership and can serve you in every aspect of life, both inside and outside science. Interview conducted by Amy Edmunds'The BSI has been doing some great work on this, including their new Diversity & Inclusion Framework, which is a fantastic approach, and is something I've used in a number of contexts.

Immunology News | June 202318 FEATURE ARTICLE BSI Outstanding Ambassadors for Immunology: interviews with Professor Danny Altmann and Dr Victoria Male An interview with... PROFESSOR DANNY ALTMANN We spoke to Danny about his work demystifying the principles of immunity since the very early days of the pandemic, as well as his more recent work advocating for those with Long Covid. What does it mean to you to win the BSI Outstanding Ambassador for Immunology award? The BSI has played a big role in my professional life. I've been a member since I was 19 or 20, when I joined in order to hear Rolf Zinkernagel talk at BSI Congress about the work he was doing on how T cells recognise infection. That was the moment I really became hooked on immunology and T cells. These days I try to do my bit to communicate about developments in the field and to be an ambassador, so yes, to win an award like this means a lot. You worked tirelessly during the pandemic to communicate the science behind COVID-19 to the public via the media. What challenges did this present, and what positives were there? It's been a long journey for all immunologists since December 2019. Before then, I would get maybe half a dozen requests a year for media interviews, but during the pandemic there were times when I was getting 20 or 30 requests a day to do interviews for TV and newspapers around the world. One of the first things you have to do is regulate how much time you spend on it. If I responded to every interview request, I'd have no time for research.Another challenge is using the right language to communicate in different circumstances. You want to be clear and understandable but not patronising. Some interviews require you to avoid even the most basic scientific terms like 'virus' or 'antibody', while others want you to go into quite a bit of technical detail. It's been a learning curve to get that balance right. Do you think areas like public engagement, communication, policy and government relations are becoming more integral to the scientist's role? Yes, to a huge degree, and for very good reason. As scientists, we've always had to fill out that section in grant applications about how we're going to communicate our work and be answerable to the public, but now I think people realise why they have to really mean it, why they need to do it in spadefuls. The pandemic taught us that members of the public really do have an appetite to grasp our research, so why would you not want to respond to that and explain what you do with your days, and the impact it has? Our inaugural Outstanding Ambassador for Immunology Award has been awarded jointly to Professor Danny Altmann and Dr Victoria Male, both at Imperial College London. You can read our interview with Danny below and find our interview with Victoria on the next page. Immunology News | June 202319 FEATURE ARTICLE I remember when there was a lot of debate about whether the UK would adopt legislation on 'immunity passports' and that felt to me like a very important time for scientists to speak up. Policymakers were trying to make decisions quickly about quite profound and complex things. Scientists could step in to remind people that different vaccines with different credentials were being used around the world, that immunity wanes and that some people may be unable to mount an immune response at all. There was layer upon layer of complexity and it felt incredibly important to be part of that conversation to avoid bad decisions being made. There is a delicate balance to be struck: you want to be a good ambassador and communicator, but not be seen as political or as having an axe to grind. Sometimes your scientific answer might sound quite critical of current policy or advice. All this has, for many immunologists, been new territory. Long Covid will continue to be an important topic for years to come, and this is a particular area of interest for you. Is it fair to say you balance two roles here: researcher and advocate? How do you manage that balance? Communicating about Long Covid is different in so many ways to the kind of communication we did earlier in the pandemic. Back then, we were all united in our fear and our sense of danger, and everyone was looking to the scientific community for answers. Now, a lot of people want to believe the pandemic is over so they can resume normal life, but at the same time we have this persistent chronic disease in Long Covid that is so much harder to grapple with and talk about. The topic has become quite polarising and sometimes toxic, so that my world is now full of rivalries and anger and bitterness. I sometimes feel caught up between the various camps, and the spirit of the debate is very different from that during the acute phase of the pandemic.At the end of the day, you want to be a good advocate for the science and for the patients, and sometimes that involves saying things that are quite uncomfortable. But we've raised the awareness so much already, partly thanks to the BSI and others, and there is so much more appetite now to have a measured conversation about these things. I think that scientists and their achievements are now valued much more than they were, and science correspondents have more clout with their editors to get these stories onto the front pages. This is all progress. How do you think your work acting as an ambassador for immunology might evolve in future? The role is evolving and progressing in ways I never foresaw, and still can't to some degree. I think we're in a much better place than we were in terms of lines of communication and having a shared lexicon. There are still challenges, of course - I will still have days where I get deluged with criticism for interpreting a paper in a particular way that upsets a certain group of people. The territory ahead is still quite uncharted but ultimately, more communication is better than less, and I for one look forward to doing more of it. 'There is a delicate balance to be struck: you want to be a good ambassador and communicator, but not be seen as political or as having an axe to grind 'An interview with... PROFESSOR VICTORIA MALE We spoke to Victoria about her work communicating the evidence around COVID-19 vaccines, pregnancy and fertility, and how her role promoting science has changed during the pandemic. The pandemic has brought immunology firmly into the limelight. What positives do you think this has led to? And what are some of the challenges? What's really great is that suddenly people are interested in immunology. People with no science background can now hold a conversation about T cells and B cells and different antibodies. That wouldn't have been possible five years ago. Early on in the pandemic, when I was talking to people about the risks and benefits of vaccination in pregnancy, the vast majority of people didn't have an agenda. They simply wanted to make the best decision for themselves and their babies. It was fun and interesting to have these conversations. This time last year, for every unpleasant message I received, I got ten photos of babies from new parents saying thank you for giving me the information I needed to make a decision I felt comfortable with. The kinds of people I talk to have changed a lot in recent months. Everyone who wanted to be vaccinated has now got the vaccine, so I'm spending more time talking to people who have quite strong preconceived notions about vaccines being a bad idea. I made a very conscious decision early on, that I would rather take the time to talk to ten people who might never agree with me, if there was a chance one of those might be someone who genuinely wanted information. That has informed the whole of my approach. As a busy researcher, how do you balance the role of carrying out the research, and the equally important role of communicating it? I'm lucky that I have an enormous amount of support. My family understand that I'm doing something worthwhile, and that it might mean I sometimes spend an evening doing a podcast rather than spending time with them, for example. They have been fantastic in giving me the space and time to get on with it. My university and funders have also been great. I'm funded by a pre-term birth charity called Borne (www.borne.org.uk) who have been really supportive. They recognise that ultimately my job is to prevent pre-term births, and that one of the ways I can achieve this is by ensuring people have accurate information about the dangers of COVID-19, and about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In your experience, what is the key to having a constructive conversation about vaccines with a member of the public who is having doubts? The first thing I do is to completely liberate myself from the idea that it's my job to persuade a person to get vaccinated. My job is to make sure they have the information they need to make a decision that they're happy with, one that's right for them and their family. This mindset helps open up a two-way conversation. The second thing is to really listen and find out what it is they need from the conversation. Immunology News | June 2023 20 FEATURE ARTICLE This may sound obvious, but I was speaking to someone who was unsure whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine when she was breastfeeding. I asked her what it was that was holding her back and she explained that she didn't understand how a vaccine in her arm could protect her whole body. That wasn't at all what I expected her to be unsure about, and was absolutely something I could help explain! What would you say to encourage a budding scientist to enter the field of immunology? I've recently started going into schools again after taking a break during the pandemic, and when I talk to children now about vaccines, they immediately know what they are and, in most cases, think they're a good thing. So, in some ways, it's a much easier sell than it used to be! Sometimes children have preconceived notions about what kind of person can be a scientist, so it's really important to stress that they can be a scientist no matter their gender, ethnicity, religion, or if they have a disability. Whatever their interests are, there will be a place for them in science. Ultimately, getting this message across will make science a more diverse and welcoming place. Becoming an immunologist is an opportunity to really make a difference, and we've just seen an amazing example of that in vaccine development and managing COVID-19. But there's more to immunology too - it's a fascinating puzzle for anyone with an enquiring mind. There are so many moving parts to it, and there's probably not a challenge like it anywhere else in science. What future challenges do you see for anyone acting as an ambassador for immunology? The odds are that I will see another pandemic in my lifetime, and my children will probably see more than one. We're in a potentially very good situation, in that we have new vaccine platforms and new ways of approaching vaccine trials. We could be entering a golden era of vaccination, but only if people want to get vaccinated. Ambassadors for immunology will have an important role to play in helping people to understand the evidence so they can make informed choices. Of course, being an ambassador doesn't necessarily mean dealing with the media - twitter and TV interviews won't be for everyone. Some people may be more comfortable working with MPs and decision makers, or in partnership with professional bodies. There are many ways someone can be an ambassador, and it's going to be fascinating to see how different people go about it in the ways that come naturally to them.

The rapid development and deployment of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled unprecedented scrutiny of the immune response following vaccination. This has begun to permit us a better In April, the BSI published a new policy report which calls for further study of immunogenicity to improve the evaluation of the effectiveness and value of vaccines for the advancement of public health. We then met with policymakers, regulators, clinicians, researchers and industry at Parliament to present this report and explore the actions needed to leverage immunogenicity progress to protect and boost health for future generations. Here, our Policy and Public Affairs Manager, Matthew Gibbard, discusses the importance of the report, and its development and subsequent launch. understanding of the components of immunity that confer short- and longer- term protection. There have also been parallel advances in the development of novel research and routine clinical diagnostic devices to measure elements of this immune response. Lessons to be learned The UK is at a critical juncture to learn lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, to reform regulatory decision-making and clinical trial design. We have the opportunity to make vaccine development cheaper and easier to conduct, as well as continue point of care and home testing for immunogenicity as a legacy of COVID-19 to bridge the divide to real-world data. Utilising immunogenicity as a tool is key to all this potential progress. We have a duty to build on the legacy from COVID-19 throughout science, research infrastructure and innovative working, and deliver the long-term benefits we know are possible to both patients and the country's wider public health. The key to securing this legacy will be the adoption of the recommendations that we have made in our report, to support future vaccine development and implementation by breaking down barriers between academia, industry, clinical medicine, regulators and government. A welcome reception To ensure the report's visibility among parliamentarians, the research community, and those who work in the science policy sphere, the BSI launched the report at an afternoon reception in the House of Lords. The event was kindly sponsored by the Lord Patel of Dunkeld KT, a physician and the former Chair of the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee. The meeting was fully funded by MSD. Lord Kakkar, an eminent cardiovascular surgeon and former member of the Science and Technology Select Committee, spoke first to launch the report, welcoming the parliamentarians and scientists to the event, while highlighting the importance of immunology in improving public health. He noted that the accelerated progress in vaccine development from COVID-19 has led to an increased understanding of the immune response components that confer short- and longer-term protection from infection and disease severity.Measuring vaccine-induced immunogenicity: Leveraging a COVID-19 legacy for improved public health MSD fully funded and attended the roundtable meeting.

In her speech, she discussed the challenges and opportunities of measuring immunogenicity and talked through the report's recommendations, how they link into each other, and how they will ultimately be able to come together to improve public health and the UK's pandemic preparedness. Dr Dilruwan Herath, medical director at MSD, also spoke at the event. In his speech, Dr Herath discussed the role of industry and noted that MSD is committed to supporting research that can help to improve the understanding of immunogenicity.

This report was fully funded by MSD and was fact checked for accuracy and balance only. \"This British Society for Immunology report explains how we can unlock immunogenicity's full potential by breaking down barriers between academia, industry, clinical medicine, regulators and government, and investing in our R&D sector to ensure that we have the funding, skills and capacity to leverage the legacy of COVID-19 for the ultimate benefits of public health and pandemic preparedness.\" Professor Alex Richter, Chair of the roundtable for this report and Director of the Clinical Immunology Service at the University of Birminghamstakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, industry, regulators, and clinicians, the afternoon reception provided an opportunity to discuss the importance of immunogenicity research in a post-pandemic world, as well as to share their views on the report and its recommendations. By working together to leverage a COVID-19 legacy, we can deliver immense benefits to those most at risk, our vital research and clinical community, and our society. Matthew Gibbard BSI Policy and Public Affairs Manager Email: m.gibbard@immunology.org Report recommendations Lessons from measuring vaccine-induced immunogenicity in COVID-19 Immunogenicity research should be recognised as a central part of the UK's pandemic preparedness plans. Vaccines regulation and monitoring Regulators should clarify the laboratory evidence needed to bring a vaccine to market and what industry can do to collect these data. Decision-makers should clarify what post-marketing surveillance immunogenicity studies are required to inform the need for booster vaccines and prioritisation of at-risk groups. An agreed toolbox of companion diagnostics should be defined to support vaccine development, licensing and adoption. Validation and standardisation of assays There should be a clear process for the development and monitoring of standardised, high-quality assays for immunogenicity that can be used as surrogates of vaccine protection. Guidance should be provided to the scientific community on standardisation requirements for assays and the steps required for developing international reference standard reagents. Mucosal immunity We must prioritise research into the understanding and accurate measurement of mucosal immunity. We need to develop methods for predicting how well a vaccine will confer sterilising mucosal immunity and prevent onward transmission of infection. Regulators must clarify the regulatory requirements for vaccines designed to reduce transmission to stimulate research by industry into this area. People with weakened immune systems We are urgently calling for more research on which assays correlate with protection for people who are immunocompromised. People who are immunocompromised should be included in licensing and post-marketing surveillance programmes for vaccines. Vaccine development should consider achieving successful immunogenicity in people who are immunocompromised. Point of care and at-home testing A legacy of COVID-19 should be ensured through continued point of care and at-home testing for immunogenicity and recognise how this can be of use to post-marketing authorisation studies mandated by the MHRA to bridge the divide between immunogenicity studies and real-world data. We must ensure that there is proper government and industry support for the UK diagnostics sector through boosting capacity, inward investment and skills. Leadership and co-ordination A UK vaccinology network based on pandemic models of working, with continued funding and strong leadership, should be established to devise and address key questions and challenges in immunogenicity. We must ensure that routes for knowledge transfer in a pandemic situation are clearly delineated with a focus on knowledge generation. Coordination within the UK's antibody and vaccine development research community should be improved, and this should include mapping the UK's academic innovation and capacity, as well as developing a virtual biobank of samples stored in UK laboratories. There should be template agreements drawn up in advance between academic research institutions, government and industry on compensation for components used in assay development and for intellectual property arrangements. There should be clear and transparent advice ahead of time from the Health and Safety Executive that allows UK researchers to provide their expertise in the event of another pandemic. This should be combined with establishment of a standardised and centralised portal for material transfer agreements.

We are proud to have delivered the patient and public involvement (PPI) element of the programme, working closely with its management team and a panel of public contributors, with whom we then collaborated to design tailored training in the area to provide researchers with tools for effective PPI. As the programme came to an end in April 2023, we now look back on the successes, challenges and improvements for future involvement with immunology research, and the value of co-creating training to deliver impactful outcomes. Embedding involvement In 2022, a panel of nine patients and members of the public was established to work alongside the research teams supported by NCSi for 12 months. The At the British Society for Immunology (BSI), we have been working towards equipping researchers with the necessary tools for effectively involving patients and the public in research. We managed the patient and public involvement (PPI) element of National Core Studies Immunity (NCSi) to facilitate involvement with COVID-19 research and, subsequently, designed and delivered tailored PPI training for the researchers involved. Here, BSI Public Engagement Manager and lead for PPI within the programme, Erika Aquino, details the impact and lessons of the NCSi PPI element and reflects on the importance of carrying out meaningful involvement with patients and the public. panel members had diverse experiences and backgrounds, including some with conditions that affect their immune system. Their overarching role was to offer insights, advice and feedback on the work being undertaken, ultimately ensuring that the research effectively met the needs of the widest possible range of people. Members met regularly with the research teams to discuss findings and implications. Through regular meetings with the research team, the panel helped draw attention to questions and issues that may not have been considered, such as the challenges of recruiting study participants from underrepresented communities. \"The panel tended to bring up ideas of diversity of our cohorts, which made us really push this agenda, although we have been devoted to this cause! It was a very positive experience and will influence the way I think in the future.\" Management team, National Core Studies Immunity Capturing impact Patient and public involvement in the programme had immense positive impact in a range of areas including the research delivered and the individuals involved. Importantly, it was also of crucial benefit to the public contributors, who reported feeling valued and recognised for their role within the programme. \"I'm proud to be a PPI member for National Core Studies and the BSI, thanks for taking me onboard.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity All public contributors strongly agreed that they could contribute their feedback and reflections on the ongoing research priorities to the NCSi management team. The panel were grateful to the programme lead, Professor Paul Moss, and co-lead, Professor Doreen Cantrell, for always attending meetings and providing regular updates, and greatly appreciated the opportunity to ask questions and provide their feedback. \"Researchers were amenable to public contributors' questions, comments and suggestions and always replied with expanded explanations.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity Continuous feedback drives improvements Throughout the project, we used Padlet, an online anonymous feedback tool, to gain insight on how the meeting went and what could be done differently. \"The Padlet was a great way to surface issues and discuss them, many PPI groups don't have a process for that.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies ImmunityBeyond sharing findings: patient and public involvement for better research \u00a9Shutterstock/mentalmindImmunology News | June 202325 REPRESENTING IMMUNOLOGY www.immunology.org Feedback was collected and comments discussed to implement changes that drive improvement . Positive changes included: Meeting times convenient for everyone enabled high average attendance of 80% Comfortable pace of meetings allowed open and constructive conversationsSuccesses Continual progress 100%100% of public contributors reported positively that: They could contribute feedback and reflections on ongoing research priorities Their advice and guidance were respected and could influence the project There was a clear role for PPI and supportive structures in place They felt valued and recognised for their role as a patient and public contributor \"Gathering anonymous feedback is a great way to surface issues and discuss them, many PPI groups don't have a process for that.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity For example, at the beginning of the project, the timing and fast pace of the meetings were noted as feedback, which was taken on board, rearranging them for more convenient times and reducing the agenda. The panel reported back that these changes enabled open and productive conversations with researchers. Early in the project, the need for researchers to use accessible language and avoid complicated terminology was highlighted as important. We briefed presenters ahead of the meetings and provided feedback after so researchers could learn from their experiences and build their communication skills. Reflecting on this later in the project, panel members noted that presentations were clearer and easy to understand, and they praised researchers for explaining the complex science in an understandable way. Fostering relationships is key to successfully working together Another success was the strong relationships formed between the panel members and the BSI team. Key to successfully building rapport is trust, openness and listening to others to have productive conversations. The BSI welcomed the opportunity to reflect on our own ways of working, as well as the wider immunology research culture, and actively engaged in a process of continuous adaptation and learning around PPI. \"I enjoyed seeing real-time research results from the teams. The best sessions were when the public contributors who were part of the research presented alongside the researchers, it was great to see that happening.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity \"I think the BSI have been amazing here and the comments from people that they felt completely included are a testament to that.\" Management team, National Core Studies Immunity Influencing policy and research funding Positively, all public contributors reported that they could provide their perspective on wider implications of the research on national COVID-19 public policy priorities. However, there is still work to be done to ensure decision-makers involve public contributors and patients in policy discussions. Additionally, the BSI strives to promote the important role of PPI in research funding and how involving people with lived experiences in grant applications is vital for effective research. It is vital to focus on communication beyond research findings to effectively involve and make sure outcomes reach the people affected and their clinicians. We will continue to advocate for PPI influencing policy topics important to patients and the immunology community. \"In future, the BSI needs to keep on supporting PPI and involve patients and the public in additional research as the BSI is well placed.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity \"The British Society for Immunology have an extraordinary culture of excellence, commitment, professionalism and support.\" Management team, National Core Studies Immunity First steps towards meaningful involvement Many panel members cited that they were able to add meaningful input into the programme's public engagement and communication activities. We worked with them to create public- facing infographics, co-author a report and deliver a public webinar. Crucially, the panel and BSI also co- produced a training course for researchers 'Building partnerships and nurturing relationships with mutual respect and trust takes time and resource but should not be seen as a barrier to involving patients and the public with research . 'Immunology News | June 202326 REPRESENTING IMMUNOLOGY about how to involve the public and patients in their research, and better understand the mindset and approach needed for effective and inclusive involvement. This course laid out the foundations in this area to help researchers start their PPI journey and provide them with the necessary tools to involve the public throughout the entire research cycle. \"My highlight has been co-developing the training to teach researchers about PPI.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity Co-production at its core A group of five patient and public contributors worked closely with the BSI team to co-design an online course for the NCSi researchers, developing learning objectives, content and delivery methods, and including a practice run. The researchers were also consulted on the content of the training to identify gaps in knowledge and how best to shape the course. The course allowed for peer-to-peer learning through sharing experiences and case studies of successful involvement. Researchers wanted to improve their knowledge of how to reach the people most affected by their research and involve them in funding applications, and these topics were incorporated into the course. As well as practical skills of administrating and coordinating involvement, a vital element for the public contributors was to role-model inclusive engagement and emphasise the importance of approaching involvement with a sincere mindset. Everyone involved inputted into a group agreement, in which they shared what they need to enable them to participate and discuss what adjustments might be necessary to promote inclusive practice. The journey is as important as the destination The course focused on reflexive practice, where researchers were challenged to recognise how their own assumptions impact how they view PPI. Building partnerships and nurturing relationships with mutual respect and trust takes time and resource but should not be seen as a barrier to involving patients and the public with research. Equitable involvement requires fostering a culture where different types of knowledge and lived experiences are appreciated and can add value to research. Positive feedback and room for improvement Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire before and after the training to gather feedback and rank their confidence in accomplishing different aspects of PPI. Positively, confidence in all aspects increased after attending the course. Before the training, 48% of participants were not confident in building rapport and relationships with public contributors but after completing the course, 92% of participants reported feeling confident and very confident. Notably, 93% of attendees finished the course feeling confident in giving value to patient and public contributors, compared with 9% before the training. Many of the researchers reported enjoying the helpful insights and advice from the experienced patient and public contributors as well as hearing useful www.immunology.org Key to strong rapport is trust and active listening, which guides productive dialogues. The BSI welcomed the opportunity to reflect and engage in a process of continuous adaptation and learning around PPI.Building relationships \"The BSI built relationships with us. I felt that I could reach out with any concerns and comments, both positive and negative. Thank you to all at the BSI for all that you are and everything that you do. You have been approachable, reflexive and it's been a joy to be involved with you.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity \"We made space for conversations which delved into tensions inherent in big data research. It was great to have the time to do that productively.\" Public contributor, National Core Studies Immunity\"The British Society for Immunology has an extraordinary culture of excellence, commitment, professionalism and support.\" Management team, National Core Studies Immunity case studies from their colleagues. The feedback highlighted areas for improvement too, including having more time for smaller group conversations and more information on how to monitor and report impact. There were useful suggestions of having separate introductory training with more practical guidance around recruiting patient and public contributors and running effective meetings. We look forward to further developing and improving the training, working closely with public contributors and the wider research community, and seeing more of our members and immunology community getting involved in this important part of the research process.

Although initially conceived as an initiative to address the need for a specialist group focusing on immunology education, the remit has expanded following these initial discussions. Beyond the focus on education in a rapidly evolving higher education sector, the primary aims of the group are to ensure that BSI members are kept up to date on innovative teaching practices and that curricula are relevant and engaging for students at all levels of study. The Group helps provide a platform for educators and researchers involved in immunology teaching to connect, collaborate and share their experiences, knowledge and resources. These networking opportunities will help create a stronger, more cohesive community of immunology educators. The BSI Teaching Affinity Group also offers support for immunology educators in their career progression, providing opportunities for professional growth, training and recognition. A collective voice Sharing best practices is a central tenant of the group, and in facilitating the exchange of best practices, we aim to improve the overall quality of immunology education. This includes the development and dissemination of innovative teaching approaches, authentic and engaging assessment techniques, and resources that cater to diverse learner needs and preferences. Looking to the future term, we will The Teaching Affinity Group of the British Society for Immunology (BSI) is a dedicated group focused on promoting excellence in immunology education and nurturing the next generation of immunology educators. Under the leadership of its first co-chairs, Professor John Curnow from the University of Plymouth and Dr Nigel Francis from Cardiff University, the Group aims to create a supportive community for educators and researchers in immunology. Here John and Nigel tell us about the Group's aims, future plans and how to get involved.Introducing the BSI Teaching Affinity Group: a forum for immunology educators act as a collective voice for immunology educators, advocating for the importance of immunology education and its relevance to broader scientific and medical disciplines. This work will be overseen by the newly appointed committee helping to support our work as co-chairs. You can take a look at the inaugural committee on the Group's webpage. A positive start Our first formal meeting was held via Zoom, where former winners of the BSI Immunology Teaching Excellence Award were invited to present their teaching innovations. This was followed up with a breakfast meeting at the BSI Congress 2022 (Liverpool) where the initial aims of the group were outlined to around 50 attendees. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many members expressing an interest in joining and supporting the group. Anyone who is interested in joining the Group can do so via their BSI membership dashboard (please go to 'More about you' and select 'Teaching Affinity Group') or by contacting the committee members. The future looks bright The future of the group is an exciting one with several projects already planned to help design immunology curricula for different disciplines and dissemination of these ideas via a session at the BSI Congress 2023 in Belfast. We will also be working towards a blended two-half-day conference/workshop in 2024. More details of these will be circulated by the BSI closer to the time.By offering opportunities for networking, collaboration, and sharing best practices, the BSI Teaching Affinity Group strives to enhance the quality and impact of immunology education across all levels of academia and industry. We are very keen to expand the reach and impact of the group and welcome ideas from the BSI membership to help enhance immunology education across the BSI network - we'd love to see many in the community get involved!

Discovery Immunology Bone marrow is an important source of immune cells in mice and has been extensively studied in laboratory mice. However, recent studies have raised concerns about how well findings from laboratory mice can be applied to humans. In this study, Muir et al. collected bone marrow samples from wild mice from an isolated population in Scotland, and conducted an in-depth analysis to characterise the cellular make-up of bone marrow for wild mice, compared with laboratory mice. They found that the wild mouse bone marrow differs in every cell The BSI journalsImmune Update \u00a9Shutterstock/Rudmer Zwerver in melanoma Immunomodulatory drugs have revolutionised cancer therapy over the past few decades; for example, the use of checkpoint inhibitor therapies to target coinhibitory PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways. However, the effectiveness of this treatment option can vary greatly between patients. In this study, Edner et al. used immuno- phenotyping of blood samples from 20 patients with advanced melanoma before and after treatment with the PD-1 blocking antibody pembrolizumab to track response and progression of the disease. They found that individuals responding to PD-1 blockade were characterised by increased CD8 T cell proliferation following treatment, while progression was associated with an increase in CTLA-4-expressing Treg. Further analysis revealed differences in the biomarkers between those that responded well to treatment and those that didn't. These results suggest flow cytometric analysis of blood samples could be used to monitor clinical response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy for rapid treatment decisions. Edner et al. 2023 Immunotherapy Advances 3 reduce obesity-induced inflammation Obesity and obesity-related diseases represent a significant health and economic challenge globally, but little is known about the inflammation associated with obesity and how it drives pathology. Pezhman et al. investigated how the immunopeptide PEPITEM affects pancreas homeostasis and leukocyte trafficking, with the aim of potentially establishing an alternative, complementary treatment for inflammation related to obesity. The researchers observed for the first time that therapeutic administration of PEPITEM in mice was found to decrease pancreatic islet size, and modulate leukocyte mobilisation and T-cell trafficking, therefore potentially reversing the effects of obesity induced inflammation on certain tissues. This highlights PEPITEM as a potential novel treatment for systemic inflammation experienced in obesity that could lessen the impacts of obesity on pancreatic homeostasis. Further research is now needed to fully understand the mechanism by which PEPITEM regulates pancreatic islet size and function, and if this is uncoupled from lipid storage.

This demonstrates significant distinction between wild and lab mouse bone marrows that may provide a better understanding of the role of the immune system in a natural environment.

Written by Edd James, Louisa James and Donald Palmer. \u00a9Shutterstock/vchalImmune responses to viral infections are generally more robust in females compared with males. Hormonal differences likely play a role, however, the molecular basis for this difference is unclear. Here, Cheng and colleagues show that natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in this difference. Despite males having increased numbers of NK cells, they produced lower levels of interferon-g when stimulated ex vivo and impaired killing of target cells. Examining the gene expression on the X chromosome showed that Kdm6a, which encodes the protein UTX and is an epigenetic regulator, escapes X inactivation increasing expression in females. Importantly, in female mice, if one Kdm6a allele is deleted, NK cells increase in number and exhibit impaired function like that observed in male mice. This highlights the important role of UTX in the molecular basis of sex differences in the immune system. Cheng et al. 2023 Nature Immunology 24 780-791The X-linked infant conferring immunity to respiratory infectionT follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) are critical for regulating antigen-induced antibody responses while preventing autoimmunity. Le Coz et al. established a model system to determine the contributions of T regulatory cells (Treg) versus T follicular helper cells (Tfh) to the human Tfr pool. They found evidence of clonal sharing between Tfr and both Treg and Tfh. The absence of a clonal relationship between Treg and Tfh suggested that both Tfh and Treg contribute separately to the Tfr pool. Transcriptomics analysis confirmed this dual contribution and identified key differences between Tfr that originate from Tregs versus those originating from Tfh. The authors found that Treg-derived Tfr were located largely within the follicular mantle and have suppressive capacity, suggestive of a primary role regulating autoreactive T cells. In contrast, Tfh-derived Tfr, which could be distinguished by CD38 expression, were located within the germinal centres and have suppressive activity but retain the ability to augment antibody production. Le Coz et al. 2023 Science Immunology 8 DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.ade8162 Impaired JAK-STAT pathway signalling in leukocytes of older people Environmental stresses in early life can predispose individuals to various disorders in later life. Indeed, poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy increases susceptibility to severe lower respiratory infections in early life . Sikder et al. further explored this phenomenon with the observation that viral infection of neonatal mice that were reared on a low-fibre diet during pregnancy exhibited severe lower respiratory infections associated with a type 2 inflammation along with airway remodelling. Associated with a reduction of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and Tregs in the lung of infected mice, which is necessary to prevent this disorder, further studies revealed that this is due to a decline in the intestinal production of the DC growth factor Flt3L. Mechanistically, the low-fibre diet altered both the microbiome of maternal milk along with the intestine of neonatal mice resulting in alteration of Flt3L production. Overall, these studies highlight the possible impact of maternal diet towards the aetiology of various immunological disorders.
