Wish you had someone to help you figure out these things? You're in the right place then! Let's get on the same page here for a minute. Motherhood leaves you feeling depleted, doesn't? You give all you have to everyone (and some days that might not be your ideal) and then you are left with nothing or even negative nothing. Keeping the balls in the air all the time is exhausting. Such a heavy mental load, right? When you're a sensitive woman, you feel all that even more. Then there's the perfectionist in you that is striving to juggle and live up to your own high expectation. I love helping moms out that suffer from this taxing (and yes, VERY rewarding) life. Please know it doesn't have to be this draining all the time; I help women by addressing to important and often neglected parts of ourselves\u2014our spirituality and physical health. We talk about what they are doing for their physical bodies (and, girl\u2014there is no shame here around eating habits or carrying the pregnancy weight around after they are born). We discuss their vitamin levels, thyroid health, water intake and many other factors that might be easy wins to help them feel better. However, you are just not skin and bones. You are a soul who is making your way through this life. Maybe you're at a point that you just don't feel like you anymore. Perhaps you are looking to find deeper meaning in your life. Spirituality is an amazing tool for helping us find dormant or suppressed parts of ourselves. There are so many things to try and use, there is no ONE single right path to find yourself. I've done so much of this work myself being a detective for my own life and I want to share what I know with you to get you feeling comforted, supported & living a really satisfying life. What makes me great at helping moms in this way? My quick bio is that I'm a mom to two amazing kids, SAHM who also has passion projects brewing like this, wife, non-toxic lifestyle advocate, certified life coach, and energy healer. I love making moms feel supported, seen, and capable! Around here, I'm super passionate about being connected with who we really are (via spirituality) and healing our physical bodies (via natural approaches and healthy(ier) lifestyles). "}
