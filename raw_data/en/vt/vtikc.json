Here are summaries of a few of the recent studies that grabbed our attention here at Holistic Primary Care. Horsetail Extract Matches Thiazide for BP Regulation A standardized extract of Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) produced clinically and statistically significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with Stage I systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). The effects were comparable to those seen with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in this head-to-head comparison trial. Researchers at the Federal University of Goi\u00e1s, Brazil, randomized the cohort of 58 people to either HCTZ, 25 mg per day, or 900 mg per day of a dry extract of the Equisetum for a total of three months. They assessed systolic, diastolic, and casual blood pressure (the sum of stable basal pressure measured at rest and labile pressure measured during physical and mental stimulation) every 30 days. Daily ingestion of the horsetail extract resulted in a 12.6 mmHg mean decrease in systolic pressure, and an 8.1 mmHg drop in diastolic pressure. This translated into a mean casual pressure of 134/84.5 mmHg at the close of the study, compared with 145/95.7 mmHg at baseline (Carneiro DM, et al. Phytomedicine. 2022). HCTZ performed equally, and there were no significant differences between the herb and the drug on any of the parameters measured in this study. Both were well-tolerated, with few adverse effects reported for either of them. An ancient plant, Equisetum is widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere even as far north as Scandinavia. It is also present, though to a lesser degree, in the southern hemisphere. It has a long history of use in Austrian herbal medicine, usually taken as a tea or via compresses, for treatment of skin, kidney, and rheumatic disorders. This study, though preliminary suggests it could have a role in the management of hypertension, especially in patients who are reluctant to use pharmaceuticals. Tomato Lycopene Lowers Systolic BP Daily supplementation with 15 mg or more of tomato-derived lycopene for eight weeks can reduce systolic blood pressure by a mean of 2.6 mmHg. That's the upshot of a new metanalysis of 10 studies representing nearly 700 total subjects. Mahnaz Rezaei Kelishadi and colleagues at the School of Nutrition and Food Science, Isfahan University, Iran, report that the pressure-mitigating effect of this unique carotenoid\u2014found abundantly in tomatoes, watermelon, and papayas\u2014was greatest in people with baseline systolic pressures over 130 mmHg (Kelishadi MR, J Herb Med. 2022). While there was no effect on diastolic pressure in the aggregate analysis, the investigators did find significant diastolic reductions in the studies that enrolled patients with baseline diastolic pressure over 80 mmHg. This new report corroborates a 2017 metanalysis by investigators at Northumbria University, UK, looking at 21 studies of lycopene and other tomato-based products. They concluded that lycopene supplementation, and increased intake of tomatoes has positive effects on blood lipids, blood pressure and endothelial function (Cheng HM, et al. Athersoclerosis. 2017). Oregano Mitigates Burden of Parkinson's Disease A tea made from Origanum majorana (aka oregano) can reduce depression and other non-motor symptoms associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, according to a recent placebo-controlled study by researchers at Sousse University in Tunisia. A total of 60 patients were randomized to a self-prepared placebo herbal tea, or a self-prepared infusion of 5 g oregano (2 spoonfuls) in 100 ml boiling water per day. After 30 days, those in the oregano group showed significant reductions in their Beck Depression Inventory and Non-Motor Symptom Scale scores. There were no such changes in the placebo group. Neither group showed changes in motor symptom scores. Infusions made from fresh or dried oregano are a common and longstanding part of traditional North African medicine. There were no adverse effects associated with daily consumption of oregano tea at this dose level. (Chahra C, et Relat Adhesion Carnosic acid, a phytochemical produced in abundance by the culinary herb Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) can block the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from attaching to ACE2 receptors on human epithelial cells, according to researchers at the Tokyo University of Technology, and Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. Classified as a phenolic diterpene, carnosic acid exerts direct anti-inflammatory effects, potentially quelling the NLRP3 inflammasome activation that drives much of the tissue damage associated with Covid-19. CA can downregulate inflammation via several other mechanisms as well: it inhibits macrophage expression of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)), and it minimizes production of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) reactive nitrogen species. Since it can pass the blood brain barrier, and is able to reach the brain parenchyma, CA may be neuroprotective against the neurodegenerative sequelae of long Covid. \"CA appears to inhibit the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection by two mechanisms, one at the point of viral entry, possibly through covalent binding to the ACE2 receptor protein, and the other by ameliorating cytokine storm through the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, CA represents a potential therapeutic for COVID-19,\" write Takumi Satoh and colleagues. Researchers at Oregon State University recently showed that cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA)\u2014two compounds naturally produced by Cannabis sativa\u2014can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, at least in vitro. Richard van Breemen and colleagues used a technique called affinity selection mass spectrometry to screen a host of plant compounds, including cannabinoids, to see which might have potential to bind target molecules on the virus. Then, in a proof of concept experiment, they showed that CBGA and CBDA could block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into human epithelial cell cultures (Van Breemen RB, et al. J Nat Prod. 2022.) \"Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use, these cannabinoids, isolated or in hemp extracts, have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2,\" says van Breemen. He added that CBGA and CBDA are not controlled substances like THC, the most well-known psychoactive compound found in produced by the Cannabis genus, and they have a good safety profile in humans. \"Cell entry inhibitors, like the acids from hemp, could be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and also to shorten infections by preventing virus particles from infecting human cells. They bind to the spike proteins so those proteins can't bind to the ACE2 enzyme, which is abundant on the outer membrane of endothelial cells in the lungs and other organs,\" writes van Breemen. Cannabis is only one of many plants that produce compounds that can block entry of SARS-CoV-2. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) is another. Researchers at the Peking University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences screened over 100 distinct licorice-derived phytochemicals for their ability to attach to key receptor-binding sites on viral spike proteins. They found two such compounds-triterpenoids licorice-saponin A3 (A3) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)\u2014that showed strong affinity for the spike proteins. This suggests that they could potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking entry and replication of the virus (Yi Y, et al. J Adv Res. 2022). Though the findings are preliminary, the authors hold that \"these triterpenoids may contribute to the clinical efficacy of licorice for COVID-19 and could be promising candidates for antiviral drug development.\" High Intake of Plant Omega-3Lowers HF Death Rates Patients with heart failure (HF) who are in the highest two quartiles for circulating levels of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)\u2014a acid\u2014had a 39% lower risk of HF-associated hospitalization and death than those in the lowest quartiles. Iolanda L\u00e1zaro and colleagues at the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, used gas chromatography to study serum ALA levels\u2014measured as a percentage of total serum phospholipids\u2014in a cohort of 905 ambulatory HF patients. The subjects had a mean age of 67, and roughly two-thirds were male. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, HF-specific death, and HF-associated hospitalization during a median follow-up of 2.4 years. Compared with patients in the lowest ALA quartile, those in the top two quartiles had a 49% lower rate of death due to HF, and a 42% lower rate of HF-related hospitalizations (L\u00e1zaro I, et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2022). Surprisingly, they found no such correlations between HF outcomes and fish-based omega-3s (EPA and DHA), suggesting that ALA\u2014found in flax seed, walnuts, chia, hemp, and purslane-has different modes of action from the marine-derived omegas. The authors suggest that patients with low ALA levels \"might be a target population in whom to test dietary ALA-rich interventions to promote quality of life.\" In an editorial accompanying the L\u00e1zaro paper, heart failure expert Abdallah Al-Mohammad, of the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, UK, postulated that ALA confers its benefits by mitigating the inflammation that exacerbates HF. He views the L\u00e1zaro study as \"hypothesis-generating,\" but not as definitive proof that ALA interventions would lower HF morbidity and mortality. A\u00e7a\u00ed Reduces Arterial Stiffness Daily 200 grams of anthocyanidin-rich A\u00e7a\u00ed-ju\u00e7ara (Euterpe edulis Martius) pulp resulted in a measurable change in pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, in a cohort of overweight individuals. In recent years, A\u00e7a\u00ed has become popular worldwide as a \"superfood\" owing to its high content of fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidant compounds. Cardiologists at the Rio Grande do Sul/University Foundation of Cardiology, Porto Alegre, Brazil, randomized 55 people with body mass index measurements of 25 kg/m2 or greater, to restricted calorie diet plans that did or did not include daily intake of A\u00e7a\u00ed, the small purple fruits of a particular species of Amazonian palm trees. After 12 weeks, the subjects in the a\u00e7a\u00ed group showed a statistically significant reduction in PWV from baseline. This is suggestive of reduced arterial stiffness. The researchers did not find any difference between the two groups on measurements of peripheral vascular resistance, or endothelial flow-mediated dilation. Saffron Comparable to Ritalin for Kids with ADHD An open label pilot study involving 53 children and adolescents with ADHD shows that oral supplementation with Saffr'activ\u2014a standardized extract of saffron (Crocus sativus)\u2014was comparable to the drug Ritalin (methylphenidate) in reducing subjective and objective signs and symptoms of ADHD and hyperactivity. A multicenter research team in Spain recruited a cohort of ADHD patients, ranging in age from 7 to 17 years. All the kids, and their families, participated in a psychoeducation program. They were then given a choice to go on extended-release methylphenidate (titrated up to 1 mg/kg per day) or the saffron extract (30 mg/day). There were 27 patients in the methylphenidate group, and 36 in the saffron group, and they remained on treatment for 3 months. Saffron produces a number of compounds including crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal, which interact with NDMA and GABA receptors in the human nervous system, thus promoting the secretion of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalin. The Spanish researchers point out that dopamine and noradrenalin are the key neurotransmitters associated with ADHD. They evaluated the kids at baseline and again after 3 months using an array of standardized assessment tools including the 18-item Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP)-IV questionnaire to measure inattention and hyperactivity; the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function\u2014Second Edition (BRIEF-2) which measures inhibition, flexibility, emotional control, initiative, working memory, planification, self-supervision, material organization, and task supervision; and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). They also used the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, version 3 (CPT-3), a task-based test that gives objective measurements of impulsivity and the ability to sustain attention. The CPT-3 is a direct measure that, unlike the other tests, does not depend on the impressions of an external observer. \"The most relevant finding is that both treatments showed statistically significant improvements in both core ADHD symptoms and executive functions. More importantly, they were comparable in terms of efficacy, measured with both pen-and-paper tests filled out by parents, and objective measures,\" report Hilario Blasco-Fontecilla and colleagues. There were no major differences between methylphenidate and the saffron on any of the major ADHD parameters, though the researchers did note that saffron appeared to be more effective for reducing hyperactivity symptoms, while methylphenidate was more effective on symptoms of inattention. Some parents of kids in the saffron group reported a marked improvement in their childrens' speed of falling asleep\u2014a finding not seen in the drug group (Blasco-Fontecilla H, et al. Nutrients. 2022). Overall, the herb was on par with the drug. The Spanish researchers note that their data are in accord with three earlier studies all of which showed some degree of efficacy for extracts of saffron in treatment of ADHD. However, those studies were entirely dependent on subjective pen-and-paper evaluations, and did not include objective measures. Though they acknowledge the limitations of their study-particularly the fact that it was not blinded or randomized\u2014they believe their findings support a role for Saffr'activ in the care of children with ADHD. It could be a viable option for parents reluctant to put their kids on stimulant drugs. Green Tea Extract ReducesUV Skin Damage Oral supplementation with antioxidant-rich green tea extracts appears to have a protective effect against skin damage caused by ultraviolet radiation exposure. Antonella Di Sotto and colleagues at the Sapienza University of Rome, analyzed data from 12 clinical studies specifically looking at green tea preparations for prevention or treatment of skin diseases. Most of these studies were focused on photoaging and UV-induced erythema\u2014that's sunburn in common language. The trials varied widely in their size, inclusion and exclusion criteria, green tea products and doses tested, and observed outcomes. Most of the studies looked at products containing between 40% and 70% catechins. Overall the data are supportive of the notion that green tea\u2014or compounds derived from it\u2014may have potential sunscreen effects. \"The evidence supports the use of oral green tea preparations to protect skin from damage induced by low-dose ultraviolet radiation,\" wrote De Sotto and colleagues (Di Sotto A, et al. Nutrients. 2022). \"However, a higher than 2-month supplementation period seems to be needed for clinically visible improvements on the skin.\" Green tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves produce many catechins. The most well-known is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has been shown in multiple cell culture and animal studies to inhibit a range of different types of cancer cells (Chakrawarti L, et al. Exp Op Ther Patents. 2016). EGCG and other green tea polyphenols are often marketed in dietary supplements for stress reduction, tissue regeneration, immune system regulation, and antioxidant defense. Di Sotto and colleagues note that while catechins may indeed have photoprotective effects, other phytochemicals may also play a role. While oral green tea preparations won't likely be pushing Coppertone off the sunscreen shelves any time soon, they could have an adjuvant role in helping people prevent the cutaneous downsides of sun exposure. New data from the third generation of the Framingham Heart Study indicate that higher red blood cell Omega-3 concentrations correlate with healthier brain structure and better cognitive function in midlife. The study also suggests that the effects of Omega-3 fatty acids on the brain are mediated, to some degree by apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. \"In multivariable models, higher Omega-3 index was associated with larger hippocampal volumes and better abstract reasoning,\" reported Claudia Satizabal, PhD, Univeristy of Texas San Antonio, the lead author of the Framingham paper which was published in the journal Neurology. \"Our results, albeit exploratory, suggest that higher Omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are related to better brain structure and cognitive function.\" Several previous epidemiological studies have shown correlations between Omega-3 levels, improved brain function, and attenuated risk of stroke or dementia. But interventional studies with Omega-3 supplements or high Omega-3 diets have given variable and inconclusive results. Dr. Satizabal and colleagues surmise that this is because nearly all previous studies have involved elderly subjects in whom brain changes may already be advanced and cognitive impairment is entrenched. The new Framingham study is the first to look at the relationship between Omega-3 Index (the relative percentage of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in red blood cell membranes), and brain structure and function in middle-aged individuals. After controlling for a range of demographic and biometric variables and potentially confounding factors, the Framingham investigators found a clear correlation between Omega-3 index readings and hippocampal volume on MRI. The Omega-3 index more accurately reflects overall dietary intake of Omega-3 fatty acids over the prior three months than does measurement of plasma Omega-3 levels at isolated points in time. \"In the brain, DHA is incorporated into neuronal and glial cell membranes, particularly in grey matter and synapses,\" the Framingham authors write. \"Both DHA and EPA are metabolized into bioactive molecules involved in neurogenesis, neurotransmission, and inflammation resolution.\" A Younger Population The new study involved 2,183 dementia- and stroke-free participants, who had a mean age 46 years. A majority of the subjects were from the Framingham Third Generation cohort, meaning that they are grandchildren of participants in the original Framingham Heart Study which was begun in 1948. The investigators also included over 900 subjects from the Framingham Omni 1 and 2 cohorts comprised exclusively of non-white individuals. Over half of the participants are women (53%), and 22% are carriers the APOE-e4 gene. Nearly 60% held college degrees or above. The median Omega-3 Index reading was 4.6% (interquartile range 3.8-5.8), which Satizabal and colleagues state is \"consistent with cohorts of similar age, but slightly lower than older cohorts.\" \"What's important about this study is that it replicates what we saw in the Framingham Offspring 10 years ago, in subjects who had an average age of 66. However, this study represents Generation 3, their kids essentially, who had an average of 46.\" William S. Harris, PhD, President, Fatty Acid Research Institute All participants underwent brain MRIs, to measure total brain volume, total gray matter and hippocampal volume, as well as white matter hyperintensity volumes. They also took an array of standardized neuropsychological tests close to the times of the MRIs, to assess episodic memory, logical memory, processing speed, executive function, and abstract reasoning. Structural & Functional Differences After controlling for a range of demographic and biometric variables and potentially confounding factors, the Framingham investigators found a clear correlation between Omega-3 index readings and hippocampal volume on MRI. Mean hippocampal volume was 6.9 cm3 for the participants in the top three quartiles for Omega-3 index, versus 6.8 cm3 among those in the lowest quartile. \"Every standard deviation unit increase of log-transformed Omega-3 index was related to 0.003 cm3 larger hippocampal volumes relative to intracranial volume,\" Satizabal and colleagues report. The difference was statistically significant, and the general correlation also held for EPA and DHA levels independently of the composite Omega-3 index (Satizabal C, et al. Neurology. 2022). Participants with DHA levels and Omega-3 index readings in the three upper quartiles had larger total gray and cortical gray matter volumes, as compared with those in the bottom quartile. Notably, there was an association between higher Omega-3 index, higher DHA levels and lower white matter hyperintensity volumes. Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are regions of macrostructural brain damage that correlate with neurocognitive and neuromotor decline. In addition to the structural changes, Omega-3 levels also correlated with differences in cognitive performance. Specifically, higher levels of all omega-3 parameters-EPA, DHA, and the Omega-3 index\u2014were associated with significantly better performances on the Similarities test, a standardized assessment of abstract reasoning. This correlation remained robust after adjusting for vascular (ie, stroke) risk factors. \"Every standard deviation unit increase of log-transformed Omega-3 index was related to 0.003 cm3 larger hippocampal volumes relative to intracranial volume,\" Claudia Satizabal, PhD, University of Texas, San Antonio Impact of APOE The Framingham researchers found that APOE-e4 status had some effect on the relationship between Omega-3 levels and indicators of brain health. For example, the positive relationship between higher DHA levels and increased hippocampal volume was only present in participants who were non-carriers of the APOE-e4 allele. It was not seen in carriers of the gene. On the other hand, the reduction in WMH seen in connection with higher EPA, DHA, and Omega-3 index levels, was only found in the APOE-e4 carriers. Carriers also showed a relationship between increasing EPA levels and better performance on the Similarities test. This was not seen in the non-carriers. \"Stratification by APOE status in our study suggested distinct potentially protective associations of omega-3 PUFA with gray and white matter.\" The clinical significance of these APOE-related effects is not entirely clear. But given that APOE has a role in the transport and metabolism of lipids, and is involved in the movement of omega-3 fatty acids into the brain, it makes sense that gene-based variations in APOE would influence the relationship between circulating Omega-3 levels and brain function. The Framingham authors note that their findings are in line with population studies suggesting differential effects by APOE status in the association between omega-3 PUFA and neurocognitive indicators. \"It has been suggested that APOE-e4 carriers have different patterns of brain activity at younger ages, including larger white matter volumes, better white matter integrity on DTI (diffusion tensor MRI), as well as better attention. Alternatively, the beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA on brain white matter may occur through other pathways related to reductions of vascular risk factors that may contribute to cerebral small vessel disease.\" Satizabal and colleagues believe APOE status is an important consideration for future studies of the impact of Omega-3s on brain health. It is a factor that has usually been overlooked in past studies, and it could account for some of the discrepancies between observational studies showing robust correlations between Omega-3s and brain health, and interventional studies giving equivocal outcomes. Start Early Past interventional studies may also be hindered by the fact that most of them tested diet or supplement interventions in elderly people who already have significant cognitive impairment. In other words, the interventions are started too late in the course of the disease. \"Epidemiological and intervention studies suggest omega-3 PUFA may be most beneficial to preserve brain health from early midlife, as our study suggests, and just before the onset of moderate cognitive changes.\" \"What's important about this study is that it replicates what we saw in the Framingham Offspring 10 years ago, in subjects who had an average age of 66. However, this study represents Generation 3, their kids essentially, who had an average of 46,\" explained William S. Harris, PhD, one of the authors of the current study. Harris is also president of the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI), and co-inventor of the Omega-3 Index testing method. \"The results of this study show that low red blood cell DHA levels are associated with smaller brain volumes and a 'vascular' pattern of cognitive impairment, even in persons free of clinical dementia,\" said Harris in a press release following publication of the Satizabal study. \"This suggests that intervening early and maintaining an optimal Omega-3 Index (8% or higher) could play an important role in staving off cognitive decline, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's in the long-term,\" Dr. Harris said. A large CSIRO study of a commercially available krill oil supplement showed that patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) obtained modest but meaningful improvements in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function after supplementing with krill oil. Krill (Euphausia superba) \u2014 a diverse group of small marine crustaceans \u2014 are among the world's most abundant species in terms of total biomass. Researchers estimate there are 300,000 million metric tons in the Antarctic Ocean alone. Like fish, krill are rich in the inflammation-reducing eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA). Patients with the highest levels of inflammation at baseline\u2014as indicated by elevated baseline C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels-experienced significantly greater improvements in knee pain following krill oil treatment than those with low or medium degrees of inflammation at baseline. Omega-3 supplements generally, and fish oils in particular, are known for their anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous fish oil studies offer evidence of its ability to quell inflammation. The literature on krill oil, however, is far less robust. The CSIRO team, headed by Dr. Welma Stonehouse, proposed that krill oil could impact OA-related pain via similar anti-inflammatory mechanisms observed for fish oil. Their randomized, placebo-controlled trial took place at four clinical sites across Australia over six months. It included 235 healthy adults between 40 and 65 years of age. All participants had clinical diagnoses of mild to moderate knee OA and habitually consumed low amounts of long-chain (LC) omega-3 (-3) fatty acids in their diets. None used fish oil supplements. The investigators split the participants into two groups: a treatment group receiving 4 grams of krill oil per day (4 one-gram capsules), and a control group that took a vegetable oil placebo. Participants were instructed to take the assigned capsules with or immediately after a meal. The krill supplement-a popular Australian retail brand containing the Superba BOOST manufactured by Aker BioMarine-provided 1 g krill oil (E. superba oil; 0.15 g EPA, 0.07 g DHA) and 0.11 mg of astaxanthin per capsule, totaling 880 mg of -3 and 45 mg astaxanthin daily. According to the investigators, the recognized dosage at which EPA in combination with DHA typically exert an anti-inflammatory response is >2 g per day. They point out that 73% of the EPA and DHA in Superba krill oil is phospholipid-bound, which they suggest would \"facilitate more efficient incorporation of long-chain -3 PUFAs into tissues than triglyceride form.\" Owing to fact that the -3s are phospholipid-bound, \"krill oil's anti-inflammatory effect would be greater than what would be expected based on its long-chain -3 PUFA content alone.\" The 4-gram daily dosage was deliberately set higher than the levels used in prior knee OA studies, \"so as to facilitate an anti-inflammatory response, but in amounts suitable as a complementary medicine.\" Supplementation with krill oil translated clearly into an increase in blood -3s levels, as indicated by changes in the OmegaQuant Omega-3 Index\u2014a measure of -3 content in red blood cell membranes. In the krill group, participants' mean Omega-3 Index increased from 6.0% at baseline to 8.9% at 3 months and to 9.0% at 6 months. In the placebo group, on the other hand, the levels did not change, with Omega-3 Index measurements remaining between 5.4% and 5.5% throughout the study. Reduced Pain & Stiffness The CSIRO researchers assessed OA severity at baseline, three months, and six months, using a visual analog self-assessment scale. They quantified changes in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scales. The krill and the placebo groups both showed some degree of improvement of knee pain over the course of the trial, but, the krill group showed a greater decrease. The difference in adjusted mean change between groups at 6 months was 5.18 (95% CI: 10.0, 0.32; P = 0.04). Closer analysis indicated that patients with the highest levels of inflammation at baseline\u2014as indicated by elevated baseline C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels-experienced significantly greater improvements in knee pain following krill oil treatment than those with low or medium degrees of inflammation at baseline. Compared with the placebo group, the patients taking krill oil also showed greater improvements in knee stiffness and physical function. The difference in adjusted mean change of WOMAC scores between the two groups at 6 months was 6.45 for knee stiffness; 4.67 for physical function; and -4.83 for total knee score. All of these changes were statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of need for NSAIDs. Safer Therapies Needed Though krill oil cannot be considered a \"cure\" for OA, the results of the Stonehouse study do hold promise for patients who suffer from OA-associated joint inflammation and pain. OA is a major cause of chronic pain and disability worldwide. While conventional drug therapies\u2014typically NSAIDs-may provide some symptomatic relief, they do little to quell the underlying drivers of inflammation. Stonehouse and colleagues note that, \"Owing to the adverse effects associated with long-term NSAID use, there is a need to identify alternative therapies that can safely and effectively reduce pain and inflammation and improve function.\" Krill oil differs structurally from other dietary sources of -3 in that it delivers a relatively high amount of -3 PUFAs in phospholipid form rather than triglyceride form (the primary source of EPA and DHA in fish oil). Preliminary research suggests that the -3s in krill oil might have a higher bioavailability than those in fish oil. There's some evidence that krill's higher relative phospholipid content could facilitate -3 incorporation into the tissues more efficiently than fish oil. Krill also confers the additional inflammation-lowering benefits of astaxanthin, a naturally occurring red pigment that acts as an antioxidant. Astaxanthin exists in only a handful of natural sources, including salmon, shrimp, trout, crayfish, algae, and yeast. Closing the Research Gap The CSIRO trial is the largest, longest, and highest-dose krill oil study to date, at least in the context of OA. The main result was a significant increase in Omega-3 Index to 9% after 6 months, which translated into a modest but significant reduction in knee pain and stiffness, and improvements in physical function of affected joints. Prior to the CSIRO trial, studies of krill supplementation and OA were mostly small, short, and used very low krill dosages. In addition to confirming krill oil's anti-inflammatory properties, the CSIRO data showed that it is remarkably safe. There were no worrisome adverse events during the 6-month trial period. Further, the patients taking the krill oil did not report any of the undesirable effects sometimes linked to fish oil, such as \"fish burps,\" flatulence, diarrhea, or bleeding/vascular complications. Krill oil is also free from the strong fishy aroma associated with fish oil supplements that some people find unpleasant. That said, krill oil is not suitable for individuals with shellfish or seafood allergies. Since it is from an animal source, it is not an option for strict vegans and vegetarians, and since it is derived from crustaceans, it is not appropriate for people who follow the Kosher dietary restrictions. By design, the Australian researchers recruited patients with mild to moderate knee OA for this trial, but excluded those with more severe conditions. That decision was based on the view that severe knee OA, \"may be beyond the point of improvement with a supplement or may require high doses of NSAIDs that may mask any supplement effect.\" For patients with milder, early-stage OA\u2014in whom there is a possibility to reduce knee pain and improve function, krill oil supplementation is a promising option. A number of assessment tools can be used to determine if a patient is at risk of myocardial damage caused by cardiometabolic disease and/or COVID infection. Many of these tests also reflect the general dysfunction of cellular metabolism that underlies a host of chronic conditions. Vitamin D3 Level: There are so many good reasons to measure a patient's level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) in the blood. Vitamin D3 is important for the prevention and treatment of heart disease and viral infections. It is a simple inverse relationship: if vitamin D is low, risk is higher. Statistically, low vitamin D correlates strongly with COVID risk. Vitamin D also activates many cancer prevention genes; women with high levels of vitamin D3 (60-90 ng/ml) have an 82% lower risk for breast cancer. Most studies indicate that risk of CVD rises when vitamin D levels drop below 30 ng/ml. Optimal levels for protection against CVD are in the range of 60-90 ng/ml. GlycoMark: The GlycoMark test measures blood levels of 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a glucose-like sugar found in many foods. It is an indicator of the average maximum blood glucose level over the previous 14 days. A sharp decrease in circulating 1,5-AG signals that a patient has frequent post-prandial glucose surges and greater risk. According to the company that makes the test, two people with similar A1C levels in the 7-8% range may have very different glucose variations throughout a day. Roughly 40% of people with \"healthy\" A1Cs have persistent glucose spikes, putting them at high risk for cardiometabolic complications. GlycoMark is an adjunct to standard glucose tests. It is a simple well-validated tool for early detection of glucose dysregulation. A reading of 3 ug/ml or lower indicates potential problems; a reading above 10 indicates better glucose regulation. Homocysteine: This is a great test to determine if the body has adequate levels of B vitamins, especially B6, B12 and folic acid. Deficiencies in these vitamins often indicate future cardiovascular and cognitive problems, as well as hormone-related diseases, potential birth defects, and many other health challenges. C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Inflammation is a key driver of CVD, along with other chronic diseases and CRP is a reliable indicator of inflammation. It provides an early warning for heart disease and many other chronic problems. Often triggered by the presence of free radicals and oxidative stress, high CRP is an early warning sign for heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. 8-OHgD test: 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a byproduct of oxidative damage to guanine bases in DNA, which makes it a good indicator of DNA damage caused by chemical toxins in the air, water or food, as well as various forms of radiation. A high level of 8-OHgD in urine indicates increased oxidative stress, thus providing an early warning of disease. The acceptable or \"normal\" levels on the 8-OHgD urine test are 43.9+/-42.1 ng/mg ng/mg creatinine in males. Galectin-3 (Gal-3): This molecule plays important roles in normal cell adhesion, cell growth, and chemoattraction. However, Gal-3 elevations indicates that something is wrong. High Gal-3 is strongly associated with ventricular remodeling, heart failure, and stroke. It is also associated with some forms of cancer. Gal-3 is over-expressed on cancer cell surfaces, and actually helps them to stick to one another. It also circulates in the blood, indicating that cancers are attempting to metastasize. Because it can signal the possibility of multiple diseases, Gal-3 measurement is not a stand-alone diagnostic test for any particular condition. But it is a useful biomarker of chronic inflammation, tissue fibrosis, and possible neoplasia. From a CVD perspective, serum Gal-3 levels below 18 ng/ml are considered low-risk; readings above 25 ng/ml suggest high risk for heart failure. Oximetry: A simple finger oximeter can provide important signals. If oxygen levels are low, the mitochondria do not produce enough energy and cells are not able to function properly. Most finger oximeters use a 100-point scale: the desired level is from 96 to 100. As oxygen level drops, cellular metabolic problems increase. Vascular damage and vasoconstriction are primary causes of low readings. In some cases, this reflects infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF): VEGF is a signal protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in response to low levels of oxygen. It can also produce a profound increase in vascular permeability and edema. Over- and under-expression of VEGF can both create problems. Too much VEGF can lead to excess vessel growth and excess permeability of capillaries. Too little can lead to a lack of oxygenation in tissues, which can trigger symptoms of chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS). Most studies establish the optimal range of VEGF to be between 31 pg/ml and 86 pg/ml. Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT): This enzyme is found in many organs in the body, with higher concentrations in the liver where it helps to deliver cysteine for intercellular glutathione synthesis. While predominately a marker of liver disease, elevated serum GGT also indicates oxidative stress, often associated with excessive alcohol consumption, heavy metal exposure, heart disease, and diabetes. High GGT can also be associated with increased cancer risk. Typical reference ranges are 15-85 IU/L for men, and 5-55 IU/L for women. Magnesium RBC: Magnesium has many physiological roles. One of the most important is glucose and insulin transport. The level of magnesium in red blood cells is the best indicator of overall magnesium levels in the body. Mg deficiency is associated with diabetes, and a host of cardiometabolic problems. It is also linked to increased cancer risk. The reference range for magnesium RBC tests is 4.26.8 mg/dL. D-dimer: D-dimer is a small protein fragment that results from fibrinolysis. High levels are associated with deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. It is also a biomarker of abnormal clots associated with COVID-19 infection or in response to a COVID vaccine (if the test is done within ten days of diagnosis or injection). A four-fold increase in D-dimer is an indicator of poor prognosis in hospitalized COVID patients. In adult males and non-pregnant females, the threshold is 0.5 ug/ml. Omega 3/6 ratio: This test measures the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in the blood. In broad-stroke terms, omega-3 is anti-inflammatory, while omega 6 is inflammatory. We need both to maintain health, but they need to be in the right balance. Too much omega-6 drives inflammation and raises risk of CVD and other diseases. A good ratio is in the range of 2 to1 or 3 to1, favoring the omega-3s. MRI Plaque View: This relatively new assessment tool shows the actual morphology of atherosclerotic plaques, including multi-contrast identification of the lipid core, calcification, and hemorrhage potential. It indicates maximum carotid wall thickness, normalized wall index, and gives a lot of information about the health of the endothelial lining. It is an accurate way to assess plaque vulnerability to rupture, thus giving a clear picture of thrombosis risk. PULS Cardiac Test: The Protein Unstable Lesion Signature (PULS) Cardiac Test is another relatively new method that aggregates biomarkers of immune system activation and endothelial injury, including IL-16, MCP-3, Eotaxin, and sFas, along with HDL and hemoglobin A1c. It combines these variables into a composite score that predicts the odds that someone will have a heart attack within five years. There is good science to support this method, as summarized in a recent paper by Premyodhin and colleagues in Coronary Artery Disease. But PULS testing is not yet considered standard of care in cardiology. Cardiac surgeon Steven Gundry recently published an abstract looking at the effect of mRNA COVID vaccines on PULS scores. Gundry has been using PULS regularly for 8 years. He ran the PULS tests 2-10 weeks following patients' second doses of mRNA shots, and compared the scores to each patient's pre-vaccine levels. Based on those comparisons, he observed increases in IL-16, sFas, and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), which raised 5-year coronary event risk scores from an average 11% to 25%. Gundry concludes that mRNA vaccines trigger endothelial inflammation. The findings are not entirely surprising given that the purpose of a vaccine is to generate temporary inflammation. The question is whether the observed elevations are dangerous. Gundry's experiment did not include an unvaccinated control group, patients who received a non-mRNA vaccine, or people receiving any other type of conventional non-COVID vaccine. The paper gives no data about duration of the inflammatory surges. Further, there is no information given about PULS score changes during an acute COVID episode, which makes it difficult to gauge the potential vaccine risk Gundry is suggesting against the risks associated with severe COVID. His observations raise important questions that warrant attention. But without these comparators they are not conclusive. Charles K. Bens, PhD, is a nutritionist and educator based in Sarasota, FL. He is the founder of Healthy at Work, a corporate wellness program, and the author of 9 books, including Healthy at Work: Health in Your Pocket: Your Pocket Guide to Good Health. Reach Dr. Bens at: bensck@gmail.com Emerging research is challenging the long-held belief that tissue damage following myocardial infarction is permanent and irreversible. For decades, the conventional medical view has been that damaged myocardium cannot regenerate, owing to the fact that heart cells are not as readily replaced as are other cells in the body. Several research teams around the world, including a group based at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Heart Institute, are studying the mechanisms that put the brake on myocyte regeneration. This line of inquiry suggests that the myocardium might, in fact, have regenerative capacities, opening up a whole new world of treatment approaches. That's good news, given that CVD is the still the number one cause of death in North America. Every year, over 800,000 people in the US have heart attacks. Though 90%, at least initially, long-term sequelae can be debilitating. CVD prevalence will continue to rise if present trends continue. In a recent report from the Bogalusa Heart Study, nearly one-third of young adults (32%) in their 20s and 30s already show arterial plaque formation (Razavi AC, et al. JAHA. 2021). Much of the blame for that lies with unhealthy diet and lifestyle. COVID-19 can also cause myocardial damage. Many infected people suffer from rapidly-developing blood clots, endothelial inflammation, pericarditis, and myocarditis. Inflammation of the myocardium can lead to cardiomegaly, scarring, and death. Emerging research is challenging the long-held belief that tissue damage following myocardial infarction is permanent and irreversible. This line of inquiry suggests that the myocardium might, in fact, have regenerative capacities, opening up a whole new world of treatment approaches. There are also a small but significant number of myocarditis cases\u2014usually transient\u2014in people who have received the Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines. This seems to be most prevalent with 18-39 year-old males, and tends to occur after the second dose. According to a recent report by Steven Gundry, MD, in the journal Circulation, the vaccines can trigger a rise in inflammation markers like IL-16, soluble Fas, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Gundry S. Circulation. 2021). COVID long-haul patients are also drawing renewed attention to the issue of myocardial damage, since so many experience chronic heart problems. After treating long COVID sufferers for over fifteen months, it became clear to me that while most could achieve a general recovery from COVID via intensive nutrition and lifestyle-based protocols, roughly 50% need extra help resolving the cardiovascular problems. As I dug deeper into the medical literature I discovered research about nutraceuticals that show promise for helping COVID long-haulers to recover faster and better. Many of these nutrients and herbs may also help regenerate myocardium and improve cardiovascular function in people with non-COVID myocardial damage. Vitamin C: Vitamin C is crucial to the production of collagens, the most abundant proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and therefore the most abundant proteins in the body. The ECM has a fibrillar structure that provides a framework for tissue/organ morphogenesis, as well as for regeneration after injury. Vitamin C impacts ECM homeostasis by regulating collagen synthesis and maturation. It is also an antioxidant, able to prevent damage caused by free radicals. In the cardiovascular context, vitamin C's antioxidant capacity may mitigate endothelial damage following a heart attack or a viral infection such as COVID-19. Vitamin C is also influential as a co-factor in many enzymatic reactions that determine how stem cells differentiate during tissue repair. It therefore plays an important role in both the production of myocardial cells, and in cellular repair and replacement (D'Aniello C, et al. Stem Cells Intl. 2017). Vitamin D3:The roles of vitamin D3 in bone health, genetic expression, antiviral protection, and cancer prevention/treatment are well known. Less well known is the impact it has on cellular repair, especially cells in the heart and circulatory system. The endothelium is an active organ, not simply an inert lining which allowed water and electrolytes to pass through. One of its key functions is the maintenance of nitric oxide levels. Vitamin D3 plays a central role in that process, by increasing cytoprotective nitric oxide (NO) while reducing peroxynitrite\u2014an unstable nitrate isomer that can cause considerable oxidative damage. This favorable rebalancing allows endothelial cells to be repaired more rapidly. Experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures showed that vitamin D3 could effectively restore healthy NO/peroxynitrite balance in tissue perturbed by angiotensin-II. The authors conclude that \"vitamin D3-stimulated improvement of endothelial function may directly benefit the treatment of the dysfunction of the cardiovascular system.\" (Khan A, et al. Intl J Nanomedicine. 2017). Vitamin E: Vitamin E is particularly effective in protecting and repairing cell membranes due to its strong anti-oxidant properties. The benefits of vitamin E\u2014and tocotrienols in particular-in the treatment of heart disease, vascular disease, brain disorders, and fatty liver disease are well-documented. Vitamin E is also an efficient scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically targeting lipid oxidation. It can prevent oxidized fats from damaging DNA. Vitamin E also helps to extend the antioxidant neutralizing capacity of vitamin C, making these nutrients a powerful one-two punch . Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP): Citrus pectin is a naturally-occurring soluble fiber in the cell walls of citrus fruit peels. It is rich in beneficial -galactoside. However, pectin's long-chain polysaccharides are too large to be digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the benefits of ordinary citrus pectin are limited to the GI tract. It is possible to shorten the pectin fibers enzymatically, and through controlled changes in pH and heat. This enhances absorption, hence the term \"modified citrus pectin.\" Another step called de-esterification decreases the cross-linkages and gelling effects seen with unmodified pectin. It also renders the fiber ends more available to bind and inhibit Galectin-3, an adhesive cell surface protein that is a strong predictive marker for CVD and other inflammatory conditions. The Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) study showed that elevated serum Gal-3 correlated with a three-fold increase of all-cause mortality in a cohort of nearly 8,000 general population subjects followed for a median of 10 years (DeBoer RA, et al. J Intern Med. 2012). Data from nearly 3,000 patients in the Framingham Heart Study showed that elevated circulating Gal-3 correlates strongly with abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and other indicators of CVD (Nayor M, J Am Heart Assoc. 2016). MCP has a specific and very high binding affinity for human Gal-3. Researchers at the Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, showed that MCP ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, decreased myocardial injury and reduced collagen deposition in a rodent model of myocardial fibrosis. The MCP downregulated a host of pathogenic biomarkers related to inflammation and fibrosis. The data, though preclinical, do support the notion that Gal-3 is a therapeutic target in post-infarction myocardial fibrosis, and that MCP may help to reduce the damage (Xu GR, et al. Biomed & Pharmacotherapy. 2020). CoEnzyme Q10: This valuable nutraceutical has a proven track record for the prevention and the treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, MI, heart failure, viral myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, dyslipidemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other cardiometabolic conditions. CoQ10 can significantly improve cardiomyopathy related to genetic or acquired dysfunctions in the left ventricle or mitral valve. A daily dose of 200 mg ameliorated fatigue and dyspnea, reduced posterior wall thickness, and improved mitral valve function. In viral myocarditis, it is able to quell inflammation. It also exhibited strong anti-inflammatory properties during various heart surgery procedures, and during recovery, as measured by C-reactive protein levels. CoQ10 reduces the negative side effects\u2014especially myopathy\u2014of statin drugs. It helps to both prevent and treat heart failure by improving the heart's contractile force and increasing cellular oxygen levels. It also improves myocardial cell survival during ischemic events, and limits post-infarction myocardial remodeling (Zozina V, et al. Current Cardiol Rev. 2018). Magnesium: Severe magnesium deficiency can lead to heart attacks. Magnesium deficiency also sensitizes the myocardium to the toxic effects of various drugs, as well as to hypoxia. Long term magnesium deficiency may also lead to chronic electrical instability of the myocardium, by affecting the sodium and calcium flow into the cells. Extracellular magnesium ions exert a profound beneficial influence on the flexibility and structure of the arteries, arterioles, and veins. Most importantly, it is the transport agent that delivers glucose and oxygen to cell membranes and to the mitochondria for energy production. Several studies have shown that anywhere from 40% to 50% of all patients hospitalized for CVD-related events are magnesium deficient (DiNicvolantonio JJ, et al. OpenHeart. 2018). Supplementation has significant potential cardioprotective benefits. But one of the challenges is that while supplemental magnesium may cross cell membranes and enter into target cells, it does not always reach the mitochondria. The addition of berberine along with magnesium can help. Berberine: Berberine is a natural compound found in plants such as European barberry enhances cellular energy production via interactions with the Glut-4 molecule to transport glucose and oxygen from the inside of the cellular membrane to the mitochondria. By increasing the efficiency of glucose delivery, it lowers the levels of circulating glucose that can cause oxidative damage to the cardiovascular system Berberine possesses a variety of pharmacological and biological properties that can potentially enhance cardiovascular performance: it reduces myocardial apoptosis and necrosis; it is a agent that can mitigate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury; and also lowers serum cholesterol and LDL (Yu L, et al. Oxidative Med Cell Longevity. 2016) Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs): The ultimate goal of cardiac repair is to regenerate functionally viable myocardium, to prevent cardiac death. SPMs have unique properties that can play a big role in the repair process. SPMs are a subtype of Omega-3 fatty and maresins. Physiologically, SPMs signal the immune system to stop generating pro-inflammatory signals, and instead to accelerate the return to homeostasis. They play a unique role in helping the body to shut down the immune response, to minimize additional inflammation, to clear away damaged tissue, and to promote tissue remodeling. The degree of post-MI inflammatory damage is a major determinant of both the subsequent healing process and the long-term prognosis. Cardiomyocyte death leads to wall thinning, ventricular dilatation, fibrosis, and ultimately to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. In the wake of an MI, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes contribute to the clearance of dead cells, while activating reparative pathways. SPMs act on specific receptors to regulate the activity of these various leukocytes. SPMs also blunt the release of inflammatory mediators, and endothelial cell Soehnlei Front Pharmacol. 2018). Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is a red carotenoid pigment naturally produced by a type of microalgae called Haematococcus pluvialis and by some forms of yeast. It is well known for its ability to scavenge free radicals. Astaxanthin is itself able to capture free radicals, and it also stimulates production of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and it IL-1, also apoptosis, and modulates autophagy. In the context of CVD, there are several animal studies showing cardiac muscle preservation when astaxanthin is given either orally or intravenously prior to the induction of ischemia. The evidence is promising, though not yet confirmed in human studies (Fassett RG, Coombes JS. Molecules. 2012). Several recent review articles propose a role for astaxanthin in mitigating the cardiovascular and respiratory damage caused by the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Given its myriad anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, this is a reasonable hypothesis though again, there are not yet any clinical trials to prove efficacy. L-Taurine: Taurine is a unique sulfur-containing amino acid that influences many cellular functions including osmoregulation, antioxidation, ion movement modulation, and conjugation of bile acids. It is found in high concentrations in seaweed, shellfish, and fish, and to a lesser degree in beef, lamb, pork, and poultry. Taurine is much more than simply a building block for proteins. It is anti-inflammatory, and there's some evidence that it can benefit the cardiovascular system, possibly by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Following ischemia induced by coronary artery occlusion, taurine resulted in significantly smaller myocardial infarct size. It also elevated superoxide dismutase levels, and decreased interleukin and TNF-. In patients with heart failure, taurine improved tolerance and recovery during increased exercise. In a study of obese women, supplementation with 3 grams of taurine per day for eight weeks, resulted in meaningful weight loss and also significant drops in systemic inflammation (Rosa TC, et al. Eur J Nutr. 2014) In another study, continued supplementation with taurine corrected cardiomyopathy by restoring mitochondrial function and improving cardiac energy metabolism (Qaradakhi T, et al. Nutrients 2020). Arterosil: This innovative product is a supplemental form of rhamnan sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from two types of sea algae (Monostroma and Monostroma Nitidum). Rhamnan also anti-inflammatory agent (Okamoto T. J Natural Med. 2019). Arterosil is particularly effective in repairing damage to the endothelial glycocalyx, the gel-like glycoprotein layer that coats the inner surfaces of blood vessels. The glycocalyx is, essentially, the first line of endothelial defense, preventing the penetration of harmful substances like oxidized LDL, cholesterol, fats, inflammatory compounds and clotting factors. Glycocalyx damage is one of the first steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and it correlates strongly with many biochemical markers of CVD. Arterosil has myriad cardiovascular benefits. A Baylor University study showed that within hours of ingestion, arterial elasticity increased by an average of 89.6%. MRI studies of men and women with high-risk carotid artery plaques, showed average plaque regressions of 46.8% in men and 64% in women who took Arterosil for 3 months. There was also a 56% average reduction of the lipid core size in the carotid plaques, indicating a shift away from unstable plaques prone to rupture. In addition to the above list, the following nutraceuticals also deserve honorable mention in the context of preventing Lumbrokinase, and Hawthorn berry. END Charles K.

Reach Dr. Bens at: bensck@gmail.com Ahiflower oil, derived from the seeds of a plant called Buglossoides arvensis, provides a new vegan-friendly, sustainably sourced option for boosting essential fatty acid levels and mitigating pro-inflammatory physiological states. The research shows that Ahiflower\u2014so named because it represents a plant-based alternative to omega-rich oils from fatty fish like the Ahi tuna-provides the richest, most complete and balanced omega fatty acid profile available from a non-genetically modified botanical source. Ahiflower oil is in the same category as flax, chia, hemp, or evening primrose seed oils, but its overall omega-3-6-9 fatty acid content is higher. It has the highest omega-3 stearidonic acid (SDA) level of any plant-based omega alternative, as well as a high gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) content. That's on top of a balanced core of alpha-linolenic (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) acids in an optimal ~4:1 omega-3 to 6 ratio. B. arvensis, also called Lithospermum arvense, and known colloquially as Field Gromwell, is in the borage family, and is native to most of Europe, the United Kingdom, and parts of Asia. It grows easily and in some parts of the world it is considered to be a weed. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers, and its seeds are extremely oil-rich. This oil has a clean taste and aroma which aids greatly with patient compliance. After Ahiflower supplementation, LPS-stimulated macrophages had an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is part of the body's natural 'quelling' response to pro-inflammatory events. Ahiflower oil has only been available in the US and Europe as a food and dietary supplement ingredient since 2015. Its introduction and rising popularity are due largely to the efforts of Natures Crops International, a Canadian company commited to regenerative agriculture. The company sources the oil from growers in the UK who follow the Crop Assured 365 sustainability and stewardship principles. Alternative to Marine Oils I became interested in Ahiflower oil after a number of my colleagues and patients began talking about it as a plant-based alternative to fish oil. As an integrative family physician for more than 15 years, I was well aware of the science supporting omega-3 supplementation for cardiovascular and cognitive wellness, and increased longevity. Many of us as medical professionals routinely recommend daily fish oil supplements for help in cholesterol management and glycemic balance, along with immune, joint, skin, and brain health. But marine-based products\u2014whether from fish or krill\u2014are not a good option for vegetarians, vegans, or those who simply don't want to consume fish or seafood. A new plant-based source of omegas was certainly welcome news. The clinical research supporting Ahiflower oil is compelling. Controlled human clinical trials show unmatched metabolic conversion to longer chain omega-3s. The first human clinical trial, published in 2016 by researchers at the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, Canada, established Ahiflower oil's safety at high daily intakes of over 9 grams per day. The study compared Ahiflower versus flax seed oil, and showed that the former has superior long-chain omega-3 conversion efficiency. In a cohort of 40 healthy subjects randomized to equivalent daily doses of flax or Ahiflower oil for 28 days, those taking Ahiflower had circulating omega-3 EPA levels up to 4 times higher than those in the flaxseed oil cohort (p<0.01). Tissue levels of EPA were also higher in the Ahiflower group, averaging 3 times higher in erythrocytes, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. Further, the Ahiflower oil cohort showed significantly higher circulating dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA). In contrast, the DGLA levels decreased significantly in the flaxseed cohort. Since both EPA and DGLA are notable for their anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolving effects, this particular finding has clinical relevance. The second human clinical trial, also by Natalie Lefort and her colleagues at Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, confirmed the ability of Ahiflower oil to raise circulating EPA and DGLA levels in healthy subjects, but this time from a dose-ranging perspective. In subjects taking Ahiflower oil, EPA and DGLA levels showed a linear response at intakes as low as 2.7 grams per day, compared with a (non-active) sunflower oil placebo. This brings Ahiflower's anti-inflammatory support benefits into the range of typical dietary supplement intake levels \u2014 roughly 2-3 grams/day, or about half a teaspoon. Key physical and chemical features of Ahiflower oil Cytokine Modulation Given the types of patients I see, I was interested to learn that the researchers went a step further and examined whether Ahiflower oil could influence cytokine expression in plasma and mononuclear cells, and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Their goal was to determine whether Ahiflower oil could support the body's natural anti-inflammatory cytokine response. After the period had a 45% compared with baseline levels (p<0.05). IL-10 is generally recognized as an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by M2 immunosuppressive monocyte/macrophages. The unique cell-signaling and metabolic effects associated with Ahiflower oil may be tied to its very high combined SDA and GLA levels, the factors that distinguish it from all other omega-rich oils. This is part of the body's natural 'quelling' response to pro-inflammatory events like intensive exercise or seasonal immune challenges, in which other pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-1B, and IL-6 are upregulated. The finding is a first for plant-based omega-3 sources. The authors state that, \"the abundance of IL-10 can predict the severity of several human diseases with an inflammatory etiology, with low circulating IL-10 suggesting a greater disease severity.\" This ability to increase IL-10 may be unique to Ahiflower oil. In contrast, EFA oils from marine or algal sources might actually inhibit IL-10 activity. A recent human study published by Jisun So and colleagues at the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory, Tufts University, showed that high oral intake of EPA or DHA (3 grams per day, respectively) from marine or algal sources showed no stimulatory effect on IL-10 production by LPS-stimulated macrophages. On the contrary, DHA actually had an inhibitory effect. The unique cell-signaling and metabolic effects associated with Ahiflower oil may be tied to its very high combined SDA and GLA levels, the factors that distinguish it from all other omega-rich oils. IL-10 upregulation is clinically relevant for many of my patients, especially those struggling with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Little did I know when I first read the study, that the findings would also benefit me personally. Based on my research into the inflammatory response triggered by COVID, I began taking Ahiflower oil myself as means of proactively increasing IL-10 levels. I also began recommending this to patients. In October 2020, I developed Adult Onset Stills Disease (AOSD). This is a rare autoimmune condition that manifests as fevers, joint pain, and a characteristic rash. I was able to diagnose and treat myself effectively within 3 days of symptom onset. I did several sets of labs on myself to monitor my D-dimer levels and clotting risk, as well as other lab parameters associated with AOSD. This included a full cytokine panel three weeks after my symptoms had completely resolved. The cytokines were all within normal range with the exception of IL-10, which was highly elevated. I rarely see IL-10 values out of range, even in my patients with active autoimmune and/or inflammatory processes. Given that my own IL-10 level was the highest I have seen in any of my patients, I suspect that my rapid response to treatment\u2014a complete resolution of pain and fevers within 24 hours of starting steroids-was due in part to my elevated IL-10 and its anti-inflammatory activity. I believe the high IL-10 is attributable to my daily use of Ahiflower oil beginning in February 2020. Ahiflower in the Clinic Working with patients, I have utilized Ahiflower oil as a stand-alone product and as a carrier oil for customized cannabinoid tinctures over that same time period, in a number of patients, and I have seen myriad benefits for patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), seborrheic dermatitis, autoimmune encephalitis, and mast cell activation syndrome. Some condition-specific Ahiflower protocols I currently use with adult patients are: Asthma / Mast Cell Activation: 3 to 4 grams Ahiflower oil per day in gel caps or liquid oil. Seborrheic Dermatitis: 3 to 4 grams Ahiflower oil per day in gel caps or liquid oil. Keratosis Pilaris: 3 to 4 grams Ahiflower oil per day in gel caps or liquid oil. Autoimmune Encephalitis/PANDAS: seen particularly good results with Ahiflower oil in treating patients with suspected gastrointestinal pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) following an acute illness; for those with known or suspected gut dysbiosis that is causing ongoing symptoms (bloating, distention, loose stool, pain); and for those with neuro-psychiatric symptoms who also produce gut auto-antibodies. The research studies and my own clinical experience have convinced me of the efficacy of this comprehensive multi-omega oil in the management of a wide variety of clinical conditions. I've designed protocols that combine Ahiflower with pro-butyrate, humic monolaurin complex, resveratrol, vitamin K2), probiotics, and other botanicals and nutraceuticals, depending on the specific symptom profiles and individual patient characteristics. I typically start patients on Ahiflower oil first, and continue that for a week as directed before incorporating additional supplements. Then, I will add on the next product and continue until we have incorporated all of them. With the growing number of my patients, Ahiflower oil has become an essential component of many of my treatment protocols. The leading practitioner-focused brand that offers Ahiflower oil is GreensFirst Pro (Ahiflower Vegan Omega-3). This product is available via Fullscript. I feel positive about recommending it as a sustainable, plant-based alternative to fish oil. The research studies and my own clinical experience have convinced me of the efficacy of this comprehensive multi-omega oil in the management of a wide variety of clinical conditions.

Platelets may be tiny\u2014on average they're about 20% of the diameter of red blood cells\u2014but they have huge impact on our health and wellbeing. Beyond their obvious role in blood clotting and wound healing, they are also important players in the immune system. More than we realize, optimal health depends on the platelets doing their jobs appropriately, but not over-doing them. There are as many as 150,000-350,000 platelets per microliter of blood, but since platelets are so small, they make up just a tiny fraction of the blood volume. These splendid multi-functional cell fragments are produced by the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, via a process comprised of an intricate series of remodeling events. A single megakaryocyte can release of thousands of platelets. Like red blood cells, platelets (aka thrombocytes) lack nucleii, and hence they have no nuclear DNA; but they do contain some RNA machinery. The \"Goldilocks\" Zone As with most physiological functions, we want thrombocyte production and function to in the \"Goldilocks\" zone: not too much and not too little. Blood clotting is indeed essential. If it weren't for high-functioning platelets, even relatively minor injuries would be debilitating or life-threatening. But as we see all too often in our practices, clotting in the wrong places at the wrong times\u2014in the coronary arteries, the carotids, or the brain\u2014can be deadly. Clots are not always stable and they don't always stay put. A clot formed in a leg vein can travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing an embolism. A thrombus arising in the heart can end up in the brain. These silent migrations can have lethal consequences. In the context of atherosclerosis, we can really see how a physiological healing response can end up causing damage. When there's an endothelial injury, white blood cells and particles of cholesterol-carrying low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and form a gooey pool rich in inflammatory signaling molecules. Eventually, a thin cap forms over the mess. If that cap splits open, the body responds as it would to a cut in the skin: platelets rush to the scene and clotting begins. If the break is small and heals quickly, the episode passes with no harm. But if the rupture is extensive, the resulting clot occludes the artery. If that happens in one or more of the coronary arteries, the patient ends up in the emergency room with a myocardial infarction. When a clot occludes an artery feeding the brain, it causes a stroke. We're taught to prescribe anticoagulant drugs to decrease platelet aggregation, and to interrupt the clotting cascade at one or several of its stages. These can mitigate risk of MI and stroke, but it is equally true that any one of these anticlotting drugs can cause excessive bleeding. We need to be careful and constantly watch for signs of abnormal bleeding, such as bruising and swelling (without physical injury), or blood in the stool. We also need to consider that thrombocytes play other important roles beyond clotting. These include: Tissue & Wound Repair: Adequate and timely repair depends upon healthy, functioning platelets. Different growth factors and other biomolecules necessary for wound healing are provided by platelets (hence the surging interest in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to treat sports injuries and the like). When there is a deficit in repair, inflammation results. In some cases, this is due to platelet inhibition. It may also be due to deficiencies in magnesium or vitamin C, or to use NSAIDs, steroids, aspirin or other drugs that inhibit platelets. Cell Proliferation: Platelets release specific signals that promote mitosis in various tissues of the body. This property of platelets has been harnessed to create therapies for healing from bone-related injuries Immune System Function: Platelets are crucial to the optimum functioning of the immune system, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune defense/repair responses. Innate - Thrombocytes regulate the maturation and activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. They also act as first responders when a virus, bacteria or allergen enters the body. Adaptive- They also modulate the adaptive immune system by aiding in CD4 maturation. These are helper lymphocytes that amplify immune system reactions to pathogens. CD4 cell activation is required for proper T- and B-cell mediated immunity. Physiology Before Pharmacology How can we help our patients optimize their platelet function? I tend to advocate for a \"physiology before pharmacology\" approach. The key is to protect the endothelial lining, and to promote appropriate but not excessive clot formation. Here are five key factors that support healthy platelet function: Ascorbate(Vitamin C): Vitamin C is an antioxidant radical oxidative leukocytes (Raghavan SAV, et al. Thrombosis Research 2003). I recommend using buffered l-ascorbate based on the C cleanse protocol to maximize this benefit. Polyphenols: Plant-derived tissue repair, especially in conjunction with buffered l-ascorbate. They also act as zinc ionophores, meaning that they transport zinc where needed. This is an added plus, because zinc is important for endothelial cell integrity. Magnesium: Adequate magnesium intake can prevent thrombocytopenia while also reducing unnecessary platelet aggregation. Magnesium also raises ATP production in the mitochondria. It protects essential fats during transport, activates enzyme catalysts, decreases metabolic acidosis, and protects the kidneys. I suggest using magnesium with choline citrate for optimum absorption. Checking the 1st morning urine pH is a great way to know if you are getting adequate magnesium. Vitamins D3 and K2: Vitamin D deficiency can increase platelet aggregation and consequently, raise the risk for cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D3 also regulates platelet volume. I suggest taking enough Vitamin D3 to maintain blood levels of between 50-80 ng/ml. Using Vitamin K2 with Vitamin D3 is recommended. Omega 3 Fatty Acids: Omega-3s, especially EPA and DHAhave a positive influence on platelets, in that they reduce unwanted platelet aggregation. For best results, use pure, active EPA/DHA distilled under nitrogen and micellized in softgels. The Omega-3 Index is a simple test that gives a clear picture of someone's Omega-3 status. "}
