Prior to this, he was an Assistant Professor of Science Education at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, a newly established medical school with a unique experimental medical curriculum. His educational area of interest includes the use of multimedia to enhance medical education, content development, medical curriculum development, and medical education research. Before that, he formerly held the position of Assistant Professor of Public Health and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College. As a specialist in preventive cardiology, valvular heart disease, and adult congenital heart disease, as well as health information technology, he developed telemedicine-based applications in order to improve healthcare delivery and practical personal health education for underserved medical communities in the New York tri-state area. This included medical education geared toward the members of the lay population that may find themselves functionally illiterate when it comes to healthcare and/or health (medical) terminology. At Weill Cornell Medical College, he had been extensively involved in many areas of graduate medical education including training the pediatric house staff, medical house staff, and cardiology fellows. During this time, he also taught the Problem Based Learning (PBL) course, the Medicine, Physicians and Society (MPS) course for the first year and second-year medical students, as well as evidence-based medicine as part of the Public Health educational curriculum for medical students at Weill Cornell Medical College. He has also served on the board of evidence-based medicine at the New York Academy of Medicine. Dr. Bornstein earned his medical degree at Tufts University School of Medicine, graduating Cum Laude in 1973. From 1973 to 1978, he went on to do his subspecialty training in Internal Medicine, followed by a Cardiology Fellowship, at The Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. After formally completing his cardiovascular training, he did an extra year of cardiovascular research in the areas of electrophysiology, pacemaker insertion, and congenital heart disease, spending time on the pediatric cardiology service as well. Upon completion of his training, Dr. Bornstein joined Cardiology Associates of Fairfield County PC, a private practice consultative cardiology group, where he became a principal partner and practiced invasive/interventional cardiology for 20 years, from 1978-1998. During that time, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Heart Institute at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, CT where he was appointed Associate Director. While in clinical practice, he served as a member of the Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield Medical Advisory Committee. He also served as a member of the Connecticut Hospital Association Panel of Clinical Excellence in Cardiology, where he was intimately involved with the establishment of clinical guidelines and other quality of care initiatives. After leaving private practice, Dr. Bornstein trained in cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in 1999, and Nuclear Cardiology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in 2000. He has more than 30 years of clinical practice experience in both the private practice setting, as well as in the academic environment. Throughout his career, he has participated extensively in the medical education process, believing this to be the cornerstone for achieving ongoing clinical excellence. He has been the recipient of numerous teaching awards. In recent years, he has focused on the use of information technology to facilitate medical education, patient care, and to provide access to medical information at both the professional and lay levels. He has also developed content for the medical school curriculum, as well as for CME and teleconferencing. Yearly, he is responsible for the entire Adult Congenital Heart Disease curriculum for the Cardiology Fellowship Training Program at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City. He also has expertise in invasive/interventional cardiology as well as noninvasive cardiac imaging, including nuclear cardiology, cardiac positron emission tomography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac CT and MRI. He has published papers in peer-reviewed journals as well as chapters in textbooks in his areas of expertise. "}
