At a recent conference here, Dr. Herbert Benson president of the Harvard Medical School's Mind/Body Medical Institute, said that his office at Harvard was now getting five or six calls a week from H.M.O.'s that were interested in the medical uses of relaxation and other nontraditional treatment methods. The reason, he said, is clear: if such methods succeed reliably in reducing workload, they are \"just plain money in the bank for the H.M.O.'s.\" Dr. Matthew Budd, a doctor at the largest managed care organization in New England, Harvard-Pilgrim Health Care Plan, said that a decade ago a behavioral program he developed at the Harvard Community Health Plan got 60 to 70 referrals a year from doctors. Now, he said, it is up to 1,000 to 2,000 referrals. \"Something is happening out there,\" he said. The group at Harvard, which merged with Pilgrim, has begun training doctors to run behavioral medicine clinics in health maintenance and managed care groups around the country. \"We've trained people from six or eight H.M.O.'s, and other outfits are developing their own behavioral programs,\" he said. The methods and techniques being investigated are not new to medicine. Dr. Benson has been studying relaxation, meditation and prayer for some time. He and other researchers often group psychological and spiritual practices together, suggesting that it is unnecessary to make a distinction between them as long as they work. Dr. Benson said he had offered a menu of practices to patients. \"But about 80 percent of the patients chose prayer,\" he said. \"So I found I was teaching prayer.\" But Dr. Benson said relaxation, meditation and prayer had begun to find a place in medicine, not only because of support in scientific studies, but because of the possibility that these relatively cheap techniques might reduce medical costs. In one study, for example, a clinic tried different approaches to treating high blood pressure: one using drugs alone and another using reduced levels of drugs supplemented by relaxation techniques. More than half the patients in the behavioral group were able to eliminate their need for drugs while achieving significant drops in blood pressure. The cost savings in the behaviorally treated group was estimated to be $1,300 per patient over the five-year course of the treatment. The conclusion that these methods can be used was supported by an independent panel convened by the National Institutes of Health a few weeks ago. The panel concluded, \"Integrating behavioral and relaxation therapies with conventional medical treatment is imperative for successfully managing these conditions.\" The panel did not endorse a single technique, but said a variety of them worked, as long as they included two features: \"a repetitive focus on a word, sound, prayer, phrase or muscular activity, and neither fighting nor focusing on intruding thoughts. When done properly, the panel concluded, such relaxation therapy \"can lower one's breathing rate, heart rate and blood pressure.\" Not all medical practices seem to be helped by \"spiritual\" practices. For example, mending broken bones does not seem to be affected, nor does simple infection seem to heal more quickly. But those illnesses that have psychological components or that can be helped by changes in heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension and so on have been found to respond well to the human touch of the healer and the physical effects of meditation and prayer, Dr. Benson said. The scientists involved do not make clear distinctions between what is \"spiritual\" and what is \"psychological.\" The recent conference in Boston was a milestone in the growth of interest in what is sometimes called behavioral medicine. It was a mix of the traditional and the unusual. The hallways at the Copley Plaza Marriott looked like an international bazaar, with garb from caftans to cowboy boots, as scores of spiritual healers gathered here before an assembly of a thousand onlookers. A few years ago this would have been the farthest fringe of medicine. And even now there was a hint of sideshow. There were snake handlers here, and some recommended the snakes as a way to induce relaxation. But the conference was sponsored by a mainstream institution, Harvard University, and among the participants were about 200 medical doctors, an equivalent number of registered nurses, clergymen, psychologists and a variety of healers from Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Hindu and other traditions. Medical literature has long noted instances of \"spiritual healing,\" but has tended to set such findings aside as examples of a \"placebo effect,\" in which a patient's wish to improve is believed to lead the person to report fewer problems. Dr. Anne Harrington, a historian of science at Harvard, who spoke at the gathering, wrote that \"medicine has long acknowledged that 'sham' treatments like sugar pills or injections with saline solution have the capacity to rally healing processes -- sometimes of a dramatic nature -- within believing patients.\" She said nonphysical treatments like meditation had been shown to be effective in controlled scientific studies for depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, cardiac pain, insomnia, diabetes, ulcers, cold, fever, asthma, arthritis and alcoholism. Although the phenomenon has been studied since attempts at healing began, its modern wave of rigorous scientific studies began in the early 1970's after it was shown that Indian holy men using meditation could reliably lower their heart rates, breathing rates, blood pressure, oxygen consumption and shift their brain waves to a semi-dreamlike state. Their achievements were soon duplicated, minus the religious trappings, in the laboratory, with techniques like biofeedback or muscle relaxation exercises. Conferees in Boston were delighted to hear, at the end of three days of testimony, a paper by Dr. Stephen Kosslyn, a Harvard neuroscientist who cited his latest work in brain scan studies, which offers a possible explanation for at least one connection between the mind and body. His specialty is visualization -- what the mind can see when the eyes are closed. He performed some demonstrations with the audience, not unlike ghost stories around the Boy Scout campfire, which showed that mental images alone can produce anxiety, sweaty palms and a faster heart rate. He said he and Lisa M. Shin, a doctoral student, had recently carried out Positron Emission Topography brain scans on seven subjects as they were asked to mentally imagine a number of emotionally neutral objects, like a sofa, as well as a number of negative images, like the swollen and bruised face of a battered woman. They compared the most active areas of the subject's brains during both neutral and aversive imagining, and found that one area activated more by the negative images than the neutral ones was the insula, an area of the brain between the temples, just forward of the middle of the brain. In animals, it has been found that stimulation of the insula can raise or lower heart rate and blood pressure, so it appears to partake of both the physical reactions and the mental images. This area appears to have a large network of connections to the part of the brain associated with strong emotion, the limbic area in the brain's center. He said it had recently been shown that the insula also had a bundle of connections with the stomach and intestines through the vagus nerves. This may be the pathway by which wishes can effect ulcers, he speculated, as there are studies showing that meditation techniques can reduce ulcer pain, stomach contractions and acid secretion. He said it was important to realize that the brain could treat visual images very much like images from the outside world. Both stimulate the same visual areas at the back of the brain, regardless of whether the images are real or imagined, he said. At the conference, Dr. Richard Friedman, of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, was pressed by reporters on the question whether the medical establishment would actually bring itself to accept spiritual methods as a regular part of the armamentarium of healing. \"Of course, the medical establishment is conservative,\" he said, and quoted an old saw in medical school: \"As a doctor, you don't want to be either the first or the last to try something new.\" \"But it is now catching on fast,\" he said. \"Let me make a prediction. Ten years from now, in many managed care settings, doctors will not only be asking for a medical history when you come in, but will routinely ask about your belief system "}
