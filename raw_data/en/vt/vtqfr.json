In our lab we investigate genomes of ssRNA and dsDNA bacteriophages, structures of their proteins and various molecular interactions during their life cycles. Our investigations have contributed to deeper understanding of phage structural and molecular biology and practical applications of their VLPs. We use VLPs of several ssRNA bacteriophages in vaccine development against various diseases such as Lyme borreliosis, influenza and various veterinary diseases. Since our lab is the only one in Latvia capable of solving protein structures by crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, we are involved in several other projects which are devoted mainly towards structure-based rational drug development against a variety of pharmacologically import enzymes. Our targets include carbonic anhydrases and bacterial enzymes and their microcompartments involved in trimethylamine metabolism.
