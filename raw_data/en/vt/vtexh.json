Eckels-Gaeddert, 50, says the center's founder, Joseph Martinez, a psychic surgeon from the Philippines, bequeathed leadership of the center to her when he died in 1995. Services take place at the church every Tuesday night and on the first Sunday of each month. In addition to doing \"spiritual healing,\" Eckels-Gaeddert teaches meditation and yoga and sells various products including a protein powder made from peas and a colon cleansing dietary supplement. She hosts the radio talk show, \"Adventures in Consciousness,\" from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. every Monday on 1450 AM. Q: How did you get started on this path? A: I was able to have a conversation with Jesus. Well, I thought everybody could. I just followed his divine instruction. I got the instruction to go to the churches to discover where there was truly the presence of Christ and so I did that. A lot of the ministers would recognize some kind of glow. Q: How did the leadership of the center pass from Joseph Martinez to you? A: He called me up the night before he died and gave me the mailing list and said he was going on sabbatical, so I thought he was just going back to South America. I came in for Tuesday evening prayer and meditation and found him in his chair - he'd left. Q: What do you think happens to people when they die? A: The Lord has many mansions, many universes, and some ascend right into that paradise but the Lord says we can experience it now. We don't have to die. Our whole planet is ascending and those people who chose to stay in ignorance will get to do that for as long as they want but I don't know if they'll get to do that on this planet. Q: When you say you are a clairvoyant, what do you mean by that? A: That I can see auras and thought forms and peoples' higher selves, that portion of them that is part of God and the personality that has formed. It's a telepathic, spirit-to-spirit communication technique. You can send a thought and receive it. Q: How do you heal someone spiritually? A: I close my eyes and look at the aura. I look at somebody's highest essence, their divine being, and their body and I bring them together. I remove all foreign energy from the physical body and mental image pictures such as programming and conditioning. Once you're aligned with your higher power, anybody can heal themselves.
