Palmer & Wong Fei Hung Chiropractic and tit tar are amongst the most common treatments sought after by Malaysians with back pain, neck pain and other injuries. Chiropractors are not the same as tit tar practitioners, who are commonly referred to as Chinese chiropractors but that is incorrect. So to help everyone understand chiropractic and tit tar better, we've compiled 5 key differences you must know before seeing them, so you make an informed decision. 1. History The term chiropractic originates from Greek for done by hand, 'cheir' (meaning 'hand') and praktos (meaning 'done'). Now the world's third-largest healthcare profession was founded in 1895 in America by DD Palmer. Chiropractic treatments started in Malaysia in the early 1920s. Although it is still considered relatively new in Malaysia, chiropractic has especially been gaining popularity in the past few decades. The term tit tar originates from Cantonese, directly translated as 'fall hit' is but one areas of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and is concerned primarily with healing physical trauma. Thought to have been initiated in the Canton province of China by Master Wah Toh in 200 B.C., tit tar was closely associated with the Chinese martial art of kung fu. It could be that tit tar was derived from the need to effectively, quickly, and safely heal injuries sustained during the practice or execution of high-contact martial arts. 2. Treatment Philosophy Chiropractic is the correction of [subluxations](/conditions), which are by definition, minute bone dislocations, most commonly found in the spine. Chiropractic adjustments aim to remove interference to the nervous system, typically pressure on the spinal cord or nerves caused by subluxations. Chiropractic adopts an evidence-based practice, meaning the doctor of chiropractic fully understands the patient's medical history, needs, and preferences then apply the right clinical treatments indicated by the newest evidence-based research. Chiropractors take a western approach to treatment. They are medical professionals who diagnose and treat disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. They use traditional diagnostic testing methods (such as x-rays, MRI) along with specific chiropractic techniques that involve hands-on manipulation of the articulations (joints) of the body. They don't prescribe medications, and they do not perform surgery; however, many chiropractors work closely with medical doctors and will refer a patient when necessary. Traditional Chinese Medical philosophy is derived from Taoist ideas of natural balance, qi, and yin and yang. In essence, its philosophy revolves around the understanding that the human body is a sophisticated universe of interconnecting systems that work in balance for the general health of the body. Traditional Chinese medicine philosophy also states that the body is equipped with its mechanisms to fight illness and cure itself. Hence, any kind of therapy applied is to assist the normal self-healing function of the human body, not interfere with it. 3. Treatment Technique A Chiropractor's principal method of treatment is through specific adjustments to restore the proper joint function of the spine and other osseous structures. Chiropractic treatment starts with a consultation, sometimes accompanied by x-rays or MRIs. Usually, notes are taken down into the patient's record. Then an examination of the spine and joints is performed before deciding the treatment technique. Precise manual adjustments are performed with high velocity, low amplitude which they trained for years. Chiropractors, in addition to using [manual adjustments](/services), also offer other treatment modalities such as physiotherapy, ultrasound, electrotherapy, and dry needling. Tit tar principles & treatment start with an examination of the joints within the body starting with the head then moving towards the legs. The practitioner will do a series of mobility exercises for the patient to determine their problem. The practitioner then proceeds to treat the patient by using physical manipulations to relocate the joints and also do massages to relieve blood flow to the \"cold\" muscles. The practitioner may also use a traditional herbal healing ointment to help with blood circulation. 4. Education and Regulation Spinal adjustments are only safe and effective when the [doctor is certified](/team) and has comprehensive knowledge of human anatomy. All chiropractors must complete a 4-year degree in chiropractic from an accredited college by the Councils on Chiropractic Education International (CCEI). Chiropractic education covers the scope of anatomy, neurology, radiology, and pathology, among other fields. Most chiropractors are members of the Association of Chiropractic Malaysia (ACM) which is regulated under the Federation of Complementary and Natural Medical Associations, Malaysia (FCNMAM) which is recognized by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH). Tit tar practitioners are not obligated to have a degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) although many universities offer this course. Formal TCM education covers acupuncture, tuina, tit tar (bone manipulation/setting), herbs, and others. Some TCM students can choose to specialise in specific disciplines. Chinese medicine practitioners who have degrees from accredited universities are regulated by the Malaysian Chinese Medical Association (MCMA) which is recognized by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH). For those who are not formally educated in TCM, their skill and education come from master's, sensei's, tit tar course or family. Their apprenticeship may range from a few months to years of learning before practicing. They are not regulated by MOH. 5. Price [Prices of chiropractic](/price) sessions in Petaling Jaya & Kuala Lumpur averagely range from RM100-RM200 per session. Most chiropractors sell in packages which lowers the price per session. Prices of tit tar in Selangor range from RM200 to a few thousand ringgit per session. Commonly calculated by the number of \"body parts\" and depending on the master/sensei's fame and experience. Conclusion Chiropractic and tit tar have evolved significantly throughout the years and have combined their practice with other disciplines for best results. Since, everyone will respond differently to treatment, it's hard to say which is better because both chiropractic and tit tar have been successful in helping millions of people around the world for generations.
