Pain. Limited range of motion. Arthritis can really put a damper on your ability to enjoy daily activities. Why Not Just Use Painkillers? Many doctors encourage the use of over-the-counter or prescription anti-inflammatory medications and pain killers. While these provide relief, they also can have undesirable side effects. In general, painkillers are rough on your liver and have been associated (when used regularly and/or in high dosages) with serious side effects such as stroke, heart attack and aneurysms. ( [Click here](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-issues-strong-heart-attack-stroke-warning-for-common-painkillers/) to learn about the strong FDA warning issued in 2015 about the link between painkillers and increased risk of stroke and heart attacks.) Recommended Natural Arthritis Remedies As a holistic doctor focused on wellness solutions that positively affect your health on a macro level, Dr. Doyle encourages his patients to try to the following natural arthritis remedies first (assuming they do not interact with medications you are currently taking for other conditions - always check with a doctor first) and to use painkillers sparingly. - Alternate heat and cold. Take long hot baths and/or use a heating pad (not at the same time, of course!) to alleviate stiffness. Use cold packs to reduce inflammation. - Try acupuncture. Acupuncture stimulates natural pain relief and directs healing energy to your aching joints. - Take fish oil and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) supplements. These supplements naturally reduce inflammation, loosen stiff joints and lower pain. - Consume turmeric. This golden spice is delicious and has anti-inflammatory properties. Drink turmeric tea or how chocolate with turmeric, or add turmeric to dishes like curries, chili or stir fry dishes. (If you take blood thinners or are on medication for diabetes, turmeric may increase the effectiveness of those medications, so consult your doctor if appropriate.) - Try herbal supplements of boswellia, bromelain, devil's claw, ginkgo, stinging nettle or thunder god vine; all of these herbs are touted as effective arthritis treatments. Before trying any herbal treatment, always check with a doctor to ensure these supplements won't negatively interact with any other drugs you currently take.
