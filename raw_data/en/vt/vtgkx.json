However, with a modern understanding of how these substances can benefit the body it is easy to overlay them with specific TCM archetypes based on Chinese medicine with a few liberties taken. Most vitamins and mineral impact multiple organs and elements. Note: This is a theoretical exercise with the understanding that these substances would be of benefit only in the case that they are lacking. Five Elemental Classifications of Vitamins [Five Element theory of traditional Chinese medicine](https://agelessherbs.com/five-elements-theory/) associates [energetic organ systems](https://agelessherbs.com/organ-systems-of-chinese-medicine/), [emotions](https://agelessherbs.com/emotional-health/natural-alternative-herbs/), sensory organs, and all of the related symptoms of each element. It is a core tool of Chinese medicine to allow practitioners of Asian medicine to form an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.

The Lungs are the most external Yin Organ in TCM and are closely associated with the Wei Qi which is associated with the immune response (see more below). Vitamin A - Benefits the skin - Enhances the ability to smell and taste - Protects the respiratory tract - Nourishes the mucous membranes of the Large Intestine & sinuses - Re-enforces the Wei Qi Vitamin B-1 Thiamine - Benefits the Liver energetic organs ability to move Qi Vitamin B-3 Niacin - Fortifies and thickens the skin Vitamin B-3 Niacin - Combats dermatitis Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid - Involved with bone growth - Treats all types of skin conditions Vitamin D-3 Cholecalciferol - Protects the colon by enabling the lining to absorb calcium (possibly) Vitamin E d-alpha Tocopherol - Benefits the skin by maintaining the stability of skin membranes - Protects the Lungs from environmental toxins Brain (Sometimes referred to as a Curious Organ in Chinese Medicine) Vitamin B-1 Thiamine - Benefits neurological pathways (memory) [Improves memory and concentration](https://agelessherbs.com/memory-loss/) - Combats insomnia Vitamin B-3 Niacin - Directs Qi and Blood up to the brain Vitamin B-3 Niacin - Calms the Shen (necessary for psychological balances) Vitamin B-6 Pyridoxine - Used in children with autism (magnesium added to direct to the brain) Vitamin B-7 Biotin - Associated with unexplained mood disorders and mood swings Vitamin B-9 Folate - Supports the utilization of amino acids in neurological structures of the brain - Supports bone marrow production (the Brain of Chinese medicine is the Sea of Marrow) Vitamin B-12 Cobalamin - Reinforces blood-brain barrier from toxins - Supports bone marrow production (the Brain of Chinese medicine is the Sea of Marrow) - Deficiency results in a deterioration of neuro-connections [Associated with auto-immune disorders (think crohn's disease)](https://agelessherbs.com/crohns-disease/) Vitamin D-3 Cholecalciferol - Improves mood (think seasonal disorder) Vitamin E d-alpha Tocopherol The Three-Four Level Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Nutrients Theoretically, there are four levels that diseases must pass through; each becomes more serious as it progresses to deeper levels of the body. In reality, some viruses or diseases may not affect every level. This is a practical working theory of the most likely path that is taken: - Wei (Defensive) Level - Qi Level (or stage) - Ying (Nutritive) Level - Xue (Blood) Level Wei Qi Level Preventive Nutrients The Wei Qi level of Chinese medicine refers to the more outer-body protective abilities of the skin, nerves, muscles, sinews, tendons, and immune response (loosely). We have includes minerals and vitamins that play a role in the body's defenses beyond the immune system here also. Vitamin A [Tonifies the Wei Qi-bolsters the immune system](https://agelessherbs.com/wei-qi-immune-support/) - Protects the body from environmental toxins Vitamin B-1 Thiamine - Benefits the nerves (neuropathy) - Anti-oxidant Vitamin B-3 Niacin - Fortifies and thickens the skin Vitamin B-6 Pyridoxine - Affects neurological issues (carpal tunnel) Vitamin B-7 Biotin - Associated with neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease-peripheral neuropathy) Vitamin B-9 Folate - Used with cancer patients to rebuild healthy cellular division Vitamin B-12 Cobalamin - Reinforces blood-brain barrier from toxins - Associated with auto-immune disorders when deficient - Deficiency results in a deterioration of nerve tissue (myelin sheath) Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid - Maintains the integrity of the skin - Defends against environmental toxins and stresses - Re-enforces immune system - Generates flesh and heals wounds Vitamin D-3 Cholecalciferol - Boosts the immune system Vitamin E d-alpha Tocopherol - Blocks the formation of tumors - Protects the lungs from environmental toxins - Protects the cells from environmental toxins and radiation Qi Level Nutrients At this stage, the disease has progressed into the interior and begins to reach the organs. We discussed individual organs in the Five Element theory archetype above. Ying Qi Level Preventative Nutrients The Ying level of Chinese medicine is associated with the Blood, blood vessels, flesh, fascia, and connective tissue collectively. Vitamin B-2 Riboflavin - Promotes the production of red blood cells - Deficit of riboflavin associated with Blood Stagnation due to Blood Deficiency Vitamin B-3 Niacin - Alleviates Blood Stagnation - Flushes, pushes out through the sensory organs of the head (skin, sinuses, eyes-think allergies) Vitamin B-7 Biotin - Resolves dermatological issues due to Heat in the Blood Vitamin B-9 Folate - Promotes the production of health red blood cells Vitamin B-12 Cobalamin - Protects blood vessels Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid - Enhances the action of iron in the blood and Blood production - Anti-oxidant-cleanses the blood of damaging toxins Vitamin E d-alpha Tocopherol - Reinforces the blood vessel walls Xue Level Preventative Nutrients This is the Blood Level where diseases and conditions become more serious. Heat in the Blood is a common manifestation. Vitamin B-7 Biotin - Used in conditions with Internal Wind (likely due to Liver Congestion-think Parkinson's disease) Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid Vitamin E d-alpha Tocopherol - Powerful Blood level anti-oxidant (free radicals are Blood Heat) - Prevents Blood Sticky (think cholesterol) Yuan Qi Level Preventative Nutrients This is from yet another three-level system of Asian medicine that considers the Yuan level as the bone, marrow, genetic considerations (loosely the [Kidney Jing or Essence](https://agelessherbs.com/three-treasures-of-chinese-medicine/)), which would be the deepest level, or our core. Vitamin B-9 Folate - Promotes the DNA synthesis of cell division - Used with cancer patients preventatively with a familial history of cancer (think breast cancer) Vitamin B-12 Cobalamin - Plays a role in DNA synthesis Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid Vitamin D-3 Cholecalciferol - Facilitates the body's ability to utilize calcium in bone-building Vitamin E d-alpha Tocopherol Erem S, Atfi A, Razzaque MS.
