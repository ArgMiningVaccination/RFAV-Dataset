INTRODUCTION Bordetella pertussis is a fastidious gram-negative coccobacillus responsible for the respiratory infection commonly known as \"whooping cough. \"The organism is spread by respiratory droplets and is highly contagious among close contacts. The typical incubation period is 7 to 10 days, but it may be as long as 21 days. Neither natural infection nor pertussis vaccination results in long-lasting immunity, contributing to endemic infection and 3- to 5-year cycles of pertussis epidemics. PATHOGENESIS Several active components, which play a role in immunity and are responsible forthe organism 's ability to cause disease, are produced by B pertussis . (1) Pertussis toxin, lamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and agglutinogen allow the organism to adhere to ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract, where it exerts its effects.AUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Daniels and Sabella have disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

Pertussis toxin is postulated to be responsible for the systemic manifestations of pertussis, including the leukocytosis and lymphocytosis evident in young infants. This virulence factor is also thought to sen- sitize b-islet cells in the pancreas, which may lead to hyper- insulinism, which rarely manifests as hypoglycemia in young infants. Other substances elaborated by the organism include adenylate cyclase and tracheal cytotoxin, which allow the bacteria to cause damage to the respiratory epithelium and evade the host immune system by altering leukocyte function. Pertussis vaccines contain these various antigenic compo-nents. Central nervous system complications of pertussis are thought to be secondary to hypoxemia induced by coughing and apnea associated with infection rather than to a direct effect on the central nervous system by the organism. (2) EPIDEMIOLOGY In the 1940s, before the introduction of pertussis vaccine in the United States, there were 100,000 to 200,000 cases of whooping cough and thousands of deaths annually. After the introduction of pertussis vaccine, there was a 99% decrease in the number of cases; the lowest number of cases was in 1976, with only 1,010 cases reported. Over the past few decades there has been an increasing incidence of pertussis (Fig 1). According to the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), there were 48,277 cases reported in the United States in 2012, the highest number of cases since1955. (3) Worldwide, pertussis is responsible for 16 million cases and approximately 195,000 deaths annually. (4) Historically, the incidence of pertussis peaked in children 1 to 5 years of age and was less common in those younger than 1 year and older than 10 years. There has been a shift in recent decades with an increase in the incidence among infants younger than 1 year, adolescents, and adults (Fig 2). In 2015, 55% of reported pertussis cases in the United States were in individuals older than 10 years, and children youn- ger than 1 year accounted for 13% of cases. (5) There are multiple factors that seem to be responsible for the change in epidemiology of pertussis: the switch from whole cell pertussis vaccine to acellular pertussis vaccine,waning immunity, change in the organism, vaccine refusal, lack of natural disease to boost immune response, and un- diagnosed individuals serving as reservoirs. Switch from Whole Cell Pertussis Vaccine to Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concerns about the reactogenicity of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTwP) lead to the development and introduction of the diphtheria andtetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). The DTaP was incrementally introduced into the US pediatric immunization schedule starting in 1992, with all children receiving only the DTaP by 1997. (6) Acellular pertussis vaccines are signi cantly less reactogenic than whole cell vaccines. Recent studies during epidemic outbreaks in Australia demonstrated that children who received the DTwP series Figure 1. Reported pertussis cases, 1922-2015. From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Noti able Diseases Surveillance System for 1950 through 2015 and from passive reports to the Public Health Service from 1922 through 1949.DTP\u00bcdiphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis vaccine, Tdap \u00bctetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine. 248 Pediatrics in Reviewhad lower rates of pertussis than those who received the DTaP series. (7) This effect may be related to the different responses elicited by the 2 types of vaccines: the whole cell pertussis vaccine activates T-helper (Th) type 1 cells, and the acellular pertussis vaccine elicits a Th2 response. The Th1responses result in robust interferon- gproduction, which is required for cell-mediated immunity and rapid clearance of the organism on repeated exposure, whereas Th2 responses do not seem to have the same effect on interferon- g, resulting in less effective clearing of the organism from the respiratory tract after infection. Thus, humoral immu- nity provided by acellular pertussis vaccines seems to be effective at preventing severe disease but may lack the cellular responses needed to effectively eradicate the infec-tion from the respiratory tract. (7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14) Waning Immunity Neither natural infection nor vaccination induces lifelongimmunity. Recent studies demonstrate that immunity wanes 4 to 20 years after natural infection and 4 to 12 years after vaccination. (15) After pertussis outbreaks in California in 2010 and 2014, it was determined that patients who developed pertussis were more likely to have had a longer period of time since their last DTaP or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine(Tdap). (16)(17) More speci cally, immunity began to wane 5 years after the last DTaP, with a 42% increase in the odds of developing pertussis each year thereafter. (16) These studies also determined that immunity began to wane 2 to 3 years after Tdap vaccination. (17) Another study showed that the odds of pertussis increased 1.33 times per year after the lastDTaP, with only an estimated 10% of children retaining immunity 8.5 years after the last immunization. (18) Change in the Organism Current vaccines contain various antigens to components of B pertussis, such as pertussis toxin, mbriae, pertactin, and lamentous hemagglutinin. Since the introduction of the whole cell and acellular vaccines there have been geneticchanges of B pertussis . Variants that are emerging include allele changes to the genes that code for pertactin ( ). (6) (19)(20)(21) Studies in Europe and Asia have demonstrated that current pertussis strains are different from when the vaccines were developed, which may be limiting the mem- ory provided by vaccination. (20)(21) In addition, the adap- tation of these components may make the organism more virulent and adept to evade the immune response. (19) Vaccine Refusal There is concern that vaccine hesitancy or refusal has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases, espe- cially measles and pertussis. Phadke et al (22) reviewed theanalysis of 32 pertussis outbreaks and found high percent- ages of unvaccinated individuals (24% -45%) in the states with the largest outbreaks, with a signi cant proportion of individuals (59% -93%) unvaccinated by choice. Lack of Natural Disease to Boost Immune Response Some have proposed that with decreased rates of pertussis since vaccine development there are fewer cases of pertussis to which an individual is exposed during their life, thereby limiting the chance to naturally boost the immune memory Figure 2. Pertussis incidence by age group, 1990-2015. From the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention National Noti able Diseases Surveillance System. Vol. 39 No. 5 MAY 2018 249to the infection. Without these exposures to less severe cases, an individual 's immunity continues to wane without a boosted response. (15) Undiagnosed Individuals Serving as Reservoirs Last, adolescents and adults with pertussis may not manifestclassic or severe symptoms of pertussis, resulting in under- reporting of infection in these age groups. These individ- uals, however, serve as important reservoirs of infection and commonly transmit pertussis to infants and younger chil- dren who are unvaccinated or have been incompletely vaccinated or who may have waning immunity after vacci- nation. (23) Several studies have documented that adoles-cents and adults have an important role in transmission of the organism and that pertussis is a common cause of pro- longed cough illness in thes e individuals. (24)(25) CLINICAL PRESENTATION Pertussis is typically divided into 3 stages: catarrhal, parox- ysmal, and convalescent. Progression through these stages and symptoms varies among individuals, especially based onthe patient 'sa g e . Catarrhal Stage The catarrhal stage typically begins 1 to 2 weeks after exposure toBp e r t u s s i s . Symptoms at this time are nonspeci c( c o u g h , coryza, and low-grade fever) and may be confused with an upper respiratory tract infection. During this 1- to 2-week phase, individuals are contagious without realizing that they have pertussis. Infants may ha ve a very short catarrhal phase before progressing to the next stage. Paroxysmal Stage Classical symptoms of whooping cough begin to be evident during this stage, which can last approximately 1 month. Children develop paroxysmal episodes of cough followed by an inspiratory \"whoop \"sound at the end of the episode. This high-pitched whoop sound is caused by rapid air flow during a forced inhalation after a repetitive coughing episode during which the lung is devoid of air and the glottis is partially closed. During the coughing episodes, cyanosis,especially perioral cyanosis in young children, and post- tussive emesis are common; however, between episodes infants and children generally appear well. Individuals with pertussis may experience fatigue and exhaustion from lack of sleep and decreased appetite caused by persistent cough- ing. Fever is characteristically absent during pertussis infec- tion; its presence should prompt a search for secondary bacterial infection.Infants and older individuals may have less classic symp- toms during this stage. Infants may present with apnea,cyanosis, and gagging during the coughing spell without the classical whoop sound. Adolescents and adults also may lack the typical whoop sound at the end of coughing spells; however, the presence of a whoop sound or posttussive emesis in adults should raise suspicion for pertussis. (26) Convalescent Stage Diminished severity and frequency of cough paroxysms characterize this stage, which signify recovery from pertus- sis. However, because pertussis is also known as \"the 100- day cough, \"this stage can last from weeks to months and is often exacerbated by intercurrent respiratory illness, espe- cially in infants. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Adenovirus Adenovirus can cause an illness of severe prolonged parox- ysmal cough associated with an inspiratory presence fever commonly asso- ciated with adenovirus infection can help distinguish this from pertussis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of prolonged cough and pneumonia in school-aged children. The presence of other systemic symptoms, such as fever and pharyngitis, along with auscultatory (crackles) and chest radiographicndings can help differentiate this from pertussis. Chlamydia trachomatis Infants with Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia may have a cough illness that may be dif cult to distinguish from pertussis. The cough is more commonly described as a staccato cough, with inspiration between each cough. These infants may also have tachypnea and crackles, and 50% of them have a history of conjunctivitis. On laboratory evalu- ation they commonly have a normal white blood cell countand an elevated eosinophil count. Respiratory Syncytial Virus Respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of respiratoryinfection in infants and may present with cough and apnea. Wheezing, fever, and signi cant rhinorrhea or congestion may help differentiate this from pertussis. Coinfection with pertussis and respiratory syncytial virus is well described. 250 Pediatrics in ReviewOther Bordetella Species Bordetella parapertussis causes a pertussis-like syndrome and accounts for approximately 5% of Bordetella isolates in the United States. Compared with B pertussis , the paroxysms and whoop are less severe, the posttussive emesis is less frequent, and the total duration of cough is shorter. (27) COMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES Young infants ( <6 months old) with pertussis have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality compared with older infants, children, and adolescents. Complications inthese young infants include secondary bacterial pneumonia, apnea, bradycardia, and pulmonary hypertension. Bacterial pneumonia is the most common complication of pertussis, occurring in approximately 5% of all cases and in approx- imately 10% to 25% of infants younger than 6 months. During coughing spells, infants may become hypoxic, lead- ing to central nervous system complications, including seizures and encephalopathy. (2) Because of its propensity to cause apnea in young infants, pertussis has been pro- posed as a cause of sudden infant death syndrome. (28) Additional complications include otitis DIAGNOSIS (TABLE 1) Culture Until recently, the gold standard for diagnosing pertussis was a positive respiratory culture for B pertussis . Culture alsoallows for strain typing and antimicrobial testing, which is useful for public health tracking. Culturing for the organ-ism, however, is fraught with dif culty because it requires obtaining a sample within the rst 2 weeks of illness, using a specic swab (calcium alginate or Dacron-tipped swab) for collection, immediate inoculation on solid media or trans- port in special media (Stainer-Scholte broth with cyclo- dextrin or Regan-Lowe to 98.6\u00b0F (35\u00b0C -37\u00b0C) for 7 days, to maximize the yield for isolating the organism. Previous immunization or recent antimicrobial treatment can lower the yield of the culture. Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the \"new \"gold standard and is now more commonly used to diagnose pertussis because it allows for a more rapid result and seems to be more sensitive than culture, especially in individuals who are mildly symptomatic and in those who received antibiotics. It requires collection of a naso- pharyngeal specimen using a Dacron swab or nasopharyn- geal aspirate. The PCR test is most sensitive if obtained within the rst 3 to 4 weeks of illness. (29) Overall sensitivity and speci city vary based on the performing laboratory, and it is important to note that there is no standard PCR assay.False-positives may occur due to contamination from other samples. Serology Serologic testing is helpful in epidemiologic studies ofpertussis but have a limited role in the clinical setting. TABLE 1.

Vol. 39 No. 5 MAY 2018 251Acute and convalescent titers against pertussis antigens are generally required for serologic diagnosis. However, suchtesting is dif cult to interpret in immunized individuals, specic cutoff data are not available, and these tests are not licensed for commercial use. Direct Fluorescent Antibody Testing Direct fluorescent antibody testing of nasopharyngeal spec- imens for pertussis antigens is no longer recommended. These tests have poor sensitivity compared with culture and PCR and require experienced laboratory personnel. Supporting Laboratory Testing and Imaging Leukocytosis, speci cally absolute lymphocytosis, is common in infants and young children with pertussis, especially in the late catarrhal and paroxysmal stages. The degree of lympho- cytosis correlates with the severity of disease. (30)(31)(32) The presence of absolute lymphocytosis in the setting of an appropriate clinical scenario should raise suspicion for the possibility of pertussis, keeping in mind that normal lym- phocyte counts vary with age. Thrombocytosis is common and correlates with a poorer prognosis in infants. Chestradiography may reveal nonspeci cndings, such as hyper- inflation and perihilar in ltrates, but most often is normal. MANAGEMENT Antimicrobials Antimicrobial therapy (Table 2) is recommended to elimi- nate the organism from the nasopharynx and, thus, reducetransmission of the organism. In general, antimicrobial therapy does not in fluence the clinical course of pertussis, although it may reduce the duration and severity of symp- toms if administered before the paroxysmal stage. A recent case-control study of infant deaths from pertussis concluded that early recognition and appropriate antibiotic therapy are important in preventing death. (33) Therapy should be given to any infant younger than 1 year within the rst 6 weeks of symptoms and anyone older than 1 year within the rst 3 weeks if pertussis is suspected. (34) Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythro- mycin) are the preferred class of antibiotics to treat pertus- sis. Azithromycin is most commonly used because it has less adverse effects and is easier to administer. When TABLE 2.

MMWR Recomm Rep 2005;54(RR-14):10. 252 Pediatrics in Reviewerythromycin is used, the estolate form is preferred because of its superior serum and respiratory tissue concentrationscompared with the ethylsuccinate and stearate forms. Tri- methoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used as an alternative agent in rare clinical situations when macrolides are not tolerated, there is clear severe allergy to macrolides, or in cases of macrolide-resistant strains. Treatment of infants with pertussis requires speci c considerations. Infants younger than 6 weeks must be mon- itored for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), which is associated with macrolide therapy, for 1 to 2 months after treatment. (35) Azithromycin is the preferred treatment because it seems to be less associated with IHPS than iserythromycin, although cases of IHPS have also been asso- ciated with azithromycin. (35)(36)(37) It must be stressed that the bene t of macrolide therapy outweighs the risk of IHPS, and such therapy should not be withheld for a young infant with pertussis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is contrain- dicated in children younger than 2 months. Supportive Care Because antimicrobial therapy for pertussis may not be effective at the time of diagnosis, supportive care is the mainstay of management. Any infant younger than 6 months with suspected pertussis should be admitted to the hospital to monitor for progression of the illness and associated com- plications and to educate family members before discharge. (38) The duration of hospitalization depends on the clinical course, including the severity of cough episodes, ability to tolerate feeds, presence of apnea and bradycardia, and pres- ence of other complications, such as pneumonia. Although cough may persist for weeks to months, the severity and frequency of these wane with time. Infants have an increasedrisk of mortality from pertussis, with 1 in 100 infants hos- pitalized for pertussis succumbing to the infection. (23) Episodes of apnea may require mechanical ventilation. Infants with severe disease should be monitored for the development of pulmonary hypertension. (38) Patients with extreme leukocytosis may require exchange transfusion. CONTROL MEASURES Chemoprophylaxis Postexposure chemoprophylaxis is recommended for asymptomatic close contacts and high-risk individuals. The CDC de nes a close contact as \"a person who had face-to-face exposure within 3 feet of a symptomatic patient; direct contact with respiratory, oral or nasal secretions; or shared the same con ned space in close proximity with a symptomatic patient for 1 hour. \"(34) Chemoprophylaxisfor high-risk individuals should be determined on a case-by- case basis. High-risk individuals include infants youngerthan 12 months, pregnant women in their third trimester, immunocompromised individuals, those with preexisting health conditions that may be worsened by pertussis, and individuals with close contact with high-risk individuals. Chemoprophylaxis is most effective if given within the rst 3 weeks after exposure and is recommended for all close contacts regardless of age or immunization status because previous immunization may not always prevent infection. Chemopro- phylactic agents to be used, dosages, and duration of chemo- prophylaxis are identical to t he treatment regimens shown in Table 2. Any household contact of a patient with pertussis whois symptomatic should be treated as having pertussis. Immunization Immunization with a pertussis vaccine (DTaP or Tdap) isrecommended for all exposed individuals who do not have an age-appropriate complete immuni zation history for pertussis. Infection Prevention Measures Droplet precautions are recommended for hospitalized patients with suspected or proven pertussis for 5 days after beginning therapy or for 21 days from initial coughing illness if no treatment was given. Transporting of patients with proven or suspected per- tussis in the ambulatory setting, such as from a pediatri- cian 'so fce to a laboratory or radiology suite, should include communication among health-care workers regarding the appropriate use of droplet precautions. Individuals exposed to a person with pertussis should be monitored for symptoms for up to 21 days. They should be excluded from child care facilities, school, and visitation at thehospital for 5 days after starting chemoprophylaxis or for 21 days if no treatment was given and they are not symptomatic. PREVENTION Vaccination is the primary method to prevent pertussis infections (Table 3). The speci c composition of pertussis vaccines varies around the world, with some countries still using whole cell vaccines. In the United States, whole cellpertussis vaccine was initially introduced in the 1940s and was transitioned to only acellular vaccines for all recom- mended pertussis immunizations by 1997. Primary Series The current recommended schedule in the United States forpertussis vaccination is DTaP at 2, 4, and 6 months; 15 to 18 m o n t h s ;a n d4t o6y e a r so fa g e ;t h e fth and nal dose need not Vol. 39 No. 5 MAY 2018 253be given if the fourth dose was given at 4 years or older. Vaccine effectiveness after the primary series is 80% to 90%. (39) Booster Doses After the transition to DTaP, there was an increase in pertussis cases noted in 2005, especially in the cohort that received only DTaP and were approximately 5 years from their last dose (Fig 1). Findings in the US data mirrored ndings in Australia after their transition to the acellular pertussis vaccine. (7) Based on these data, Tdap booster was recommended for 11- to 12-year-olds starting in 2005. Also, Tdap is recommended for any individual aged 7 to 10 yearswho has not previously been vaccinated or has been incom- pletely vaccinated with pertussis vaccine. (40) Recommendations for Tdap vaccination have been expanded over the past several years based on changing epidemiologic data, including increased cases in infants younger than 12 months, which is associated with high mortality. Recommendations for booster doses for adults and pregnant women were made to address the issue of undiagnosed adult cases serving as a reservoir leading to severe infection in infants. In addition to the Tdap booster doses at 11 to 12 years old, all adults who have not previouslyreceived a Tdap should receive 1 dose of Tdap in place of routine tetanus vaccination. It is also recommended that pregnant women receive Tdap with each pregnancy at 26 to 37 weeks 'gestation, ideally earlier during this period to allow for transfer of antibodies to the infant. (41) These recommendations are part of a cocooning strategy to prevent severe disease in young infants. This strategy uses vaccina- tion of close contacts, such as parents, grandparents, and other caregivers, to help protect high-risk individuals.Although the cocooning strategy has been challenging, it is currently the best method available to protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated. (23)Adverse Events and Contraindications Local reactions to pertussis vaccines are the most common adverse events in infants after pertussis immunization and include erythema, swelling, and tenderness at the site of injection, and they are often accompanied by sleepiness, restlessness, vomiting, and low-grade fever. Entire limbswelling involving the thigh or the arm occurs in 2% to 3% of vaccines after the fourth or fth dose of pertussis vaccine. Erythema, pain, and fever often occur in conjunc- tion with the limb swelling, which resolves spontaneously and rarely limits a child 's activity. Systemic reactions to pertussis vaccination occur much less frequently after DTaP than after DTwP and include: \u0081Prolonged severe crying for 3 or more hours occurring within 48 hours of vaccination \u0081Seizures, most of which are febrile seizures \u0081Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes \u0081High fever (temperature 104.9\u00b0F [ 40.5\u00b0C]) Because these reactions do not result in any long-term sequelae, they are not contraindications to subsequent per- tussis vaccination. (29) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics Com- mittee on Infectious Diseases, the only true contraindications to pertussis vaccination include a previous anaphylactic reac- tion to a previous dose or a vaccine component, and an encephalopathy occurring within 7 days of a previous doseof pertussis-containing vaccine that is not attributable to another cause. (29) Local events after pertussis vaccination in adolescents are common and include redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site. Severe arm swelling in this population is rare and self-limited. Systemic signs of illness, such as fever, headache, and fatigue, are common. Syncope is more common in adolescents than in infants and young children. TABLE 3.

Summary \u0081Based on strong research evidence, the epidemiology of whooping cough is changing. (3)(5) \u0081Based on strong research evidence, many factors seem to be contributing to the changing epidemiology of pertussis,including the exclusive use of acellular pertussis vaccines, waning immunity, changes to the organism, vaccine refusal, and undiagnosed cases.

The baby was born full term and without complications. There is no other signi cant medical history. The mother reports that overnight she noted several short episodes of apnea and is concerned that the baby has been feeding poorly. The baby is afebrile. There is a 5-year-old sibling in the home who has been healthy and has had all regularly recommended vaccinations. Onfurther interview, the mother tells you that the maternal grandmother, who has been helping care for the infant, has had a \"terrible \"cough for the past 2 weeks with some posttussive emesis. The grandmother had received whole cell pertussis vaccine manyyears ago. What is the most likely epidemiologic factor leading to the transmission ofpertussis to the infant in this scenario? A. Children aged 1 to 5 years are an important reservoir of pertussis infection. B. The acellular pertussis vaccine that is used now seems to be more effective than whole cell pertussis vaccine. C.
