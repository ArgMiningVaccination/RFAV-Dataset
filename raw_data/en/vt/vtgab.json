This is in sharp contrast to the American or Western forms of health care, which have been in existence for a much shorter time span. The primary feature of modern Chinese medicine is the premise that good health relies on the restoration and maintenance of harmony, balance and order to the individual. Traditional Chinese medicine takes a holistic approach to understanding normal function and disease processes and focuses as much on the prevention of illness as it does on the treatment. In the United States, people use traditional Chinese medicine primarily as a complementary health approach.
