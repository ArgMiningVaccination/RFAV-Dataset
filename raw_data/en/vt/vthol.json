From its humble beginnings as a single hospital in a two-story wooden house in Cleveland, University Hospitals has grown into a multihospital health system that includes a thriving academic medical center, 18 hospitals, 40 health centers and dozens of medical practices - all working together to serve 1 million people throughout Northeast Ohio. As University Hospitals took shape over the years, it distinguished itself within the Northeast Ohio community and across the country. Our national reputation for providing high-quality care, our direct involvement in pioneering medical advancements and clinical discoveries, and a continued commitment to training the next generation of health care providers demonstrate that from the beginning, we were living the UH mission: To Heal. To Teach. To Discover. Our history is richly woven into the growth of this community, and having the support and trust of the people we serve has enabled us to flourish through the decades and become a respected community leader. UH is prepared for the future of medicine, inspired by our rich history and dedicated to our mission. We look forward to continuing to serve Northeast Ohio with purpose, passion and promise for decades to come.
