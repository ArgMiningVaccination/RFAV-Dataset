The more one reads, the more it becomes clear that the \"experts\" barely agree on anything. How can we know that what we're doing is effective, or even safe? Some experts say to juice raw kale. Other experts say that kale should always be cooked, otherwise it will suppress the thyroid. Some experts say to avoid juicing because all of that sugar without the fiber is bad for our health. Other experts say that juicing is essential for detox. Some experts say to avoid caffeine during a detox. Other experts say the science shows that caffeine actually stimulates detoxification pathways and that it should be a part of a detox program. A third group says only if it's administered in the form of an enema! Some experts say that drinking lemon juice in the morning is a great way to detoxify. Other experts say that citrus inhibits molecular detox pathways. Some experts say that massages help detox our tissues. Other experts say that science shows that massage actually creates toxins - myoglobin molecules, which in worst case scenarios, can lead to rhabdomyolysis! Some experts say that extended water fasts are the best way to detox. Other experts say that extended water fasts are much too dangerous for modern people because we risk mobilizing stored toxins that can recirculate into our brains and other organs where they can cause serious damage. Who can we trust? Who knows for sure? Rethinking Detox with Practical Homeopathy\u00ae How to Stop Stressing About Toxins and Fearlessly Achieve Health the Simple Way Have we lost sight of our true goal? Health? Is an obsession with toxicity leading us to greater health? Or is it draining our time, our wallets, our energy, and our joy? I'm offering a stress-relieving solution. This Q&A Webinar was created during the Live Presentation of this Course back in Spring of 2019. If you are struggling with the burden of strict diets, expensive supplement regimens, and taxing detox treatments such as enemas, colonic irrigation and frequent fasts, this is the course for you. If you have become fearful and anxious about the toxic world that we live in, this is the course for you. If you feel you will never regain your health until you can clean out your body, this is the course for you. If you worry about the toxic burden your family carries, this is the course for you. This is the course to help you relax and stop worrying. This is the course to show you a better way to approach these problems. This is the course to help you let go of fear and choose joy instead. Take a deep breath, you are right where you should be. What if I told you that there is a simple, effective and MUCH LESS STRESSFUL way to pursue our health goals? One without the vigilance and paranoia that accompanies our culture's current obsession with toxins and detoxification? A relatively safe, gentle, natural medicine that has withstood the test of time and brought healing to millions of people over the last two centuries. A medicine that YOU can learn and put to use at home. A medicine that is inexpensive, empowering and free from side effects. A medicine that is FUN to learn. No more late nights staying awake reading confusing and conflicting information on the internet about the daily changing science of chemicals, genetics, molecular detox pathways, high tech detox tools and treatments, etc., etc., etc. Just the stress of trying to learn the real facts about detox can give you a headache! It's too easy to get lost in an endless maze; moving round and round but never getting any closer to your ultimate goal of health. If you feel that your life has become a weary exercise in rigid discipline, this is the course for you. Let me tell you a couple stories to illustrate what I mean about the stress of this kind of toxic thinking, and why I believe \u2014 why I KNOW \u2014 there is a better way: Let me tell you about a woman we'll call Margaret... Margaret was tired. Too tired to exercise or put any effort into her clothes, hair or makeup most days. Those were all things Margaret used to love, but now it was all she could manage just to drag herself out of bed each morning and care for her one child, or scrape together some kind of dinner for the family by the time her husband Luke came home from work. It all started around five years ago ... Luke and Margaret were newlyweds living in a rented house. A house that turned out to be full of mold. At first, Margaret barely noticed the fatigue creeping up on her, but weird symptoms started manifesting here and there. A prickly, itchy feeling just under her skin at night - Margaret looked it up and found it was called formication - it felt like tiny insects crawling under her skin and it made Margaret's sleep restless. And migraines! Margaret had rarely suffered from headaches before but now she was getting migraines at least once a month. Luke and Margaret had wanted to start a family right away, as soon as they got married. But as one year turned into two, and then three years, Margaret became increasingly worried. Gynecologists and fertility specialists ran tests on both Margaret and Luke but could find nothing wrong. Meanwhile, even Luke was starting to feel the toll taken by their damp home. Or maybe it was just the stress and worry over their inability to conceive a child? At any rate, he was complaining of tiredness and irritability, maybe even a touch of depression. And Margaret's headaches were becoming more frequent. But then something wonderful happened ... Margaret got pregnant! Margaret and Luke were elated, and they made the decision to move out of the moldy apartment for their own health and for the health of their unborn child. Margaret had high hopes that their move would cure all of their problems. But the pregnancy was not an easy one. The migraines came more frequently, the morning sickness was awful, the formication was still there (making sleep difficult), and the fatigue was getting worse and worse. Eventually the baby was born - they named her Annabelle after Luke's mother, and Margaret looked forward to life resuming back to \"normal.\" Surely now that the pregnancy was over, her health and energy would return! But it didn't. If anything, Margaret felt more drained than ever, as though she had been robbed of her vitality with no chance to rest and recover. Breastfeeding exhausted her, all the same old symptoms persisted, but now she found she was having difficulty losing the pregnancy weight and had developed serious brain fog and an irritating fluttery-eyelid tic. The migraines were appearing twice weekly and preventing Margaret from getting anything done while she suffered. Although she'd never been interested in holistic health before, Margaret spent more and more time reading about health topics on the internet and buying books in the local health food store. She felt desperate and had to get to the bottom of what was ailing her. Slowly, Margaret became convinced that the mold in their old apartment was the root of all her problems. She began doing monthly juice fasts and started taking supplements that her reading and books assured her would detox the mold lurking inside her body. Usually Margaret felt better immediately after a juice fast. Her mind felt clearer, her body felt lighter, and she just knew that toxins were leaving her body. She could tell because her nighttime itching would get worse. Surely that was a sign she was detoxing, Margaret promised herself as she tossed and turned in her bed. But overall, things weren't getting better. The brain fog wasn't better overall. The fatigue wasn't better overall. The migraines weren't better. The itching wasn't better. Margaret buckled down. All the books and websites said you had to feel worse before you felt better. Well she certainly did feel worse, that must be proof that the detoxes were working. She assumed it must be her; she probably just wasn't putting enough effort into it. If she spent more money on treatments and exercised more discipline, Margaret was convinced she could regain her health faster. Margaret became obsessed. Like a (tired) Spartan warrior princess, Margaret seized control of their home. No more sugar! No more gluten! No more meat! Nothing that wasn't organic and GMO-free! These foods were dangerous, and were poisoning her family; Margaret could sense it. She could sense that her family was full of horrible toxins, even her precious baby. Just thinking about it was enough to bring on a migraine. Margaret shuddered to think of the mold and parasites and heavy metals and plastics and hormones lurking in her poor child's little body! Every time Margaret breastfed Annabelle, she worried about what toxins might be lurking in her breast milk, and felt as though she were poisoning her own child. Margaret spent thousands of dollars on tests to try and find out exactly what toxins were in her body, preventing her from feeling healthy. She spent even more on chelation treatments, colonic irrigation, and more and more and more supplements. She invested in an infrared sauna for their home, and they got rid of everything they could that might be off-gassing harmful toxins. They replaced their expensive and new, super-comfortable mattress with an organic wool mattress that made Luke's back sore. They installed a whole-house, reverse-osmosis water filtration system. Margaret knew that all of these efforts must be helping. And she did have good days sometimes, especially during or after a low-sugar green juice fast. But overall, was she getting better? Margaret said, \"Yes, I MUST be getting better. The problem is that I'm just SO toxic. I must be full of heavy metals and residue from the ghosts of drugs past and all that mold, that terrible mold that pushed me over the edge.\" But Luke pressed his lips into a firm line and thought to himself, \"Our savings is almost gone and it doesn't seem like she's getting better.\" Margaret's mother saw the stress and fatigue in her, the premature wrinkles forming around her eyes, and thought, \"this is not my vivacious daughter. This paranoid woman who is afraid to eat in a restaurant with me on Mother's Day is not getting better.\" Finally, the day came when Luke put his foot down. He had had enough. It was a Saturday. Margaret had just gotten out of the shower, and she seemed to be having a nervous breakdown. Luke wasn't exactly sure what was going on, but the baby was wailing in her crib, and Margaret was wailing in the bathroom. \"My hair!\" Margaret moaned, \"my hair!!!!\" Luke looked at Margaret's hair. It looked the same to him. \"It's GONE!\" Margaret wailed, holding up a massive clump of hair that she'd collected from the shower floor. She sobbed in exhaustion, her shoulders heaving. Margaret couldn't understand it. She'd worked so hard, studied so much, spent so much money, exercised so much discipline and vigilance. Why wasn't she getting better? Luke sighed. \"Margaret,\" he said, \"this isn't working... let's try something different.\" My Story Hi everyone, my name is Joette Calabrese and I'm a homeopathic consultant, lecturer, and author. I'm also a Weston A. Price Foundation Honorary Board member and author of the column in Wise Traditions called, \"The Homeopathy Journal.\" But more importantly, I'm also a mother and a person just like you who has struggled with serious health conditions in the past, including: - Severe environmental illness - Allergies - Pesticide exposure that resulted in a miscarriage I know the dangers of TOXINS. I pushed my city, Buffalo, NY, to become the first city in the United States to eliminate or minimize pesticides in and on public property. I worked with city council members, the mayor's office, and every hospital in the Buffalo vicinity to halt their lawn pesticide practices. I'll give you the happy ending to Margaret's story in a minute, but first let me tell you: I used to be a lot like Margaret. I became consumed by the same fears, the same obsessions, the same paranoia and drive to achieve purity and perfection. I lived in fear of cigarette smoke, household chemicals, cosmetics, air pollution, food additives and GMOs, dental procedures, tap water, mold, and of course, pesticides. I thought the vigilant and perfect avoidance of these toxins was the only way I would get MY health back and ensure my family's health. But I was wrong. It took me many years, and it was a long and winding road for me. I am the woman I am now because I discovered there IS a better way. A less stressful, much simpler, but also highly effective way. I now depend on homeopathy for my health and for the health of my family. I find this medicine not only brings me health, vitality, and more energy than I've ever had before, but it also brings me JOY \u2014 not stress. I want to show you a SHORTCUT to get to where I am now, so you don't have to waste time and money traveling down that same dark, foggy path Margaret and I did. But first, let me tell you the rest of Luke and Margaret's story. (Now I should also mention that, for the sake of anonymity, Luke and Margaret are pseudonyms, and their story is a consolidation of similar cases I've heard time and time again from many different clients. This kind of scenario is extremely common!) \"Margaret, there's this woman at work who told me about something called homeopathy,\" Luke began. \"She has all these little bottles of pills that she hands out when someone has a sore throat or a headache or something ... and they work! And she says it's all safe and natural - no side effects or toxic additives or anything. She's so excited about homeopathy that she talks about it all the time, and she takes courses and has study groups that meet at her house. I'll bet she knows someone who could help you with your migraines. Why don't you talk to her ... please?\" Little did Luke know that this would be the turning point for his family. Out of sheer exhaustion and desperation, Margaret called Luke's co-worker Sandra that very afternoon and asked her what she recommended for migraines. Sandra asked Margaret several questions about her health problems, and, like a floodgate opening, Margaret poured out the whole story. When Margaret began talking about her mold toxicity and the heavy metals present in her hair analysis tests, the tears started flowing from her eyes and she could feel the stress tightening her chest again. \"Sandra,\" she sobbed, \"these toxins are killing me. Does homeopathy have a way to get them OUT of my body?\" Sandra was quiet for a moment while she waited for Margaret to catch her breath. \"Margaret,\" she said, \"don't worry about it. Just stop. Stop worrying about it.\" Margaret felt shocked and disappointed. A wave of frustration washed over her. This woman was out of touch. She was kind, but she didn't understand. She didn't know enough about mold and plastics and xenoestrogens and parabens and glyphosate and how toxic the world was. Margaret felt tired. Then Sandra said, \"Let me give you the name of someone I know who can probably help you.\" This is when Margaret contacted me. Margaret came to me with the same questions and concerns that she'd expressed to my student Sandra. Primarily, Margaret wanted to know if I could help her detox because she still believed that was the only lens through which to interpret her poor health, and the only path to gain her health back again. I explained to Margaret that homeopathy has been used for over 200 years to address toxins ranging from DDT to kerosene but in her case, I might not be recommending homeopathic medicines specifically aimed at eliminating toxins. I discussed homeopathic medicines with her that I explained had a history of uprooting all of Margaret's conditions directly - the migraines, the fatigue, the itching, the eyelid twitch, the brain fog, even her prior infertility. \"But what about the toxins,\" Margaret asked, \"what remedies will help me get rid of those?\" \"Margaret,\" I said, \"I think you've lost sight of your goal. Yes, homeopathy has remedies that will help address specific toxins, but what is your real goal?\" Margaret thought for a minute. The first thing that came to her mind was \"to be free of toxins... I want to be clean, pure.\" And then, like a lightning flash, Margaret realized how silly that was. She had never worried about that kind of thing when she was younger. She had just enjoyed her health and her energy. \"I want to be healthy,\" Margaret said. \"I want my energy back. My headaches gone. I want to stop itching and start thinking clearly again.\" \"So let's put aside our concern with toxicity for a while, and work on these problems more directly,\" I replied. Margaret was wary, but she agreed to try homeopathy for just her most debilitating condition at first: Belladonna 3C and Picric acid 200C for migraines, to be taken every three hours whenever a migraine came on, until the migraine was gone. Margaret had her first opportunity to test the homeopathic medicines a few days later. It was a terrible migraine this time! Margaret had to call her mother to come over to care for the baby so that she could lie still in her darkened bedroom. Margaret almost forgot about the homeopathic pills; though she took them anyway, she had little faith they'd do much to help her. But Margaret got lucky: the migraine started out awful, but after around four hours and two doses of the remedies, the pain was gone. \"Was it the remedies?\" Margaret wondered. \"Maybe. Or maybe it was just coincidence. Or placebo.\" But the remedies held up. Each time Margaret had a migraine, the remedies helped cut it shorter and shorter. Soon, Margaret wasn't getting migraines anymore, just normal headaches. And then one day, Margaret noticed that she hadn't even had a headache in weeks. At our follow up consultation, Margaret was notably excited. \"Joette! I think your little pills worked! I don't know how, but I haven't had a real migraine in months! And I haven't even been keeping up with my detox treatments. In fact, our diet has been far from perfect these past few weeks! Do you think homeopathy could help my hair loss?\" I smiled, \"I've witnessed it work for not only that, but also for fatigue, brain fog, itching and eyelid tics also. That pretty much sums up your list, right?\" \"Oh gosh,\" Margaret responded, \"you know what? I think the eyelid tic is gone already, I haven't even thought about it lately!\" When Margaret called Sandra to tell her about the incredible progress she was making with her health, Sandra invited Margaret to join her homeopathy study group: several women and a few men in the area were all meeting up weekly to study this gentle medicine ... learning how to uproot their own health problems and to care for their families. Margaret thought about it and decided that if she gave up her monthly chelation treatments, she would have time for the study group and save a lot of money at the same time. She may even make some new friends. Eventually Margaret's health was so improved, she felt she didn't need to consult with me on an individual basis anymore. Instead, Margaret began taking my courses so she could gain the confidence and competence to raise her child using homeopathy instead of drugs like antibiotics and Tylenol. And this is how Margaret's life changed. The more she learned about homeopathy, the more she was able to address and uproot her family's health problems without stress and vigilance and without exerting a Spartan stranglehold on her family \u2014 a stranglehold based on fear and anxiety. As Margaret's health and energy improved, she found she had more time as well. No longer was she spending hours studying toxins and dangers; no longer was she spending hours studying the latest science on how to detect toxin levels in the body; no longer was she spending hours juicing and purging her body with laxatives; no longer was she spending hours counting out her weekly supplements, going to appointments for colonic irrigation and chelation (and then recovering from those appointments). Not to mention all the money saved! Margaret put a fraction of that extra time and money into furthering her study of homeopathy. The rest she poured into her family, into joyful and exhilarating exercise, into a touch of makeup and a new outfit, and poring over recipes for delicious dishes she used to love before she became afraid of them. Margaret wasn't afraid anymore. Alright folks, so many of you already know that I'm a mom who has raised her three boys to adulthood using only homeopathy and pig-headed determination. This course is for you if you know a lot of homeopathy... This course is for you even if you know very little homeopathy... And it's particularly for you if you've struggled in the past with using homeopathy. In my many years of practice as a homeopath, I've seen a lot of cases. Many cases just like Margaret's. Over time I learned not only what remedies, protocols and methods work the best and most consistently, I've also had the chance to observe the rabbit holes that lead people down meandering paths, distracting them from their real goal - health, energy, freedom and joy. In cases like Margaret's, I believe a fixation on detox can hinder healing. It becomes an added source of stress and an unnecessary detour that doesn't really help one find the quickest and easiest route to health. The way I see it, sometimes the whole notion of toxicity is a rabbit hole that draws us away from our REAL goal: health. Sometimes all it does is serve as a stressful distraction from better methods of achieving health. Then again, there are also occasions when toxicity IS the main problem, and homeopathy has a wealth of medicines we can call upon when the effects of toxicity are clear and obvious. In these cases, homeopathy has methods for addressing such complaints simply and straightforwardly. In my time as a practicing homeopath, I've taken a great number of toxicity cases. Let me assure you, homeopathy has excellent medicines for addressing ailments arising from toxins such as heavy metals, mold, pesticides, food additives, and much more! Let me tell you another story to give you another example. Let's take the case of John, a resident of Flint, Michigan. John's exposure to lead in the Flint water supply lead to symptoms of fatigue, mental confusion, muscle weakness and incontinence, despite his young age of 42. The incontinence was an excruciatingly embarrassing problem for him: even though it was just a dribble, he worried that he would smell and people would notice. While the incontinence problem was the most serious in John's mind, he was also troubled by his lack of focus at work, his inability to keep up with his former regimen at the gym, and the fatigue that made his life seem more like a chore each day. Three of the top remedies that would be considered in a case like John's would be Plumbum, Alumina and Causticum - all excellent and time-tested medicines for uprooting the negative effects of lead exposure. In John's case, Causticum made the most sense, as it covered the majority of his symptoms, especially the incontinence that was his top priority. John bought a bottle of Causticum 6C at his local health food store for seven dollars and took the medicine twice a day for three months. Within eight weeks of having begun the medicine, John's urinary incontinence was greatly improved. He only had a bit of leakage when he coughed hard or lifted an overly heavy weight at the gym. By twelve weeks, John was reporting much better energy, muscle strength, mental focus and the incontinence was gone. John kept up with the remedy twice a day for a few more weeks, and then switched to once a day until he felt he had no more need for the medicine. Get started today! Rethinking Detox with Practical Homeopathy\u00ae How to Stop Stressing About Toxins and Fearlessly Achieve Health the Simple Way If you intuitively feel your efforts at detoxing your body are making your life MORE difficult and your health an even MORE distant goal, join me for an in-depth discussion of alternatives to how we think about toxins and detoxification, as well as Practical Protocols for peace of mind. Course Syllabus Rethinking Detox with Practical Homeopathy\u00ae: How to Stop Stressing About Toxins and Fearlessly Achieve Health the Simple Way We'll be covering ailments that arise from exfposure to common toxins such as mold, pesticides, heavy metals, and more. Check out the syllabus by clicking the button below. We'll be discussing concepts like: - How the homeopathic approach differs from the naturopathic, functional medicine or conventional medical approach to toxicity and detox - When to detox \u2014 and how \u2014 and when to let it go and stop worrying about it - The possibility of prophylactic approaches before exposure to toxins - Is it important to identify the toxin? - Toxins-in vs. toxins-out: analyzing the unknowns of what's happening vs. the reality of how one feels - How to identify a helpful diagnosis - The importance of symptoms and how they represent deeper conditions - The difference between detoxification and uprooting a concrete diagnosis - How to utilize a Materia Medica and Repertory to find the best medicines for the job - Plus, all of the specific toxins included on [this syllabus](https://detox.joettecalabrese.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Toxins-Course-Syllabus-FEB-26-REV-JC-REV-LD.pdf), as well as others not included on the official syllabus What we will NOT be doing in this course is going in depth into serious diseases such as autism, cancer and MS. I know that many of you approach these problems as being caused by underlying issues of toxicity, but that is not how homeopathy traditionally looks at these ailments. What you WILL learn in the course is more about these distinctions between approaches. So why do you need this information? I used to believe that we lived in a toxic world, and that made me scared. I now believe that we live in a complicated world. A confusing world sometimes. But I'm not scared anymore. There are ways to sift through that confusion and simplify things. Ways to approach life with confident and competent joy, rather than anxious hyper-vigilance. This is what I want to share with you and teach you. My goal is that you will complete this course with a better ability to identify and attain your real health goals, without getting lost in deep, dark, labyrinthine rabbit holes. My goal is to give you practical protocols and information about time-tested remedies that will speed up your ability to uproot the health conditions bothering you and your family. My goal is to make these things simple for you. Homeopathy, like any worthwhile medical modality, is complex. But I can teach you the shortcuts I've learned with time and experience. And let me assure you, homeopathy is easy in comparison to trying to untangle the confusing mess that is the current world of detox practices and detox-thinking: A complicated world of chemistry, biology, and technology, where we are surrounded by conflicting information that changes daily, competing financial interests, and a crisis over who we can trust to give us real facts. I choose homeopathy because I no longer have time to waste poring over these draining and frightening ideas. I have gardens to tend, family to laugh with, delicious meals to cook, flea markets to visit, and places to travel. Why do I need to focus on the latest information about molecular detox pathways when I know homeopathy can do the job simply and with less stress? Deep down, we know there must be a better way. Get started today! Rethinking Detox with Practical Homeopathy\u00ae How to Stop Stressing About Toxins and Fearlessly Achieve Health the Simple Way If you intuitively feel your efforts at detoxing your body are making your life MORE difficult and your health an even MORE distant goal, join me for an in-depth discussion of alternatives to how we think about toxins and detoxification, as well as Practical Protocols for peace of mind. It's time to go in-depth and share my favorite protocols with you. I'll teach you not only the protocols that I use, but we'll observe sample cases where I show you how I like to lay out and combine those protocols. All of this will be discussed in a step-by-step fashion that makes homeopathy easy to learn and apply at home. \"Joette has drastically changed the health of my family! Her courses are fantastic, and have made homeopathy accessible and useable to families without requiring them to have years of study before being able to successfully use the protocols. And on top of that, the amount of free information she provides to the public is amazing. I have learned so much from her and have successfully treated many illnesses and injuries without having to resort to powerful drugs with long lists of side effects.\" Your Takeaway Some of this foundational instruction constitutes a refresher for my former students. But rest assured, whether you're a newbie or an experienced student of mine, this information is assured to benefit everyone. With each new \"take\" on a subject and the new perspective gained from each different course, you will flesh out your understanding of and hone your grasp on these subject - How diagnosis relates to homeopathy's approach to ailments that may or may not have a \"toxic\" component. - How too much theorizing can hamper your quest for health: chasing the wrong \"diagnosis.\" If your starting assumptions are wrong, your whole paradigm will be wrong. - As always, you'll learn protocols, protocols, protocols! I teach you protocols that I developed over the years, protocols that I learned directly from the Drs. Banerji in Kolkata, India, and we'll go over the protocols from the Banerjis' book, because the book can be difficult for non-professional homeopaths to understand and use. - Case studies. I use cases as teaching tools. What comes with the course? And just like all my other courses: If you are new to homeopathy, this is the homework that will bring you up to speed before this course starts. If you are experienced, it provides a valuable refresher for some things you may have forgotten or missed. Let me warn you, my courses are so crammed with information that people used to complain they felt overwhelmed. I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL OVERWHELMED. I want you to find this easy, fun, and do-able. That's why I made this mini-course. That's why I created this format that allows you to go back and review each lesson as many times as you like, as slowly or as quickly as you like. I've been doing this for a while, and my classes draw an audience that covers the broadest range from experienced medical practitioners, to curious moms with no prior experience with homeopathy. I believe I've perfected the art of making sure no matter what your skill level is, you will feel comfortable with and be able to benefit from my courses; that's the whole point. MY goal is for YOU to learn the skills and information you need to care for your family with homeopathy, and to achieve so many success stories that you develop the same passion for homeopathy that I have. Infographic Download the Rethinking Detox Infographic today! People sometimes accuse me of being an angry woman. Well, you know what? I can't deny that I sometimes am. I get angry when I see the devastation wrought on families by the pharmaceutical industry, by a medical establishment too quick to push drugs or other suppressive treatments, by a society that brainwashes us into believing that only \"experts\" are capable of healing. I believe that knowledge is power. And I want to see that power returned to the capable, caring, conscientious hands of mothers who have gained the confidence to use it. That's what I'm all about. This is an indispensable course if you are looking to learn how to become the healer in YOUR home when it comes to conditions such as: - Symptoms from mold exposure - Symptoms from exposure to mercury, lead and other heavy metals - Parasites - My approach to problems with glyphosate and other pesticides - Symptoms from food additives - Symptoms from food and water pollution - Symptoms from radiation, radon, EMF, Wi-Fi, cell towers, computer and device radiation - Toxicity from medical tests/methods - Chemical sensitivities - And much more My students know I have a tendency to cover a lot more than what's initially included in the syllabus! This course is based on over 28 years of experience with over 128,000 consultations. I've heard all the stories. Most of my clients came to me after they'd tried everything else. My Practical Homeopathy\u00ae Protocols make the journey to health so much simpler - without the side effects. Get started today!

I know you are hungry to learn a safe, inexpensive way to uproot you or your family's \"toxic condition\"- take a deep breath and relax ... you are right where you should be. I know because I was there many years ago. Back then, I wish I knew what I know now. I didn't have someone to hold my hand and show me the shortcuts, but you do. Why Homoepathy? We have all done it. I tried all these things as well, and experienced all of the same frustrations until I found homeopathy. Homeopathy is a 200-year-old medical paradigm. Are you aware of any other alternative medical standard that has been followed, utilized and researched for over 200 years? Worldwide use of homeopathy is growing at a rate of 25%, except in one country - The United States - but that's a whole other story in and of itself. Homeopathic Remedies are Safe, Effective Medicine. It is easy to find examples of Homeopathy being used: - My own local children's hospital routinely gives Arnica to emergency room patients. Imagine! - For many years, plastic surgeons have been using Arnica under the name SinEcch to control swelling. If you are afraid of the side effects of drugs; if you are tired of wasting money on ineffective supplements; if you are exhausted and stressed from trying to find the best alternative solution, and you rightfully suspect you are one of the 60 million suffering from an illness related to allergies...then you and I have something in common. I tried all these things as well, and experienced all of the same frustrations until I found homeopathy; more specifically, the Banerji Protocols, which allowed me to truly break through that wall of frustration. In this course, I will teach you the methods that made such a difference in my life, the lives of my family, my clients and my friends, as well as provide you with the ability to make a profound difference in your life. I can teach you I know the way to make the complex simple, the methods learnable today, and the solutions practical. After nearly three decades of devotion to the WAPF methods, 60 weeks working side by side with the doctors at the world-famous Banerji Clinic in Kolkata, India, and 27 years of clinical experience related to gut, diet, and psychology...I have cracked the case. I will teach you Practical Homeopathy. To your classical homeopath, I know this sounds blasphemous but please, read on and let me explain. I have been where you are now. I've dieted, taken supplements, bio-identical hormones, essential oils, herbs - but nothing, nothing has ever come close to the reproducible, safe, and effective results both I and my clients have achieved with homeopathy. Teaching families has been my mission from day one, but oh, how frustrating it was when I always had to put my hand up and explain that this or that was outside the ability of a family to treat because it was a chronic condition. The final pieces came together for me while I was in India working at the Banerji Clinic in Kolkata. I traveled to Kolkata, India. Throughout my many fellowships over a total of 60 weeks, I sat next to the Drs. Banerji, observing and recording over 10,254 cases. After a long day in the clinic shared with Dr. Prasanta and his son, Dr. Pratip Banerji, I would travel to the inner-city to visit the free evening clinic, and for 3-4 hours every night, I cataloged practically every disease known in the free world. I observed and recorded as many as 100 cases per day. I loved every single moment of this remarkable training, and now you get to reap the benefits. Banerji Protocol vs. Classical Homeopathy Peer Review I presented my case for Practical Homeopathy. Four years ago in April, I presented my case at the National Center of Homeopathy for a Practical Homeopathy and Pathology-Specific Homeopathy to a standing-room-only group of more than 500 attendees (mostly practitioners and students of the classical mode.) Although I initially expected them to throw tomatoes at me, instead they were encouraged to learn there was a way other than classical that produced consistent results. As a direct result of this, the Drs. Banerji were asked to present on the subject in California a year later. Get started today! Rethinking Detox with Practical Homeopathy\u00ae How to Stop Stressing About Toxins and Fearlessly Achieve Health the Simple Way If you intuitively feel your efforts at detoxing your body are making your life MORE difficult and your health an even MORE distant goal, join me for an in-depth discussion of alternatives to how we think about toxins and detoxification, as well as Practical Protocols for peace of mind. Potential Reasons You Think You Should Not Take This Course: [\"I am working with a classical homeopath and she says what I am telling you is not classical and won't work.\"] She is right; it is not classical. I will not cast aspersions on classical homeopaths - however, I will tell you, if you want to take control of your own health and the health of your children by becoming the healer in your home using efficacious, reproducible, simple practical protocols - this is the only way! If you accept the benefits of homeopathy - but see it as too complicated a medicine to study in depth - this is the only way! Practical Homeopathy\u00ae, reproducible efficacious results, with easy-to-learn practical protocols Join me in my world of homeopathy with velocity. You'll be able to learn the protocols and use them with confidence! [\"I want the healthiest way to raise my children, but I'm unsure if homeopathy is what I should be studying.\"] This is the medicine you thought you were getting from your family doctor. I raised my three boys to adulthood with only homeopathy and pig-headed determination. And yes, they never received a single antibiotic. EVER! All study materials will be available 24/7 for you to study from the comfort of your living room on your time. Yes, the initial purchase may be a financial stretch for some - however, with the protocols in hand, your lifetime savings in co-pays will pay for the course while the lifetime savings to your health will prove invaluable. [\"I just purchased my first Essential Oils kit and I can't possibly find the time to learn another health paradigm.\"] I understand this might not be your time. The clients that I consult with are special; they share a common character trait - they have suffered long, \"tried everything,\" been frustrated with only little successes, and land at my door with no other alternative left to try. This course aims to teach you my methods for addressing common, everyday family bacterial infections. By learning how to do this at home, you can avoid the overuse of antibiotics (reserving their use for truly life-threatening conditions) and enjoy vibrant health free from what I refer to as antibiotic fallout. Simply put, this course is designed to get you out ahead of all the conditions that I help to resolve in the other courses. Imagine, no food allergies, no eczema, no female problems... Benjamin Franklin said something 250 years ago that still rings true today. I believe this quote, and my free infographic, should be on everyone's refrigerator: \"If you think knowledge is expensive, try ignorance.\" You have some choices: Are you going to travel down the conventional medical conveyor belt? Or, attempt to climb by yourself the alternative medicine paradigm ladder with you and/or your children's precious health in the balance? Or, are you going leap ahead, start using the medicine you have been searching for (the medicine you thought you were getting from your doctor) and take back your God-given right to be the healthcare provider in your family? If you have a daughter or son, you instinctively know they may develop food allergies. Are you ready to get on the medical conveyor belt, or the alternative medical gauntlet of expensive supplements? Do you really want to start a rigid, restrictive diet? Vision isn't easy. As a result, many of you will let this opportunity to... - Gain Confidence - Gain Competence - Gain Pride - Gain Freedom from worry, and doubt. - Take control back from the insensitive medical establishment. Interact with them on your terms. ...slip through your fingers and live to regret it. In this case, I will make it easy for you not to let this one pass you by.
