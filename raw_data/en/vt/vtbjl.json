Natural processes are effective in treating wastewater to Orego n's environmental standards often times at a l ower cost to the community, due to lower ongoing maintenance costs and lower operating costs, including reduced chemical and energy costs. For many Oregon communities e specially in rural Oregon tree farms, treated water reuse for crops such as hay and pasture, and treatment ponds, b uild on the natural resource management expertis e resident in the community. Water quality trading is another innovative regulatory strategy that can build on the success of soil and water conserva tion districts, watershed cou ncils, and other nonprofit partnerships, to substitute more effective natural systems for steelandconcrete systems. Water quality trading also often provides substantial savings t o the community while providing multiple environmental benefits. A variety of Oregon communities c urrently use natural treatment systems to meet water quality requirements, almost always at a cost substantially les s than conventional steel andconcrete systems, while also providing amenities to the com munity such as recreational access, open space, and opportunities for environm ental education. A selection of Oregon communities u sing natural treatment systems include: Wetland treatment systems in Salem, and Albany Recycled water irrigation systems in Cottage Grove, Silverton, Myrtle Creek, Newberg, and Prineville, and Bend Tree farms in Woodburn, Eugene/S pringfield, Harrisburg, and Ven eta Indirect discharge at Roseburg U rban Sanitary Authority (RUSA) Water quality trading programs f or Clean Water Services and Med ford Wastewater treatment ponds in D ufur, LaGrande, and Condon Match Natural Treatment Systems to Water Quality Challenges Many Oregon cities and towns fac e strict water quality discharg e requirements to meet stringent limits set to protect fish populations. Every commun ity should insist that natural systems are evaluated and considered along side traditional con creteandsteel solutions. Oregon communities with experien ce in using natural treatment s ystems have found the natural systems to be lower in costs to operate and maintain du e to reduced energy and chemical expenses. Some natural treatment systems can be desig ned to require only a State water quality permit, not a federal water quality permit, lowering permit fees, lessening regulatory requirements and reducing risk. Many syst ems can provide additional 6 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 6 community benefits such as irriga ting ball fields and providing outdoor recreation opportunities in a p arklike setting. The table below summarizes the types of natural treatment syste ms that perform best to meet specific types of water po llution control restrictions: Water Quality Treatment Target Wetland Treat\u00ad ment Phyto Treat\u00ad ment Recycled Water Phyto Treat\u00ad ment Tree Farms Indirect DischargeWater Quality Trading Wastewater Pond Systems Nutrient Restrictions Temperature Restrictions Toxic water quality limits Ammonia Chlorine For many communities, linking a variety of natural treatment sy stems, or linking a traditional mechanical treatment system followed by a variety o f natural treatment systems is the best wastewater treatment match for the communit y. Natural Treatment Systems Can Cost Less Designing and installing natural treatment systems can reduce c osts. For instance, The City of Medford program to u se water quality trading to red uce its temperature impacts on the Rogue River is co sting $6 million, compared to $ 16 million and additional O & M c osts for chillers. The Roseburg Urban Sanitary Auth ority natural treatment system was installed at a cost of $9 million compare d to $100 million for a conventio nal treatment system that also had much higher operating costs. In the 10 years Clean Water Serv ices has operated its temperatu re water quality trading program, it has saved ra tepayers $100 million. Clean W ater Services is meeting its DEQ permit at a 95% cost savings compared to conven tional wastewater treatme nt technologies. Additional Details Available 7 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 7 A complete report reviewing the performance of Natural Treatmen t Systems in Oregon has been compiled by a task force of Oreg on DEQ and municipal treatment system experts. A copy of the report, dated July, 20 14) is available at http://www.oracwa.org/rstudiesreports.html . Oregon communities considering a n expansion or upgrade of their wastewater treatment plants should take the time to read the report, and work with their co nsulting engineer to tour nearby communities using Natural Treatme nt Systems, and consider how b est to incorporate these systems into the overall wastewat er treatment facility planning process. The report on Natural Treatment Systems was prepared jointly by Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Or egon Association of Clean Water Agencies For Additional Information For additional information, contact DEQ staff Dennis Water Agencies (phone: 503/ 2366722/email gillaspie@oracwa.org .

NATURAL TREATMENT SYSTEMS All wastewater treatme nt systems utilize natural processes. For example, gravity is used to remove particulates and bacterial decom position reduces organics. In c onventional treatment systems, these natural processes are suppo rted by a complex array of ene rgyintensive mechanical equipment. Natural treatment systems, by cont rast, utilize biological and physical/chemical processes to accomplish a wide range of treat ment objectives, with minimal d ependence on energy inputs and mechanical assistance. These sys tems can also go beyond simply providing treatment services; many provide an aesthetic benefi t, and some include opportuniti es for wildlife viewing, environmental education, and outdoor recreation. Natural wastewater treatment systems have been used for centuri es, but a serious resurgence in interest in the United States o ccurred after the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. At first, wastewater treatment managers focused on advanced mechanical tr eatment methods to meet the new, more stringent water quality standards, but the high energ y requirements and costs of these methods soon became apparent and the natural treatment systems were taken into consideration as more sustainable and costeffective alternatives.i While natural treatment systems can be used to treat a variety of media, including industrial wastewater and contaminated soils , this report focuses on the u se of these systems to treat domestic wastewater, either work ing in tandem with or taking th e place of a conventional municipal wastewater treatment system. DEFINITION OF NATURA L TREATMENT SYSTEMS Natural treatment systems are engineered systems that have a mi nimal dependence on mechanical elements to support the wastewater treatment process, instead u sing plants, soil, bacteria, and other natural processes to break down and treat pollutants in w astewater. Natural treatment systems use rather than dispose of water, minimize the use of chemicals, and require limited energy to operate. These systems clean contaminated water in a sustainable, low cost, low impact manner, and can be designed to have a long life. SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY OF NATURAL TREATMENT SYSTEM PROCESSES Natural treatment systems utilize a variety of natural processe s to achieve pollutant reduction goals. Most of these natural sys tems are intended to treat wast ewater that has already gone through primary or secondary tre atment, providing further treat ment and polishing. Depending on the type of natural treatment sy stem, some or all of the follow ing processes may be utilized in a given natural treatment system. 9 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 9 Scientific processes at play in the natural treatment system in clude: Bacterial decomposition (aerobic and anaerobic) of organic wast es Natural aeration th rough waterfalls Settling of particles Natural cooling, e specially at night Nutrient uptake by plants Metals reduction through sedimentation Adsorption of metals to soils, and Filtration through gravel or other media The chart below illust rates the scientific basis for wastewater treatment in natural systems. A more detailed description of natural t reatment system processes can be found in Appendix 3. TYPES OF NATURAL TREATMENT SYSTEMS REVIEWED IN THIS REPORT 10 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 10 Five major types of natural treatment systems are examined in t his report: Wetland treatment Phyto treatment, including both water recycling and tree farms Water quality trading Indirect discharge, and Wastewater pond systems. Each type of natural treatment s ystem is suitable for addressin g different pollutant reduction goals and requires different amounts o f investment in terms of land, money, and energy. Many times, a variety of natural treatment systems may be used in sequence to provide effective wastewater treatment and community amenit ies at an affordable price. The case studies reviewed in this report utilize all five of th ese natural treatment approaches. The systems examined include: City of Albany - treatment wetlands City of Bend - water recycling Clean Water Services - water quality trading City of Cottage Grov e - water recycling City of Harrisburg - poplar farm and wastewater ponds City of Junction City - water r ecycling and wastewater ponds City of Medford - water quality trading Metropolitan Wastewater Manageme nt Commission (MWMC) - poplar f arm and water recycling City of Myrtle Creek - water recycling City of Newberg - water recycling City of Prineville - water recycling and wastewater ponds Roseburg Urban Sanitary Authority (RUSA) - wetland treatment an d indirect discharge City of Salem - wetland treatment City of Silverton - wetland treatment City of Veneta - poplar farm, wa ter recycling, and wastewater p onds City of Woodburn - poplar farm Natural treatment systems are more effective for treating some types of pollutants; less for other types of pollutants. The table below summarizes the types of n atural treatment systems that are likely to be most effective in t reating specific classes of pol lutants. Remember that for some communities, linking a variety of natural treatment systems, or linking a mechanical treatment system to be followed by a natural treatment system, is an effe ctive treatment train combination. For the table below, subject areas marked with a check ( ) are good candidate s for reducing the listed pollutant to acceptable w ater quality standards. For th ose natural treatment systems that can eliminate the need to discharge treated wastewater effluent for instance by land applying all the treated wastewater effluent to a tree farm in stream wa ter quality standards are no longer a concern. 11 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 11 For toxic water quality limits, Oregon has the nation's most st ringent water quality standards for toxics related to human health. There are no known technologie s able to meet the very low levels of toxics set in the Orego n water quality standards.1 WATER QUALITY TREATMENT TARGETS Natural treatment systems are e ffective at treating a variety of water quality treatment targets. The table below summarizes syste ms by the types of water qualit y pollutants they can effectively target. Water Quality Treatment Target Wetland Treatment Phyto Treatment Recycled Water Phyto Treatment Tree Farms Indirect DischargeWater Quality Trading Wastewater Pond Systems Nutrient Restrictions Temperature Restrictions Toxic water quality limits Ammonia Chlorine DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS Each natural treatment system is unique and each system should be evaluated to de termine how it matches with the local situation. The table below summarizes s ome of the general design conditions for using natur al treatment systems.

For instance, The City of Medford program to use water quality trading to red uce its temperature impacts on the Rogue River is costing $6 million, compared to $ 16 million and additional O & M costs for chillers. The Roseburg Urban Sanitary Auth ority natural tr eatment system was installed at a cost of $9 million compared to $100 million for a conventional trea tment system that also had much higher operating costs. The City of Salem wetland treatm ent system treats for ammonia a nd temperature at an operating cost of $80 per day. In the 10 years Clean Water Services has operated its temperatu re water quality trading program, it has save d ratepayers $100 million. Clean Water Ser vices is meeting its DEQ permit at a 95% cost savings com pared to conventional wastewate r treatment technologies. WETLAND TREATMENT Wetland treatment involves utili zing existing wetlands or const ructing engineered wetlands to treat wastewater. Many processe s that occur naturally in wetlan ds, such as uptake of water by plants, microbial breakdown of organics, sedimentation and pass ive cooling, can help reduce common pollutants in wastewater i ncluding Total Suspended Solid s (TSS), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), metals, and temper ature. Wetlands used for wast ewater treatment typically have engineered structures to control flow direction, detention time , and water level, but otherwise rely solely on natural processes to t reat wastewater. Specific pollu tants may be targete d through careful engineering and management of a treatment wetlands system. There are two basic types of w etland treatment systems: Free Water Surface (F WS) wetlands, and Vegetated Submerged Bed (VSB) wetlands. Free water surface wetlands visua lly resemble natural wetlands because they contain aquatic plants that grow in the soil lay er on the bottom of the wetland and water flows through the stems and leaves of the plants. Vegeta ted submerged bed wetlands do n ot resemble natural wetlands because they have no visible wate r. Instead, they consist of a bed of media such as crushed rock, small stones, sand, or soil whic h has been planted with aquatic plants. Water flows beneath the 14 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 14 surface of the media and comes i n contact with the roots of the plants but is not visible at the surface. Treatment wetlands can also prov ide additional community benefi ts including the creation and preservation of wildlife habitat, environmental education, and recreation opportunities for the local community including h iking and bird watching. PHYTO TREATMENT Phyto treatment includes many types of natural treatment system s, including systems using rooted plants, floating aquatic plants, and algae. In these types of plantbased treatment systems, treated effluent passes through a vegeta ted medium, allo wing for furthe r polishing of the e ffluent. Nitrogen and phosphorus in the wastewater are utilized as nutrients by t he plants. The plants uptake the treated wastewater and absorb th e nutrients along with other po llutants such as metals.ii Further polishing occurs as the effluent filters through the soil mediu m in which the plants grow before flowing to groundwater or surface water.iii This report focuses on two key types of phyto treatment systems most often used in Oregon: Water recycling, and Tree farms. WATER RECYCLING Treated wastewater can be recycled and used as a substitute for potable water for many environmentallysound water uses. Using recycled water reduces the amount of water that must be discharged to a river and stream , making permit compliance easi er, may conserve potable water for uses such as drinking. Recycled treated wastewater can be used for: Irrigation on crops such as firew ood, Christmas trees, animal p asture, fodder, golf courses, parks, and playgrounds, Irrigation on orchards and vineyards if the water is applied di rectly to the soil, Industrial and commercial uses su ch as industrial cooling, rock crushing, street sweeping, commercial car washing, and dust control, and Impoundments such as a water supply for golf course water ponds , restricted recreational impoundments, and artificial groundwater recharge. Water recycling project exa mples in Oregon include: Golf course irrigation in Be nd, Prineville, and Newberg Park irrigation in Washington Co unty by Clean Water Services TREE FARMS In some situations, phyto treatm ent systems can be used to grow trees, such as poplars. Several tree farms in Oregon that are irrigate d with wastewater use hybrid p oplars to absorb nutrients, beneficially reuse biosolids, an d grow wood, while eliminating any discharge to rivers and streams in summer, lowflow conditions. 15 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 15 Treated wastewater is used to i rrigate tree farms, and often ti mes, biosolids are land applied as a fertilizer. In Oregon, tree farms must be harvested within 12 years to avoi d being regulated under Oregon's Forest Practices Act (see definition of ' operation ' at OAR 6296000100(46) available at http://www.oregon.gov/odf/private forests/docs/guidance/oardiv60 0.pdf . Communities could decide to grow higher value wood products, even cedar or redwoo d, but must ensure compliance with the Oregon Forest Practices Act and assorted harvest taxes . Water and nutrient use is relati vely low during the first estab lishment year and bu ilds over the first three years of growth as the tree stand matures. By the fourth growing season, the tree stand canopy is typically closed and wa ter and nutrient use stabilize at their peak rate until harvest. iv In Western Oregon poplar tree stands , the expected maximum nitroge n uptake rate of a mature stand is approximately 240 pound per acre per year.v Acreage needed for a plantation depends on site soil and draina ge conditions, , tree planting density and cover crop management, inten ded rotation age, setback requi rements from site boundaries and waterways, irrigation methods utilized, and volumes of treated wastewater water and biosolids to be applied. A number of hybrid poplar varieties are available f or use. The ideal poplar tree variety for a particular site depends on the local soil attributes, was tewater characteristics (including salinity and nutrient concentrat ion), tree stand management pla ns (e.g. short rotation dense plantings for biomass or pulp vs . longer rotation less dense pl antings for solid wood products), and common local pests and diseases.vi INDIRECT DISCHARGE Indirect discharge involves addi tional treatment of secondaryl evel treated wastewater through the soil matrix in the subsurface flow environment. This soil ma trix may be saturate d all the time or part of the time by this infiltration, and the soil and associa ted microbial and chemical/physical activity further treats the wast ewater. Indirect discharge pro cesses can also reduce the effect of wastewater discharge temperature s on receiving waters by delayi ng the arrival time of the flow and heat into surface waters to cooler less temperature sensiti ve periods and by intermixing with cooler groundwater to create a more diffuse discharge. Indire ct discharge mimics the natural processes of side channel and fl oodplain discharges in a river system. Indirect discharge allows for nat ural physical, biological, and chemical processes present in groundwater to further treat the wastewater before it reaches t he surface water.vii Discharge of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent by i ndirect discharge to surface water via groundwater water may be env ironmentally beneficial if plan ned, installed, and operated correctly, and if locat ed under the right geographic, hydrogeol ogic, and environmental conditions. The type of indirect discharge system should be matched to the specific conditions of the site. Systems that could be used for indirect discharge of treated mu nicipal wastewater include: Rapid and moderate rate infiltration systems Constructed wetlands designed for evaporation/transpiration and minimal seepage Constructed wetlands des igned for infiltration Surface spray irrigation applied at greater than agronomic rate s 16 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 16 Subsurface drip irrigation applie d at greater than agronomic ra tes Exfiltration galleries, drainfie lds, mounds, and bottomless san d filters Evaporation ponds with infiltration components Injection wells dischargin g above the water table Indirect discharge systems shoul d have each of the following ch aracteristics: The intent of the system design is to route wastewater through shallow unsatu rated soils and/or groundwater for additiona l polishing and diffusion befor e it discharges to surface water. This would include situati ons where wastewater is discha rged to hyporheic water. Site conditions (geology or hydro logy) and system design are su ch that (effectively) all the wastewater and affected groundwa ter will discharge to surface w ater after leaving the waste management area. As required by the DEQ Groundwat er Quality Protection rules (se e OAR 340040), groundwater outside the waste ma nagement area will not be adver sely affected by the system. Conditions in the waste manageme nt area and the quality of disc harge are such that long term contamination would be unlikely following termination of t he discharge. A local government or special di strict owns or otherwise contro ls the property containing the waste management area. Water supply wells do not exist and cannot be placed (or are re asonably unlikely to be placed) within the waste management area. WATER QUALITY TRADING Water quality trading is a flexible approach to achieving water quality goals in a cost effective manner, often with gre ater environmental benefit than concrete andsteel approaches. Credits are generated through the conservati on or restoration of natural ec osystems beyond levels required by state and federal regulations. A regulated entity then buys the se credits as a way to meet its regulatory obligations . Water quality trading can reduce compli ance costs while providing additional benefits to ov erall watershed health.viii Water quality trading can be used to offset a variety of pollut ant parameters, inclu ding temperature and nutrients. Permittees can obtain pollutant reduction credit s by taking action to create or restore wetlands, streamside riparian areas, floodplains, aquat ic habitat, or other streamrelated areas similar to that discharged by the permittee. For instance , this could involve sponsoring the planting of trees to increase riparian shading which in turn re duces stream temperatures. The permittee can also trade cre dits with other permittees or n onpermitted entities to offset its pollutant impacts. Some permitte es are better equipped than oth ers to treat their effluent to a high level. If they exceed the level of pollutant reduction required by their permit, they can sell the excess reduction as credits to ne arby permittees looking to off set their own pollutant loads. Non permitted entities such as farms and logging operations can als o implement pollutantreducing practices that extend beyond the current regulatory requirement s, and those can be sold as credits to permittees. ix Nutrient trading is often carried out in this manner. For examp le, the Long Islan d Sound National Estuary Program has developed a nitrogen credit trading program to reduce nitrogen discharges 17 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 17 from Connecticut point sources, s uch as wastewater treatment pl ants, to Long Island Sound. Nitrogen reductions help increase dissolved oxygen levels and i mprove the overall health of the water body. The Connecticut pro gram focuses on reducing nitrog en output from 84 municipal wastewater treatment discharges. Each municipality is charged w ith making a 70% reduction in their total nitrogen load. Munic ipalities that reduce nitrogen beyond the 70% reduction requirement can sell their credits to other municipalities that cannot meet reduction requirements through treatment technology alo ne. Nonpoint sources, including agricultural activities and forestry operations, can also gen erate credits by employing pol lutantreducing practices beyond that required by current environ mental regulations. These credi ts can then be sold to NPDES permittees. WASTEWATER POND SYSTEMS Wastewater ponds are large ponds where wastewater is held for a period of days or months. These ponds are designed to mimic a na tural pond environment, encoura ging the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that can redu ce BOD, TSS, and pathogens leve ls. Pond systems can be used alone or in combination with other wastewater treatment processes. There are two main types of wastewater pond systems: Facultative wastewater ponds are the most common type of pond system. These systems are usually used to treat raw municipal wastewater but may also be used for primary or secondary effluent tre atment. They contain an aerobic layer of water overlaying an anaerobic layer. Aerobic bacteri a provide odor control along wi th nutrient and BOD removal, while anaerobic bacteri a aid in sludge digestion, deni trification, and some BOD removal. The system relies on ox ygen production by photosynthet ic algae and/or re aeration at the surface to maintain the aerobic processes. Aerobic pond systems are shallower ponds that maximiz e aerobic processes. High light penetration and reaeration at t he surface allow aerobic bacter ia to biochemically stabilize the wastewater. Advantages of this system include short detenti on time with low land and energy requirements, but their operation is more complex and th e effluent can contain high levels of TSS if the algae are not removed prior to discharge.x EFFLUENT PERFORMANCE Natural treatment systems can be utilized to treat a wide varie ty of pollutants, including : Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Nutrients Temperature Toxics Ammonia Chlorine Metals, and Emerging contaminants, including solvent relatedcompounds such as benzene 18 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 18 Different types of natural treat ment systems are best suited to treat different pollutants. In considering the use of a natural treatment system, utility mana gers should consider the water quality needs of the local river and stream. Consider both wat er quality standards that are currently not being met, along wit h examining the available dat a to determine what regulations and restrictions might affect the ut ility system in the future. While there are many published s tudies and statistics about the performance of individual natural treatment systems, pollutant removal performance varies for eac h system based on factors such as wastewater influent flow, pollu tant load, characteristics of t he sediment and/or vegetation in place, local climatic conditions, and ot hers. In some cases, consult ation with other jurisdictions that are operating under similar conditi ons may be helpful in determinin g what type of natural treatment system may meet a community's needs. Performing pilot studies is an effective wa y to gather data that describes how a particular natural treatment system might be expected to perform under specific local conditions. These types of studies are especia lly important if the system is intended to treat an emerging contaminant or if the influent includes an unusual source, such as treated industrial wastewater. Based on both Oregon and nationa l natural treatment systems, th is type of pollution removal effectiveness can gene rally be predicted: WETLAND TREATMENT SYSTEMS A variety of factors w ill influence each treatment systems perf ormance. Wetland treatment systems demonstrate posttreatment water disc harges with a wide range of parameter concentrations, as rep orted in the most recent compre hensive international compilation Treatment Wetlands 2nd Edition (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009). These discharge chemistries are t he result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: i nfluent parameter concentrations and loadings; regional para meter background concentrations in simil ar natural wetlands; hydraulic loading rate; residence age; climate a nd seasonal fac tors such as temperature, precipitation, snow cover depth, and snow melt; internal erosio n (e.g. wave activity) and wildlife use (especially waterfowl). All of these factors are addressed in design to optimize outcomes, but some can also be managed during the treatment system life, whil e some remain fixed. These factors lead to variability in discharge concentrations from a wetland treatment system seasonally and annually, and the rang e of discharge concentrations summarized below for selected treatment wetland types. FREE WATER SURFACE WETLANDS For free water surface wetlands, the final effluent characteris tics are likely to be: BOD values in the range of 4.8 - 14.1 milligrams per liter (mg/ l) Total Suspended Solids in th e range of 2.829.7 mg/l Temperature reduction of 0.3 - 11.1 F Phosphorus reduction to 0.014 mg/l Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen in the range of 1.3511 mg/l Ammonia reduction to 0.156.9 mg/l 19 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 19 Nitrate in the range of 0.0548 mg/l Metals concentrations reductions f or aluminum, copper, iron, ma nganese and zinc VEGETATED SUBMERGED BED WETLANDS For vegetated submerged bed wetl ands, the final effluent charac teristics are likely to be: BOD values in the range of 2.2 - 55.4 mg/l Total Suspended Solids in the range of 435 mg/l Phosphorus reduction to 3.23.9 mg/l Metals concentrations reductions f or aluminum, copper, iron, ma nganese and zinc The most comprehensive resource on the subject of wetland efflu ent performance is Treatment Wetlands by Kadlec & Wallace. WETLAND TREATMENT OF PRIORITY PERSISTENT POLLUTANTS Due to the extended interaction the soil and a variety of natur al processes, natural treatment systems are effective at reducing emerging contaminants. Some o f these pollutants have associated Oregon water quality criteria, w hile others do not. The table b elow summarizes some wetland treatment system performance data on reduction in concentration s of a variety of complex organic pollutants: Chemical Constructed Wetlands Performance (% removal) Benzene 81 Biphenyl 96 Chlorobenzene 81 Dimethylphthalate 81 Ethylbenzene 69 1,2Dicholorethane 49 Tetrachloroethylene 75 1,1,1Trichloroethane 68 20 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 20 INDIRECT DISCHARGE For treatment plants employing a n indirect discharge, additiona l removal can be anticipated, including: Temperature reduction Removal of metals will be influenced by the types of soils in t he area, but the majority of the heavy metals are removed within the first six inches of soil th rough which the treated wastewater percolates xi For example, indirect discharge in Flushing Meadows, Arizona ob tained zinc reductions to 0.035 mg/l, copper to 0.016 mg/ l and cadmium to 0.072 mg/l WASTEWATER PONDS Wastewater treatment pond perform ance will vary, but generally, this type of performance can be anticipated: BOD reduction ranging from 50 - 95% reduction Phosphorus removal in the range of 30 - 90% Total Kjeldahl nitrogen reduction to 523.6 mg/l Ammonia in 1.322.9 mg/l Nitrate reduction to 0.92.96 mg/l Phyto treatment systems including recycled water and tree farms , along with nondischarging wastewater ponds. beneficially reu se the treated water, elimina ting the need to meet strict in stream water quality standards. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH OR TESTING NEEDS While there has been extensive research done on natural treatme nt systems, there are still areas that need to be investigated further. Chief among these issues is the challenge of emerging contaminants. As water quality standards become more stringent , additional research into the treatment effectiveness of natur al systems on emerging contamin ants would be useful information. Additional research and 'best pra ctices' for maintaining and op erating natural treatment systems is an additional area of potential research. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BACKGROUND This section summarizes the DEQ regulations that apply to natur al treatment systems. DEQ Regional permit writers can answ er questions about specific, de tailed permitting requirements. In considering a natural treatme nt system, some additional regu latory requirements should also be considered including: 21 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 21 FEDERAL US Federal Aviation Administration will be interested in wetlan d and pond systems if there are nearby airports, or the project is near a flight path or important air space.

DEQ and the Oregon Health Author ity will want precautions to pr otect any underground source of water used for dri nking water withdrawals. LOCAL All actions must be in accordance with the adopted comprehensiv e plan and the Statewide Land Use Planning Goals and Guidelines. REVIEW OF DEQ PERMI TTING REQUIREMENTS Diagram the DEQ permitting requirements to ensure you have a co mplete understanding of the various elements. Working with your consulting team, develop a schedule for completing and filing the various necessary plans and a pplications. Review the diagr am and time frame with DEQ staff to get their review, input, and agreement. Remember that all DEQ permit applications must be accompanied b y a Land Use Compatibility Statement - a form signed by the local land use agency that ind icates your project is consistent with the locally adopted land use plan and zoning requirements. Loc al land use approval is necessary prior to applying to DEQ for permits. Many permit actions require publi c notice. Permitting decision s can be extended if, at the end of the public notice period, an org anization requests a public hea ring. The public hearing will likely require an additional time for public notice. The DEQ permitting requirements for these natural treatment sys tems are summarized below: 1. Wetland Treatment 2. Phyto Treatment, including wat er recycling and tree farms 3. Indirect Discharge 4. Water Quality Trading 5. Wastewater Pond Systems 22 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 22 WETLAND TREATMENT A constructed wetland built outs ide of a natural wetland, water way, or flood plain, is considered part of the wastewater treatment system and not subject to EPA, Army Corps of Eng ineers, or the Oregon Department of State Lands wetlands regulations. An important regulatory permitti ng consideration for wetland tr eatment systems is the point of compliance for achieving the applicable water quality standards . Determining the pointof compliance with a standard discharge pipe and its associated mi xing zone can be more straightforward; communities des igning a wetland treatment syst em will want to work with their consulting team and Oregon DEQ pe rmit writer to determine the e xact pointofcompliance. The pointofcompliance may vary by pollutant parameters. Some Oregon wetland treatment systems have restored and expande d natural wetlands using the Department of State Lands invent ory and permitting system, and have generated wetland mitigation credits to use in future projects. Most wetland systems do not have a liner and are designed to us e the soils beneath the wetland for additional treatment, while sti ll protecting groundwater. Permit holders (NPDES and WPCF) would apply to DEQ to incorpora te the wetland treatment system as an additional treatment train described in the water quality permit. DEQ will incorporate specific monitoring and reportin g requirements for the wetland treatment system. Groundwater monitoring wells may be required as part of a permi tted treatment wetland project. If a DEQ hydrogeologist concluded that there was a likely adver se groundwater quality impact, monitoring may be required (see OAR 3400400030(2). Communities will want to check th e Water Resource s Department w ell logs to ensure no wells are close to the wetland treatment system and might be impacted by it. REGULATORY TIPS FOR WETL AND TREATMENT SYSTEMS Gather adequate background hydra ulic, geomorphic, and soil info rmation to fully characterize the area where the wetland treatment system is pla nned Map area wells Consider the pointofcompliance Work with DEQ to bring the wetland treatment system into the ap propriate NPDES or WPCF permit PHYTO TREATMENT Phytoremediation is a broad term that has been used since 1991 to describe the use of plants to reduce the volume, mobility, or toxicity of contaminants in soi l, groundwater, or other contaminated media, including wastewater (USEPA, 2000). The fo cus on this paper is on phyto treatment systems that feature treated water recycling and tree farms. 23 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 23 WATER RECYCLING Treated wastewater can be recycled as a substitute for potable water for many environmentally sound water uses. Using recycle d water reduces the amount of w ater that must be discharged to a river and stream, making permit compliance easier, and may cons erve potable water for uses such as drinking. Recycled treated wastewater has many uses, such as: Irrigation of crops, Christmas tr ees, animal pasture, fodder, g olf courses, parks and playgrounds, and orchards and vin eyards if the water is applied directly to the soil Industrial and commercial uses su ch as industrial cooling, rock crushing, street sweeping, commercial car washing, and dust control Impoundments recharge such as wa ter supply for golf course wate r ponds, restricted recreational impoundments, and ar tificial groundwater recharge Oregon DEQ regulates the use of recycled water from a wastewate r treatment plant (see OAR Chapter 340, Division 55). In summary, these regulations: Set quality standards for four classes of recycled water: Cla ss A, Class B, Class C, and Class D. Specific recycled water uses a re allowed depending on the c lass of water produced. A recycled water management pla n will be required. The plan wi ll detail the water treatment programs, re cycled water use, sys tems to meet the DEQ requirements, and monitoring and reporting requirements. Recycled water with high public a ccess requires greater levels of treatment. Recycled water can only be use d for beneficial purposes. Groundwater must be protected. Water recycling project exa mples in Oregon include: Golf course irrigation in Be nd, Prineville, and Newberg Park irrigation in Washington Co unty by Clean Water Services Additional information on DEQ's recycled water regulations and a 'fillable' form for completing a model recycled water manage ment plan is available at http://www.deq.state.or.us/wq/reuse/recycled.htm REGULATORY TIPS FOR WATE R RECYCLING PROJECTS Partner with large volume agricu ltural, industrial, and commerc ial water users near the treatment plant; learn how treated wastewater can be substitut ed for potable water uses Match the recycled water use with the necessary treatment stand ards in the DEQ regulations TREE FARMS Trees, such as fastgrowing hybri d poplars, can provide both a nutrient sink for wastewater and a means to produce a harvested wood product. The wastewater tr ee farms in Oregon use hybrid poplars to absorb nutrients, ben eficially reuse biosolids, and grow wood. 24 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 24 Tree farms irrigated with recycle d water are regu lated under th e same rules described above for water recycling projects (see OA R Chapter 340, Division 55). Like water recycling projects, use of tree farms for applying t reated wastewater can avoid stringent water quality limits for surface water discharge often imposed in the summer, low flow season. In Oregon, tree farms must be reviewed and approved by Oregon D EQ. If biosolids are to be incorporated in the plantation, the appropriate Biosolids Manag ement Plan must be revised. Strict practices will be required to ens ure that treated wastewater is not applied at greater than agronomic rates and that there will be no runoff to nearby stre ams and rivers. In Oregon, tree farms that are located on Exclusive Farm Use zo ned land must be harvested within 12 years to avoid being regulated under Oregon's Forest Practic es Act (see definition of ' operation ' OAR 6296000100(46) available at http://www.oregon.gov/odf/private forests/docs/guidance/oardiv60 0.pdf . Communities could decide to grower higher value w ood products, even cedar or redw ood, but must ensure compliance with the Oregon Forest Practices Act, and assorted harvest taxe s. REGULATORY TIPS FOR TREE FARMS Get professional foresters involv ed in planning and operating t he tree farm Consider the possible end uses of the harvested wood products a nd select trees and a tree farm management plan that match the targeted use Match the amount of treated wast ewater to be applied to the agr onomic needs of the tree crop and soils Ensure there is no oppo rtunity for runoff f rom the irrigation s ystem INDIRECT DISCHARGE Disposal of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent by in direct discharge to surface water via groundwater water may be env ironmentally beneficial if plan ned, installed, and operated correctly, and if locat ed under the right geographic, hydrogeol ogic, and environmental conditions. The type of indirect discharge system should be matched to the specific conditions of the site. The following are potential benefits of using indirect discharg e: Wastewater temperature may be reduced in the groundwater water to meet instream temperature standards and therefore stream flow volumes may be maintained; Some \"polishing\" of the wastewat er, such as reducing total meta ls or removing residual chlorine through natural geochemical processes, may occur withi n the soils and aquifer containing groundwater water; and If a land application component i s used in the design, nutrient s in wastewater may be beneficially reused by plants an d therefore reducing the nutrie nt load for a mandated Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). There are many methods for land discharge of treated municipal wastewater that could be used for indirect discharge to surfac e water. These include: Rapid and moderate rate infiltration systems 25 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 25 Constructed wetlands designed for evaporation/transpiration and minimal seepage Constructed wetlands des igned for infiltration Surface spray irrigation applied at greater than agronomic rate s Subsurface drip irrigation applie d at greater than agronomic ra tes Exfiltration galleries, drainfie lds, mounds, and bottomless san d filters Evaporation ponds with infiltration components Injection wells dischargin g above the water table An indirect discharge system sho uld have each of the following characteristics: The intent of the system design is to route wastewater through shallow unsatu rated soils and/or groundwater for additiona l polishing and diffusion befor e it discharges to surface water. Site conditions (geology or hydro logy) and system design are su ch that (effectively) all the wastewater and affected groundwa ter will discharge to surface w ater after leaving the waste management area. As required by the Groundwater Q uality Protection rules in OAR 340040, groundwater outside the waste management are a will not be adve rsely affecte d by the system. Conditions in the waste manageme nt area and the quality of disc harge are such that long term contamination would be unlikely following termination of t he discharge. A local government or special di strict owns or otherwise contro ls the property containing the waste management area. Water supply wells do not exist and cannot be placed within the waste management area. Groundwater quality in Oregon is protected from pollution in Or egon Revised Statutes (ORS) 468B.025 and ORS 468B.050, and r eflected in the Oregon Groundwa ter Quality Protection rules, OAR 340040. With the use of an indirect tre ated effluent discharge system, treated wastewater may reach the waters of the state, so NPDES permits are needed for this type of natural treatment system. Permittees planning and designing indirect discharge systems wi ll want to ensure that salmon spawning or rearing areas will not be affected, and the existin g cold water is protected (see OAR 340410028(11). DEQ's policy for indirect discha rge of treated effluent entitle d Disposal of Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluent by Indirect Discharge to Surface Water via Groundwater or Hyporheic Water (2/07) is available at http://www.deq.state.or.us/wq/pubs/imds/indirectdischarge.pdf . REGULATORY TIPS FOR INDIRECT DISCHARGE Adequately map the soils and und erlying geology of the possible indirect discharge in order to have adequate information to predict the pathway of the trea ted wastewater Be able to demonstrate that groundwater outside the project bou ndary will not be impacted Consider the pointofcompliance 26 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 26 Ensure the indirect discharge will not adversely impact salmon and steelhead populations or other aquatic species. Get the local Oregon Department of F ish and Wildlife fish biologist involved in the program. WATER QUALITY TRADING Water quality trading is an inno vative program that allows faci lities that discharge wastewater to a stream or river to meet re gulatory obligations by: Purchasing equivalent or larger p ollution reductions from anoth er source; or Taking action to protect or rest ore riparian areas, wetlands, f loodplains, and aquatic habitat to reduce the impact of pollutants. Trading is based on the fact tha t dischargers in a watershed ca n face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Trading prog rams allow facilities facing hi gher pollution cont rol costs to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equi valent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source a t lower cost, th us achieving th e same water quality improvement at lower overall cost. Trading may also allow Oregon water qual ity permit holders to achieve water quality improvements more quickl y and more cost effectively tha n would otherwise be possible. For many communities, using wate r quality tradin g will meet pol lution reduction targets at a lower cost than traditional steel and concrete solutions, while provi ding greater environmental benefit. Examples of successful water quali ty trading projects used in O regon are planting trees and restoring riparian areas rather than constructing chillers for wastewater effluent that exceeds temperature limits. NATIONAL TRADING MODELS EPA has developed a wa ter quality trading tool kit for permit w riters, available at http://water.epa.gov/type/wate rsheds/trading/WQTToolkit.cfm . A variety of trading programs are outlined, including trading p rograms among water quality pe rmit holders, and trading programs between water quality p ermit holders and nonpoint sou rces such as agriculture or forestry. The tool kit provides specific fact sheets describing a number of successful trading programs nationally including: Lower Boise River (Idaho) Long Island Sound (Connecticut) Neuse River (North Carolina) Clean Water Services (Oregon) Rahr Malting (Minnesota) The tool kit is based on EPA's 2003 national water quality trad ing policy - see also available at http://water.epa.gov/type/wate rsheds/trading/WQTToolkit.cfm . OREGON TRADING MODELS 27 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 27 Since 2001, Oregon has had a state law supporting the use of wa ter quality trading (see ORS 468B.555 - available at http://www.oregonlaw s.org/ors/468B.555 ). Oregon DEQ uses this state law to implement water quality trading in Oregon. There are no water quality trading rules, at this time. Oregon DEQ has a policy in place to guide water quality trading programs, Water Quality Trading in NPDES Permits \u00ad Internal Management Directive (12/09 updated 8/12) available at http://www.deq.state.or.us/wq/pubs/imds/wqtrading.pdf . Oregon DEQ typically requires a trading ratio of 2 credits trad ed for each 1 credit needed to compensate for the time it takes to implement natural systems. DEQ can, however, consider a lower trading ratio for certain situat ions. For instance, work on a s maller stream may not generate as many credits as work on a larger stream. However, the smaller s tream may be more ecologically important than the larger stream. A variety of water quality trading program resources are availa ble on the DEQ web site at http://www.deq.state.or.us/ wq/trading/trading.htm#Pro In Oregon, two municipal water quality NPDES permits have incor porated water quality trading to date: Clean Water Services - Watershed Permit Medford Regional Water Reclamation Facility There are two models for undertaking water quality trading: a utilitymanaged trading program such as the program run by Clean Water Services and a third par ty contracted program as chosen by the City of Medford and its contractor, The Freshwater Trust . The Willamette Partnership has dev eloped water quality trading protocols and practices, including its Counting on the Environment accounting system. More inform ation is available at http://willamettepartnership.org/ REGULATORY TIPS FOR WATER QUALITY TRADING PROGRAMS Carefully review the DEQ guidance on trading programs and the d etails included in the City of Medford Regional Wa ter Reclamation Facility permit and tradi ng program evaluation for the City of Medford Learn from the two water quality trading programs currently in place in Oregon Discuss trading program options w ith DEQ staff early in the dev elopment of the program. WASTEWATER POND SYSTEMS There are generally three types of wastewater pond systems used in Oregon: Ponds that discharge to public w aters under a National Pollutan t Discharge Elimination System permit, Ponds that do not discharge to pu blic waters, but irrigate trea ted recycled wa ter under a Water Pollution Control Facility permit, or 28 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 28 Ponds that neither discharge to public waters nor irrigate recy cled water. These ponds rely exclusively on evaporation for wastewater disposal and are also permitted under a WPCF permit. DISCHARGING PONDS These facilities must demonstrat e that the effluent meets all a pplicable water quality standards at the edge of the mixing zone during times of discharge - often i n the winter during high flows. The Oregon water quality standards a re found in OAR 340, Division 4 1 - see http://www.deq.state.or.us/wq/standards/standards.htm NONDISCHARGING PONDS WI TH RECYCLED WATER USE Nondischarging ponds are regula ted by the State Water Pollutio n Control Facility (WPCF) permits. No discharge is allowed and the ponds must be pr operly engineer ed and managed to ensure no discharge is needed, even in time s of high precip itation. Man y nondischarging ponds beneficially reuse treated effluent as recycle d water. DEQ's recycled water regulations (OAR 340, Division 55) set specific water quality stand ards for different types of rec ycled water uses. Recycled water with high public access requires great er levels of treatment. A Re cycled Water Use Plan must be developed, including mon itoring and reporting. NONDISCHARGING EVAPORATION PONDS These ponds are also regulated by the State Water Pollution Con trol Facility (WPCF) permits. No discharge is allowed an d the ponds must be properly engineered and managed to ensure no discharge is needed, even in time s of high precipitation. These ponds are almost exclusively for smaller systems (schools, rest st ops, small RV parks, etc) and in the drier parts of the Oregon, such as Eastern Oregon and the Sout hwestern interior valleys. REGULATORY TIPS FOR WASTEWATER PONDS Design a series of natural treat ment systems possibly including a wastewater pond and recycled water so that the treated water can be used, not disch arged. Nondischarging systems qualify for an Oregon Wa ter Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) permit a permit with lower fees, reduced requirem ents, and less le gal risk. IMPORTANT DESIGN CONSIDE RATIONS AND CHALLENGES Natural treatment syst ems are complex tools that require signif icant preparation and planning. This section outlines the most important considerations to keep in mind when designing a natural treatment system. These tips can help system planners avoid une xpected problems and be prepared for the challenges that come with operating a natural treatment system. GENERAL When designing a natural treatme nt system, it is important to u nderstand the regulatory targets specific to the community in which the system is to be built. T he planners must consider future 29 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 29 pollutant concerns as well as cu rrent ones, collaborating with the Department of Environmental Quality to gain guidance and ins ight. Thinking in the context o f the overall facility plan is also important: population growth and other changes can affect hydra ulic loading rates and wastewater constituents in the future. Life cycle costs such as energy, ch emicals, and operation and maintenance costs must be consid ered, as well as the appropriat e level of wastewater pretreatment prior to entering the na tural treatment system. The climate and geography of the local area can affect the natu ral treatment sy stem design and performance considerably. Topogr aphy, rainfall, soils, and aver age seasonal temperatures should all be considered when determinin g site suitability. Land avail ability is another important factor, since natural treatment systems are usually located outside of wastewater treatment plant grounds. Existing local economic activiti es such as hay production, fore stry, or farming should also be analyzed for their potential to be incorporated into the natura l treatment system plan. This provides a depository for the tr eated wastewater and a resource for the established economic entities. Natural treatment syst ems are not built in a vacuum. It is impo rtant to understand the values of the community under consideration and to look for ways to cater to the public's values such as bird watching and outdoor recreation. Public access, outreach, and e ducation will help the natural treatment system gain support whi le communicating the purpose, benefits, and potential challenges of the natural treatment system and help manage the expectations of decision makers and the public. When utilizing a natural treatment system, trea tment system managers and the community must be flexible and expect surprises. These are natu ral systems that co mbine a variety of interconnected factors to tre at wastewater, and not every ch allenge can be predicted and planned for. While there are published studies and many anecdotal statistics about the performance of individual natural treatment systems, pollutant removal perform ance varies for each system based on many factors including influen t flow and pollutant load, cha racteristics of the sediment and/or vegetation in place, lo cal climatic conditions, and others. In some cases, consultation with other jurisdictions that are operating under similar conditions may b e helpful in determining what type of natural treatment system may meet a community's needs. Perf orming pilot studies is a more effective way to gather data tha t describes how a particular na tural treatment system might be expected to perform under specif ic local conditions. These typ es of studies are especially important if the system is intended to treat an emerging contaminant or i f the influent includes an unusual source such as treated i ndustrial wastewater. WETLAND TREATMENT Before constructing a wetland tre atment system, a comprehensive analysis of soil types and groundwater hydrology of the sel ected area must be performed. T his includes mappi ng all drinking water wells in the immediate area , since leakage from the wetla nd system could have impacts on these wells. Background and ongoi ng groundwater monitoring shou ld be an integral part of the system management plan, and flood plain impacts should also be c onsidered. The design of the wetland treatm ent system starts with determin ing what level of pretreatment is needed for the system to operate successfully. A comprehensive evaluation of influent water quality 30 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 30 and chemistry is necessary. Plan ners must also determine whethe r a lined or unlined system is better for their community. What level of seepage to groundwate r is acceptable? W hat should be done if the liner is damaged? Other important design considerations include: Plant selection Flow control and measurement Target ratio of subsurface to surface flow System detention time, and Water depth Coordinate carefully with your DEQ permit writer about the exac t compliance point s and associated monitoring. In some cases, DEQ m ay work with you to establish a n additional compliance point for the effluent from the treatment wetlands. The design should al low for the inclusion of the necessary monitoring equipment at the permitted compliance poin t(s). If the wetland will be hydraulically connected to the tr eatment facility, a comprehens ive model should be done. As with traditional wastewater t reatment technologies, monitori ng of the processes that are occurring within the treatment we tlands is critical to its succ essful operation. Thought should be given to how and where monitoring should occur within the indiv idual treatment wetland cells. It is common to provide monitoring e quipment for data collection a t the inflow and outflow points of each cell, for instance. Wetland treatment syst ems are often open to the public, so it i s important to consider how to handle and accommodate public use of the area. Important factor s include signage, trail maintenance, restroom facilities, seating, tours, and security. Outreach materials help educate visitors about how the natural treatment system works. It is al so important to consider unforeseen consequences of public use such as duck feeding and litter. Oth er challenges can include destructive wildlife such as muskrat and nut ria, invasive species, and vect or control of mosquitoes. Published studies can provide information on design strategies to minimiz e these negative impacts. For example, organic loading, nutrie nts, and emergent vegetation ca n have a significant effect on mosquito production and therefore should be taken into consider ation when designing a wetland system. xii PHYTO TREATMENT WATER RECYCLING Land application of treated wastewater involves a variety of co nsiderations. Before initializing a water reuse system, system plann ers must determine the most sui table type of irrigation system (drip, spray, etc.) for the part icular area. Water balance, sea sonality, and salinity limits (especially in drier climates) must also be considered. A recycled water pl an is essential to ensure proper record keeping. Since the type of recycled water use determines the level of wastewater pretreatment required, it is imp ortant to identify how the trea ted effluent will be used before commencing irrigation. Challenges for water reuse syste ms can include aerosol or spray drift and cooperation with partners that are not affiliated with the wastewater treatment facility, such as go lf course managers 31 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 31 and farmers. Contracting with suc h entities requires training a nd poses risks such as overirrigation and lack of monitoring. TREE FARMS Communities considering a tree f arm system should be familiar w ith agricultural and forestry regulations that could apply to their tree farm, especially the Oregon Forestry Practices Act, which can have tax implications for tre e farm operations. It is also important to ensure that the tree farm is congruent with local land use planning regulations. While there is potential to gene rate and sell saw logs from a t ree farm harvest, the market for wood is not robust or predictable, so plant managers should be prepa red to not make a profit on their tree crop. Hiring forestry experti se to help analyze the market and gear forestry practices to market potential can be very beneficial. The selection of the most suitab le tree species for a particula r system is essential. Pest and weed management plans need to be devel oped, along with a plan for so il monitoring. Labor needed to run the operation should be consider ed, as trees require maintenanc e and oversight. The farm should be laid out to allow for access fo r forestry equipment for main tenance and harvest. INDIRECT DISCHARGE A minimum of secondarylevel trea tment is required for indirect discharge systems. If improperly designed, indirect discharge can have negative impacts on drink ing water supplies and fish populations. Therefore, it is imp ortant to consider fish use in a proposed indirect discharge area and map cold water refugia for sensitive fish populations. Work ing with the local Oregon Fish & Wildlife biologist is important to avoid negative impacts on fi sh and other wildlife. Groundwater flow and characteriz ation, including ongoing monito ring and consideration of seasonal variations in the ground water table, can help prevent unexpected complications. Planners must coordinate closely with DEQ to map the waste management ar ea, which must be owned and controlled by the wastewater trea tment authority. Soil percolat ion modeling and testing are essential to determine appropriat e flow rates and prevent plugg ing issues. DEQ's groundwater protection regulations are inclu ded in OAR 340, Division 40. WATER QUALITY TRADING Using water quality trading to m eet strict temperature requirem ents is cheaper and more environmentally sound than other compliance options, such as in stalling chillers. Utilities interested in water qu ality trading should look for l ocal partnerships to build upon existing programs for agricultural practi ces pollution control, such as the incentives inclu ded in the national Farm Bill. The potential for water quality trading within the basin must b e assessed. Utilities will want to consider if they have the capacity to manage a water quality tr ading program or want to use a contract for generating credits, such as the City of Medford ag reement with The Freshwater Trust. 32 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 32 WASTEWATER POND SYSTEMS Wastewater pond systems need adequ ate available land. Some sys tem can be designed for irrigation in the summer growing season, and discharge during t he winter when stream flows are greater and there is increased dilution. Attempt to design a system where the water can be stored and re cycled and not discharged. Non discharging systems can qualify for a State Water Pollution Con trol Facility permit. The WPCF permit has lower fees, fewer regulatory requirements, and less enforcement risk. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER The advantage of using natural t reatment systems is that they a re very flexible. Many systems, such as the system utilized by the Roseburg Urban Sanitary Authority (RUSA) , employ several natural treatment approaches that work in tandem to achieve treatment g oals and maximize the utility of the overall system. Therefore, municipalities and districts int erested in natural treatment systems should consider using a number of components to meet their wast ewater treatment needs. For instance, can a wetland treatment system be installed that trea ts some of the flow, while a portion of the flow is applied to a tree farm? Or, can a nearby field used to grow hay during the summer months be partnered wi th a nutrient trading partnership with a local soil and water conservation district? Since different treatment approaches can be used to m eet different performance standards, a combination of syst ems can provide a more complete treatment solution. LESSONS LEARNED Through the experience of design ing, operating, and maintaining the natural treatment systems detailed above, the system opera tors have gained valuable insig ht and experience. The following is a summary of the lessons they le arned throughout this process. GENERAL Know your community's values. Ar e nature and natural spaces a v alue? Is energy conservation a value? Hire knowledgeable experts for a ssisting with the planning, des ign, and construction of these systems Tour similar facilities and ask questions when deciding whether a natural treatment system is right for your municipality Involve the operations tea m in planning and design Involve the appropriate regulatory authorities early in the pro cess Carefully consider how you will conduct monitoring to know the system is performing as predicted Do not overpromise on p erformance of the system Educate public and elected offi cials as early as possible Be up front and foster co mmunity relationships Make sure neighbors understand the benefits and potential chall enges of having a natural system nearby 33 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 33 Invest effort in using as little energy as possible or even pro duce energy if possible Every year is different - change one operation at a time and gi ve the system time to react WETLAND TREATMENT Local topography is important. W etlands need ample flat land. Identify jurisdictional wetlands and floodplains If you want to open the facility to the public, plan for consid erations such as restrooms and litter Establish a plan and budget for vegetation and wildlife control at the outset Be aware of specific criteria fo r preserving the natural enviro nment and the hydrological cycle Time of planting is important Be prepared for unexpected challenges such as weeds and birds t hat eat seeds/seedlings How to control and monitor flow b etween wetland cells and monit oring performance within each cell is important WATER RECYCLING Talk to local agricultural users . How do producers in your are a feel about recycled water? Match the recycled water use with the level of treatment Put contingency plans in p lace for handling spills Communicate with nearby neighbor s and institute a process for r esponding to any concerns or complaints TREE FARMS Know you are in it for the long haul - cannot just plant trees and forget about them Maintenance will vary depending o n the type(s) of tree selected and the end wood product goals Additional soil supplements o r pest control may be needed Consider responses to wind damage and seasonality Understand that this is first an d foremost a treatment system, not a monetary investment Monetary gains can vary due to system operation costs and wood products market fluctuations WATER QUALITY TRADING Conduct a survey to learn what w ater quality trading opportunit ies are available Analyze the impact of the existing or increased wastewater disc harge against chronic or lethal conditions, especially if fish are present in the receiv ing stream Be transparent about the types of credits being generated and d ocument progress towards meeting environmental goals Consider how you will monitor an d report on the effectiveness o f the trading system 34 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 34 WASTEWATER PONDS Involve the public in siting decisions Carefully calculate the water storage needs of the system, incl uding winter rainfall SYSTEM INVENTORY There are a variety of natural treatment systems in use in Oreg on. The summary below highlights some of the Oregon systems. Co mmunities interested in natural treatment systems can contact these communities and learn abou t their experien ces, along with touring the facilities. CITY OF ALBANY The City of Albany's 9.6 MGD ave rage dry weather flow water rec lamation facility operates under an NPDES permit. In 2010, the Ci ty installed Talk ing Water Gard ens, a system of 38.3 acres of treatment wetlands that operates yearround. The initial design was for an average dry weather flow of 11.6 MGD. This system was designed to meet the temperat ure reduction requirements of the Willamette Total Maximum Dail y Load, developed by DEQ and a pproved by EPA. xiii Albany's treatment wetlands are also some what unique in that a local ind ustrial facility also discharges its treated wastewater directly to t he wetlands. Design and constr uction costs were $10.7 million with an additional $5.6 million for l and acquisition. Operations and management costs average about $300,000 per year. The City of Albany is currently gathering additional informatio n on the effective ness of the system in meeting its targeted pollution reduction goals. This system provides additional benefits to the community including walking trails, bird watching, wildlife hab itat, and environmental education. CITY OF BEND The City of Bend Water Reclamation Facility was installed in 19 81. Located near the Deschutes River, the City of Bend benefici ally reuses all its treated was tewater. No wastewater is discharged to the River. The 6 MGD wastewater treatment facility uses both secondary treatment and nutrient treatment processes, along with anaerobic digesters, including a substantial Cla ss A water reuse program. The water reuse program is used from April to October to treat secondary effluent under a WPCF permit. The system meets its pollutant reduction goals of 20 mg/l of BOD and 20 mg/l Total Suspended Solids with a 10. 0 mg/l total nitrogen content in the effluent. The Bend Water Reclamation Facili ty is currently being expanded to meet the population needs into 2030. The City of Bend beneficially reuses all its treated effluent o n a 1600acre area that includes grounds around the treatment pla nt and at nearby golf courses. Using treated effluent as a substitute for potable water for irrigation conserves water and reduces chemical fertilizer use. A significant portion of the treated effluent is used to irrigate landscaping and greens at the Pronghorn Resort. The Pronghorn Resort inclu des two 18hole golf courses - the Jack Nicklaus Signature Course and the Tom Fazio Course. 35 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 35 It cost $4 million to design and construct the natural treatmen t system and ongoing operation and maintenance costs average $25,000$50,000 per year. Energy requ irements to treat the wastewater to applicable standards averages 500,000 kilowatt hours per yea r. Additional system amenities include bird watching. CLEAN WATER SERVICES Clean Water Services (District) is a special service district t hat serves more than 536,000 customers mostly in the urban portion of Washington County. The District owns and operates four wastewater treatment plants in the Tualatin River basin. The D istrict, along with its 12 member cities and Washington County, also implements the Municipal Sep arate Storm Sewe r System (MS4) program in urban Washington Coun ty. The wastewater treatment p lants and MS4 are permitted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) under a si ngle watershedbased National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The 2001 Temperature Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Tu alatin River included strict thermal load allocations for the District's Rock Creek and Durh am Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facilities (AWTFs). T he thermal load allocations wer e later incorporated into the District's watershedbased NPDES permit. The District evaluate d technological and source control options to meet the thermal load limits. Ultimately, the Distr ict concluded that the technology based approach, which would require mechanical cooling, was res ource intensive and cost prohibitive, and would do little to improve watershed health. The District adopted a strategy to offset the thermal load from the two AWTFs with riparian planti ng and flow augmentation. The District concluded that this appr oach was not only costeffecti ve, but would provide an opportunity to improve overall watershed health. The District's watershedbased NPDES permit included provisions to develop and implement a Temperature Management Plan (TMP) which specified the District' s approach to offsetting the thermal load from the Rock Creek and Durham AWTFs. The TMP included pr ograms that the District would implement to offset the thermal load from the AWTFs. Since 200 4, the District has implemented a trading program to offset the thermal load from the Rock Creek and Durham AWTFs. The thermal load trading program consists of augm enting stream flow in the Tuala tin River with its stored water releases and riparian planting i n the Tualatin River watershed. The District augmented stream flow in the Tualatin River using its stored water in Hagg Lake (Scoggins Reservoir) and Barney Reservoir. From 200413, the D istrict released an average of 35.2 cubic feet per second (cfs) of it s stored water during the crit ical months of July and August to augment flows in the Tualatin River. Thermal credits for flow augmenta tion are based on the temperature benefits of the augmentation water at the Rock Creek and Durham AWTFs. A riparian planting program was implemented in the urban and ru ral areas of the Tualatin River basin. In urban areas, the Dist rict implemented the riparian p lanting program. The projects in the urban areas included riparian pla nting and, on a site specific basis, stream enhanc ement activities such as stream bank stabilization, channel reconfiguration, lar ge wood placement, floodplain reconnection, and offchannel ha bitat. From 200413, a total o f 48 projects were implemented in urban areas of the watershed, which resulted in over 18 stream miles being planted. In rural areas of the watershed, the District contracted with the Tualatin Soi l and Water Conservation District to 36 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 36 provide incentives for enrolling landowners in an enhanced vers ion of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reser ve Enhancement Program (CREP) a nd Vegetated Buffer Areas for Conservation and Commerce (VEGBA CC) programs. From 200413, a t otal of 45 projects were implemented in rural areas of the watershed, which resulted in 24.9 stream miles being planted. In all, the urban and rural riparia n planting programs resulted in 43 miles of planting in the Tualatin River watershed. A 2:1 trading ratio is used to calculate the thermal credits fro m the riparian planting program. CITY OF COTTAGE GROVE The Cottage Grove facility conduc ts land application of its tre ated secondary effluent. Cottage Grove operates a 1.8 MGD dry weather/3 .5 MGD wet weather plant under an NPDES permit. Installed in 2007, the facility irrigates a 75 acre golf course and driving range, along with ho spital grounds, in the summer. The system was designed to help meet a 75% polluta nt reduction goal . Test results show that the system i s meeting the goal. CITY OF HARRISBURG The City of Harrisburg's 0.49 MGD wastewater treatment system i ncludes a 58acre poplar farm that is irrigated during the months of May to October with trea ted recycled water. The City grows four varieties of poplars that were planted in 2005. As of Apri l 2013, the poplar trees were eight years old, and are intended to be harvested on a 12year rotati on, consistent with the Oregon Forest Practices Act. The trees are managed by the City of Harr isburg Public Works Department. Harrisburg also utilizes a series of wastewater ponds, installe d in 1992 and expanded in 2004. The ponds cover an area of 26 acres with two a cres of rock filter. Both the wastewate r ponds and the poplar tree farm are regulat ed under an NPDES permit. CITY OF JUNCTION CITY Constructed in 1966/1967, the Ci ty of Junction City's 0.8 MGD d ry weather sewage treatment plant operates under an NPDES permit. The system includes 50 acres of wastewater ponds that are used during the wet season, from November to April, to treat seconda ry effluent. During the dry season, treated wastewater is land applied at agronomic rates using spr inkler systems on adjacent agricultural land. Actual averag e flow over the past two years has been 0.62 MGD during the dry season and 2.06 MGD during the wet season. CITY OF MEDFORD The Medford Regional Water Reclamation facility treats wastewat er from the cities of Central Point, Jacksonville, Phoenix, Talent, E agle Point, and other unincorpo rated Jackson Coun ty areas. The 20 MGD average dry weather flow fac ility is an acti vated sludge tr eatment plant, with a trickling filter. A biogas generator fuels the facility by combusting was te gas from the digester. The City of Medford Regional Wa ter Reclamation Facility dischar ges to the Rogue River, near important steelhead and salmon sp awning beds. Strict temperatu re requirements were included in 37 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 37 the Medford water qual ity permit. Temperatu res at wastewater t reatment plants are elevated due to hot water from households was hing clothes and dishes and tak ing showers. The City and DEQ staff evaluated a number of alternatives, incl uding water quality trading, to meet the stringent water quality temperature limits, including: 1. Internal plant changes 2. Evaporative cooling 3. Effluent recycling and reuse 4. Effluent chillers 5. Effluent storage 6. Temperature trading. The three feasible alternatives, chillers, effluent storage, an d trading, were further evaluated based on operability, effectiveness, rel iability, flexibility, energy consumption, public and regulatory acceptability, regulatory compli ance, and risk control. Using t hese criteria, efflu ent chillers scored the lowest, with the highest ene rgy consumption and lowest perc eived public acceptance. While effluent storage offers improved flexibility by allowing the pl ant to divert flows to storage, it is a higher energy consumption altern ative to temperature trading. Temperature trading had the lowest estimated cost at $6 million , versus $16 milli on for effluent chillers. Based on this information, the City of Medford ente red into a contract with The Freshwater Trust to develop and implement a water quality tradi ng program to restore streamside vegetation to meet the City's temperature obligations. Medford also utilizes a thermal credit trading pr ogram to meet standards that require an effluent temperature reduction of 1 degre e Celsius, an equivalent of abo ut 300 million kilocalories. Instead of paying $16 million to build and operate an effluent chilling system, the City developed an $8 million trading program. It pays for the eradication of nonnat ive species in riparian areas and replaces them with native trees and plants that shade the strea m. It also pays streamside landowners $100$300 per acre per year to host these restoratio n projects. The City will create projects to offset 600 million ki localories of heat output in a lignment with a 2:1 ratio that helps offset possible project failures. Over the next 20 years, the C ity will monitor these sites for success.xiv More about the Medford trading program is available at http://www.thefreshwatertrust.org/fixing rivers/waterqualitytrading/ METROPOLITAN WASTEWATER MANA GEMENT COMMISSION (MWMC) The Metropolitan Wastewater Mana gement Commission treats sewage from the City of Eugene, the City of Springfield, and the urba nized areas of Lane County. Th e 49 MGD treatment plant is located on the banks of the Willamette Riv er in the City of Eugene. The treatment plant uses an innovative natural treatment system for bios olids recycling and recycled w ater application. MWMC's Eugene/Springfield Water P ollution Control Facility curr ently produces approximately 5,000 dry tons of biosolids annu ally from three anaerobic diges ters. The solids are processed at the Biosolids Management Facility (BM F), located 5.5 miles north of the treatment plant. For the 38 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 38 majority of biosolids produced, MWMC relies on voluntary cooper ative agreements with farmers to utilize biosolids as a source of nutrients for agricultural cro ps. In addition, in 1997, MWMC adopted a Biosolids Citizens Advisor y Committee's (CAC) recommendation to diversify the biosolids program, which includ ed a dedicated application site growing hybrid poplar trees. Hyb rid poplars are a great option for biosolids application and recycling because these trees combine a long growing season wit h significant water and nutrient uptake capacity due to their rapid growth rate. In order to ensure the availability of land for environmentally sound application of biosolids, MWMC purchased land, called the Biocy cle Farm and began planting pop lar trees in 2004. By 2010, MWMC had completed phased implementation of the farm, with a total a rea of nearly 400 a cres containing 88,000 trees. On average, 750 dry tons of Class B biosolids and 70 million gall ons of Class D recycled water is irrigated on the poplar farm annually. By o wning and operating its own farm connected by pipelines to the WPC F, MWMC furthers its sound man agement practices and achievement of high environmental standards. CITY OF MYRTLE CREEK The City of Myrtle Creek's 1.8 MGD dry weather/2.4 MGD wet weat her wastewater treatment process includes the use of recy cled water for golf course irri gation. Their system was installed in 1996 and upgraded in 2003. The 1 20acre facility is used season ally, from May 1 to October 31, to reduce nutrient discharge to the South Umpqua River during the summer season. CITY OF NEWBERG The City of Newberg's 4 MGD wastewater treatment plant was inst alled in 1989 and is in the process of being upgraded. Opera ting under an NPDES permit, the facility was designed to meet an 85% pollutant reduction goal, which it succeeds in meeting. Sec ondary effluent is discharged to the Willamette River yearround. During the dry season, the City fu rther treats a portion of its wastewater and provides this wat er to the local golf course for recycled water irrigation purposes. CITY OF PRINEVILLE The City of Prineville's municip al wastewater treatment system utilizes water recycling and wastewater ponds as part of its s ystem. The treatment plant was installed in the 1960s, and has gone through multiple upgrades, the last of which was in 2005. This latest upgrade brought the dry weather design flow to 1.6 MGD. Operating under an NPDES permit , the City of Prineville land applies secondary effl uent during the dry season on the 123acr e Meadow Lakes Golf Course and more recently on farmland adjacent to the wastewater treatment facility. This system was designed to help the municipality meets i ts pollutant reduction goals of CBOD to 25 mg/L and TSS to 40 mg/L. For the most part the facility meets these goals although algal blooms can cause suspended solids issues during the mont hs of February and March. The 2005 facility upgrade cost approximately $8 million dollars . Operations and management costs average $1450 per million gallons treated, or approximately $50 0,000 per year. Energy usage 39 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 39 averages 4640 kilowatt hours pe r million gallons treatment, or 1,598,000 kilowatt hours per year. Additional benefits of the syst em include wildlife habitat. ROSEBURG URBAN SANITAR Y AUTHORITY (RUSA) The Roseburg Urban Sanitary Authority (RUSA) provides sanitary sewer service to the City of Roseburg and the area within the Roseburg Urban Growth Boundary . The 7.9 MGD dry weather/15 MGD wet weather Roseburg Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) was installed in 198587 and utilizes treatment we tlands and indirect discharge under an NPDES permit to seasonally polish treated secondary effluent. The complex natural treatment sy stem, constructed in 20092012 on a private farm near the WWTF that RUSA owns, contains hyd raulic management, treatment, and ecosystem services components. This includes a reus e pump station at the WWTF, an irrigation pond and treatment wetlands, land application as agronomic and highrate irrigatio n, indirect discha rge, mitigation wetlands, and restoration of his toric natural wetlands on the f arm.xv The system utilizes farm crops, soil organisms, and soil chemica l reactions to uptake, absorb, and transform target constituents in the treated effluent. The drainage waters from these natural pr ocesses then percolate through the soil and discharge to the nearby surface waters in compliance w ith the water quality criteria of the river.xvi The 340acre facility is used seasonally, from May 1 to October 31, to treat 8 MGD dry weather WWTFtreated effluent flow. It was designed to meet the 2006 T emperature TMDL for the South Umpqua River and to reach effluent phosphorus levels of less th an 3.4 pounds per day, a 97% reduction from normal levels. A ccording to system managers, the system achieves that goal, offering a costeffective altern ative to conventional treatment systems while meeting stringent water quality standards. In the summer of 2013, the natural tre atment system's first full summer of operation, the NTS removed 96.2 percent of the total phosphorus , releasing only 603 pounds to the South Umpqua River. The DEQ/RUSA target of no more than a 1 mg/ L decrease in dissolved oxygen from upstream to downstream samp le points was met 100 percent o f the time, and dissolved oxygen in the downstream sample point was above the statewide c old water standard of 8 mg/L 100 percent of the time.xvii The surface flow wetland cells a t Salem have also been monitore d for temperature treatment and have shown to be effective in lowering effluent temperatures fr om the WWTP. Data from the constructed wetland cell showed t hat with 6 to 13 days of hydra ulic retention time, the average temperature reduction was 3 oC in July to 8.3 oC in December . Construction costs were approxim ately $8.5 million while ongoin g operations and maintenance costs average about $200,000 per year. This represents enormous savings compared to a conventional treatment plant, which would have cost $100 millio n to design and construct and $6 million in annual operation and maintenance costs. xviii The system also provides additional community benefits such as tours for diverse groups such as mid dle school classes, engineers, the Audubon Society, and civic groups. CITY OF SALEM 40 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 40 The City of Salem operates the 3 5 MGD Willow Lake Treatment Pla nt, serving Salem and Keizer. The treatment process includes a 1.0 MGD Natural Reclamation Sy stem, a treatment wetlands system that was installed in 200 2. Design and construction cost s were $3.5 million and operations and maintenance costs are $20,000 per year. The treatment area covers 10 acres wi th 20 acres of nonprocess native habitat and is used yearround to treat seco ndary effluent. The facility operates under a stateonly WPCF permit and achieves its design goals of temperature and ammonia reduction. According to system ma nagers, the syst em has been a success and provides a great learning environment that can be used for furthering knowledge of natural treatment systems for both facility operators and the public. Additional benefits of the system include walking trails, bird watching, wildlife habitat, an d environmental education. The City of Salem Natu ral Reclamation Syste m can treat up to 1 million gallons per day (mgd) of secondary effluent. The City's main treatment plant (Willow La ke Water Pollution Control Facility) does not have the capacity to perform nutrient removal in its c urrent process and can send secondary treated wastewater to the wetlands with ammonia level s as high as 25 mg/l, which at 1 MGD equals 208.5 pounds of ammonia. The wetlands treatment sys tem is capable of removing most of the ammonia and can rout inely reduce ammonia concentrat ions to less than 1 mg/l at the end of the process. Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is also redu ced to a range of 1 to 2 mg/l. The Salem wetland treatment system is effective in removing most of the nitrogen from the water. The only cost for this system is the pumping of the water from the main plant out to the wetlands. Now that the system is fully established and operational, ongoing o perations and maintenance costs for this nutrient treatment system is approximately $80.00 per day. CITY OF SILVERTON The 2.25 MGD Silverton Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes a 17 acre treatment wetland system that was installed in 1999 and operates under an NPDES permit. Operations and maintenance costs average $46,000 per year. These treatment wetlands are classifi ed as warm water refugia and receive hightemperature secondary wastewater treatment plant e ffluent during the summer months (May 1 - October 31). The wetland water is also used to irrigate the Oregon Gardens, an ornamental botanical garden. Ene rgy costs to irrigate the Orego n Gardens average about $1,100 per year. This natural treatment system was designed to help the City of Silverton meet the thermal load limit of less than 5.2 kilocalor ies per day for Silver Creek. F acility managers report that the system performs very well, meeting the t emperature reduction design go als while offering additional amenities including botanical gar den irrigation, walking trails , wildlife habitat, bird watching, and environmental education. CITY OF VENETA The City of Veneta's 1.25 MGD wa stewater treatment plant was in stalled in 1970. Originally consisting of a single facultati ve lagoon system, the City expa nded to two lagoons in 1976. In 1982, due to increasing flows, the lag oons could no longer hold all o f the effluent during the summertime, so the City began conducting irrigation on Cityowned fields du ring the summer season, usually during the months of May to Octob er. After undergoing primary a nd secondary treatment in the activated sludge treatment facili ty, the effluent is disinfecte d and sent to the effluent holding 41 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 41 lagoon. From there, irrigation p umps move the effluent to city owned fields located to the north of the city. A mixture of poplar trees and hay are grown in these fields. CITY OF WOODBURN The City of Woodburn's 3.3 MGD d ry weather/4.8 MGD wet weather wastewater treatment facility was installed in 1999. As part of the wastewater treatment syst em, the City utilizes secondary effluent to irrigate an 88acre poplar farm that provides phyto treatment services. The poplar farm system is operated during the dry season (JuneOctober) under a n NPDES permit. Biosolids are also applied on the poplar farm during the summer months. The system was designed to reduce ammonia loading to the receiving stream. According to system op erators, the system is straightforward and effective, m eeting ammonia reduction requir ements and while providing additional benefits to the comm unity including environmental ed ucation. 42 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 42 SYSTEMS USED BY OREG ON MUNICIPALITIES Facility Wetland Treatment Recycled Water Tree Farms Indirect Discharge Water Quality Trading Wastewater Ponds City of Albany X City of Bend X Clean Water Services x X City of Cottage Grove X City of Harrisburg X X City of Junction City X X City of Medford X MWMC (Eugene/Springfield) X X City of Myrtle Creek X City of Newberg X City of Prineville X X RUSA X X City of Salem X City of Silverton City of Veneta X X X City of Woodburn x RECYCLED WATER SYSTEMS This list was generated by Orego n Department of Environmental Q uality staff.

During the summer months, Ash land uses membran e filtration to treat wastewater and remove phosphorus. The City of Ashland i s one of only a handful of facilities in Oregon that are required to treat wastewater to remove phosp horus. Ashland is now planning 46 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 46 further improvements to its trea tment plant by relocating its o utfall to a larger nearby stream, while constructing wetlands to p rovide temperature reductions t o address near field temperature issues. The City is also working to incorporate water quality t rading into its wate r quality permit compliance plans to address far field temperature issues. The c ombination of these natural treatment approaches would build on the success of other commun ities that have demonstrated that natural solutions can be more cost effective for ratepayer s, while providing greater environmental gains than the ir mechanical alternatives. HOODLAND The Hoodland Wastewater Treatmen t Plant, located in Welches, Or egon, serves a mountain community of 4000 customers. Tre ated wastewater from the Hoodl and plant is discharged to the nearby Sandy River via a traditi onal inriver outfall structure . The beauty of the Hoodland area is matched by the intensity of rain events and the Sandy River is wellknown for being dynamic and destructive during high river flows. Hoodland's river outfall structure was destro yed during a flood event in 1996, rebuilt in 1998, a nd destroyed again in 2011. Clackamas Water Environment Serv ices (WES), in coordination wit h regulatory agencies and consultants, is evaluating the p ossibility of using an indirect discharge system adjacent to the river channel. WES has facilitated mee tings with the local community on the project goals and status. Several meetings and phone conferences have taken place with DE Q and other agency staff to update them on project developmen t and to obtain feedback on th e project approach. Stakeholder reactions to the project conc epts have been positive. The following studies have been conducted thus far: Soil sampling and depth to groun dwater monitoring through test pit installation - Test pits were installed in January 2012 and data indicated that the Sand y River was a gaining stream in this area. Installation of three monitoring wells and a pump test to asses s hydraulic conductivity and direction of groundwater flow at the site and refine groundwate r hydrology modeling. A wetland delineation study with an assessment of Sandy River O rdinary High Water Elevation Survey and a Rare Plan ts Survey. The study concluded that no wetlands or rare plants are present within the study area. An evaluation of the geomorpholo gy of the upper Sandy River in the vicinity of the preferred indirect discharge site. A fisheries survey conducted at t he preferred disc harge locatio n. The study showed that spawning habitat is limited due to the large substrate size. Th e preferred discharge location was chosen in part because spawn ing habitat is l imited in the i mmediate vicinity. The project is anticipated to pr ovide a more resilient system t hat is less likely to be damaged during subsequent Sandy River flood events while at the same time impr oving receiving wa ter quality as a result of improved and more disp ersed dilution into the river. CLEAN WATER SERVICES - FERNHILL The Fernhill Natural Treatment Sy stem in Forest Grove is planne d to be built in 20152016. It will include 95 acres of treatment wetlands. It is planned for year round use but the primary benefit is 47 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 47 anticipated to be achieved durin g the dry season. It is designe d to achieve temperature reduction goals under an NPDES permit while offering additional amenities to the community including walking trails, bird watching, w ildlife habitat, and environmen tal education. The initial design flow rate of the facility is 5 MGD. By 2025, the system is anticipated to have a flow of 6.3 MGD, with an increase to 9 MGD and finally 18 MGD furthe r in the future. The following table summarizes the system's predicted temperature changes based on these different flow rates. The following table summarizes pr edicted removal rates for othe r selected pollutants: Pollutant Influent (mg/l) Effluent (mg/l) BOD 6 3 TSS 12 6 Ammonia 2 0.2 Phosphorus 0.5 0.3 WOODBURN In response to a 2008 Pudding River Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) issued for temperature, the City of Woodburn plans to develop a constructed wetlands partially within an existing unused effluent lagoon and on adjacent Cityowned floodplain land to provide passive cooling. This approach would provide a cost effective alternative to expensive and high energy demand chillers otherwise required to meet the temperature requirements. Planned improvements to the wastewater treatment facility include improved aeration and disinfection, emergency backup generators, road improvements, and increased pumping capacity along with an expansion to the poplar tree system and construction of a 10 million gallon irrigation regulating reservoir and 26 acres of constructed wetlands with a new outfall into the Pudding River. 48 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 48 CONCLUSION Natural treatment syst ems, including wetland s, recycled water s ystems, tree farms, indirect discharge, water quality trading, and wastewater treatment pond s are a sustainable, and affordable wastewater treatment system for Oregon communities, especially rural Oregon communities. All communities should incorporate ev aluation and consideration of natural treatment systems as part of ongoing facility planning an d treatment syst em updates and expansions. The reduced operation, chemical, and energy costs of natural tr eatment systems make them more sustainable. Although planning a successful natural treatment system may take more planning up front, the investment will pay of f later for the community. Co mmunities should be evaluating a number of different natural treatment systems combined into one holistic system. Additional community benefits can include recreation, environme ntal education, and open space.

APPENDIX 3: ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIO N OF NATURAL TREATMENT SYSTEM PROCESSES BOD/CBOD Dissolved oxygen is a key element to water quality that is nece ssary to support aquatic life. Organics and ammonia in wastewater are often decomposed by aero bic bacteria that require oxygen as part of thei r metabolic process. T herefore, the exist ence of organics and ammonia in 54 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 54 wastewater places a demand on th e natural supply of dissolved o xygen in water, called biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or carbonaceo us biological oxygen demand (C BOD). If there a re high levels of these pollutants in the efflue nt then the effluent will dema nd more dissolved oxygen from the water and leave less fo r the fish and other aquatic life that d epend on this oxygen for survival.xx Natural treatment systems such as treatment wetlands and ponds create an environment where the natural breakdown of organics by bacteria can occur before the wastewater is released to surface water. The large surfaces of these systems encourage the reaer ation of water, stimulating the activity of aerobic bacteria. BO D/CBOD can also be reduced thro ugh the anaerobic breakdown of organics, which is facilitated b y other types of bacteria that do not use oxygen as part of their metabolic processes.xxi PARTICULATES The amount of particulates in treated effluent determines its c larity, which can have adverse effects on water quality when it is disch arged to surface water. Partic ulate level is usually measured in terms of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Clay, silt, sand, algae, organic matter, and sewage are common sources of particulates in wastewater. Sediments are a n atural part of all water bodies, but if the particulate levels are to o high, the wate r loses its abi lity to support aquatic organisms. Particulates decrease light pene tration, which limits plant gro wth and decreases oxygen production. The death and subsequ ent decomposition of these pla nts further decreases oxygen availability and imposes more ne gative impacts on fish and othe r aquatic organisms. Water with high TSS also usually becomes war mer because the suspended sedi ment darkens the water and causes it to absorb more heat from sunlight.xxii Particulate levels can be reduce d through decomposition, sedime ntation, and filtration. Since much of suspended sediment is organic , it will be broken down by bac teria in the natural treatment system. Sedimentation can occur in wetlands or ponds that slow down water flow and allow for particles to settle out through gravitational forces. Particula te levels can also be decreased through filtration, when the wastewater p asses through na tural mediums such as soil and gravel.xxiii TEMPERATURE Heat reduces water's capacity to retain oxygen. Because dissolv ed oxygen is essential for the survival of fish and other aquat ic life, effluent that enters s urface water at an elevated temperature can have serious negative impact s for sensitive species such as salmon. Elevated temperatures reduce salmon's ability to succe ssfully reproduce and for their offspring to survive and grow. There is increased incidence of diseas e, reduced survival rate of egg s, increased competition for limited resources, and reduced ability t o compete with other species th at are better adapted to higher water temperatures. The incidence of these impacts increases as the water temperature increases and can seriously alter the ecology of the water body.xxiv Natural conduction and advection processes help achieve tempera ture reductions in wastewater. Conduction involves the transfer of heat from wastewater to a s olid substance. For example, filtering treated wastewater thr ough a cooler solid medium such as soil can decrease temperature through conduction. Advection invo lves the transfer of heat to another liquid. When wastewater is pumped through hyporheic water b efore reaching s urface water, t he cooling process is defined as advection.xxv 55 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 55 PHOSPHORUS Phosphorus is an essential nutrie nt for all living things and i s one of the most common nutrients found in water; but excessive p hosphorus in was tewater can ha ve detrimental effects. When effluent containing high levels of phosphorus is released to su rface water, it can create a condition called eutrophication which is cau sed by the rapid growth of al gae. High phosphorus levels stimulate this excessive algal growth, preventing sunlight from penetrating the water and choking out other plant life. When the algae die and decompose, the BOD /CBOD of the water increases significantly, further decreasin g dissolved oxygen levels and d epriving fish and aquatic plants of oxygen.xxvi Microbes living in natural treatment system environments conver t insoluble forms of phosphorus into soluble forms that are avai lable for plants to use. Aquati c plants and terrest rial plants that grow in or around natural treatment system environments natural ly uptake phosphorus and remove it from the effluent before it is released to surface wa ter.xxvii Phosphorus can also be absorbed and retained by soil through a process known as adsorp tion.xxviii NITROGEN Nitrogen is another essential nu trient that can also create a s ignificant oxygen demand if released to surface water at high concentrations. Nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, can also be toxic to fish. Due to nitrogen's vari ous oxygen states, this pollutant is pres ent in wastewater in a variety of forms. Nitrogen can change quick ly from one state to another de pending on the physical and biochemical conditions present in the wastewater. Nitrogen reduction can be achieve d by plant or algal uptake, ni trification and denitrification by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and loss of ammonia gas to the atmosphere (volatilization). Some forms of nitrogen can be also ad sorbed onto soil particles and retained in the soil.xxix METALS Trace metals that enter the food chain or the water supply can create serious health problems for both humans and wildlife. The pr imary metals of concern are cop per, nickel, lead, zinc, and cadmium. Metals are primarily reduced thr ough adsorption onto organic ma tter and precipitation. Natural treatment systems that utilize plants can also reduce wastewate r through the bioaccumulation of trace metals in plant tissues. Some metals may be toxic to plan ts, however, so it is important to evaluate the types of metals in the influent before choosing to utilize bioaccumulation methods for metals removal.xxx CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN AND PRIORITY PERSISTENT POLLUT ANTS According to the US En vironmental Protection Agency, an emergin g contaminant (EC) is any chemical or material characteriz ed by a perceived , potential, o r real threat to human health or the environment or by a lack of publ ished health standards. A conta minant also may be \"emerging\" because of the discovery of a ne w source or a new pathway to hu mans.xxxi Emerging contaminants comprise a wide array of chemicals including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroids, 56 Natural Treatment Systems - A Water Quality Match for Oregon's Cities and Towns Oregon DEQ & Oregon ACWA Page | 56 hormones, flame retard ants, and pesticides .xxxii These pollutants are bein g increasingly detected in the environment. Due to daily activities, there is a concern th at municipal wastewater may be a significant source of these pollu tants. Many of these chemicals are harmful to fish and other aquatic life and some may be harmful to humans. The syne rgistic effects created by these chemicals in combination are not well known.xxxiii The State of Oregon has implemen ted efforts to address a relate d category of pollutants: priority persistent pollutants. These sub stances are toxic and either pe rsist in the environment or accumulate in the tissues of huma ns, fish, wildlife or plants. In 2007, the Oregon State Legislature passed Senate Bill 737, which required the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to work with all interested parties to de velop a list of priority persi stent pollutants. This Oregonspecific category of bioaccumulative toxic s includes 118 su bstances that have a documented effect on human health, wildlife and aquatic life. The bill also required Oregon's 52 largest municipal wastewater treatment plants to screen wastewater effluent for t he presence of priority persistent pollutants, and to develop pollu tion reduction plans if levels were over threshold quantities. FDA approval is not required for the commercial use of many eme rging contaminants and priority persistent pollutants, making it difficult to prevent them from entering the water system. Many of these chemicals are not regulated under traditional environment al regulations and are not covered under state or federal water q uality standards or limits.xxxiv Natural treatment systems have a complex set of microenvironmen ts that can remo ve a wide range of emerging contaminants and pri ority persistent pollutants und er aerobic, anaerobic, and anoxic conditions.xxxv Some contaminants can also be adsorbed to other particles and settle out.xxxvi APPENDIX 4: REFERENCES Crites, R.
