Just some of the condtions we can help with: PDT Therapy (Photodynamic) is the application of specific light wavelengths to the body for healing. It has wide applications in medicine and is currently being researched and used to reduce inflammation and pain, repair tissue, to stimulate the immune system, reduce infections, and for healing of traumatic brain injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders. We use different PDT devices, depending on the type of healing required. Dr. Skakel uses photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy or low level laser light along with acupuncture to relieve pain in a relaxing 30 minute treatment.

Naturopathic Medicine combines safe and effective traditional therapies with the most current advances in modern medicine. Licensed Naturopathic Physicians are the highest trained practitioners in the broadest scope of naturopathic medical modalities. For more information about Naturopathic Medicine please visit: Chinese medicine has a written history that traces back more than 2,000 years and a growing scientific evidence base generated over the past 40 years. Acupuncture and Chinese herbal practice are grounded in the concept of qi (pronounced chee) \u2014 a concept which defines all living things and systems. Qi flows along pathways in the human body and interconnects the organs, tissues and emotions of human beings. When the balance of qi is disturbed due to trauma, poor diet, medication, stress, hereditary conditions, environmental or psychological issues, pain or illness results. Chinese medicine focuses on correcting these imbalances and stimulating the body's natural ability to heal itself with a combination of acupuncture, herbal medicine, bodywork and mindfulness practices. \"As a Naturopathic Physician, Bonnie is able to mix the best of western and eastern treatments. It's such a treat to be in her care. She has a very calm demeanor, a quieting voice, and a good knowledge of preventive medicine. When you're in her care you feel like you're the only patient she has. ...she definitely gives you her undivided attention and one-on-one care.\" \u2014 P. V. \"I was diagnosed with colon cancer a few months ago. Even though I had a lot of faith and trust in my medical team, I felt that the healing could be enhanced with non- conventional medical practices. I was introduced to Bonnie Skakel, a naturopathic doctor, who embraced both western and eastern medicine. She carefully and skillfully planned out a course to strengthen and support my body while I go through this process. Through my surgery and now chemo therapy I have had little to no adverse side effects to the chemo, have felt great, and have a lot of energy and stamina. I do not wish this condition on anyone; however, if I were to know someone that was going through this or some similar diagnosis, I would highly recommend that they work with Dr. Bonnie Skakel.\" - W.D. \"Dr. Skakel saved my life! I was in severe chronic pain for years and my primary care doctor couldn't help me. Depressed and ready to give up I heard about Dr. Skakel and decided to give her a try. At the first visit she gave me a simple natural approach to my condition and within 3 weeks my pain was 90% gone. I highly recommend her.\"\u2014 S.S. \u2014 Riverside Wellnesss Three Sisters Natural Health at Riverside Wellness 2955 N Highway 97, Suite 200 Bend, OR 97703 541.600.4731 We are located on the beautiful Deschutes River in Bend, Oregon.
