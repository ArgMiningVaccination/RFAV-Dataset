Passengers will need to provide proof of vaccination before embarkation and must have received both doses of the vaccine if recommended by the manufacturer at that time. Guests will complete an online form acknowledging this requirement before their cruise tickets will be issued. \"We are encouraged by the progress being made with the Covid-19 vaccines,\" said Crystal's interim president and CEO, Jack Anderson. \"We know that peace of mind is the greatest luxury; and the vaccine requirement is simply the best way to ensure the safest possible Crystal Experience for all on board. This sentiment is underscored by conversations with our guests, travel partners and a recent Cruise Critic survey of cruisers that revealed that more than 80 per cent of respondents would cruise if a vaccine were required.\" Crystal's crew members will also be expected to be vaccinated 14 days before service when the cruise line resumes sailing. However, this requirement is dependent upon the availability of vaccines in their home countries for their age range. Those who cannot access the vaccine when operations restart will be tested for Covid-19 prior to leaving their home and must receive a negative test. They will also take a test at embarkation, be quarantined for seven days, then take another test at the end of that period before beginning their duties. As the widespread availability of vaccines is currently dependent upon each traveller's home country, Crystal has suspended operations of its river fleet until May; until June for its ocean ships; to the start of August for Crystal Esprit and through to the end of August for Crystal Endeavor. This pause is intended to give passengers sufficient time to be fully vaccinated. "}
