For most people, the goal is <140 and <90; however some individuals may be better served by other BP goals. Lifestyle modifications (LM)* should be initiated in all patients with hypertension (HTN) and patients should be assessed for target organ damage and existing cardiovascular disease. Self-monitoring is encouraged for most patients throughout their care and requesting and reviewing readings from home and community settings can help in achieving and maintaining good control. For patients with hypertension and certain medical conditions, specific medications should be considered, as listed in the box on the right below.

Gather clinical staff to make consensus decisions about: Specific medications to be prescribed for most patients with hypertension Medications to consider for patients with hypertension and certain medical conditions Starting dosages and dosage increases with each titration Time intervals for follow-up and titration 2. Customize the template by accepting the variables in red or modifying them with other drug names, dosages, and titration As needed, develop separate protocols for subpopulations with different treatment goals 3. Adopt the protocol across the practice or system and revise it over time to meet the needs of patients and staff Abbreviations ACEI - Receptor Blocker BB - Beta Blocker CCB - Calcium Channel Blocker EF - Ejection Fraction MI - Myocardial Infarction TIA - Transient Ischemic Attack*Lifestyle Modifications1 (LM) Modification Recommendation Approximate SBP ** Reduction (Range) Weight reductionMaintain normal body weight (body mass index 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) 5-20 mm Hg/10kg Adopt DASH eating planConsume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy products with a reduced content of saturated and total fat8-14 mm Hg Dietary sodium reductionReduce dietary sodium intake to no more than 100 mmol per day (2.4 g sodium or 6 g sodium chloride)2-8 mm Hg Physical activityEngage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (at least 30 min per day, most days of the week which may be broken into shorter time intervals such as 10 minutes each of moderate or vigorous effort)4-9 mm Hg Moderation of alcohol consumptionLimit consumption to no more than 2 drinks (e.g. 24 oz. beer, 10 oz. wine, or 3 oz. 80-proof whiskey) per day in most men, and to no more than 1 drink per day in women and lighter weight persons2-4 mm Hg **SBP - systolic blood pressure The effects of implementing these modifications are dose and time dependent, and could be greater for some individuals DASH - Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension "}
