Not only have patients had to adjust to telemedicine, but they also experienced difficulty getting antiviral refills and disruptions in mail-order delivery. Others have had trouble navigating specific health information related to COVID-19 for people with liver disease and concerns related to the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for people living with hepatitis B and liver disease. The past year also has been particularly challenging for community-based organizations (CBOs) that provide direct public health services such as HBV education, screening, and vaccination. A 2020 survey conducted by Hep B United and several partners (the National Association of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, HepVu, the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, the Hepatitis Education Project and the National Association of County and City Health Officials) found that nearly two-thirds of CBOs providing viral hepatitis services received inadequate or no funding to adapt during the pandemic. Many CBOs were not able to offer hepatitis testing, vaccination, or community outreach, and more than half had to furlough or lay off staff. Despite these challenges, organizations have adapted resources and programs to the new reality. Creative strategies include an increased social media presence for hepatitis B awareness, contactless hepatitis B lab testing, client outreach and follow- up via phone calls and email, distribution of hepatitis B materials alongside COVID-19 education, and hosting drive-through educational events, among others. If the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us anything, it is the dedication, passion, and resilience of under-resourced CBOs to persevere in the most challenging times and continue their mission to eliminate viral hepatitis.THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON PEOPLE LIVING WITH HEPATITIS B IN THE U.S.Inside this issue 2 Planned a week of action for World Hepatitis Day 3 AASLD award to Joan and Tim Block 4 Drug Watch 5 There's a new forum in town 6 Our hepatitis B clinical trial finder 7 Successful Gala launches 30th Anniversary CelebrationHepB.org The Hepatitis B Foundation is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B worldwide through research, education and patient advocacy.76 Summer 2021Informed THE NEWSLETTER OF THE Hepatitis B Foundation page 6Hepatitis B Discrimination Registry Find more about COVID-19 and Hepatitis B at www.hepb.org. LEARN MORE ABOUT HEPATITIS B The Hepatitis B Foundation recommends three steps to help protect against hepatitis B: 1 Get tested: Hepatitis B can easily be detected with a quick and simple blood test, often available for free or reduced cost at a healthcare professional's office or clinic. 2 Get vaccinated: There are safe and effective vaccines that can provide lifelong protection from the virus. All newborns should receive hepatitis B vaccination at birth, and vaccination is also recommended for older children and adolescents who were not previously vaccinated or infected. 3 Get treated: If you test positive for hepatitis B, talk with a healthcare professional who is knowledgeable about hepatitis B for regular monitoring and to find out if treatment is appropriate to help reduce the risk of further liver damage. The national Hep B United coalition, led by the Hepatitis B Foundation in partnership with AAPCHO, provides culturally and linguistically responsive hepatitis B education, prevention, and treatment services to highly impacted populations\u2014communities that often experience inequities in healthcare access.

The goal is to encourage advocacy, raising awareness and lifting up the voices of our global community about the need for universal testing and adult vaccination in the United States, increasing birth dose vaccination worldwide, combatting stigma and discrimination and other advocacy priorities. The aim is to share our messages with government officials and elected leaders. To help, we've created a new campaign, which is detailed in the adjacent article, 300 Million Reasons campaign launched to boost advocacy communications,\" that also is being launched this month. 300 Million Reasons The 300 Million Reasons campaign is a movement to improve awareness about hepatitis B and liver cancer worldwide, to promote engagement of key stakeholders, and to empower people impacted by hepatitis B to become vocal advocates. There are almost 300 million people around the world living with chronic hepatitis B infection, and we want to make sure every voice is heard. We're launching 300 Million Reasons in conjunction with World Hepatitis Day to honor those living with hepatitis B and those engaged in hepatitis B prevention, patient care, research and advocacy. You can learn more about the 300 Million Reasons campaign by visiting www.hepb.org/300millionreasons and on social media by following the Hepatitis B Foundation and #300MillionReasons. Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Summer 2018 | hepb.org 3AASLD award to Joan and Tim Block Hepatitis B Foundation co-founders Joan Block, RN, and Timothy M. Block, PhD, received a very significant honor last fall during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The Blocks were honored with the AASLD's inaugural Distinguished Advocacy Service Award, which \"recognizes service provided to the hepatology community over an extended period that raises awareness or garners public and federal legislative support and promotes liver health and quality patient care.\" The award was presented by T. Jake Liang, MD, chief of the Liver Diseases Branch, National Institutes of Health, who will be presenting the award. \"The Hepatitis B Foundation has grown from a one-person crusade to a well-funded multi-tier organization with a large staff and deep influence in the advocacy community,\" Dr. Liang wrote in his nomination. \"It has effectively represented and advocated for patients with chronic hepatitis B and raised prominent awareness of the disease by implementing innovative educational, patient- oriented, community-based and public health programs.\" Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Summer 2021 | hepb.org 3Tim and Joan Block, co-founders, Hepatitis B FoundationWHY IS WORLD HEPATITIS DAY ON JULY 28 EVERY YEAR? People and organizations across the globe who care about viral hepatitis observe World Hepatitis Day on July 28 every year. That's the birthday of the late Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg (1925-2011), whose name is on our research arm, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. Not only did he discover the hepatitis B virus, Dr. Blumberg and colleagues invented the first vaccine for hep B. Because the virus so often leads to liver cancer, their invention effectively was the first \"anti-cancer\" vaccine. In 1976, Dr. Blumberg was awarded the Nobel Prize. Find Your Why for B Day! Celebrate World Hepatitis B Day on July 28 by asking yourself an important question: \"Why should I give to the Hepatitis B Foundation?\" Your why may be the almost 300 million people living with hepatitis B today, or maybe just a person you love who has the disease. Your why may be the need to fight the ever-present stigma those with hepatitis B face or the need to find a cure. Or maybe you understand the need for more research and better treatment options for those living with hepatitis B. Here's how Catharine Williams, one of our Board of Directors, expressed her Why: \"Hepatitis B should not derail anyone's life. The Hepatitis B Foundation and Blumberg Institute are changing the outcomes for people living with the disease. They are the change agents for this diseases.\" So, we ask you to Find Your Why for World Hepatitis Day, July 28, which we're making an annual giving day for our organization. Whatever your why is, you can make an immediate impact in these areas and more with a donation today. Please give from your heart to help someone else's liver. Please donate today!

When the doctor first broke the news to me about my diagnosis when I was 1 4, I was filled with a lot of emotions. I couldn't absorb anything else except \"You're stuck with this the rest of your life.\" when I went home from the doctor, I realised I hadn't absorbed anything else he had told me. So, I did what many people do; I went online and searched for information. I wanted to find a community of people going through the same thing, and I couldn't find anything. I could only find medical information, and that was all that was there. I realised then there was an additional problem with just Googling it: there are many scams and lots of people selling fake cures, and some people sharing well-intentioned but ill-informed information. To learn more about it, I went to university, got a degree in biomedical science, and did a PhD in hepatitis B research. Years later, I saw an article about WHA president Su Wang speaking about living with hepatitis B and read about Joan Block, one of the founders of the Hepatitis B Foundation in the USA. They both were speaking publicly about their own hepatitis B experience. I felt I should be doing that too, so that spurred me to ratchet up my advocacy work. I decided to look online again for a community. Almost 20 years after I first looked, there was still no online forum supporting people living with hepatitis B and connecting them with accurate information from experts. I realised that as someone with a scientific background and as someone living with hepatitis B, I could make the connections to create a forum . How does the forum work? Privacy was a big concern when setting up the forum because stigma is a huge issue for people living with hepatitis B. We allow people to post anonymously if they feel uncomfortable about being identified. We also have several other measures to protect people's privacy. You have a username that can be anything you want; it can be your name or one you choose; you don't need to share your location or anything like that. Your email address is never shown publicly. I also wanted the forum to be able to identify people that were trustworthy sources of information. So, we have a verification process for clinicians and nurses to be verified as health experts. They are on the forum to answer questions and give good advice about health guidelines and treatment options. We also have verified scientists on the forum to explain to people what is coming in terms of a hepatitis B cure and other scientific and technical issues around hepatitis B. People can then ask questions and engage in the science of hepatitis B, like how the virus works and how people are developing new cures. The site is entirely free and open to join; you just need an email address to register. People looking for advice can quickly get it. It is even free for people to read if you aren't comfortable with registering yet, so you can read answers to questions other people have asked. We have around 400 members from around the world at the moment, and they are starting conversations and participating in community discussions. For me, it is really rewarding to see people being supported by their peers. When I was struggling with the emotions of being diagnosed, I wish I had this type of group to offer me advice and support. What are your hopes for the forum? I hope this will get to a critical mass of users, encouraging offshoot movements and empowering societal change from the bottom-up. One thing I'd like to see is the coming together of multiple stakeholders, all sharing and learning from each other. A lot of the conversations in the clinical field and science are happening without the input of people affected by viral hepatitis; I would like to see the forum becoming a place where a strong patient voice can be harnessed to facilitate discussions. As a scientist, myself I know many scientists that have worked in the field for decades and they have never spoken to someone living with hepatitis B and never heard about how it is affecting their day to day lives. That connection can really focus the scientist in their work to use their knowledge and research to make a difference and combat the problems that have been highlighted to them. Most importantly, I want people living with Hepatitis B to feel supported and empowered. I hope this community can act like a family for people living with hepatitis B, particularly if they cannot be completely open with people close to them. People deserve to be supported. I hope the loneliness and the shame people experience from hepatitis B can be alleviated by this community connection. How can people sign up? I want to encourage everyone to join the forum by registering at www. HepBcommunity.org. The stronger the community can become, the more influential the forum can be, the more people we can help. If you're an expert, please join so that you can share your knowledge and so that you can listen and learn about the problems people living with hepatitis B face. Contact info@hepbcommunity.org for any comments or queries. THERE'S A NEW FORUM IN TOWN Thomas Tu, PhD, created an online community to address isolation, loneliness, and a need for connection\u2014the often hidden symptoms of hepatitis B. People newly diagnosed with hepatitis B are left with a lot of unanswered questions and limited support. Dr. Tu, an Australian scientist living with hepatitis B has created a growing online community supporting people living with hepatitis B to connect with people going through the same experiences and offer advice and support. Our partners at World Hepatitis Alliance sat down with Dr. Tu to find out more. The Hepatitis B Foundation is proud to partner with Dr. Tu in leading and growing this community.

We announced the Hepatitis B Discrimination Registry, which is a permanent and sophisticated database, in May 202 1, with a worldwide communications campaign to encourage patients to share their stories of hepatitis B related discrimination anonymously. To date, more than 1 40 people have done so. Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH, the Foundation's senior vice president, said the primary means for collecting patients' accounts will be the Foundation's brief online survey, which will be supplemented over time with patient interviews. \"We appreciate that so many people living with hepatitis B have responded so quickly, taking time to share with us their stories,\" Dr. Cohen said. \"The Foundation hopes the registry will provide us with the much-needed documentation to demonstrate that discrimination is a significant human rights violation for those living with hepatitis B that impacts all aspects of life. To our knowledge, no worldwide discrimination registry exists for individuals living with hepatitis B, and we intend to fill this gap.\" Along with asking people living with hepatitis B to complete the survey, the Foundation is asking their families, health care providers, advocates, government leaders, other nonprofit organizations and academia to help raise awareness about the new registry, particularly in regions with high infection rates. The Hepatitis B Foundation has successfully worked to improve protections against discrimination in the U.S., such as winning inclusion of hepatitis B as a protected condition under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 201 3. The Discrimination Registry's data will be used to develop policy and advocacy efforts intended to eliminate hepatitis B-related discrimination in the future. The Foundation will share the data through reports that will include high-level information (country-level, type of discrimination, etc.) on what is reported through the Registry. No identifiable information submitted by a person experiencing discrimination will be made available under any circumstances. The Foundation's public health staff, which regularly publishes articles in scholarly journals, will publish analyses of the data. Discrimination against people living with hepatitis B has been documented in the U.S. and many other countries and anecdotally reported through the Foundation's social media channels and consultation lines with more frequency. But a greater number of discrimination reports may not mean the incidence is rising, according to Catherine Freeland, MPH, PhD(c), public health program director at the Hepatitis B Foundation, who is leading the Registry project. \"The increase is probably because more people are coming out and talking about discrimination, and improved access to technology\u2014more people around the world have access to the internet, social media and email\u2014make it easier for people to find us and share their stories,\" Ms. Freeland said. According to the Foundation, discrimination is defined as the unjust, unfair or prejudicial treatment of a person on the grounds of their hepatitis B status. In other words, being treated differently because of one's hepatitis B infection. People with hepatitis B often face discrimination in many ways: denied employment or education, treated unfairly while at work or in school, not allowed to enter certain countries, not permitted to serve in the military or treated unfairly by health care providers and institutions.Our hepatitis B clinical trial finder The future is promising for people with chronic hepatitis B, thanks in a part to advancements in medical science and new drugs now in development. Before being approved to use, every new drug must go through a testing process, which involves three-phase clinical trials, to evaluate its safety and effectiveness. The Hepatitis B Foundation has partnered with Antidote, a company that connects patients with research opportunities, to offer the Clinical Trial Finder, which can connect you with hepatitis B, hepatitis D, or liver cancer clinical trials near you in 60 seconds! You don't need to input your email address to use the Finder, but if you do, you can receive updates on new clinical trial opportunities near you as they open. To access the Clinical Trial Finder, visit the Clinical Trials page on our website. You also can contact us at info@hepb.org if you have any questions. Volunteering for a clinical trial can be very valuable. Expensive blood work, treatment medications and doctor's visits are usually provided free for those accepted into a study. Clinical trials also provide the opportunity to potentially benefit from the latest advances in medical science. The U.S. National Library of Medicine manages www.clinicaltrials.gov, a large website which can help you find clinical trials around the world. More Than B celebrates people living with hepatitis B Building on the success of our #justB Storytelling campaign, we created a spinoff with a different twist: people living with hepatitis B talking about the fun and rewarding aspects of their lives that make them #MoreThanB . One of our first #MoreThanB stories was submitted by Espi . \"I am 80 this year and live a happy healthy life with hepatitis B. I maintain my fitness routine and eat healthy. My passion for worldwide travelling and exploring different places took me as far as Ushuaia (end of the world) Argentina, Australia, Russia, and Asia. Also, I enjoy and have lots of fun ballroom dancing, swimming, studying & practicing Spanish conversation. Doing volunteer work for AAUW Diversity Committee discussion group and fundraising for Dollars for Scholars is rewarding and enhances my interest in social issues.\" You can follow #MoreThanB on our social media, where we share new stories regularly.Successful Gala launches 30th Anniversary Celebration Our Annual Crystal Ball Gala on April 30 was a huge success as a fundraiser and, though a virtual, online-only event, it was a great way to kick off the Foundation's 30th Anniversary celebration. The event also brought in more than $150,000 in pledges, which is a new record for our annual fundraiser. Of course, all of those funds will go to supporting public health, advocacy and research activities of the Hepatitis B Foundation and Blumberg Institute. You can watch a recording of the event on the Gala website, hepbgala.org. It includes a new, nine- minute feature video (at 22:50 of the recording) that provides a rich view of our history.
