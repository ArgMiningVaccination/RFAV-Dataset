Vaccines are sensitive biological substances that can lose their potency and effectiveness if they are exposed to temperatures (heat and/or cold) outside of the required temperature range for the specific product ( i.e., ultra- low or frozen temperatures) or when exposed to light. Failure to adhere to vaccine handling and cold chain requirements may reduce vaccine potency ( resulting in a lack of protection against COVID- 19) and/or increased local reactions at the sit e of the vaccine administration . The loss of vaccine effectiveness due to cold chain exposures to adverse conditions is cumulative, permanent, and irreversible. As part of the current efforts to reach increased vaccination coverage targets in the province to protect individuals and the population, it is important to take every opportunity to vaccinate, especially for those who may be vaccine hesitant and for those who may be less likely to return for recommended doses. Therefore, opening a vial to vaccinate one or a small number of individuals may be necessary to support vaccination efforts and reach provincial targets. This is especially important where a vial is reaching its \"must use by\" date. Efforts should continue to be made in these instances to loca te other potential individuals for vaccination (e.g., waitlists) when possible. While unused doses in open vials are expected to increase as overall vaccination rates decrease, it remains important to limit expiry of closed vials through proper inventory management and storage and handling, including fridge monitoring (e.g., temperature logs), stock rotation based on expiry and \"must use by\" dating, and recommended packing and transport per product specifications . Public health units should also follow the: Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 20181; and Individual product monographs on the Government of Canada website . Health care providers should also follow the : Vaccine Storage Handling Guidelines ; 1 Please note Public Health Units must comply with Ontario Public Health Standards including the Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol, 2018. 3 | Page Individual product monographs on the Government of Canada website .

Please se e the following for details: Individual COVID -19 vaccine chapters for storage and handling guidance Individual product monographs on the Government of Canada website ; Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 20182; Vaccine Storage Handling Guidelines . Initial Set -Up of ULT and Freezer Storage Unit s for COVID -19 Vaccine Products All ULT and freezer storage units that will be storing the COVID -19 vaccine are required to be set up so that temperatures are stabilized at the recommended temperature range specified by the manufacturer prior to placing any vaccine into the unit. Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine s: o Orange , Maroon and Grey Cap The internal temperature of the unit should be stabilized between - 90 oC to - 60oC (-130oF to -76oF) prior to stocking vaccine. Moderna Spikevax vaccine o Royal Blue Cap: The internal temperature of the unit should be stabilized between -50 oC to - 15oC (-13oF to +5oF) prior to stocking vaccine. Recommended storage temperature is - 20oC. Prior to storing vaccine in the storage unit, the temperatures should be within the requir ed storage temperature range . Monitor and document minimum and maximum temperatures for 2 to 7 consecutive days to ensure storage unit stability is appropriate for vaccine storage. 2 Please note Public Health Units must comply with Ontario Public Health Standards including the Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol, 2018. 6 | Page Monit or and document minimum and maximum temperatures for 2 to 7 consecutive days to ensure storage unit stability is appropriate for vaccine storage. Inspections Facilities storing C OVID -19 vaccine in ULT or freezer storage units should ensure that annual inspections (including temperature cal ibration) and regular maintenance of all ULT or freezer storage units is completed by a certified company. A copy of these inspections from facilities may be requested to ensure that vaccine storage and handling conditions are being adhered to. Monitoring Vaccine Storage Unit Temperatures at the Point of Distribution Monitoring vaccine storage equipment and temperatures is a daily responsibility to ensure the safety of the vaccine supply. Facilities should implement routine monitoring activities to identify out -of-range temperatures quickly and take immediate action to correct them to prevent any loss of vaccines. Each facility that receives COVID- 19 vaccine s should : Document the time and the current, maxim um and minimum temperatures of all vaccine storage units in the Temperature Log Book3 twice daily (beginning and end of each business day) and reset the digital temperature monitoring device after recording/downloading the readings .4 As there are several different data loggers required for the monitoring of the specialized storage units, consult the product specifications for your particular data loggers, including the requirements for downloading and replacement (i.e., expiry date) . View the temperatures every time the storage unit is accessed . Report any out- of-range temperatures immediately. Maintain temperature logs and data logger temperature downloads for a minimum of one year (unless internal policy requires a longer retention period) . This data may be requested by the m inistry . 3 Please note that while the Temperature Log Book identifies refrigerated vaccines, it can also be used for ULT and freezer storage units. 4 Refer to the product specification sheets for your device(s). Ensure to share these sheets with your local public health unit and consult with them with any questions. 7 | PageInspect the storage unit during the twice -daily checks, and, if required, rotate inventory and remove any expired vaccines. Check unit doors throughout the day and always at the end of the day to ensure they are tightly closed to prevent temperature changes and exposure to light . A remote monitoring system that allows for the notification of temperatureexcursions and power disruptions is recommend ed. Develop and have contingency plans in place that account for events such aspower outages and vaccine storage unit malfunctions. oEnsure vaccine storage units can connect to and run when on emergency power ; and oHave plans for alternative storage , which could include another comparable purpose- built storage unit, such as a portable storage unit (e.g., credo cube; portable ULT) or an alternative storage facility. Contact the Vaccine Supp ly and Logistics (VSL) unit for any temperature excursions at vaccinesup plyandlogistics@ontario. ca. See bel ow section on Temperature Excursion. Data Loggers As there are several different data loggers available on the market to monitor the specialized storage units, please consult the product specifications for your particular data loggers, including the requirements for downloading and replacement . Data loggers are continuous monitoring and recording d evices that provide detailed information on all temperatures recorded at pre-set intervals. Data loggers provide the most accurate storage unit temperature information, including details on how long a unit has been operating outside the recommended tempera ture range. When using data loggers, the facility should : oContinuously record all vaccine storage unit temperatures; oCheck the digital temperature monitoring device at least twice daily, at the start and end of each day, to confirm that vaccine storage uni t temperatures remained within the acceptable range for proper vaccine storage . Record minimum, maximum, and current temperatures in the Temperature Log Book after each check; 8 | Page o Review the print -outs /downloadable reports from the data logger when the vaccine storage unit temperatures are outside the range of those indicated for the vaccine; o Change batteries annually, or as required; o It is recommended that an external alarm monitoring system is installed , which alerts staff within and outside of work hours when there is a temperature excursion . Note : an externa l alarm system is a requirement for public health units (see Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 ); o Program the continuous temperature recording system for at least a 30 - minute interval for recordings; o Place the data loggers in the middle of the vaccine storage unit with vaccines surrounding it; o Place the data logger away from doors or walls of the refrigerator; o Download data loggers on a weekly basis, and when an alarm is triggered. Logs should be k ept for a minimum of one year and be available in the event the m inistry request s this data . If single -use data loggers are utilized, ensure you have an adequate supply of data loggers before downloading ; o Download the data from the data logger immediately when an out-of- range temperature occurs to determine the duration of the temperature excursion incident and to determine if vaccine is suitable for continued use or is no longer viable; o For da ta loggers that are utilized to record the minimum, maximum, and current temperatures twice daily, data sh ould be downloaded after the temperature recordings in order to reset the minimum, maximum and current temperature readings from the previous readings. If single -use data loggers are utilized, ensure you have adequate supply; and o For data loggers that are utilized in conjunction with a maximum -minimum thermometer (e.g. , for refrigerated vaccines), data can be downloaded on a weekly basis (if no out- of-range temperatures occur) provided that the minimum, maximum and current temperature readings are documented from the maximum -minimum thermometer twice -daily. 9 | Page Vaccine Transport General Movement of COVID -19 vaccine from the storage unit into the clinic space is permissible (e.g ., to a different floor/wing; to departments such as Occupational Health). Caution should be taken to minimize shaking or agitation of the vaccine during transport due to the fragility of the products, as advised by the manufacturers. During Vaccine Storage Unit Malfunction/ Electricity Disruption at the Point of Storage When a malfunction occurs, the facility should : Document the time and the maximum, minimum and current temperature of the vaccine storage unit in the Temperature Log Book and reset the maximum - minimum thermometer (if applicable) . Not allow the vaccine to remain in a non -functioning unit for an extended period of time; o Factors including the amount of vaccine being stored in the unit, the external temperatures (e.g., summer vs. winter) and the type, model and age of the vaccine storage unit will affect the duration of time vaccines within the unit will be kept within the vaccine manufacturers ' specified temperature range; During a scheduled or a time -limited electrical disruption where the power is expected to be restored before the vaccine storage unit temperature rises above the recommended range, the facility sh ould follow these steps: o Keep the storage unit door closed until the power is restored to maintain an acceptable tempe rature range for as long as possible; and o Record maximum, minimum and current temperatures: Continue to monitor the temperatures inside the vaccine storage unit at 30 -minute intervals if the digital temperature monitoring device allows digital temperature monitoring without opening the storage unit doors; If this is not possible, keep the door closed and immediately implement plans for transfer of the vaccine into a functioning unit 10 | Page (i.e., ultracold /freezer portable unit or vaccine refrigerator unit). If it is un known whether the problem can be corrected in time to maintain an appropriate temperature, the facility sh ould initiate its contingency plan by: o Transferring vaccines to an alternative storage facility (that is connected to a generator) by: Contacting the local public health unit to notify them of the need to transport vaccine to a different location. The public health unit will notify the VSL Unit. This alternative storage facility or storage unit should be identified as part of local contingency plans prior to receipt of vaccine ; Conducting an inventory of vaccines while packing all vaccines, using portable units and/or insulated containers with appropriate packing materials and digital temperature monitoring devices . o Recording the time and insulated container temperature before transporting the vaccines to and upon arrival at the alternative storage facility; and o Continuing to read and record the maximum, minimum and current temperatures twice daily. If an alternative storage facility cannot be identified within a reasonable timeframe, place the vaccine in the insulated container with appropriate packaging material and digital temperature monitoring devices and reco rd the temperature at the facility by: o Labelling the insulated containers; and o Continuing to monitor the temperatures inside the insulated container at 30-minute intervals using a temperature monitoring device that allows temperature viewing without opening the insulated container (e.g., in/out thermometer). When the Vaccine Storage Unit Malfunction Has Been Corrected or the Electricity Supply to the Unit Has Been Restored at the Point of Distribution Document the following: o Maximum, minimum and curre nt temperatures inside the vaccine storage units; 11 | Page o Length of time the power has been off; and o Time when the electricity supply is restored . Maintain the vaccines in the storage unit or remove the vaccines from the portable storage unit, and/or insulated container . If removed, place them into the purpose- built vaccine storage unit and resume regular vaccine storage and handling practices, as long as the vaccine storage unit and insulated container maintained the required temperature range as specified by the vaccine manufacturer(s) . If the purpose -built vaccine storage unit is unable to maintain the required storage temperature range, m aintain the vaccines in the assigned container and continue to monitor temperatures inside the container . Place the vaccine back into the purpose -built unit once it is able to maintain the temperature range as specified by the vaccine manufacturer(s) in the product monograph. If the vaccine was not maintained in the correct temperature range, then an excursion has occurred; see the process below. Temperature Excursion Regardless of what point in the vaccine cold chain (e.g., transport, storage, clinic site etc.) a temperature excursion occurs, steps should be taken to ensure the appropriate management of the affected vaccine. Note: vaccine viability and final dispositio n are determined in consultation with the manufacturer's identified primary contact. General principles: Incident based temperature excursion management processes Temperature Excursion Management - Process Steps 1. Quarantine the vaccine in appropriate temperature - controlled conditions , & document the excursion in COV axON 2. Consult the appropriate vaccine manufacturer (MFG )/ primary contact 3. Follow the MFG /primary contact's direction regarding vaccine viability and disposition 4. Report the excursion to the VSL Unit at: vaccinesupplyandlogistics @ontario.ca and document the outcome in COV axON (e.g., report wastage), & appropriately dispose of waste ( see Appendix C) 12 | Page During transit from the manufacturer: When a temperature excursion occurs during transportation of the vaccine to your site from the manufacturer or the federal gover nment (i.e., FedEx/Innomar) directly, quarantine the product, notify the VSL Unit and National Operations Centre ( NOC ) email account immediately and contact the FedEx/Innomar as appropriate (see Appendix A for contact information) . If outside hours of operation, email for the primary contact should be used and copy the NOC and VSL per Appendix A . For locations receiving vaccines directly from the manufacturer (e.g., hospitals), the local public health unit and VSL should be notified of the temperature excursion. Upon completion of the vaccine stability assessment, the PHU will r eport the outcome via email to the VSL Unit using the following the reporting format in Appendix A . The VSL unit will notify the NOC to advise of the incident, resolution, and any impact on provincial vaccination efforts . Temperature excursion reporting when vaccine has been in the custody of a hospital or public health unit : Facilities storing the COVID -19 vaccine should undertake the following if the vaccine storage units ( e.g., purpose- built, insulated container(s)) were unable to maintain the required temperatures (temperature excursion): When using two or more temperature monitoring devices/systems, determine which will be designated as the primary device/system ; o Record the maximum, minimum and current temperature and download any data from the storage unit or data logger and save as a PDF file ; o Download the PDF file to a computer from the data logger ; o Save this file using standardized file format naming , including the vaccine product, location and date (e.g., Templog_Pfizer_UHN_12 -14-2020; Templog_Moderna_WECHU_12 -25-2020). In the event that two or more temperature monitoring devices/systems are used, do not average or round the temperature data points. When submitting temperature data, ensure that data from the primary device/system is identified. Contact your local public health unit to rep ort the excursion through your normal process. Public h ealth units should have an established process in place to deal with temperature excursions after hours and on weekends to ensure that vaccine is not held in quarantine for an extended period of time. 13 | Page Email or fax the public health unit the following: o The date, time, temperatures (maximum, minimum and current temperature) and the details on the excursion (e.g. , length of time) ; and o Attach the PDF file . The public health unit will contact the primary man ufacturer contact as well as copy the NOC while initiat ing the Adverse Storage Conditions form with the facility . The public health unit will notify the VSL Unit once the vaccine manufacturer/primary contact has been contacted to alert the ministry of the cold chain incident . Once recommendations from the manufacturer have been received, the public health unit will f ollow -up with the facility to provide recommendations , education and necessary remediation . The public health unit will report the outcome via email to the VSL Unit using the reporting format in Appendix A. The VSL unit will notify the NOC to advise of the incident, resolution, and any impact on provincial vaccination efforts. The facility storing the vaccine will mark vaccines involved in a temperature excursion incident that have been determined to be usable, in order to id entify them in case of a future exp osure(s) . Dispose of any unusable/wasted vaccines, as direct ed by the public health unit. Public health units are to ensure that any wastage is documented in COVax ON. Stabilizing Temperatures in New and Repaired Purpose -built Vaccine Storage Units For repaired vaccine storage units that experienced a power outage, the vaccine temperatures sh ould be stabilized within the recommended temperature range as specified by the manufacturer prior to placing vaccine back into the unit; and Prior to storing vaccine in new purpose- built storage units , the temperatures should be stabilized within the recommended range as per the manufacturer . Monitor and document minimum and maximum temperatures for 2 to 7 consecutive days to ensure storage unit stability is appropriate for vaccine storage. 14 | Page Recei pt of Vaccine This information relates to the receipt of vaccine at storage sites as well as clinic sites that will be storing COVID -19 vaccine. When receiving the vaccine at storage sites or clinic sites that will be storing the COVID -19 vaccine, the receiving sites should: Designate one person as the lead for the facility who will be an authorized receiver of the vaccine delivery . This individual should ensur e that standard operating policies and procedures related to vaccine storage and handling are in place and are followed. Designate and train alternate(s) to be responsible for the above if the lead is not available. The alternate(s) should be trained in routine and emergency policies and procedures related to vaccine storage and handling . Ensure that respo nsible staff are adequately trained and have knowledge of the requirements for vaccine storage and handling, product sensitivities, storage equipment, temperature monitoring devices, and inventory management procedures . Use the Vaccine Storage Handling Guidelines , 2021 (or as current) to educate and instruct health care providers who store publicly funded vacci nes. Ensure that designated and trained staff or their alternate(s): o Are available to receive and store vaccines when they are expected to arrive; o Never leave vaccines in a shipping container, unpacked or unattended; o Understand that vaccine deliveries require immediate attention . Immediately open all of the transport containers and assess the digital temperature monitoring device(s) . o Products should be quarantined until all necessary steps have been completed to confirm successful transport (e.g., temperature during transport, condition of product received). Examine the shipment for evidence of damage . Quarantine the product immediately if damaged. See section below on Prod uct Damage . The staff person who received the vaccine is responsible for : 15 | Page o Document ing their name, the date and time of receipt of the vaccines and signing the manifest to acknowledge the receipt of the vaccine s; o Unpack ing the shipment and placing the vaccines immediately in the appropriate storage unit; o Reviewing the order against the packing slip(s) to confirm that the order is correct; o Receiv ing and recor ding the vaccine s into inventory for use if the digital temperature monitoring device(s) indicates that the cold chain was maintained during shipping (e.g. , +2oC to +8oC); o In the event of a temperature excursion, follow the Temperature Excursion process in this document . Check vaccine expiry dates regularly and after every vaccine order. o Move vaccines with shorter expiry dates to the front of the refrigerator so that they can be used first ; o Check expiry dates before vaccine s are u sed; o Remove expired vaccines and dispose of them appropriately (see Appendix C ). Record as wastage in COVax ON (see Vaccine Wastage and Returns section below). Preparation for Immunization Clinics Just in Time Vaccine Delivery Ensure that only the number of doses of the vaccine needed for the clinic are removed from the storage unit to prevent unnecessary or accidental wastage . Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccine s should be transported frozen and thawed at the clinic location according to manufacturer specifications and stored at +2 oC to +8oC prior to dilution (if required). Be sure to mark and keep track of the date and time of delivery using a system that works for your st aff. Monitor and record temperature readings in the vaccine refrigerator or insulated container: o Before leaving the main storage facility with the insulated container; o Upon arrival at the clinic location w ithin the building prior to starting the immunization clinic; 16 | Page o Each time the cooler is opened and at least every hour during the immunization clinic ; o Before and after breaks , i.e., lunch breaks; and o Upon completion of the clinic . Visually inspect the digital temperature moni tor ing device each time the insulated container is opened . Minimize the number of times that the insulated container is opened during the immunization clinic . Upon arrival at the main storage facility after the immunization clinic : o Place t he vaccine into inventory for use if the digital temperature monitoring device(s) indicates that the temperature was maintained within the vaccine manufacturer -sp ecified time range during the clinic and transport; and o Place the vaccine under quarantine in th e vaccine storage unit if the digital temperature monitoring device(s) indicates an out- of-ra nge reading and immediately assess the temperature excursion incident. All cold chain incidents need to be reported to the local public he alth unit . Vaccine Wastage and Returns Vaccine doses wasted due to any of the following reasons are not to be returned to the local public health unit /the Ontario Government Pharmaceutical and Medical Supply Service ( OGPMSS ) and should be disposed of according to local, provincial and/or federal regulations (see Appendix C ). However , they should be recorded in COVax ON as wastage: o Defective product(s); o Insufficient dose(s) from a single/multi vial; o Dose(s) remaining in a multi -dose o Suspected vaccine contamination; o Unused pre -drawn syringe(s); o Vaccine administration issue(s); o Vaccine stor age temperature excursion(s) at clinic; o Refrozen vaccine( s) after being thawed; 17 | Page o Punctured/reconstituted vaccine(s) not used within 6 hours; o Reconstituted frozen vial(s) left at room temperature beyond manufacturer specifications o Vial(s) left at room temperature beyond 12 hour s; o Stored in ULT/freezer temperatures beyond expiry date; o Stored in refrigerated temperatures (+2oC to +8oC) beyond manufacturer guidelines . When Product is Damaged In the event of potential damage to the vaccine either during transport or while on site (e.g., damage to the shipping container, a box/tray of vaccine s or vial (s), box with vaccine vials dropped) the following steps should be followed : Quarantine the impacted product and contact the manufacturer/primary contact . If outside hours of operation, the PHU should email per below and copy the NOC. If the damage occurs during initial transport to the site or if product is damaged during storage or handling on site and doses are wasted based on recommendation from manufacturer, notify the VSL Unit and report the outcome based on recommendation from the manufacturer via email to the VSL Unit using the following the reporting format in Appendix A . The VSL unit will notify the NOC to advise of the incident, resolution, and any impact on provincial vaccination efforts. Onward Transport of COVID -19 Vaccines beyond the Initial Point of Delivery For this document , transport refers to taking the vaccine from one site to another using a vehicle on ground , air or water. Walking the vaccine (e.g., within a facility, between adjacent buildings on a campus) is not considered transport when it is for a short period (i.e. , up to 15 minutes). This document provides a range of options related to the transport and movement of the vaccine. The operational plan should be tailored to local circumstances, with collaboration among the hospitals and public health units. If possible, ai r and water transport should be done in a frozen state. 18 | Page For ground transport at +2oC to +8oC only : If applicable, i t is recommended that the vaccine is packaged for delivery in a frozen state to be transported to the clinic/facility location using an insulated cooler (e.g., Playmate), that has been preconditioned to a refrigerated temperature of +2oC to +8oC. In this state, the unopened vaccine vials should be in transport for no more than 12 hours of cumulative time . Product should be sent for 'just in time use' as part of a planned vaccination clinic versus movement for secondary storage at another facility. Once diluted (if applicable) , transportation is recommended in syringe to prevent agitation of the product in an opened vial. This should only be compl eted when necessary for vaccination and not part of routine practices. It is recommended that the vaccine is only transport ed at +2 oC to +8oC once . Under except ional circumstances , based on a risk assessment , the vaccine may be transported at +2oC to +8oC more than once if and per normal process ensure the following : o The cold chain has been properly monitored and documented; o The c umulative total travel time does not exceed 12 hours and is properly documented ; o There is documentation that captures details at the individual vial level (e.g., labels on vials); o Vials are packed in order to minimize movement and agitation . Repacking should be done in a 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C environment whenever possible. Otherwise, time at room temp erature should be tracked and minimized to stay within the 2 -hour allowance for room temperature. If applicable, transport diluents with their corresponding vaccine (in separate containers due to unique storage requirements) so there are always equal amounts of v accines and diluents for reconstitution. Diluent storage and handling requirements should always be adhered to by Points of Distribution when transporting and redistributing. 19 | Page General Precautions for Frozen and Liquid State Transport of the Vaccine The vaccine should be handled with care and protected as much as possible from shocks, drops, vibration, etc. The transport container should be labe lled prominently with \"Fragile: Handle with Care, Do Not Drop\" cautionary statements. Vials should be stored in an upright position (i.e., standing up) during transport . The transport containers should be secured (strapped/braced) when being transported to prevent unnecessary movement. The vaccine should be protected from being dropped. Any set of cartons/vials should not be subject to repeated instances of transport , except under exceptional circumstances as noted above. If a carton/vial has been on a transfer once, it should not be sent out again and instead be used at the site , even if the vial has not been in transit for the maximum allowable period. This is a precautionary measure since it will be difficult to keep track of the transportation time \"used up\" for any specific vial. The vaccine should be transported staff who are trained in the transport of vaccine or other products requiring cold chain monitoring. The use of courier companies can be considered, but the y should specialize in cold chain transport (e.g., bonded and contracted companies). The courier should have systems in place for tracking and monitoring vaccine s and the ability to deliver the vaccines to preven t excessive movement o r agitation . The F ollowing R ecommendations are to be C onsidered for the O nward Distribution of Unopened V ials of COVID -19 Vaccine: Transport containers should be packed as per th e recommend ations /specifications for the container (e.g., credo cubes, stirling coolers) . Follow the configuration in Appendix B: Instructions on How to Pre -Condition and Pack an Insulated Container . Transport in the largest configuration wherever possible (e.g., box), avoiding individual vial distribution, while considering the minimum number of doses needed at the onwards location to avoid wastage. 20 | Page Preve nt movement in the cooler by surrounding it with dunnage (padding material) inside the container to minimize product movement during transport. If transport is conducted at vial level, the vial should be placed in insulation and bubble wrap or similar padd ing to protect the product (e.g., wrap the vial in bubble wrap and place it into a medication/pill bottle). Keep the vaccine vials upright. Protect the vaccine vials from light. Label the cooler as \"Fragile: Handle with Care, Do Not Drop\" and indicate that the contents are temperature sensitive. The pack out should be secured in the vehicle so that it does not move around. As much care as possible should be taken to minimize extra movement in the thawed state. The vaccine should be protected from being dropped. Never place the cooler in the trunk of a vehicle. The temperature should be maintained and recorded for the duration of the transport per temperature range) , ensuring that the transportation locations, dates and times, including the duration of time in transit are recorded. o A data logger or minimum -maximum thermometer should be used to monitor temperatures. o Download the data logger/record minimum -maximum temperatures as soon as possible to ensure no \"unwitnessed\" excursions occurred while in transit. Upon receipt, the vaccine should be inspected, inventoried and immediately placed into vaccine fridge, noting the date and time of the vaccine delivery on the storage unit temperature log. If the vaccine is to be used for a vaccination clinic immediately then the vaccine should be prepared and used as per the manufacturer's specifications. Do not transport the vaccine at room temperature. Do not refreeze previously frozen vaccine. In exceptional circumstances, when transporting a syringe containing a COVID -19 vaccine , the following parameters should be considered and adhered to: A single dose of vaccine should be transported in a syringe. 21 | Page Special attention should be paid to handling and packaging of the syring e to prevent contamination. The syringe should be protected from light. There should be a tamper evident seal on the pre- drawn syringe or container during transport between locations. The pre- drawn syringes and the container should be labeled, identifying information to prevent errors during storage, dispensing, transport, and use. Container and pre -drawn labeling components should include: o Name and dosage of vaccine o Facility name and phone number o Quantity of syringes o The exact beyond -use date and time (i.e ., 6 hours from when the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine vial was first punctured) o Lot number o Initials of preparer The syringe should be packed appropriately in a conditioned cooler (transport container) at +2 oC to +8oC and the temperature monitored during transpo rt. o Note: The vaccine in the syringe can be at ambient temperature, maximum of + 25 oC. The vaccine should not be at a temperature below +2oC. A barrier of bubble wrap or corrugated cardboard (at least 1 inch) may be utilized as a barrier between ice packs and the container with pre -drawn syringes. This is to prevent direct contact between pre -drawn syringes and the cooling agent that may cause the vaccine to freeze or deviate from appropriate cold chain. The syringe should be packed to cushion it and to protect it from agitation Remaining transportation time of COVID -19 vaccine = Maximum a llowable transportation time - (transportation time in vial + transportation time in syringe ) A designated staff member or specialized courier in cold chain transpor t (e.g., bonded and contracted companies) should be used to transport the syringe. The cooler/transport container should be: o Handled with care and protected from shocks, drops and vibration. 22 | Page o Labeled prominently with \"Fragile: Handle with care, Do Not Drop\" cautionary statements. o Secured (strapped/braced) during transport. An appropriate chain of custody should be in place for the syringe during all phases of transport. If the information regarding the beyond use date and total transport time, or the tamper evident seal, or ability to track the syringe in any way is in question, the vaccine should not be administered and documented as wasted. Upon receipt of the syringe, it should be visually inspected to confirm that the full dose remains, there is no damage and that there are no particulates or discolouration. If the syringe(s) will not be administered by staff from the originating site, the originating site should confirm with the receiving site all details of the transport, as per above, plus confir mation that administration will be completed at the receiving site by onsite personnel. Accessing Additional Dose(s) from Vaccine Vials This section applies to vaccines authorized by Health Canada and the details on doses contained in the Canadian product monographs. If foreign product is brought into Canada, then the section would apply to the volume of doses for the product as authorized by Health Canada. Additional Dose(s) from a Single Vial of COVID -19 Vaccine It is recommended that if an additional dose(s) of vaccine can be withdrawn from a single vial that it is administered as a valid dose and recorded accordingly in COVax ON or other specified documentation. Appropriate documentation of the source of these doses needs to be kept for tracking purpos es. If available, the use of a 1 mL low dead space syringe is recommended for administration. A 1 mL low dead space syringe increases the likelihood of obtaining an additional dose(s) of vaccine from a single vial. A 3 mL syringe can be used if the syringe has 0.1 mL graduations. 23 | Page Accessing Multiple Vials to Complete a Dose of COVID -19 Vaccine As an interim measure during time s of limited COVID -19 vaccine supply , additional dose s of COVID -19 vaccine may be extracted from up to 3 vials of the same vacci ne using aseptic technique. Although this is not routine practice for multi -dose vials of vaccines for other diseases, there are benefits to extracting additional doses when supply is low and COVID -19 case counts are significant . Every effort should be made to withdraw the entire residual volume from one vial, before entering the next vial. The antigenicity and, therefore, efficacy of the vaccine is not affected by accessing multiple vials to obtain an additional dose. Aseptic technique refers to the manner of handling, preparing, and storing medications and injection equipment/supplies (e.g., syringes, needles) to prevent microbial contamination and infections. This would mean preparing vaccines in a clean, designated medication area away from where vaccination is occurring and away from any potentially contaminated items. This is to prevent inadvertent contamination of the vial through direct or indirect contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment. Extracting an additional dose from up to 3 vials of the same vaccine only should be undertaken according to the following: Follow meticulous aseptic technique when accessing the vaccine vials to prevent contamination. Ensure that all of the vaccine vials accessed to ex tract an additional dose of vaccine are from the same vaccine lot (i.e., ha ve the same lot numbers). To minimize the risk of contamination never use the same diluent vial more than once. Make sure to discard any remaining saline in the diluent vial in a sharps container . Combine vaccine from vials with residual volume only, (i.e., not full vials or those with a complete dose) and do not save up vials until the end of the clinic before combining for extra dose. The different vials accessed have been under the same vaccine storage and handling conditions, for example: o This should only be done where there is a dedicated and skilled person (e.g., pharmacist, pharmacy tech) drawing up the vaccine. o Training should be in place per above and for related practices and techniques for proper vaccine storage and handling given the fragile 24 | Page nature of these vaccine products and timing for use (e.g., appropriate labeling and \"must use by dating/ timing\"). o Appro priate documentation of the source of these doses needs to be kept for tracking purposes . It is important that if these practices are employed, special attention is paid to the recommendations and parameters above to ensure the safety, efficacy and integri ty of the vaccine and to avoid the risk of contamination as these vaccines do not contain preservatives. This includes appropriate documentation and labelling, including inventory adjustments in COVax ON for the additional doses. 25 | PageAppendix A: Contact Information and Reporting Format for Temperature Excurisons or Damaged Products Organization Primary Contact Secondary Contact Hours of Operation Pfizer Custom er Service CanadaCSVaccine@pfiz er.com 09:00 - 17 :00 EST (M-F) Reporting Format If the vaccine undergoes a temperature excursion or is damaged, the PHU should email the VSL Unit using the following the reporting format : Date of Incident Vaccine Delivery Site (VDS) Location Vaccine name Vaccine lot number26 | PageExpiry date or manufacture d ate Number of doses impacted Manufacturer Recommendations Wastage (number of doses or indicate no wastage) Impact on local vaccination efforts Subject Examples: oDelivery Temp Excursion Report oFPT Delivery Temp Excursion Report oCOVID -19 Vaccine Damage Report If the request is urgent, include 'URGENT' in the email subject line .

Freezing episodes can happen very easily in all types of coolers, usually in the first 2 hours after packing. Pre-chill the insulated container prior to use by placing preconditioned icepacks inside the insulated container for at least 1 hour. After the hour, remove all icepacks. Placing the cooler in the refrigerator overnight can facilitate the pre - conditioning process. Pre-condition icepacks. Vaccines are vulnerable to freezing when transported in an insulated container if icepacks have not been correctly conditioned. Icepacks come out of the freezer at a temperature of approximately - 20 oC. Keeping the icepacks at room temperature for a period of time allows the ice at the core of the icepack to rise to 0oC. This process is called \"conditioning\". An icepack is adequately conditioned as soon as beads of water cover its surface. The conditioning process takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Prepare your temperature monitoring device. Ensure all other items necessary to pack the insulated container are ready and easily accessible, including pre -conditioned ice blankets at +2 oC to +8oC. 28 | PagePacking an Insulated Container Fro m the ministry's Vaccine St orage Handling Guidelines , 2021. 29 | Page Appendix C: Vaccine Vial and Packaging Disposal Vials , either empty or with vaccine remaining, should be disposed of per regulation and guidelines by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change: o Environmental Protection Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
