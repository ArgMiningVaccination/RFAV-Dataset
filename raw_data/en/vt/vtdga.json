While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. This supplement has been used in connection with the following health conditions: |Used for||Why| | | 3 Stars Colic Consult a qualified healthcare practitioner | | Research suggests probiotics may benefit babies with colic who are breast-fed or fed milk-based formula. In a double-blind study of infants, supplementation of a standard milk-based formula with probiotic organisms (Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus) significantly reduced the frequency of colic, compared with the same formula without the probiotics. Another double-blind study found that the probiotic preparation, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, was an effective treatment for colic in exclusively breast-fed infants. In another study, L.reuteri DSM 17938 taken once a day was significantly more effective than simethicone, a drug frequently used to treat colic. Other double-blind research has confirmed the benefit of probiotics (particularly L.reuteri DSM 17938) in infants with colic. | | 3 Stars Constipation Amount depends on the probiotic strain used | | Research has shown that the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota may help relieve chronic constipation after two weeks of supplementation. In one double-blind study, 70 people (average age, 44 years) with chronic constipation were randomly assigned to receive 65 ml/day of a probiotic beverage or placebo for four weeks. The probiotic beverage provided daily at least 6.5 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus casei Shirota. The treatment group began showing statistically significant improvements at the end of the second week. At the end of the treatment period, the proportion of patients having moderate or severe constipation was 34% in the active-treatment group and 83% in the placebo group. Another double-blind trial found that a probiotic supplement taken for 4 weeks significantly increased bowel movement frequency in adults with constipation. The product used in that study provided 200 million colony-forming units of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 per day, and was taken twice a day after meals. | | 3 Stars Irritable Bowel Syndrome Refer to label instructions | | A daily drink containing probiotics significantly reduced IBS symptoms in one study. In several double-blind trials, probiotic products have been found to relieve symptoms of IBS. Preparations that have been found to be effective include 1) a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07; and 4) a product known as VSL#3 | | 3 Stars Tooth Decay Add 5 to 10 x 105 CFU per ml to milk or formula | | Supplementing with probiotics may inhibit cavity-causing bacteria. In a double-blind study of children aged 1 to 6 years, supplementation with Lactobacillus GG five days a week in milk for seven months reduced the incidence of cavities by 49%, compared with unsupplemented milk. The amount of Lactobacillus added to the milk was 5 to 10 x 105 CFU per ml.In another study, supplementing with Lactobacillus reuteri strain ATCC 55730 (derived from breast milk) significantly decreased the number of children who had dental cavities at 9 years of age. The probiotic was given in the amount of 108 colony-forming units per day to the mother during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, and then to the infant in the same daily amount during the first year of life. | | 3 Stars Type 2 Diabetes 7 billion CFU or more of a mix of probiotic strains daily | | Probiotics can improve blood glucose control, as well as cholesterol and triglyceride levels, in people with type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key player in regulating immune and metabolic functions in the body, and a growing body of research suggests probiotics may be beneficial to people with type 2 diabetes. Multiple clinical trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have shown that probiotic supplements can have a positive impact on blood glucose control, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. One review reported the best evidence is for supplements with multiple strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis, taken in amounts of 7 billion or more colony forming units (CFU) for six to 12 weeks. | | 3 Stars Vaginitis Apply a daily topical preparation or a suppository containing live culture | | A topical preparation or suppository containing live Lactobacillus acidophilus may help relieve symptoms and prevent recurrent infections. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a strain of friendly bacteria that is an integral part of normal vaginal flora. Lactobacilli help maintain the vaginal microflora by preventing overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria and Candida. Lactobacilli produce lactic acid, which acts like a natural antibiotic. These friendly bacteria also compete with other organisms for the utilization of glucose. The production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide by lactobacilli also helps to maintain the acidic pH needed for healthy vaginal flora to thrive. Most of the research has used yogurt containing live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus or the topical application of such yogurt or Lactobacillus acidophilus into the vagina. The effective amount of acidophilus depends on the strain used, as well as on the concentration of viable organisms. Vaginal application of a proprietary Lactobacillus acidophilus preparation may help bacterial vaginitis. In one trial, 80% of women with bacterial vaginitis who used the preparation were either cured or experienced marked improvement in symptoms. In another trial, application of a vaginal capsule containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus reduced the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis. The treatment was given for 7 consecutive days, and then after 7 days off was given for another 7 days. In another trial, women who were predisposed to vaginal Candida Two specific strains of lactobacillus (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14) have been found to be effective against bacterial vaginosis when taken orally. In a double-blind study, supplementation with a capsule containing 10 billion of each of these organisms twice a day for 30 days increased the cure rate from antibiotic therapy to 88%, compared with a 40% cure rate in the group receiving antibiotics alone. | | 3 Stars Yeast Infection 3 capsules or 1/4 tsp powder, taken by mouth three times daily, or use powder in douche or vaginal suppositories daily | | Supplementing with probiotics may prevent the overgrowth of yeast organisms. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a species of friendly bacteria that is an integral part of normal vaginal flora. Lactobacilli help to maintain the vaginal ecosystem by preventing the overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria and Candida. Lactobacilli produce lactic acid, which acts like a natural antibiotic. Lactobacillus acidophilus can be taken orally in the form of acidophilus yogurt, or in capsules or powder. It can also be administered vaginally. In a controlled trial, women who consumed 8 ounces of Lactobacillus acidophilus-containing yogurt per day had a threefold decrease in the incidence of vaginal yeast infections and a reduction in the frequency of Candida colonization in the vagina. In another trial, women who were predisposed to vaginal Candida infection because they were Many women find relief using an acidophilus-containing yogurt douche daily for a few days or weeks, depending on the severity of the infection. Three capsules of acidophilus or one-quarter teaspoon of powder can be taken orally one to three times daily. Acidophilus can also be taken preventively during antibiotic use to reduce the risk of Candida vaginitis. | | 2 Stars Allergies and Sensitivities and Food Allergies 2.6 billion organisms per day for infants | | Probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG may improve digestion in people with food allergies, helping the intestinal tract control allergen absorption and changing immune system responses to foods. Probiotics may be important in the control of food allergies because of their ability to improve digestion, by helping the intestinal tract control the absorption of food allergens and/or by changing immune system responses to foods. One group of researchers has reported using probiotics to successfully treat infants with food allergies in two trials: a double-blind trial using Lactobacillus GG bacteria in infant formula, and a preliminary trial giving the same bacteria to nursing mothers. Probiotics may also be important in non-allergy types of food intolerance caused by imbalances in the normal intestinal flora. | | 2 Stars Athletic Performance Fermented milk containing 6.5 billion live Lactobacillus casei Shirota organisms, twice a day for 16 weeks | | In a double-blind trial, supplementation with a probiotic preparation reduced the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections in training athletes during the winter. In a double-blind trial, supplementation with a probiotic preparation reduced the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections in training athletes during the winter. The product used in the study was fermented milk that contained 6.5 billion live Lactobacillus casei Shirota organisms, given twice a day for 16 weeks. Further research is needed to determine whether other probiotic strains would have the same effect. | | 2 Stars Canker Sores Apply powdered culture topically several times daily and orally take 1.5 billion colony-forming units two times daily | | Topical and/or oral use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus may help people with recurrent canker sores. According to preliminary reports, some people with recurrent canker sores may respond to topical and/or oral use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. However, a double-blind study found no effect of acidophilus bacteria on the healing time of canker sores. | | 2 Stars Common Cold (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium 1,010 colony-forming units per day for the combination | | In a double-blind study conducted in China, children who received probiotics for six months had a significantly lower incidence of cold symptoms compared with children who received a placebo. In a double-blind study conducted in China, children who received probiotics for six months had a significantly lower incidence of cold symptoms compared with children who received a placebo. The product used in this study was Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (1,010 colony-forming units per day), animalis subsp lactis Bi-07 (a total of 1,010 colony-forming units per day for the combination). | | 2 Stars Common Cold and Sore Throat Refer to label instructions | | Daily supplementation with a probiotic may decrease the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in children. In a double-blind trial, daily supplementation with Lactobacillus GG (a probiotic organism) for 3 months decreased the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections by 34% in children attending daycare centers. Another double-blind trial found that a probiotic preparation taken for 3 months during the winter decreased the incidence of common infectious diseases in children aged 3-7 years. The product used in that study with a probiotic preparation daily for 2 weeks at the first sign of illness of a household member was shown in another double-blind trial to decrease the duration and severity of subsequent acute respiratory infections in members of the same household. The product used in that study contained Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 (NCIMB 30333) and Bifidobacterium lactis UABLA-12. | | Crohn's Disease At least 250 mg of Saccharomyces boulardii taken three times per day | | In double-blind research, diarrhea caused by Crohn's disease has partially responded to supplementation with the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii. In double-blind research, | | 2 Stars Diverticular Disease Refer to label instructions | | In a double-blind study of patients with diverticular disease in remission, supplementing with a probiotic significantly decreased the number of people who suffered a recurrence of symptoms or a flare-up of acute diverticulitis. In a double-blind study of patients with diverticular disease in remission, supplementing with a probiotic significantly decreased the number of people who suffered a recurrence of symptoms or a flare-up of acute diverticulitis. The probiotic used in the study contained 24 billion Lactobacillus casei subsp. DG organisms, and was taken the first 10 days of each month for 12 months. It is not known whether other probiotic strains would have the same beneficial effect. | | 2 Stars Eczema 10 billion colony-forming units daily of lactobacillus-type bacteria | | Pregnant women and newborns who take probiotic supplements may reduce risk of eczema in early life. A double-blind trial reported that use of a hypoallergenic infant formula plus probiotics (500 million organisms of Lactobacillus GG bacteria per gram of formula, taken for one month) initially led to improvement in eczema symptoms in infants with suspected | | 2 Stars Gingivitis Refer to label instructions | | In two double-blind studies, the use of probiotic lozenges resulted in a modest improvement in certain measures of periodontal disease. In a double-blind study of patients with chronic periodontal disease (periodontitis), use of probiotic lozenges resulted in modest improvement in certain measures of periodontal disease (a decrease in pocket depth and an improvement in attachment), when compared with a placebo. The product used in the study contained 2 different strains of Lactobacillus reuteri (Prodentis; BioGaia, Lund, Sweden); one lozenge was dissolved in the mouth twice a day (after tooth brushing) for 12 weeks. These findings were confirmed in a second double-blind trial. | | 2 Stars Halitosis Refer to label instructions | | Preparations and gums containing probiotics have shown some promise for improving halitosis. In a preliminary trial, treatment with a probiotic preparation significantly improved halitosis by about 33%. The preparation used in the study was a tablet containing Lactobacillus salivarius strain WB21 and 280 mg of xylitol. One tablet was taken 3 times per day for 2 to 4 weeks. In a double-blind trial, use of a probiotic-containing chewing gum twice a day for 2 weeks significantly improved halitosis in people with self-reported bad morning breath. The gum used in this study contained 100 million colony-forming units each of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteri ATCC PTA 5289 per piece. | | 2 Stars Hay Fever Refer to label instructions | | In one trial, supplementing with Bifidobacterium longum strain BB536 during the pollen season significantly decreased symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, nasal blockage. In a double-blind trial, supplementation with a specific probiotic strain (Bifidobacterium longum strain BB536) during the pollen season significantly decreased symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, nasal blockage, compared with a placebo. | | 2 Stars HIV and AIDS Support Take under medical supervision: 1 gram three times per day of Saccharomyces boulardii for diarrhea | | In one trial, Saccharomyces boulardii helped stop diarrhea in HIV-positive people. In a double-blind trial, the non-disease-causing yeast Saccharomyces boulardii (1 gram three times per day) helped stop | | 2 Stars Immune Function 10 billion colony-forming units a day of acidophilus or bifidobacteria-only for intestinal infections | | Probiotics help stimulate the intestine's immune system and slow the growth of infectious organisms. Supplements of probiotics (friendly bacteria) such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, or the growth factors that encourage their development in the gastrointestinal tract may help protect the body from harmful organisms in the intestine that cause local or systemic | | 2 Stars Infection Consult a qualified healthcare practitioner | | Lactobacillus acidophilus produces acids that kill invading bacteria. These and other probiotics inhibit the growth of potentially infectious organisms and have been shown to be effective against some infections. Lactobacillus acidophilus (the friendly bacteria found in yogurt) produces acids that kill invading bacteria. The effective amount of acidophilus depends on the strain used, as well as the concentration of viable organisms. These and other friendly bacteria known as probiotics inhibit the growth of potentially infectious organisms (pathogens) by producing acids, hydrogen peroxide, and natural antibiotics called bacteriocins and microcins, by utilizing nutrients needed by pathogens, by occupying attachment sites on the gut wall that would otherwise be available to pathogens, and by stimulating immune attacks on pathogens. Infections that have been successfully prevented or treated with friendly bacteria include infectious | | 2 Stars Liver Cirrhosis Refer to label instructions | | A probiotic preparation called VSL#3, which contains 8 different strains of beneficial bacteria, has been shown to improve the impaired mental and neurological function that is commonly seen in people with cirrhosis. A probiotic preparation called VSL#3, which contains 8 different strains of beneficial bacteria, has been shown to improve the impaired mental and neurological function (minimal hepatic encephalopathy) that is commonly seen in people with cirrhosis.. It is not known whether other probiotic products would also be effective. Because people with severe illnesses such as cirrhosis could theoretically be harmed by supplementing with live bacteria, people with cirrhosis should only take probiotics under medical supervision. | | 2 Stars Metabolic Syndrome = 6.5 billion colony forming units (CFUs) daily | | Early research indicates probiotics have likely, though small, benefits on metabolic and cardiovascular health. There is increasing awareness of the importance of gut bacteria in regulating metabolism and inflammatory immune function, and growing evidence indicates a role for probiotics, as well as prebiotics (fibers that enhance growth of beneficial bacteria) and synbiotics (combinations of pro- and prebiotics) in preventing and treating metabolic syndrome. One placebo-controlled trial compared the effects of a multi-strain probiotic supplement and an inulin-based synbiotic supplement to placebo in 120 participants with pre-diabetes. Both the probiotic and synbiotic supplements reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome more effectively than placebo. A meta-analysis was performed using data from nine randomized controlled trials investigating the use of probiotics in subjects with metabolic syndrome. The trials used different species of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, at doses 6.5 billion colony forming units (CFUs), and lasted three to 12 weeks. Five of the trials reported small but statistically significant positive findings with regard to metabolic syndrome parameters such as body-mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, and lipid metabolism. In addition, certain probiotic strains appear to improve gut microbiome composition and reduce blood levels of inflammatory markers in people with metabolic syndrome. More research is needed to identify specific strains, optimal doses, and duration of treatment needed for probiotics to improve metabolic health. | | 2 Stars Pre- and Post-Surgery Health Refer to label instructions | | One meta-analysis found that the use of a probiotic or synbiotic (probiotic plus prebiotic) product around the time of surgery significantly decreased the incidence of severe infections following elective surgery. A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials found that the use of a probiotic or synbiotic (probiotic plus prebiotic) product around the time of surgery significantly decreased the incidence of severe infections following elective surgery. Consult a healthcare practitioner for information about what probiotic or synbiotic to use and when to start taking it. | | 2 Stars Ulcerative Colitis 10 to 600 billion colony-forming units per day of probiotic bacteria, or 250 mg of Saccharomyces boulardii three times daily | | Supplementing with probiotics has been shown to help people with ulcerative colitis. In preliminary and double-blind trials, a probiotic supplement (in this case, a non-disease-causing strain of Escherichia coli) was effective at maintaining remission in people with UC. In a double-blind trial, a combination probiotic supplement containing Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and a beneficial strain of Streptococcus has been shown to prevent pouchitis, a common complication of surgery for UC. People with chronic relapsing pouchitis received either 3 grams per day of the supplement or placebo for nine months. Eighty-five percent of those who took the supplement had no further episodes of pouchitis during the nine-month trial, whereas 100% of those receiving placebo had relapses within four months. Preliminary and double-blind research suggests that combination probiotic supplements may be effective at promoting recovery and preventing UC relapses as well. In a preliminary trial, people with UC significantly improved on a sugar-free, low-allergen diet with additional nutritional supplementation that included a | | 2 Stars Urinary Tract Infection 1 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, twice a day | | Double-blind research found that probiotics may help prevent UTI recurrence. In a double-blind study of postmenopausal women who had a history of recurrent UTIs, treatment with a probiotic preparation reduced the number of recurrences over a one-year period by 51%. The preventive effect of the probiotic was almost as great as that of an antibiotic (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and, unlike antibiotic treatment, probiotic therapy did not lead to the appearance of antibiotic- resistant bacteria. The preparation used in this study provided 1 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, and was taken twice a day for one year. Previous research has shown that this probiotic product is particularly effective for preventing genitourinary infections. Additional research is therefore needed to determine whether other probiotic strains would also help prevent UTIs. | | 2 Stars Vaginitis Take a supplement providing 10 billion of each twice per day | | Supplementing with probiotics may help prevent recurrences of bacterial or candidal vaginitis. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a strain of friendly bacteria that is an integral part of normal vaginal flora. Lactobacilli help maintain the vaginal microflora by preventing overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria and Candida. Lactobacilli produce lactic acid, which acts like a natural antibiotic. These friendly bacteria also compete with other organisms for the utilization of glucose. The production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide by lactobacilli also helps to maintain the acidic pH needed for healthy vaginal flora to thrive. Most of the research has used yogurt containing live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus or the topical application of such yogurt or Lactobacillus acidophilus into the vagina. The effective amount of acidophilus depends on the strain used, as well as on the concentration of viable organisms. Vaginal application of a proprietary Lactobacillus acidophilus preparation may help bacterial vaginitis. In one trial, 80% of women with bacterial vaginitis who used the preparation were either cured or experienced marked improvement in symptoms. In another trial, women who were predisposed to vaginal Candida Two specific strains of lactobacillus (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14) have been found to be effective against bacterial vaginosis when taken orally. In a double-blind study, supplementation with a capsule containing 1 billion of each of these organisms twice a day for 30 days increased the cure rate from antibiotic therapy to 88%, compared with a 40% cure rate in the group receiving antibiotics alone. In another double-blind trial, women with bacterial vaginosis received one capsule of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 (1 billion of each strain per capsule) twice a day or placebo for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, the percentage women who no longer had bacterial vaginosis was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (62% vs. 21%). Women with bacterial vaginosis should consult their doctor to determine whether these probiotic strains might be an effective alternative to antibiotics. | | 1 Star Chronic Candidiasis Refer to label instructions | | Lactobacillus acidophilus is a type of probiotic that appears to help re-establish proper intestinal flora and prevent yeast overgrowth. Lactobacillus acidophilus products are often used by people with candidiasis in an attempt to re-establish proper intestinal flora. Acidophilus produces natural factors that prevent the overgrowth of the yeast. Although there are no human trials, supplementation of acidophilus to immune-deficient mice infected with C. albicans produced positive effects on | | 1 Star Stress Refer to label instructions | | Probiotic supplements may help counteract stress's detrimental effect on the balance of intestinal bacteria. Stress is understood to have a detrimental effect on the balance of intestinal bacteria, but whether probiotic supplements improve the ability to handle stress is unknown. In a six-month preliminary trial, a [] How It Works How to Use It The amount of probiotics necessary to replenish the intestine varies according to the extent of microbial depletion and the presence of harmful bacteria. One to two billion colony forming units (CFUs) per day of acidophilus is considered to be the minimum amount for the healthy maintenance of intestinal microflora. Some Saccharomyces boulardii research has used 500 mg taken four times per day. Preliminary research suggests that combinations of probiotic strains are in some cases more effective than individual strains,\" but additional research is needed to confirm that possibility.8 Where to Find It Beneficial bacteria present in fermented dairy foods\u2014namely live culture yogurt\u2014have been used as a folk remedy for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Yogurt is the traditional source of beneficial bacteria. However, different brands of yogurt can vary greatly in their bacteria strain and potency. Some (particularly frozen) yogurts do not contain any live bacteria. Supplements in powder, liquid extract, capsule, or tablet form containing beneficial bacteria are other sources of probiotics. Possible Deficiencies People using antibiotics, eating a poor diet, or suffering from [ diarrhea ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1203008#hn-1203008-need-to-know) are more likely to have depleted colonies of friendly bacteria. Best Form to Take While there are many probiotic strains used in supplements, there have been relatively few comparison trials studying whether certain strains are more beneficial than others for a given condition (although, there have been numerous clinical trials showing a benefit for at least one type of strain). However, it does appear that, under normal conditions, different types of bacterial flora occupy different parts of the body, and some strains may have a beneficial effect in specific areas of the body. In addition, it is important to buy from reputable manufacturers, as some products have been found to contain much less bacteria than was stated on the label.9 [] Interactions Interactions with Supplements, Foods, & Other Compounds Acidophilus and bifidobacteria may manufacture [ B vitamins ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2922005#hn-2922005-uses), including niacin ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2926008#hn-2926008-uses), [ folic ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2809001#hn-2809001-uses), and [ vitamin B6 ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2928009#hn-2928009-uses).

Controlled studies have shown that taking probiotic microorganisms\u2014such as Lactobacillus boulardii\u2014helps prevent antibiotic-induced diarrhea. The diarrhea experienced by some people who take antibiotics also might be due to an overgrowth of the bacterium Clostridium difficile, which causes a disease known as pseudomembranous colitis. Controlled studies have shown that supplementation with harmless yeast\u2014such or brewer's yeast)\u2014helps prevent recurrence of this infection. In one study, taking 500 mg of Saccharomyces boulardii twice daily enhanced the effectiveness of the antibiotic vancomycin in preventing recurrent clostridium infection.
