Key points: - It's unclear if temporary visa holders would be included in Australia's vaccine rollout - Experts warn they could turn to unapproved products if they are excluded - Border Force has seized imports of ephedra and hydroxychloroquine Sellers had advertised the products \u2014 developed by Chinese state-owned enterprises Sinovac and Sinopharm \u2014 at 1,500 RMB ($300) for three doses and said it could be exported overseas in two weeks. The ads sparked widespread criticism on Weibo, another Chinese social media app, and comments with variations of the hashtag SellingVaccinesOnWeChatIsIllegal were viewed more than 20 million times. \"Using vaccine scams to make money is tantamount to murdering,\" a user with the nickname Huangfusuanxiaotou wrote on Weibo. \"Such vicious sellers should be charged, shamed and seriously punished,\" wrote another. Sinovac and Sinopharm both warned the public against the \"scam\", though they didn't clarify if the products sold on WeChat were authentic. It's not clear how many \u2014 if any \u2014 of the products were sold and the ads have since been removed from the Chinese social media app. Asked what measures Australia had in place to prevent the importation of illegal vaccines, an Australian Border Force spokesperson told the ABC that officers used various forms of resources and technology to detect items, including x-ray, detector dogs and intelligence. \"The ABF is well aware of the websites, particularly on the dark web, selling COVID-19 vaccines and medicines and has the capability to detect imports of these prohibited items from these sites,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should not assume purchases made online are invisible to authorities.\" However, there is concern that temporary residents may be driven to continue trying to buy unproven coronavirus medications online if they are excluded from [the Australian Government's promise to offer a vaccine to all Australian citizens](/news/2020-08-20/coronavirus-vaccine-mandatory-rules-anti-vaxxers/12575138). The ABF said it had seized nearly 70 kilograms of ephedra \u2014 a well-known plant species often used to manufacture the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen \u2014 since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese health authorities have claimed the substance was effective at easing symptoms of COVID-19. However, it is illegal to import the plant as it is a precursor for ephedrine, a critical ingredient used to make the drug methamphetamine. Additionally, the ABF detected more than 14,800 tablets of the [anti-malarial treatment medicine hydroxychloroquine](/news/2020-06-16/coronavirus-drug-pushed-donald-trump-hydroxychloroquine-pulled/12358554) between April and August. 'It could be washing powder' In Australia, vaccines are schedule 4 medicines which should be prescription only, according to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Under the act, the importation, manufacture, supply and export of unapproved vaccines are all considered criminal offences. Advertising a product to consumers as a vaccine is also strictly prohibited. Only government vaccination campaigns or the promotion of vaccination services are permitted, as long as they comply with specific requirements. \"The TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) rigorously assesses vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness before they can be legally supplied in Australia,\" a spokesperson for the TGA told the ABC. \"These are strict requirements because vaccines are routinely given to healthy people in large numbers.\" Lisa Nissen, professor and head of the School of Clinical Sciences at the Queensland University of Technology, said this process ensured Australians the country's vaccine programs were safe. She stressed that ordering vaccines online was very dangerous, as customers would have no way of knowing whether the product they received was what they actually ordered. \"It could be contaminated with poisonous substances, pesticides, heavy metals; it could be brick dust ... it could be washing powder,\" Professor Nissen said, adding that postal services wouldn't meet the temperature requirements needed to transport vaccines. \"So you could be administering something that's completely ineffective and dangerous by the time they've got here.\" Free vaccines needed for temporary residents The issue of illegal sales and imports of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is likely to persist due to insufficient support for temporary residents, according to Lennon Chang, a senior lecturer in criminal justice at Monash University. Australia has more than 1 million temporary visa holders, a figure that includes international students, backpackers, graduates, sponsored workers and refugees, among others. \"The criminals could make effective use of public panic, selling the products to temporary residents who had willingly put themselves at great risk for treatment that was accessible,\" Dr Chang told the ABC. He said language barriers and differences in national healthcare systems between Australia and Asia-Pacific countries meant temporary visa holders were sometimes reluctant to access professional medical care. \"When official messages can't be delivered to vulnerable groups accurately and sufficiently, people would seek alternatives in a way they can accept, for example, speak to Dr Google or Dr Social Media, but not their GPs,\" Dr Chang said. New research [conducted by the University of Technology Sydney and the University of New South Wales](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/social-affairs/new-research-reveals-suffering-temporary-migrants-during-covid-19-crisis) showed more than 40 per cent of temporary visa holders have skipped meals during the pandemic. One-third were facing homelessness or expected to be evicted in the near future as they could not pay rent. And while the Australian Government has said a coronavirus vaccine will be provided to Australians for free when available, it's not yet known if temporary residents will be included in that scheme. \"I think the Australian Government must think about how to encourage people who don't have Medicare to get vaccinated, even for illegal residents who are in fear of being deported if they seek help,\" Dr Chang said. Professor Nissen said figuring out a distribution plan before a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available could help address the issue, suggesting that pharmacies could be better placed to provide services to multicultural communities. She said concerns about the accessibility of the vaccines \"really highlighted that we're not doing enough to make information about health and healthcare as available to all parts of the community as we possibly could\". \"If you have migrant communities or small groups of communities that are located around pharmacies, they're often very aware of what the different demographic and language requirements are,\" Professor Nissen said. The Department of Health has been contacted for comment. [Ask "}
