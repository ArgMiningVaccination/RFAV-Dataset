A landmark text in mind/body health and seasonal nutrition, revised for the new millennium, with a new introduction, updated resources, and extended appendices. Makes seasonal recommendations for detoxification, diet, and exercise programs. Total quackary. The introduction, basics and conclusion are pure garbage. Astrology? Seriously? But that said, I do like the idea of paying attention to the seasons and how our body and mind need different things at different times of the year. So I will continue to keep it around and read each season as it comes. One of the very best books I've ever read about how to keep balance in the body during the different seasons of the year.... Very important to people living in places like minnesota who experience such extreme cycles. A natural health professional told me that this book was foundational for bringing Eastern medicine into the West. So it's somewhat of an overview of that. What I liked the most was having some suggestions of different things to eat at different times of year. As someone who struggles with what the heck to make for dinner, or even to remember to make or buy dinner, it's nice to have some guidelines. It eliminates some elements of decision-making in meal planning -- a plus! Everything he suggests is super healthy, so really, it's not a bad idea to eat it at any point during the year.

What I like about this book is that it blends Eastern healing traditions with those of the West. He relates winter to the Chinese Five Element System, provides suggestions for a seasonal diet, exercise, as well as herbs. In regards to integrative health and wellness I like Dr. Haas' approaches. From me this is ...suggested reading! One of my first books on holistic health, I turn to it frequently. By far his best book ever, Hass covers the body systems in relation to the seasons, and how to support health and maintain balance through the use of food, herbs, fitness, astrology and more. There is also an appendix with health charts and assessment tools for the practitioner. I love this book and recommend it highly! Great simple guide to understanding how the season impact out health and how we can work with the season to achieve optimal health. Also super helpful when studying Chinese Medicine. Give greater depth and explanation to the elements. "}
