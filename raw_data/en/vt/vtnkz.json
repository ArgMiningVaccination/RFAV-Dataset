With historical perspective, it is now evident to all but delusional ideologues that the war was an utter waste of human lives, economic resources, political capital and moral reserves. By the end, I concluded that war should be outlawed. In point of fact, war was outlawed ... in 1928. Say what? In their history of how this happened, [The Internationalists: How a Radical Plan to Outlaw War Remade the World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501109863/?tag=michaelshermer20-20) (Simon & Schuster, 2017), Yale University legal scholars Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro begin with the contorted legal machinations of lawyers, legislators and politicians in the 17th century that made war, in the words of Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, \"the continuation of politics by other means.\" Those means included a license to kill other people, take their stuff and occupy their land. Legally. How? [...] In this week's eSkeptic, Raymond Barglow discusses how the psychoanalytic tradition inaugurated by Sigmund Freud casts light on the mainsprings of human motivation and helps to explain human irrationality and encourage recovery. Why Freud Matters Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, and the Skeptical Humanist Tradition by Raymond Barglow \"A great part of my life's work has been spent to destroy my own illusions and those of humankind.\" \"What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.\" Over the past half century, some of Sigmund Freud's ideas have been debunked, and he personally has been exposed as a doctor who misunderstood and harmed a good number of his patients. [1](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/sigmund-freud-anna-freud-skeptical-humanist-tradition/#note01) I do not take exception to this evaluation. Especially during the years when he was building his career as a doctor, the founder of psychoanalysis deceived the public, if not himself, about the evidence for his views and his ability to cure. There is, however, another side to Freud's character and to his achievements that the critics overlook. Indeed I believe that Freud belongs up there in the pantheon of great skeptical humanists alongside Socrates, Voltaire, and Hume. Like them, Freud believed that reason could help people undo the hypocrisies and deceptions in their lives, permitting a recovery of sanity and a measure of happiness. [2](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/sigmund-freud-anna-freud-skeptical-humanist-tradition/#note02) As well, Freud's critics fail to recognize the contributions made over the past century by the psychoanalytic movement that he inaugurated. To make this second point, I'll review the accomplishments of Sigmund Freud's daughter Anna, whose role was pivotal in developing psychoanalysis in an open-minded, evidence-based way. Her work is a telling counterexample to the broad claim that psychoanalysis is an irrational theory and ineffective practice. [3](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/sigmund-freud-anna-freud-skeptical-humanist-tradition/#note03) Anna Freud and her colleagues not only observed assiduously, but also subjected the very concept of \"observation\" to scrutiny. When adults are observing and interacting with children, Anna Freud recognized, their perceptions may be clouded by their prior expectations: observers see what they wish to see and overlook or push aside everything else. Mistaking Our Own Motives Although Sigmund Freud's own professional conduct was marred by the prejudices of his time, some of his concepts do cast light on the sources and nature of human irrationality. Freud believed that the mind is influenced by unacknowledged motives and unspoken memories. And that belief informed not only his \"talking cure\" therapy but also his social activism on behalf of issues that ranged from free mental health care to the humane treatment of shell-shocked soldiers who had survived the First World War. Since the early 17th century when Rene Descartes penned his Meditations, rationalist philosophy had held that the human mind is unified and transparent to itself. Freud affirmed instead\u2014and this is the premise that still informs psychoanalysis today\u2014that humans are inclined, by nature and by nurture, to mistake their reasons for believing and acting. That we are fallible in this manner, mentally conflicted and influenced in ways that we only partly understand, is a condition that Freud found illustrated ubiquitously in dreams, slips of the tongue, religious beliefs, sexual preferences, and the foibles of our relationships with others. And he made this \"diagnosis\" of the human condition the basis for doing psychotherapy in a new way. [...] A NEW STORY! How C0nc0rdance Became a Card-Carrying Skeptic As we [announced a few weeks ago](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/17-10-18/) in eSkeptic, we asked several friends to tell us about those \"aha!\" moments that led to their becoming skeptical thinkers. As promised, here is another one of their incredible stories on YouTube. Enjoy! The creator of this video writes: \"Skepticism, to me, is the process by which I evaluate claims. It's not cynical, rejecting every idea that makes me uncomfortable. It's not credulous, accepting new ideas because they're edgy, counter-culture or popular. I try to apply the same process of empirical evidence-gathering, careful study, and rational argument to every aspect of my life, from the laboratory, to the Internet, to conversations with friends.\" TELL US YOUR STORY! Tell us your story and become a card-carrying skeptic! Thank you for being a part of our first 25 years.

JUNIOR SKEPTIC # 65 Ghost Ships Physically bound inside each and every issue of Skeptic magazine is Junior Skeptic: an engagingly illustrated science and critical thinking publication for younger readers (and the young at heart). Today we're leaving safe shores far behind, and sailing out over the waves in search of the sea's eeriest mysteries. Imagine the ocean at night, a thousand miles from the nearest city light. Imagine cold salt wind on your face, sails overhead, a creaking deck beneath your feet. Suddenly a shadow looms out of the darkness, masts and tattered sails silhouetted against the sky. Your crew shouts in alarm, spinning the wheel to avoid a collision. A strange ship slides by. It is silent and empty, without a living soul on board. Passing like a phantom, it vanishes into the night. What just happened? Can tales of ghost ships be explained? Let's find out! ROBERT TRIVERS' LECTURE The Evolutionary Genetics of Honor Killings This lecture, based on a ground-breaking study by one of the greatest evolutionary theorists since Charles Darwin, [Robert Trivers](https://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/robert-trivers), examines the curious case of honor killings, which seem to make no evolutionary sense\u2014why would a father kill his own daughter and thereby eliminate half of his own genes from propagating into the next generation? The answer is to be found in who, exactly, is committing these murders and why. In short, the vast majority of honor killings are conducted by fathers and uncles who murder young women who have been arranged to marry a first cousin but who have fallen in love with someone outside of the family. When Dr. Trivers did the genetic analysis he found his answer. This riveting talk by Dr. Trivers took place in Dr. Michael Shermer's Skepticism 101 course at Chapman University, filmed on Thursday November 16, 2017. The lecture was followed by a conversation between Dr. Trivers and Dr. Shermer, which will be released in a separate video at a later date.

The Pro-Truth Pledge An Effective Strategy for Skeptics to Fight Fake News and Post-Truth Politics by Gleb Tsipursky How do we get politicians to stop lying? How do we get private citizens to stop sharing fake news on social media? Deception proved such a successful strategy for political causes and individual candidates in the UK and US elections in 2016 that the Oxford English Dictionary named \"post-truth\" as its word of the year, with the definition of \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" The extensive sharing of fake news by private citizens led Collins Dictionary to choose \"fake news\" as its word of the year for 2017, meaning \"false, often sensational, information disseminated under the guise of news reporting.\" We are facing a nightmare scenario. For many years now, traditional gatekeepers for ensuring the veracity of public information\u2014news media, civic leaders, authorities on various topics\u2014have been trusted less and less. Social and digital media have only accelerated this trend, exemplifying the potential of technological disruption to undermine our democracy. Fortunately, if we can create a mechanism that differentiates the liars from the truth-tellers, we have a hope of protecting our democracy. At the same time, tilting the scale toward truth requires addressing the psychological factors that cause people to tolerate untruths. Using research from behavioral science research about what causes people to lie and what motivates them to tell the truth, a number of behavioral scientists (including myself) and concerned citizens have launched the Pro-Truth Pledge at [ProTruthPledge.org](https://www.protruthpledge.org/), which combines our knowledge of behavioral science with crowdsourcing to promote truth-oriented behavior. The pledge is meant for both public figures and private citizens to sign. So far, [thousands of private citizens](https://www.protruthpledge.org/pledgers-map/) across the globe and [several hundred public figures and organizations](https://www.protruthpledge.org/public-figures-signed-pledge/) signed it, including globally-known public intellectuals such as Jonathan Haidt, Steven Pinker, Peter Singer and Michael Shermer. You might be especially surprised that many dozens of politicians have signed it as well.

Michael Shermer is a beacon of reason in an ocean of irrationailty. UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens: What Science Says UFOs. Aliens. Strange crop circles. Giant figures scratched in the desert surface along the coast of Peru. The amazing alignment of the pyramids. Strange lines of clouds in the sky. Paranormal belief is alive and well in American. Donald Prothero and Tim Callahan explore why such demonstrably false beliefs thrive despite decades of education and scientific debunking. Employing the standards of scientific evidence, the authors discuss the reliability of eyewitness testimony, and the psychology of belief and conspiratorial thinking. The New Age: Notes of a Fringe Watcher The New Yorker calls it, \"Fair, witty appraisal of cranks, quacks, and quackeries of science and pseudoscience ... A very able and even-tempered presentation.\" This book is a classic of skeptical literature filled with thirty-three diverse chapters: a bountiful offering of the delightful drollery and horse sense that has made Martin Gardner the undisputed dean of the critics of pseudoscience. It is also a quick way to get up to speed on many topics. Gardner is not afraid to examine the process of critical examination itself. Climbing Mount Improbable A brilliant book celebrating improbability as the engine that drives life, by the acclaimed author of [The Selfish Gene](https://shop.skeptic.com/productlink/b123PB), [The Blind Watchmaker](https://shop.skeptic.com/productlink/b087PB), and [The God Delusion](https://shop.skeptic.com/productlink/b113HB). The human eye is so complex and works so precisely that it appears to be the product of design. How could such an intricate object have come about by chance? In writing that the New York Times called \"a masterpiece\"\u2014Richard Dawkins builds a carefully reasoned and illustrated argument for evolutionary adaptation as the mechanism for life on earth. Breaking the Spell In this New York Times Bestseller (and a definitive work on religion), Daniel Dennett (one of the \"Four Horsemen\" and a world-famous philosopher) asks: Is religion a product of blind evolutionary instinct or rational choice? Is it truly the best way to live a moral life? Ranging through biology, history, and psychology, Dennett charts religion's evolution from \"wild\" folk belief to \"domesticated\" dogma.

As is usually the case with such gun-related tragedies, within hours social media and political punditry was abuzz with talk of gun control and Second Amendment rights, with both the left and the right marshaling their data and arguments. The two most common arguments made in defense of gun ownership are (1) self protection and (2) as a bulwark against tyranny.

In this week's eSkeptic, Margret Schaefer reviews [Freud: The Making of an Illusion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1627797173/?tag=skepticcom20-20), in which its author, Frederick Crews, convincingly argues that Freud constructed psychoanalysis on a fraudulent foundation. How did Freud convince so many people of the correctness and the profundity of his theory? The Wizardry of Freud by Margret Schaefer \"Clear evidence of falsification of data should now close the door on this damaging claim.\" The above is from a 2011 British Medical Journal article about Andrew Wakefield, the British physician whose \"discovery\" of a link between vaccination and autism fueled a world wide anti-vaccination movement. Since its publication in 1998, the paper's results were contradicted by many reputable scientific studies, and in 2011 Wakefield's work was proved to be not only bad science but a fraud as well: a British court found him guilty of dishonestly misrepresenting his data, removed him from the roster of the British Medical Society, and disbarred him from practice. In his new book, [Freud: The Making of an Illusion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1627797173/?tag=skepticcom20-20), Frederick Crews presents a Freud who was just such a fraud and who deserves the same fate. This is not the first time that Crews, a bona fide skeptic whose last book, [Follies of the Wise: Dissenting Essays](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593761503/?tag=skepticcom20-20) (2007), was reviewed in the pages of this journal, has written critically about Freud. Crews had been drawn to psychoanalysis himself (disclosure: this reviewer was, too) in the 1960s and early 1970s when, along with the late Norman Holland, he pretty much created the field of psychoanalytic literary criticism. But a prestigious fellowship to the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (he was a professor of English at UC Berkeley at the time) gave him time to delve deeper into Freud, and convinced him instead that psychoanalysis was unscientific and untenable. Since then he has contributed to the growing skeptical scholarly and historical scholarship on Freud. Psychoanalysis is not only pseudoscience (as most philosophers of science agree, though for different reasons), but \"the queen of pseudosciences\". Philosophers of science have indicted key concepts of Freud's psychoanalysis such as \"free association,\" \"repression,\" and \"resistance\" as circular and fatally flawed by confirmation bias. Historians have tracked down the actual patients whose treatment served Freud as evidence for his theories and have sought to place Freud and his theories in the historical and cultural context of his time. Crews\u2014to his own surprise\u2014became well known as a major, if not the major, critic of Freud in the public eye because of a series of articles he published in the New York Review of Books in the 1990s. For Crews is that now all too rare and rapidly disappearing creature\u2014the public intellectual\u2014who is able to explain and make accessible an otherwise unwieldy amount of erudite scholarship in clear, elegant, and jargon-free prose. Defenders of Freud have sought to discredit him as a \"Freud basher,\" thereby continuing the (not so honorable) tradition that Freud began of questioning the motives of a skeptic and attributing it to \"resistance\" instead of of falsification of data should now close the door on this damaging claim.\" The above is from a 2011 British Medical Journal article about Andrew Wakefield, the British physician whose \"discovery\" of a link between vaccination and autism fueled a world wide anti-vaccination movement.

Throughout the first decade of this century, surveys repeatedly found that prejudiced attitudes\u2014notably the once-common beliefs that blacks were inferior to whites, women inferior to men, gay men and lesbians inferior to straights\u2014had declined sharply, especially among young people. Surveys, of course, supposedly assess what you think. But what if they assess what you think others think you should think? What if they simply reflect your awareness that it isn't cool to reveal your actual negative feelings about another group? Self-report data is inherently plagued with this problem. Thus, most social psychologists who study prejudice and discrimination focus on what people do, not what they say they might do. For example, when researchers have sent identical r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to potential employers, varying only a name that indicates gender, or implies race (a black-sounding name or membership in an African American organization), or mentions religious affiliation, many employers have revealed a bias in whom they choose to call for an interview.

Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and remembering, insomnia, tinnitus, confusion, vertigo, hearing loss and \"mild brain trauma.\" Conspiracy theories abound with talk of secret military weapons from a foreign power or rogue agents, possibly Russian. But delve deeper, and the government's claims begin to unravel. For starters, there is no concrete evidence of an attack. Experts agree that what is being reported is not consistent with how sonic weaponry works. A leading figure in the field of psychoacoustics, former MIT researcher Joseph Pompei, is adamant that the State Department's claims violate the laws of physics. \"Brain damage and concussions, it's not possible,\" he said, noting that to produce such an effect \"Somebody would have to submerge their head into a pool lined with very powerful ultrasound transducers.\" [4](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/state-departments-claims-about-sonic-attack-diplomats-cuba-dont-add-up/#note04) German physicist and acoustics specialist J\u00fcrgen Altmann of Technology University Dortmund, concurs: \"I know of no acoustic effect that can cause concussion symptoms.

NEW EPISODE The Way of the Mister (Quickie): If There Is No God, Murder Isn't Wrong. Earlier this year, PragerU posted a video titled \"If There Is No God, Murder Isn't Wrong\" in which Dennis Prager claims that without God, there are no moral facts and therefore one cannot know that murder is wrong. Brian Dalton explains why the entire argument hinges on the question of knowledge. FOLLOW MR.

Aliens. Strange crop circles. Giant figures scratched in the desert surface along the coast of Peru. The amazing alignment of the pyramids. Strange lines of clouds in the sky. The paranormal is alive and well in the American cultural landscape. In UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens, Don Prothero and Tim Callahan explore why such demonstrably false beliefs thrive despite decades of education and scientific debunking. Employing the ground rules of science and the standards of scientific evidence, Prothero and Callahan discuss a wide range of topics including the reliability of eyewitness testimony, psychological research into why people want to believe in aliens and UFOs, and the role conspiratorial thinking plays in UFO culture. They examine a variety of UFO sightings and describe the standards of evidence used to determine whether UFOs are actual alien spacecraft. Finally, they consider our views of aliens and the strong cultural signals that provide the shapes and behaviors of these beings. While their approach is firmly based in science, Prothero and Callahan also share their personal experiences of Area 51, Roswell, and other legendary sites, creating a narrative that is sure to engross both skeptics and believers. Order [UFOs, Comments eSkeptic for October 11, 2017 In this week's eSkeptic: CONSCIOUSNESS & REALITY Michael Shermer, Baba Brinkman, Deepak Chopra, Seth Andrews, and Aspen Matis In late September 2017, in celebration of 25 years of Skeptic magazine and the Skeptics Society combating 'fake news,' Dr. Michael Shermer hosted a live variety science show, in partnership with YouTube Space NY, to explore the question: 'How Can We Know What's True?'. Canadian hip-hop rapper, Baba Brinkman, opened the show with a rap about perception, hallucination, optical illusions, and the predictive model of consciousness. Following that, in the name of open dialogue between those with differing or polarized worldviews, Michael Shermer (Director of the Skeptics Society, and creator of Skeptic magazine) discusses consciousness and the nature of reality with Deepak Chopra (philosopher and self-proclaimed \"radical skeptic\"). In the following video, Michael Shermer discusses spirituality and science with Deepak Chopra (philosopher), Aspen Matis (author of [Girl in the Woods](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062291076/?tag=skepticcom20-20)), and Seth Andrews (creator and host of [The Thinking Atheist](http://www.thethinkingatheist.com/)).

What is Spirituality, Anyway? Is \"Spirituality\" so Broadly Defined that Testing for it is Meaningless? by David Speed There has been an explosion of research addressing spirituality over the past two decades. The use of the term \"spirituality\" is a staple of our everyday vernacular, whereby many have friends who will identify as spiritual, but not religious. The ubiquity of the \"spiritual\" label is curious given that a definition of spirituality is rarely discussed. Granted, people are often not required to precisely define concepts that they are discussing, so the fact that spirituality means different things to different people is largely irrelevant in everyday conversation. However, this definitional ambiguity is problematic for researchers who seek to explore the relationship between spirituality and other constructs. In other words, while the average citizen can communicate in imprecise ways and get away with it, scientists and researchers do not have that luxury. The idea of spirituality is so varied that everyone experiences it differently. If this is the case, how can a measurement of spirituality be valid for everyone? The current paradigm within the spirituality literature is that higher spirituality has a tendency to be associated with better health. Higher spirituality is allegedly linked to numerous health benefits (e.g., satisfaction with life, better general health [1](#note01), less depression [2](#note02), etc.), and there has been an effort within the literature to promote spiritual diversity in the healthcare system. [3](#note03) There is also academic interest in how spirituality components relate to quality of life assessments [4](#note04), as well as movements to incorporate spirituality into clinical practice. [5](#note05) In short, spirituality is experiencing a prolonged interest from both the academy and the public at large. However, these positive findings are somewhat marred by a fundamental issue within the associated literature, namely what spirituality actually is. Within the academic literature there does not appear to be an agreed-upon definition of spirituality, while there also appear to be radically different conceptualizations of what \"being spiritual\" means. One review paper with the express intent of clarifying the definition of spirituality summarized its findings by stating, \"Spirituality is an inherent component of being human, and is subjective, intangible, and multidimensional.\" [6](#note06) This statement means that all humans are spiritual although they experience this spirituality differently. However, such a statement is not helpful because it could be used to justify any range of definitions. Offering carte blanche to the spirituality definition does nothing to advance the field of research. If everything can be spiritual then logically, any measure purporting to measure spirituality is justified.
