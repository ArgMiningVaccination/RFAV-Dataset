INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 2.1 Introduction Often changes to the manufacturing process or labelling information need to be implemented after a biological medicine has b een submitted for registration or approved (i.e. Registered). Changes may be made for a variety of reasons: e.g to improve the quality and/or the efficiency of manufacture (e.g., changes in the manufacturing process, equipment, facility), or to update safe ty and efficacy changes and/or product labelling information (e.g. add a new indication, improve the management of risk by adding a warning, limiting the target population or changing the dosage regime).It is accepted that a) any change to the process or pac kaging of a biological medicine may impact the quality, safety, and therapeutic efficacy of a registered medicine; and b) any change to the labelling information of a registered medicine may impact the safe and effective use of the same. SAHPRA has a respon sibility to evaluate and approve any post registration change that may affect the quality, safety or therapeutic efficacy of a registered medicine. The Holder of the Certificate of Registration (HCR) is responsible for submitting an application for SAHPRA approval or to notify, ensuring that the manufacturer applies for SAHPRA approval, or notifies SAHPRA of all manufacturing or labelling changes to a registered biological medicine. Prior to implementing the change, the HCR or manufacturer should assess th e effects of the change and demonstrate through appropriate studies (validation and/or analytical and/or clinical or non -clinical laboratory studies) the lack of an adverse effect of the change on the quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy of the medicin e. Regulation of changes to medicines is one of the most important elements in ensuring that medicines of constant quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy are distributed post authorisation. It is difficult to provide a set of guidelines that apply to al l situations. An attempt has been made to cover a range of possible changes on manufacture, quality control, safety, therapeutic efficacy, and product labelling information. The categories of changes and reporting procedures are provided in the main body of the document and the data requirements to support the proposed changes are provided in the appendices. This guideline has been informed by the existing SAHPRA Amendments Guideline (2012) and the WHO Guideline for procedures and data requirements for ch anges to approved vaccine (TRS 993 Annex -4 2015). SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 5 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 2.2 Scope This document provides guidelines for HCRs who intend to make cha nges to the original product license for an approved biological medicine on: a) procedures and criteria for the appropriate categorization and reporting of changes; and b) the data required to enable SAHPRA to evaluate the impact of the change on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine. This guidance will form the basis for procedures for evaluation of post approval changes. 3. DEFINITIONS Some of the definitions below were modified (compared to those provided in other documents) to reflect the meaning s as used in this guidance. Adjuvant: A substance or combination of substances used in conjunction with a biological medicine to enhance (for example, increase, accelerate, prolong and/or possibly target) or modulate a specific physiological or immune res ponse to the biological in order to enhance the clinical effectiveness of the biological medicine. Amendment: A written application submitted to SAHPRA to approve a change in the original registration application Antigen (vaccine): The following definiti ons apply in this document: The active ingredient in a vaccine against which the immune response is raised. It may be a live attenuated preparation of bacteria, viruses or parasites; inactivated (killed) whole organisms; crude cellular fractions or purifi ed active biological ingredients, including recombinant proteins (i.e., those derived from recombinant DNA expressed in a host cell); polysaccharides and conjugates formed by covalent linkage of polysaccharides to components such as mutated or inactivated proteins and/or toxoids; synthetic active biological ingredients; polynucleotides (such as plasmid DNA vaccines); or living vectored cells expressing specific heterologous immunogens. It may also be a combination of the antigens or immunogens listed above. Intermediate or component that may undergo chemical change or processing in the manufacture of the final product (drug product) and is present in the final product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect. Also referred as Drug Substance, Active Ingredient, or Active Substance in other documents. Biological Medicine: all medicines that contain a living organism, or are derived from a living organism or biological processes. They include, but are not limited to the following : i. Plasma -derived and animal products e,g Clotting factors, immunosera, antivenoms; ii. Vaccines; iii. Biotechnology -derived (recombinant acids; iv. Products developed for Human Gene therapy Well-characterised, low -molecular mass, medicinal biological compounds, may be excluded by specific regulatory decision from biological medicine status, and in that case, will not be reviewed thr ough the biological medicines review process. Change: Refers to any change made to an approved marketing authorisation in product composition, manufacture process, quality controls, equipment, facilities or product labelling information by the marketing authorisation holder. This is also referred to as variation in other documents. Comparability Exercise: The activities, including study design, conduct of studies, and evaluation of data, that are designed to investigate whether the products are comparable . In addition to routine analyses performed during production and control of the active biological ingredient or final product, these evaluations typically include further characterisation studies. In some cases, non -clinical or clinical data might contrib ute to the conclusion SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 6 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments Comparability Protocol (CP): Establishes the tests to be done and acceptable limits to be achieved to demonstrate comparability of the pre -amendment and post -amendment products following specific quality change(s). A CP is a highly specific, well -defined plan for the future implementation of a quality (e.g., manufacturing -related changes, change of analytica l method and site transfer change. It is also referred to as Post Approval Change Management Protocol in other documents. Container Closure System: Refers to the following components: Primary container closure system is a packaging component that is or m ay be in direct contact with the final product dosage form (e.g., vial, pre -filled syringe). (Container closure systems for the active biological ingredients or intermediates of medicines normally only include primary container closure systems.) Secondary container closure system is a packaging component that is not and will not be in direct contact with the dosage form (e.g. carton, tray). Dosage Form: means the pharmaceutical form in which the active ingredients, excipients and physical formulation of a medicine is presented. Final Lot : A collection of sealed final containers that is homogeneous with respect to the composition of the product. A final lot must therefore have been filled in one continuous working session. Final Product: A finished dosage form (e.g., tablet or solution) that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients. It is also referred as Finished Product or Drug Product in other documents. Formulated bulk: An intermediate in t he drug product manufacturing process, consisting of the final formulation of drug substance and excipients at the concentration to be filled into primary containers. Holder of the Certificate of Registration (HCR): means a person in whose name a registra tion certificate has been granted and who is responsible for all aspects of the medicine, including quality, safety and compliance with conditions of registrations. Intermediate : A material produced during steps in the manufacturing of a medicine that mus t undergo further processing before it becomes a final product. Manufacturer: means a person manufacturing a medicine and includes a manufacturing pharmacy. Product Labelling Information: Printed materials that accompany a prescription medicine and refer s to all labelling items (SAHPRA Regulation # 10, #11 and # 12): Package Information (PI), including prescribing information: that provides product information on indication, dosage and administration, safety and efficacy results, contra -indications, warn ings, and a description of the product for health care providers Inner label or container label Outer label or carton Patient information Leaflet (PIL) Prior approval amendment (PAA): an amendment requiring approval from the SAHPRA prior to implementat ion of the amendment. Also referred to as Change Application Dossier in other documents. Quality attribute: A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic. Quality change: In the context of this document, quality change re fers to a change in the manufacturing process, product composition, quality control testing, equipment or facility. SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 7 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments Raw materia ls: A general term used to denote the culture media components, reagents or solvents intended for use in the production of starting material, drug substance, intermediates or drug products. Registration Application: A formal application to SAHPRA for appr oval to register and market a new medicine. The purpose of the Registration Application is to determine whether the medicine meets the statutory standards for safety, effectiveness, product labelling information and manufacturing. Source material/starting material: Material from a biological source that marks the beginning of the manufacturing process of a drug as described in a marketing authorisation or licence application and from which the active ingredient is derived either directly (e.g. plasma deriv atives, ascitic fluid, bovine lung, etc.) or indirectly (e.g. cell substrates, host/vector production cells, eggs, viral strains, etc.). Specification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges or other criteria for the tests described. Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by the regulatory authorities. Vaccine: Preparations containing antigens capabl e of including a specific and active immunity in humans against an infecting agent or toxin Vaccine Efficacy: Relative reduction in disease incidence in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people measured in a randomised, placebo -controlled clinica l trial. In the context of this guidance document, medicine efficacy relates to all clinical data obtained to ensure medicine efficacy, immunogenicity or its effectiveness. 4. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS For each change the HCR should decide if the informatio n in the original application or product registration application needs to be amended and requires an official submission to SAHPRA (i.e., an amendment application) based on the recommendations in this guideline. The HCR is responsible for the assessment o f the effects of any change before implementing the change. Amendments requiring approval prior to implementation of a change are referred to as Prior Approval Amendments (PAA). In general, no change should be implemented without approval of SAHPRA unless it is exempted in this guideline. Changes to approved biological medicines are categorised based on a risk analysis. When the change affects the manufacturing process, this assessment should include evaluation of the effect of the change on the quality ( i.e. identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency) of the final product as it may relate to the safety or efficacy of the medicine. Changes that may potentially have a major or moderate impact require submission of a prior approval amendment to SAHPRA . For each change, the HCR's amendment application should contain information determined by SAHPRA to be appropriate and should include the information developed by the HCR in assessing the effects of the change. When changes are deemed to have potentiall y minimal impact or no impact, they should be recorded and retained by the manufacturer or the HCR and listed in the Annual Product Review/Report. A manufacturer making a change to a biological medicine should also conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including good manufacturing practices (GMP), good laboratory practices (GLP), good clinical practices (GCP) and other applicable regulations. For example, manufacturers should comply with relevant GMP validation and record keeping requirements and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorised SAHPRA personnel during SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 8 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments inspections. Inspe ctions may occur routinely or may be triggered by major manufacturing changes (e.g., substantial change in production capacity, move to a new facility). An assessment of the extent to which the quality change (also referred to as manufacturing change) aff ects the quality attributes (i.e., identity, strength, quality, purity, potency) of a biological medicine, is typically accomplished by comparing manufacturing steps test results from in -process, release and characterisation testing of pre -change (e.g hist orical data) and post -change material and determining if the test results are comparable (i.e., active ingredients, intermediate or final product made after the change should be shown to be comparable to and/or to meet the acceptance criteria of the active ingredients, intermediates or final product made before the change). In the case that minor differences are acceptable provided they are shown not to have an adverse impact on quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy of the product Certain changes, such as changes in the composition of active ingredients, the introduction of new vaccine antigens (except for the annual influenza virus strain update of influenza vaccines), the use of new cell substrates (i.e. use of cells unrelated to the established master cell bank (MCB) or pre -master cell bank material or changes in the composition of key excipients are generally considered to be a new product and as such require the submission of a new registration application. Cell substrate -related changes, such as r e-derivation of the MCB, may require the submission of a new registration application, whether the cells are used as a substrate for propagation or organisms or constitute the active biological ingredient itself (e.g. a new MCB generated from a different i solate). Administrative changes related to acquisitions and mergers, company names, or contact information should be submitted directly to SAHPRA as a general correspondence to the registration certificate and evaluated by SAHPRA Inspectorate. [See Sectio n 6, Reporting Categories for Safety, Efficacy and/or Product Labelling Information Changes for information on changes to the labelling items.] In the case where a change has been approved by any of the regulatory authorities with which SAHPRA aligns itself, SAHPRA may choose to recognise the decision or make an independent decision based on their assessment. Foreign approval documentation may accompany the required information to support the change as outlined in this document. The responsibility of the f inal regulatory decision on the approval of the change still lies with SAHPRA. SAHPRA may consider establishing procedures on the recognition of approvals for the same changes by any of the regulatory authorities with which SAHPRA aligns itself. Descript ions of the reporting categories for quality changes are provided for in section 5 and for safety, therapeutic efficacy and product labelling information changes in section 6. Proposed recommendations on the regulatory procedures for the reporting of chang es to SAHPRA are described in section 7. Examples of suggested review timelines for changes in the various categories will be included in future under Appendix 1. A comprehensive list of quality changes and the type of information that should be included i n an amendment application are provided in Appendix 2 for the active biological ingredient and intermediates and in Appendix 3 for the final product. Examples of changes that affect clinical use and product labelling information (safety, therapeutic effic acy, dosage, administration, active components, and expiry date) are provided in Appendix 4. 5. REPORTING CATEGORIES FOR QUALITY CHANGES Based on the potential effect of the quality change (e.g. manufacturing change) on the quality attributes (i.e. identity , strength, quality controls, purity, potency) of the medicine and on their potential impact on the quality, safety or efficacy, changes are categorised into major, moderate and minor and are identified as: Major Quality Changes, Moderate Quality Changes , or Minor Quality Changes. SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 9 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments The implementation of changes in the major or moderate category requires reporting to SAHPRA in or der to amend the information in the original registration application. The Major and Moderate Quality Changes must be reviewed and approved by SAHPRA prior to implementation of the change. Minor Quality Changes that are expected to potentially have a mini mal or no effect on the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicine do not require submission of an amendment. The changes included in this category may be implemented by the HCR without prior review and approval by SAHPRA. However, these changes should be listed in the Annual Product Review and all the supporting information retained as part of the product's record by the manufacturer or HCR, should comply with GMP requirements, and should be available for review during inspections . At any point when an a mendment application is submitted for a product, all Minor Quality Amendments pertaining to the product should also be included in the CTD Module 1.2.1 f Amendment history and also be clearly addressed in the Amendment Schedule, and the latest amendments t o any particular aspect should be submitted. Further information on each category is provided below. Appendices 2 and 3 provide an extensive list of Major, Moderate and Minor Quality Changes and the information required to support each change. Appendix 2 includes changes to the active biological ingredient or intermediates and Appendix 3 includes changes to the final product. Quality changes listed in Appendices 2 and 3 should be reported in one of the reporting categories described in this section. If a quality change may have a potential impact on the quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy of the medicine and is considered to be major, moderate or minor, but is not included in Appendix 2 or 3, then SAHPRA should be consulted for proper classification. SAHPRA will establish a mechanism that allows for the update of this guideline when new regulatory category classifications are needed. 5.1 Major Quality Changes Major Quality Changes are changes to the product composition, manufacturing process, qualit y controls, facilities, or equipment that have a potential to have a significant negative or positive impact on the quality, safety or efficacy of the biological medicine. The HCR should submit an application for amendment and receive an approval notificat ion from SAHPRA before implementation of the change by the manufacturer. For a change under this category, the amendment should specify the products involved and include a detailed description of the proposed change. Additional supportive information is al so needed as per Appendix 2 for the active ingredient and Appendix 3 for the final product and may include information such as: a description of the methods used and studies performed to evaluate the effect of the change on the product's safety or efficacy ; the data derived from those studies; relevant validation protocols and results; updated product labelling information; and summaries of relevant standard operating procedure(s) (SOP) or a list referencing previously approved relevant SOP. In some cases M ajor Quality Changes may also require non -clinical and/or clinical data. The recommendations in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines [4], Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines: regulatory expectation s [5], Guidelines on stability evaluation of vaccines [6], other related guidelines [7 -10] and recommendations for specific products and adjuvants, e.g WHO's Guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of bio -therapeutic protein products prepared by recombinant DNA technology (16), should apply. 5.2 Moderate Quality Changes Moderate Quality Changes are changes to the product composition, manufacturing process, quality controls, facilities, or equipment, that have a moderate potential to have an impact on the quality, safety or therapeutic efficacy of the medicine. The HCR should submit an amendment and receive an approval notification from SAHPRA before implementation of the change. The requirements for the amendment content of the Moderate Quality Ch anges are the same as SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 10 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments for the Major Quality Changes (see Section 5.1). However, the amount of required supportive data will be generally less than that for major changes and the review time is shorter. 5.3 Minor Quality Changes Minor Quality Changes are changes to the product composition, manufacturing process, quality controls, facilities, or equipment that have a minimal pote ntial to have an impact on the safety or efficacy of the medicine. The changes included in this category may be implemented by the manufacturer without prior review by SAHPRA (i.e. these changes do not require reporting and approval by SAHPRA). For each p roduct, the HCR or manufacturer should maintain a chronological comprehensive list of all quality changes, including Minor Quality Changes that occur in all production areas. Additionally, this list should include a description of the manufacturing and qua lity control changes including: the manufacturing site(s) or area(s) involved, the date each change was made and references of relevant validations and SOPs. The data to support Minor Quality Changes listed in Appendices 2 and 3 should be available upon re quest from SAHPRA or during inspections. SAHPRA requires that a list of the minor quality changes be reported either as part of subsequent amendments for prior approval or by annual notification amendments. When Minor Quality Changes are related to a major or moderate change, they should be included as part of the amendment for the Major or Moderate Quality Change. SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 11 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 6. REPORTING CATEGORIES FOR SAFETY, EFFICACY AND/OR PRODUCT LABELLING INFORMATION CHANGES After assessing the effect of a change related to the clinical use or to the product labelling information, on the safe and effective us e of a biological medicine, HCRs should report this change in one of the following categories: Safety and Therapeutic Efficacy Changes Product Labelling Information Changes Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes The product labelling infor mation includes the following labelling items: prescribing information (or Professional Information) for health care providers or patients, outer label (i.e. carton), and inner label (i.e. container label). After approval, a HCR should promptly revise all promotional and advertising items to make them consistent with implementation of the product labelling information change. Further information on each category is provided below. See Appendix 4 for examples of therapeutic efficacy, safety and product label ling information changes considered to be appropriate for each category. 6.1 Safety and Efficacy Changes Safety and Efficacy Changes are changes that impact the clinical use of the biological medicine and relate to safety, therapeutic efficacy, dosage, a nd administration, and require data from clinical studies to support the change. For biosimilar medicines, references may be made to the clinical data generated for the reference product (e.g. in the case of a safety related PI update to add new adverse ev ents, warnings or precautions) Safety and Efficacy Changes are major changes and require amendment application submission and approval prior to implementation of the change. Generally, Safety and Efficacy Changes affect the product labelling information a nd have the potential to increase or decrease the exposure levels of the medicine, either by expanding the population that is exposed, or by changing dosage or dosing. These changes may be related to clinical use of the medicine such as: a) addition or expan sion of a safety claim or efficacy claim, including expansion of the population that is exposed; b) change in strength or a route of administration*; c) change in the recommended dose and/or dosing range or schedule; {including for a vaccine, the addition of a booster dose;) d) co-administration with other medicines; or e) deletion or reduction of existing risk management measures (e.g. contraindications, adverse events, warnings or cautionary text/statements, in the product labelling information). It is possible that SAHPRA may consider that these changes require a new Registration application, e.g. changes in route of administration or strength. Furthermore, in some cases, changes involving the subcutaneous and intramuscular administration routes may not require a new application, while others such as changes from intramuscular to intranasal administration routes may require a new application. The type and scope of the required supportive non -clinical and/or clinical safety and efficacy data are determined case -by-case based on risk -benefit considerations related to the impact of the changes, the medicine attributes and the disease it is designed to prevent or treat and may be based on considerations such as: Robust nature of the therapeutic (or immune) response elicited by the medicine and availability of a correlate of efficacy. Availability of animal models; and Medicine attributes (i.e., live vs. inactivated vaccines). HCRs are encouraged to consult with SAHPRA, on the adequacy of the clinical data needed t o support a safety and efficacy change if deemed necessary. Additionally, changes in dosage form (i.e., change from lyophilised to SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 12 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendm ents liquid) and delivery device (i.e. change from needle and syringe to jet injector) may require clinical data and SAHPRA should also be consulted on the data required to support such changes. For non -clinical and clinical studies, the recommendations given in the WHO Guidelines on non -clinical evaluation of vaccines [4], Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines: regulatory expectations [5], Guidelines on the quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy of biotherapeutic protein products prepared by re combinant DNA technology [16] and other related guidelines [7 -10] should apply. Guidance on approaches to the non -clinical and clinical comparability exercise can also be found in WHO's guidelines on evaluation of similar biotherapeutic products [19,20] For a change under this category, the HCR should submit a CTD application to SAHPRA that includes the following: A detailed description of the proposed change; a summary of the methods used and studies performed to evaluate the effect of the change on the medicine's safety or efficacy; amended product labelling information; clinical studies (protocol, statistical analysis plan, and clinical study report); clinical assay methods (SOPs) and validations; and a pharmacovigilance plan. 6.2 Product Labellin g Information Changes Product Labelling Information Changes are changes to the labelling items that have the potential to improve the management of risk to the population currently indicated for use of the medicine (or in any other way exposed to the medi cine) by: a) the identification or characterisation of any adverse event, addition or strengthening of risk management measures for the adverse event; b) the identification of subgroups for which the benefit to risk profile of the medicine has the potential to be less favourable; and c) the addition or strengthening of risk management measures, including instructions on dosing or any other conditions of use. Product Labelling Information Changes require amendment submission and approval prior to the distribution of the product. Often amendments for Product Labelling Information Changes related to clinical use require data from pharmacovigilance reports (i.e. Periodic Safety Update Reports, PSUR).Changes supported by large clinical or non -clinical studies usually are not considered as Product Labelling Information Changes but as Safety and Efficacy Changes. 6.3 Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes (e.g. change of distributor's address, minor format change) require reporting to SAHPRA prior to implementation by the HCR, but do not require prior approval by SAHPRA. They are changes that are not expected to impact the safety, therapeutic efficacy, and/or effective use of the product. In addition, th ese changes should be reported to SAHPRA as part of subsequent amendments for Safety and Efficacy Changes or Product Labelling Information Changes when updated product labelling information is included. SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 13 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 7. PROCEDURES The establishment of procedures and criteria for adequate oversight of changes is the responsibility of SAHPRA. SAHPRA has established this guideline rega rding the submission procedures and time lines with action dates to be considered by HCRs when preparing to submit an amendment for a change. Because Major Quality or Efficacy and Safety Change amendments require extensive documentation and data, the revi ew times should be longer than for Moderate Quality Change or Product Labelling Information Change amendments. Furthermore, SAHPRA may establish different timelines for reviews of Major Quality Changes not requiring clinical data, compared to Safety and Ef ficacy Changes requiring clinical data. See Appendix 1 for examples of regulatory categories and review timelines. In the case where SAHPRA decides to recognise the approval of any of the regulatory authorities with which SAHPRA aligns itself, timelines may not apply. HCRs may contact SAHPRA to determine the adequate category of amendments prior to submission of the information in support of a change especially if the change is not included in Appendices 2 to 4. HCRs may also consult with SAHPRA on the a dequacy of clinical data required to support a Safety, Efficacy or Product Labelling Information Change. HCRs are encouraged to contact SAHPRA regarding plans for future changes and proposed filing dates for changes to existing products to aid SAHPRA in pl anning the allocation of review resources. All communication with SAHPRA must be through the office of the CEO. To aid in the acceptance of submissions for review, the cover letter to an amendment for a manufacturing change should specify that the amendm ent is being reported in the selected category by labelling the submission as: Major Quality Change, or Moderate Quality Change. The cover letter to an amendment application for a safety, efficacy or product labelling information change should specify t hat the change is being reported in the selected category by labelling the submission as: Safety and Efficacy Change, Product Labelling Information Change, or Administrative Product Labelling Information Change. Major Quality Change amendments that con tain both, quality data and revised product labelling information but no clinical data should be labelled Major Quality Change and Product Labelling Information Change and the cover letter should specify that the submission includes both, quality changes a nd revised product labelling information items . Major Quality Change amendments that contain both, quality and safety and efficacy data (from clinical studies) and revised product Labelling information, should be labelled Major Quality Change and Safety and Efficacy Change and the cover letter should specify that the submission includes quality changes and revised product labelling information items . All amendment applications should include a list of all the changes contained in the submission. The list s hould describe each change with sufficient detail to allow SAHPRA to speedily determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used and should be part of the cover letter. If the submission has been inappropriately classified, the HCR will be notified. Minor Quality Changes that are related to a Moderate or Major Quality Change, should be included in the prior approval amendment if they were implemented after the submission of a previous amendment for a Moderate or SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 14 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments Major Quality Change (e.g. a minor change such as tightening of a specification, should be included in an amendment for a moderate or major change which in cludes updated quality control release information). SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 15 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 7.1 Pr ocedures for Prior Approval Amendments The procedures in this section apply to all changes requiring approval prior to implementation: Major Quality Changes, Moderate Quality Changes, Safety and Efficacy Changes, and Product Labelling Information Changes. The following common items should be included, where applicable, in the submission package for post approval changes: a) A cover letter that includes: I.the type of submission (e.g., Major Quality Change, Moderate Quality Change); II.a narrative of the c hange(s) and a rationale for the change(s); III.any other information relevant to the submission; and b) Completed documents or forms based on SAHPRA requirements such as: Medicines Submission Application Form signed and dated; c) GMP documentation informatio n, as applicable; d) Where relevant, a side -by-side comparison showing the differences between the approved manufacturing process (including quality control tests) compared to the proposed ones. In addition to the above common information, the specific info rmation to support the various quality changes is outlined in Appendices 3, 4 and 5. It should be noted that the common information is not repeated for the various changes outlined in the appendices. All data recommended to support a change should be provi ded with the submission. When recommended supporting data cannot be submitted, a detailed rationale should be provided. For submissions that include multiple changes, the applicant should clearly specify which supporting data support each change. If the same change is applicable to multiple products, a separate submission is generally required for each product but the data may be cross -referenced. When cross -references are made to previously submitted information, details on the cross -referenced informati on should be indicated in the covering letter (e.g., brand name of the product, manufacturer's/HCR's name, submission type, application number, date approved). Submission filed in electronic format (ZA eCTD) or paper (ZA CTD) should be based on the curren t requirements of SAHPRA. The submitted data should be well organised and should be provided in the format defined by SAHPRA. A CD -ROM/USB that includes all the documentation relating to an amendment application can be useful. If SAHPRA determines that th e information submitted in an amendment fails to demonstrate the continued quality, safety or efficacy of the product made with the change, it will try to resolve the problems with the HCR. In such cases SAHPRA will issue an information request letter for additional documentation, information and clarification to be submitted by the HCR. If the identified deficiencies are not resolved and may have a negative impact on the product, SAHPRA may decide to issue a written non -compliance notification by which the change cannot be implemented and product made with the amendments cannot be distributed. If the information in the amendment is adequate and all identified deficiencies are resolved in a satisfactory manner, SAHPRA will issue a written approval notificat ion. Regarding the resolution of conflicts or disputes between SAHPRA and the HCR, the Act 101 (1965) provides procedures for review and appeal of decisions. The following points should be considered when submitting changes: Comparability Protocol: A comparability protocol (also referred to as post approval change management protocol in other documents) establishes a framework for a well -defined plan for the future implementation of a quality change, the tests SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 16 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments to be done and acceptable limits to be achieved to demonstrate the lack of negative effect for specific manufacturing changes on the quality, safety or therapeutic effica cy of the medicine. A comparability protocol is a highly specific, well -defined plan for the future implementation of a quality change. For some changes the routine quality tests performed to release active biological ingredient or final product are not considered adequate to assess the impact of the change and additional in -process tests and characterisation tests may be needed (e.g., addition of bioburden and endotoxin tests to support the removal of preservatives from the manufacturing process). The pur pose of a comparability protocol is to allow for a more expedient distribution of product by permitting MA holders to submit a protocol for a change, which if approved, may justify a reduced reporting category for the particular change at the time the comp arability data are obtained and the change is implemented. This concept is not included in this guidance as the use of the comparability protocol is not currently harmonised amongst NRAs. It is the decision of the NRA whether or not to include the review a nd approval of comparability protocols in their approach to regulating changes to approved medicines. Currently SAHPRA does not have a mechanism for reviewing and approving a comparability protocol. Nonetheless this may change in the future. For those NRAs currently taking this approach, a new comparability protocol, or a change to an existing one, requires submission of an amendment and approval prior to implementation because it may result in a decreased reporting category for the changes covered in the c omparability protocol after the actual comparability data are submitted. The change of reporting category for the comparability protocol vs. the comparability data should be established by the NRA at the time the comparability exercise is approved. Multip le Changes : Multiple related changes involving various combinations of individual changes may be submitted in the same amendment application. For example, a site change may also involve equipment and manufacturing process changes or a medicine component c hange may necessitate a change in a specification. For multiple related changes where the recommended reporting categories for the individual changes differ, the submission should be in accordance with the most restrictive of the categories recommended for the individual changes. For submissions that include multiple changes, the HCR should clearly specify which supporting data support which change. Multiple Major or Moderate Quality Changes for the same medicine may be filed in a single submission provide d those changes are related and/or supported by the same information. Any other category of changes (e.g. Minor Quality Changes and Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes) may be filed together with other submissions whether or not they are r elated and/or support the same information. If the changes are related, the HCR should indicate the association between the proposed changes. Such changes could affect both the active biological ingredient and the final product. If there are too many chang es filed within the same submission or major issues are identified with a change which would require extensive time to review, SAHPRA may ask the HCR to divide the changes into separate submissions and resubmit the file. As indicated above, if the recommen ded reporting categories for the individual changes differ, the submission should be in accordance with the most restrictive of the categories recommended for the individual changes. In case of numerous changes of the same category, SAHPRA may reclassify t he submission to the next higher level based on the potential impact of the sum of the changes on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine. This reclassification should be communicated to the HCR at the start of the assessment. Production Document s: Production documents (executed lot records) are not required at the time of filing to support post - approval changes. However, these may be requested during review and should be available upon request and during inspections SAHPRA Biological Medici nes amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 17 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 7.2 Procedures for Minor Quality Changes Minor Quality Changes do not require notification and prior approval from SAHPRA for implementation. However , any minor changes that have been implemented should be annotated in the affected documents (e.g. SOPs, batch records). Minor Quality Changes should be listed in a single document and related supportive data as recommended in Appendices 2 and 3 should be adequately recorded and filed and should be available to SAHPRA upon request or inspections. Additionally, Minor Quality Changes that were previously implemented and are related to a Major or Moderate Quality Change should be included when submitting a prior approval amendment for the related change. SAHPRA may audit minor quality changes by requesting and reviewing the supporting data as deemed appropriate. If the classification of the change or the supportive data is not considered to be acceptable, the HCR may be requested to file a Major or Moderate Quality Change amendment. In cases where the change has already been implemented, the HCR may continue to distribute the medicine until such time as any issues are resolved. However, if SAHPRA considers tha t the changed medicine may impact the safety, therapeutic efficacy, quality and/or effective use, SAHPRA may request the HCR to withdraw the medicine from the market. For changes that are not reported, if SAHPRA determines (during an inspection) that the information for the change fails to demonstrate the continued safety or efficacy of the product made using the changes, it will try to resolve the problems with the HCR. If SAHPRA finds that the product in distribution poses a danger to public health, or i f it determines that there are unresolved issues, it may require the HCR to cease distribution of the product made using the changes or to remove the product from distribution pending resolution of the issues related to the changes. 7.3 Procedures for Adm inistrative Product Labelling Information Changes For Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes, a copy of the most recent revised product Labelling information should be submitted to SAHPRA as an amendment to the registration application, but do not require approval prior to implementation. Additionally, Administrative Product Labelling Information changes should be included when submitting amendments for Safety and Efficacy Changes or Product Labelling Information Changes, for minor changes that have been implemented from the time of the last approved product Labelling information to the time of the amendment submission. For minor changes, the product Labelling information should be annotated when filing the next prior approval amendment to in dicate those administrative changes that have been implemented. These amendment procedures must follow current SAHPRA Guidelines for amendments to Professional Information and Patient Information Leaflets. SAHPRA Biological Medicines a mendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 18 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 8.1. Adjuvants It should be noted that adjuvants are considered to be components of vaccines. Thus, each new adjuvanted vaccine is considered a new entity that will require appropriate physicochemical characterisation and non - clinical and clinical evaluation. It is the specific antigen -adjuvant formulation (as a whole) that is tested in non - clinical and clinical trials and receives MA or licensure based on demonstration of safety and efficacy. There is substantial diversity among vaccine adjuvants, antigens and the diseases they are designed to prevent. Therefore, the supportive information needed for adjuvant -related changes will depend on product - specific features, the clinical indications, and the impact of the change. The recommendations in the WHO Guidelines on the non -clinical evaluation of vaccine adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines [12] should be followed. 8.2. Annual Viral S train Changes for Influenza Vaccines To ensure that influenza vaccines are effective against circulating influenza virus strains, the WHO reviews global epidemiological data twice annually and if necessary, recommends new vaccine strain(s) in accordance with the available evidence for the northern and southern hemispheres [13, 14]. The WHO and NRAs usually recommend the use of certain virus strains based on the antigenic characteristics of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glyco proteins. Influenza vaccine viruses usually are derived from isolates obtained from laboratories in the WHO influenza network. For seasonal influenza vaccines, annual changes in the vaccine strain composition are considered Moderate Quality Changes becaus e of the extensive experience with such changes and to maximise flexibility and brevity of the review process as needed. HCRs of approved seasonal vaccines are expected to submit a Moderate Quality Change amendment to support annual changes in the influenz a strain composition. To allow for timely distribution of vaccines SAHPRA reviews the amendment in a speedy process. The supportive quality information generally consists of information on the source of the viruses, passage history until establishment of working seeds, and results of quality release tests performed on working virus seeds (including identity confirmation). In addition, updated product Labelling information items (Professional Information and inner and outer labels with relevant strain compo sition and formula year) should also be provided. This information is detailed in the SAHPRA Amendment Guideline 2012 for seasonal strain change of influenza vaccines. Changes to manufacturing processes, posology, and product Labelling information of inf luenza vaccines that are not related to the annual update should follow the normal categorisation as described in Appendices 2 to 4 and should not be included in the strain change amendments to avoid delays in the approval process. Due to the time constrai nts related to the seasonality of influenza vaccines, changes that are not related to vaccine strain composition should be timed such that approval would allow manufacture of vaccines made with the change to be distributed prior to the start of the influen za season (i.e. the fall of the southern and northern hemispheres). SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 19 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 8.2.1. Introduction There are several in fluenza vaccines registered and marketed in South Africa, all of which contain three influenza strains: usually two of type A and one of type B. Each year the manufacturer changes the viral strain composition to conform to those deemed most likely to cause outbreaks during the next influenza season [May to October] in the Southern Hemisphere. The WHO, via the International Influenza Centres assisted by National Laboratories, studies the isolates, incidence and virulence of influenza viral strain around the world and generates strain recommendations, prior to the influenza season for each hemisphere. The WHO recommendations are intended for worldwide use and therefore need to be adapted to the epidemiological situation of each country. The influenza vaccine manufacturers obtain viral strains that conform to the characteristics of the strains recommended by the WHO and develop manufacturing processes to incorporate these into their respective products. These formulations are then submitted for approval from t he regulatory authority to amend the formula, the manufacturing processes (where applicable), the Professional Information and the Patient Information Leaflet. This guideline outlines the process to be followed when submitting an annual viral strain chang e to ensure standardised and adequate evaluation for quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy, and to expedite the approval process. This process is solely for routine annual vaccine viral strain changes and any related safety information to be included i n the Professional Information and the Patient Information Leaflet. No other amendments may be included in the process. 8.2.2. Time for submission The application must be submitted to SAHPRA as soon as the required information is available. Submission o f the application by the end of October of the year preceding the intended Influenza season will allow for comprehensive and diligent review. The intention is to have routine annual vaccine strain changes approved by the end of February of the year of the relevant influenza season. Late or incomplete submissions will lead to delays in the review and approval process. 8.2.2.1. Information and documentation required The application to change viral strain involves changes to the Registration Certificate and therefore the relevant amendment fee should be paid and proof of such payment be included in the submission. The following information and the relevant documents must be included: 1) WHO recommended strain list for the relevant hemisphere. 2) Manufacturer's choice of strains for inclusion. 3) Details of manufacturing procedure (declaration if unchanged). 4) The source, history and master/working seed characterisation of each strain included. 5) Egg/cell culture: Safety specifications and tests. (Declaration if unc hanged.) 6) Final product release specifications and results. This must include Endotoxin release limit. 7) Retrospective data about the \"efficacy or performance\" of influenza vaccines (preceding year / season). 8) Stability data (accelerated or from the most re cent, or most similar batch of approved vaccine). 9) Copy of the approved Professional Information. 10) Copy of the proposed Professional Information indicating: The year/season for which the vaccine will be used. SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 20 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 8.3. Bridging Studies Clinical and non -clinical bridging studies are trials in which a parameter of interest (e.g. manufacturing process, formulation, dosing schedule) i s directly compared with a changed version of that parameter with respect to the effect of the change on the product's clinical performance. If the physicochemical properties, biological activity, purity, level of impurities and contaminants of the pre -amendment and post -amendment product are comparable, the safety and efficacy of the biological medicine can be inferred. However, non -clinical and/or clinical bridging studies may be required when analytical data alone are insufficient to establish comparabil ity. Comparison of therapeutic or immune responses and safety outcomes [e.g., rates of common adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs)] are often the primary objectives. If the immune response and safety profiles are similar, then efficacy and safety of the changed medicine can be inferred. In some cases safety and efficacy data comparing the medicine before the change to the medicine produced with the change (bridging studies), may be required. The following are examples of manufacturing changes that may require non -clinical and/or clinical bridging studies: Use of a new or re -derived virus seed or bacterial cell bank or host cell line (i.e. re -derived master cell bank). New agents used for inactivation or purification of the active ingredient with ma jor impact on the quality of the active ingredient. New dosage form. New formulation (e.g., amount and composition of ingredients, adjuvants, or preservatives, amount of reactogenic residual components from the manufacturing process).

The review times are established based on the capabilities of the NRAs, the impact of t he change, and the amount of required supportive data. Therefore, the review time frames for major changes should be longer than for moderate changes. The suggested review times for SAHPRA will be included at a later stage. The review time would start when the application has been accepted for review and found to be complete and end at the time when the initial assessment is shared with the HCR either in an approval or as a request for supplementary documentation. In case of the latter the shorter timelines may apply for the secondary assessment following reception of HCR answers. In case of need of minor clarifications, the NRA may communicate with the HCR during the initial assessment period without stopping the clock to be able to finalise the assessment within the proposed time line.

SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 23 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments APPENDIX 2 - Post Approval changes to the active biological ingredient The examples presen ted in this appendix are intended to assist with the classification of changes made to the quality information for an active ingredient. The information summarised in the table provides recommendations for: (a) the conditions to be fulfilled for a given chang e to be classified as either a major, moderate, or minor change. If any of the conditions outlined for a given change are not fulfilled, the change is automatically considered the next higher level of change. For example, if any of the conditions recommend ed for a Moderate Quality Change are not fulfilled, the change is considered a Major Quality Change; (b) the supporting data for a given change, either to be submitted to SAHPRA and/or maintained by the HCR. If any of the supporting data outlined for a given change are not provided, is different or is not considered applicable, adequate scientific justification should be provided; and (c) the reporting category (e.g. Major, Moderate or Minor Quality Change). It is important to note that SAHPRA reserves the right to request additional information or material as it deems appropriate, or to define conditions not specifically described in this document in order to allow SAHPRA to adequately assess the quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy of a vaccine. HCRs should contact SAHPRA if a change is not included in the table and if it may have the potential to impact on product quality. Supporting data should be provided according to the submission format accepted by SAHPRA. This is ZACTD and/or ZA eCTD formatted submis sions, the supporting data should be provided in the appropriate sections of the CTD Modules (not as separate documents). Quality Changes to Comply with Updated Compendia and/or Pharmacopeia SAHPRA recognises European Pharmacopoeia and United States Pharmacopoeia Quality changes to approved compendial/pharmacopoeial materials (e.g. raw materials, reagents, etc.), analytical procedures or assays solely to comply with updated compendial/phar macopoeial requirements are considered a minor change as long as the change is made within six (6) months of the implementation of the updated compendial/pharmacopoeial requirements. Otherwise, the HCR is required to file a moderate change for approval by SAHPRA. General Information Description of Change Conditions to Supporting Reporting be Fulfilled Data Category 1.

SAHPRA Biologi cal Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 40 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments APPENDIX 3 - Post Approval Changes to the Final Product The examples presented in this appendix are intended to assist with the classificat ion of changes made to the quality information of the final product. The information summarised in the final product table provides recommendations for: (a) the conditions to be fulfilled for a given change to be classified as either a major, moderate, or minor change. If any of the conditions outlined for a given change are not fulfilled, the change is automatically considered the next higher level of change. For example, if any of the conditions recommended for a Moderate Quality Change are not fulfilled, th e change is considered a Major Quality Change; (b) the supporting data for a given change, either to be submitted to SAHPRA; and/or maintained by HCR. If any of the supporting data outlined for a given change is not provided, is different or is not considered applicable, adequate scientific justification should be provided; and (c) the reporting category (e.g. Major, Moderate or Minor Quality Change). It is important to note that SAHPRA reserves the right to request additional information or material as deemed appropriate, or to define conditions not specifically described in this document in order to allow them to adequately assess the quality, safety or efficacy of a medicine. HCRs should contact SAHPRA, if a change is not included in the table and if it may h ave the potential to impact on medicine quality. Supporting data should be provided according to the submission format accepted by SAHPRA. For example, for SAHPRA to accept ICH CTD and/or ICH eCTD formatted submissions, the supporting data should be provi ded in the appropriate sections of the CTD Modules (not as separate documents). Quality Changes to Comply with Updated Compendia and/or Pharmacopeia SAHPRA recognises the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), (Ph Eur) and United States Pharm acopoeia (USP). Quality changes to approved compendial/pharmacopoeial materials (e.g. raw materials, reagents, etc.), analytical procedures or assays solely to comply with updated compendial/pharmacopoeial requirements is considered a minor change as long as the change is made within six months of the implementation of the updated compendial/pharmacopoeial requirements.

SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 61 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments APPENDIX 4 Safety, Efficacy and Product Labelling Information Post Approval The examples of Safety and Efficac y, Product Labelling Information and Administrative Product Labelling Information in this appendix are provided for clarification, but are not limited to the ones included in this section and may affect changes to the product labelling information for heal th care providers and patients, and inner and outer medicine labels. Because the amount of safety and efficacy data needed to support a change may vary based on the impact of the change, risk/benefit considerations, and product specific characteristics (i. e. there is no \"one size fits all\"), this appendix provides a list of examples of changes in the various categories rather than a detailed table linking each change with the required data needed to support the change (such as those provided in Appendices 2 and 3 for quality changes). HCRs are encouraged to contact SAHPRA for guidance on the data needed to support major changes if deemed necessary. Safety and Efficacy Safety and Efficacy Change amendments requiring approval prior to implementation of the c hange should be submitted for changes in clinical practice, and changes in safety and indication claims. In some cases safety and efficacy data comparing the approved clinical use of a medicine with a new one, may be required. Such studies, often referred to as clinical bridging studies, are trials in which a parameter of interest (e.g. formulation, dosing schedule, population group) is directly compared with a changed version of that parameter with respect to the effect of the change on the product's clini cal performance. Comparison of immune responses and safety outcomes [e.g. rates of common adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs)] are often the primary objectives. If the immune response and safety profiles are non -inferior, then efficacy and safety o f the medicine can be inferred. The following list contains some examples of Safety and Efficacy Changes requiring clinical studies: 1. Expansion of safety claims: Change due to increase of risk based on updated data from post -marketing clinical studies (co nfirmatory safety and efficacy studies or studies conducted in new populations), post - marketing surveillance, or studies of shedding and transmission. 2. Expansion or contraction of efficacy claims: New indications and usage (including re -introduction of a withdrawn indication) based on clinical studies demonstrating efficacy or lack of efficacy in specific populations. 3. New route of administration*, new dosage form*, new strength*, new dose, new dosing regimen, including concomitant administration with other medicines. 4. Change in existing risk management measures, existing route of administration, dosage form and/or strength due to safety reasons. 5. Changes based on data from nonclinical studies. *SAHPRA may consider that these changes require a new market au thorisation or product license. Product Labelling Information Changes Product Labelling Information Change amendments should be submitted for changes which do not require clinical efficacy or safety data or extensive pharmacovigilance (safety surveillanc e) data. Product Labelling Information Changes require approval prior to implementation of the change. The following list contains some examples of Product Labelling Information Changes that are associated with changes that impact clinical use: 1. Addition, strengthening, or clarification of text relating to contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions of the product Labelling information. These changes may include the provision of recommended risk -management actions (e.g. required testing prior to vaccination, specific monitoring, ensuring patient awareness of certain risks), or the identification of a specific sub -population as being at greater risk such as those with a concomitant condition, those taking concomitant medicine, or a specifi c age group. 2. Addition of an adverse reaction due to information reported to the HCR or SAHPRA. SAHPRA Biological Medicines amendment guide v2.doc 2019 Page 62 of 65 Registration of Medicines Biological Medicines Amendments 3. The instructions for use inclu ding dosage, administration and preparation for administration revised to optimise the safe use of the medicine. 4.An existing indication has been withdrawn in its entirety or altered for risk management purposes including reduction in scope, but without expanding, explicitly or implicitly, the claims of the medicine. 5. An existing route of administration, dosage form and/or strength has been deleted due to safety reasons. 6. A new medicines or drug interaction has been added, or an existing drug interaction has been better characterised, that alters the conditions of use in terms of risk management (e.g. a precautionary statement is added as the result of the new data). Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes are changes to the Labelling items which do not require supportive data or approval by SAHPRA prior to implementation; however, a copy of the most recent revised product Labelling information items should be submitted to SAHPRA as gene ral correspondence to the MA or product licence. The following are examples of Administrative Product Labelling Information Changes: 1. Minor changes to the layout of the product Labelling information items or revision of typographical errors without changi ng the content of the label. 2. Update of the HCR contact information (e.g. customer service number, website addresses) or distributor's name. 3. Update of the existing information for referenced literature without adding or removing references. 4. Product Label ling Information Changes made to comply with an official compendium (e.g. change of the common name). 5. Minor changes to the text to add clarity as it relates to maintaining consistency with common label phrase standards (e.g. change from \"not recommended f or children\" to \"not for use in children\").
