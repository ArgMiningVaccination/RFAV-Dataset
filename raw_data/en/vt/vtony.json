At HealingSpace, we believe that the body has an ability to heal itself given the correct conditions. Homeopathic Medicine is used to support that ability. The active ingredients in Homeopathic Medicines include diluted plants that relieve the same symptoms they cause at full strength (i.e., a microdose of coffee bean helps to relieve nervousness). Homeopathic Medicine naturally stimulates the body to address and combat any issues it is experiencing. They work with your immune system, rather than against it. They are not addictive, there is no risk of overdose, and they do not interact with other medications. They are generally safe even for small children and pregnant women. They do not cause drowsiness or sleeplessness. They work best when taken at the first sign of illness and can be used as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment. Homeopathic Medicines have been used for more than 200 years. They are manufactured in strict accordance with the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) and drug Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Today, Homeopathic Medicines are used by millions of patients and recommended by health care professionals around the world to relieve a variety of health conditions including allergies, coughs, colds, flu, stress, muscle pain, arthritis, migraines, and more.
