EBM Pearl: Significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups usually suggests a problem with randomization. Turns out sometimes it can also be a sign of no randomization at all! This was supposed to be a 'regular' EBM Focus about the TIME trial which evaluated the timing of antihypertensive dosing and, spoiler alert, found no benefit of evening dosing compared to morning dosing for cardiovascular outcomes. But a little background research for this summary uncovered quite the controversy surrounding the TIME trial's predecessor, the highly publicized 2020 [Hygia Chronotherapy trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641769/), and not just because of the contradictory results! While it may not quite be Gray's Anatomy-level drama, this is about as juicy as it gets for medical literature. The basis for both of these studies is the hypothesis that bedtime antihypertensive dosing would better control the physiologic morning blood pressure surge and therefore reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (which is more likely to occur around this time of day). As pointed out in a [prior EBM Focus](https://www.ebsco.com/blogs/health-notes/ebm-focus-putting-morning-meds-hypertension-bed-nighttime-dosing-seems-better), the Hygia trial found that bedtime associated with a \"striking\" 45% decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular death. [Other experts](https://www.practiceupdate.com/content/2020-top-stories-in-cardiology-the-hygia-trial-and-the-potential-dark-side-of-clinical-research/109329) wrote that \"the results reported almost seem too good to be true...\" True or not, the results got a ton of attention in the lay press and social media based on the study's [Altmetric Attention Score of 2124](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34232677/) (where a score of 20 is considered good for a journal article). The problems brought forth about the Hygia trial resulted in a formal [\"Expression of Concern\"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32318736/) by the European Heart Journal and an investigation which ultimately found \"no grounds for an ethical or factual concern.\" However, many continue to seriously question the validity of the results of the Hygia trial. Here are the [alleged] problems in a nutshell: SO, the strong background of skepticism about the validity of the Hygia results lead to perhaps less excitement about the contradictory results of the TIME trial published in October 2022, which may be why it took us so long to get around to writing about it here. The CliffsNotes version of the TIME trial goes like this: it was an (actually) randomized, controlled, open-label trial of more than 21,000 adults being treated for hypertension that enrolled a low-risk, mostly White European population who all had internet and a PCP. Most people were taking their (mean 1.5) blood pressure medications in the morning, and were likely medication compliant or had mild hypertension because the average pre-trial BP was 135/79. Participants were randomized to either take all of their BP meds in the morning or the evening and evaluated for the composite primary endpoint of vascular death or hospitalization for non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke after a mean of 5.2 years. The study was well-powered to detect a difference if one were there, but an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) showed no significant difference in the primary outcome between groups. There were more side effects in the morning-meds group and more noncompliance in the evening-meds group (presumably because the participants were used to taking their meds in the morning). But get this- there was an uptick in noncompliance in the direction of switching from morning to evening dosing around the time the Hygia trial was published that seemingly leveled out by the end of the trial! While there was variable adherence in both groups in the TIME trial, there was more crossover in the evening meds group which could have muddied the waters a bit. If a per-protocol analysis had also been done and had shown a benefit of evening dosing, this might have helped explain the dramatic discrepancy in results between the two trials (outside of fraudulent data). To be clear, an ITT is preferred in superiority trials because it preserves prognostic equivalence and is thought to be closer to the \"truth\". Ultimately, however, the generalizability of the TIME trial seems to be its biggest downfall considering the population was low-risk and highish-resourced. Now, if you experienced the roller coaster of emotions about this trial controversy that \"we\" did, you may, like us, be on the nerd-empath spectrum. This whole thing is a good reminder that the peer-review process is not a guarantee that what you see is what you get. As depressing as it is, we have to remain skeptical of new studies and do our due diligence to look for rips in the seams, especially when the results seem \"too good to be true\". Replication of important findings is critical. As far as the timing of antihypertensive medication goes, our advice to patients is to take their blood pressure medications when they are most likely to remember to take them. One thing we can be sure of is that blood pressure medications dosed at morning, noon, or night definitely won't help if patients forget to take them.

Reference: [Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2023 Jan 30;1(1):CD006207](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36715243/) Practice Point: According to the newest and best available evidence to date, wearing surgical masks in the community doesn't prevent COVID or flu-like illnesses. And N-95s don't seem better than surgical masks in healthcare settings. EBM Pearl: It's human nature to seek out evidence that confirms our point of view, but that doesn't make it true. It's not surprising that a benefit seen in case reports or cohort studies diminishes or disappears in randomized trials. As we remove systematic error and better approximate the truth, the magnitude of effect almost always decreases. I came across a meme the other day that featured an array of pictures from early 2020 of people wearing things like water cooler bottles on their heads, plastic grocery bags on their faces, and even maxi pads duct-taped across their noses and mouths. The entertainment value of these photos is based on the ridiculousness of it all because we know enough about the biophysiology of aerosolized viral spread and the mechanics of these various homemade protection devices to be so certain they won't work that we would never bother testing them. But masks were engineered to prevent the spread of illness, and we thought they should work in practice, so we wore them believing they would. Before last month, the best evidence we had on masking was a [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34789505/) of 71 observational studies and a single RCT that suggested that both surgical masks and N-95s were effective for preventing COVID and flu-like illnesses. But here comes a systematic review and meta-analysis of 78 randomized trials by the Cochrane group that concluded there was no benefit to wearing surgical masks in the community, and that N-95s are no better than surgical masks in healthcare settings. How do we explain these very different results from two systematic reviews, considering systematic reviews supposedly sit atop the evidence pyramid? The answer comes down to systematic bias in study design. A perfectly-executed systematic review is still only as good as the data analyzed. Garbage in = garbage out. (Or for you non-cynics out there, diamonds in = diamonds out.) We're with you if you find yourself thinking \"But how could wearing masks not prevent the spread of COVID, even a little?\" We, too, found ourselves looking for flaws like heterogeneity among included trials and limited adherence to masking as reasons to distrust these newest results. However, we might be falling victim to confirmation bias, which is the tendency to better trust results that confirm our beliefs over results that don't fit with the existing paradigm. We want to believe that wearing masks helps. This is where EBM comes in and exactly why we need systematic reviews of high-quality randomized trials evaluating interventions that we think should work: to show us what does work when tested. We also have to affirm the statistical phenomenon wherein the magnitude of effect is diminished as you \"move up\" the evidence pyramid, reducing systematic bias and better approximating the truth. In this case, the Cochrane review analyzed higher quality evidence than did the previous systematic review of observational studies, and in the absence of any methodological concerns about the Cochrane review, the Cochrane is inherently higher quality evidence with outcomes that are objectively more trustworthy and closer to the truth. But let's also make room for nuance here. In many ways, the study of masks really comes down to mask efficacy on an individual level vs mask effectiveness on a population level. And while the painful truth seems to be that wearing surgical masks in the community may be about as effective as wearing water cooler bottles or plastic bags over our heads, we can interpret the Cochrane results in one of two ways: either 1) masks are not effective, or 2) masks can't be worn long enough or tight enough by enough people for them to work properly all the time and so they lack effectiveness. We want to believe the truth is #2, but is that just our confirmation bias at play? All in all, what we have is trustworthy evidence that real-world masking doesn't make a difference in the community spread of COVID, but no definitive evidence that perfect masking all the time in the community doesn't work because that hasn't been studied. But for what it's worth, my kid is wearing a mask in a high school musical and this EBM die-hard isn't stopping him.
