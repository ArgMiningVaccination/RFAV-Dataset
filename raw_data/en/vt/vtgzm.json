According to the CDC, [ COVID 19-vaccines are effective](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20are%20safe,vaccine%20as%20soon%20as%20possible). Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. By getting the vaccine, you're helping to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community. Vaccination is your best defense against serious illness from COVID-19. According to the CDC, How COVID-19 Vaccines Work Vaccines are designed to activate the human body's immune response to fight an infection. If you become infected with COVID-19 and you're fully vaccinated, your immune system will recognize the infection and work to fight it. At least a single mRNA bivalent vaccine is recommended for most people to stay up to date. [ Find out when to schedule updated vaccinations for different age groups.](/for-patients/health-alerts/covid-19-vaccine) You can also talk to your family doctor if you have questions. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html), the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA bivalent vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental. They went through all the required stages of clinical trials, including extensive testing and monitoring. The Novavax protein-based vaccine has also been determined to be similarly safe and effective to the mRNA-based vaccines. As of May 7, 2023, Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is [no longer recommended or available](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/index.html) in the U.S. Common Vaccine Myths - \"The vaccine will give you COVID-19.\" None of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus. This means that it's not possible to get COVID-19 from any of the vaccines. - \"The COVID-19 vaccine will alter my DNA.\" [COVID-19 vaccines don't change or interact with your DNA](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html)in any way. Both mRNA vaccines deliver instructions to our cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. All COVID-19 vaccines work with the body's natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease. - \"I don't need the vaccine after I get COVID-19. The antibodies will protect me!\" Even after infection, the CDC recommends getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19. After recovery, reinfection is still possible. - \"I just got the vaccine, so it's impossible for me to spread the virus.\" Getting the COVID-19 vaccines doesn't fully eliminate the risk of spreading the virus to others, especially with the spread of new variants and varying infection rates. COVID-19 vaccines are still your best option to help protect against serious illness, hospitalization, and even death. Allergies and the Vaccines If you had a severe allergic reaction after the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the [CDC recommends ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html)against a second dose. If you're considering a second dose, get evaluated by an allergist first. Please see the [Pfizer ](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines#additional)and [Moderna ](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/moderna-covid-19-vaccines#additional)fact sheets for ingredient lists and more information. Getting Vaccinated After COVID-19 Infection In most cases, you can receive the COVID-19 vaccine after you're out of isolation and your symptoms are getting better. In most cases, you can stop isolating when all of the following are met: - Five days have passed since the symptoms began. - You haven't had a fever for at least 24 hours without using Tylenol or other fever-reducing medications. - Other symptoms have improved. If you're immunocompromised or experienced moderate to severe illness requiring hospitalization, please check with your doctor about how long isolation should last and when it's safe for you to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Pregnancy and the COVID-19 Vaccine Based on CDPH and CDC guidelines, pregnancy is considered a high-risk condition with an increased chance of complications from COVID-19. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html), there's no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination causes any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. In addition, there's no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including the COVID-19 vaccines.
